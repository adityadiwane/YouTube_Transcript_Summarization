00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau, who said,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
"People protect what they love,"

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and that's the incredible number and variety

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
of animals in it that make light.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp;

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
that's not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Right after I completed my Ph.D.,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
that was using it for the first time

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
as a tool for ocean exploration.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and then my first open ocean dive

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
was in Santa Barbara Channel.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
It was an evening dive.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I went down to a depth of 880 feet

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and turned out the lights.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
this phenomenon of animals making light

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
called bioluminescence.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
But I was totally unprepared

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
for how much there was

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and how spectacular it was.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
that were longer than this room,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
pumping out so much light

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
that I could read the dials and gauges

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
inside the suit without a flashlight;

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and puffs and billows

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
of what looked like luminous blue smoke;

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and explosions of sparks

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
that would swirl up out of the thrusters --

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
but these were icy, blue embers.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
It was breathtaking.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Now, usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
it's these guys; it's fireflies.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light --

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
some insects, earthworms, fungi --

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
but in general, on land, it's really rare.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
In the ocean, it's the rule

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
rather than the exception.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
If I go out in the open ocean environment,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
virtually anywhere in the world,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
most of the animals --

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
of the animals that I bring up in that net --

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
make light.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Now I want to share with you a little video

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
that I shot from a submersible.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
I first developed this technique working from a little

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
single-person submersible called Deep Rover

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea-Link,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
which you see here.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
So, mounted in front of the observation sphere,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
there's a a three-foot diameter hoop

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
with a screen stretched across it.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
that's about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
albeit a little fuzzy.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
So you turn on the camera, turn out the lights.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
that's just electronic noise

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
on these super intensified cameras.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
You don't see luminescence until the submersible

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
begins to move forward through the water,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
but as it does, animals bumping into the screen

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
are stimulated to bioluminesce.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Now, when I was first doing this,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
I knew my forward speed, I knew the area,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
there were per cubic meter.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
by the type of flashes they produced.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And so, here, in the Gulf of Maine

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
at 740 feet,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Like those big explosions, sparks,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
are from a little comb jelly,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and jellyfish.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
There was another one of those comb jellies.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
to develop automatic recognition systems

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
that can identify these animals

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and do nearest neighbor distances.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
But you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
to see a light show like this.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
You can actually see it in surface waters.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
This is some shot, by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And this isn't someplace exotic

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And sometimes you can see it even closer than that,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
because the heads on ships --

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
that's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening --

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
are flushed with unfiltered seawater

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
that often has bioluminescent plankton in it.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
So, if you stagger into the head late at night

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
and you're so toilet-hugging sick

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
that you forget to turn on the light,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
you may think that you're having a religious experience. (Laughter)

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So, how does a living creature make light?

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Well, that was the question that 19th century

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
French physiologist Raphael Dubois,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
asked about this bioluminescent clam.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals;

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
one, the enzyme, he called luciferase;

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
the substrate, he called luciferin

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
after Lucifer the Lightbearer.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
That terminology has stuck, but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
In fact, most of the people

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
studying bioluminescence today

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
are focused on the chemistry, because these chemicals

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
have proved so incredibly valuable

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
for developing antibacterial agents,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
cancer fighting drugs,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
testing for the presence of life on Mars,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
detecting pollutants in our waters --

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
which is how we use it at ORCA.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
In 2008,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
was awarded for work done

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
on a molecule called green fluorescent protein

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
of a jellyfish,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
in terms of the impact that it has had

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
on cell biology and genetic engineering.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Another thing all these molecules are telling us

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
that, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
in evolutionary history,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
which is a clear indication

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
of how spectacularly important

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
this trait is for survival.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
So, what is it about bioluminescence

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
that's so important to so many animals?

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
by staying in the darkness,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
light can still be very useful

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive:

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
and that's find food,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
attract a mate and avoid being eaten.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
So, for example, this fish

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
has a built-in headlight behind its eye

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
that it can use for finding food

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
or attracting a mate.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
just like the headlights on your Lamborghini.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
This fish actually has high beams.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
And this fish, which is one of my favorites,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
has three headlights on each side of its head.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
Now, this one is blue,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
because evolution has selected

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
for the color that travels farthest through seawater

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
in order to optimize communication.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
So, most animals make blue light,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and most animals can only see blue light,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
but this fish is a really fascinating exception

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
because it has two red light organs.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
And I have no idea why there's two,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and that's something I want to solve some day --

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
but not only can it see blue light,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
but it can see red light.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
to be able to sneak up on animals

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
that are blind to red light

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
and be able to see them without being seen.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
It's also got a little chin barbel here

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
with a blue luminescent lure on it

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
that it can use to attract prey from a long way off.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
This is another one of my favorite fish.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
This is a viperfish, and it's got a lure

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
on the end of a long fishing rod

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
that it arches in front of the toothy jaw

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
that gives the viperfish its name.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
The teeth on this fish are so long

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
it would actually impale its own brain.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
So instead, it slides in grooves

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
on the outside of the head.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
This is a Christmas tree of a fish;

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
everything on this fish lights up,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
it's not just that lure.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
It's got a built-in flashlight.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
It's got these jewel-like light organs on its belly

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
that it uses for a type of camouflage

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
that obliterates its shadow,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
it makes itself disappear.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
It's got light organs in the mouth,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
it's got light organs in every single scale, in the fins,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
in a mucus layer on the back and the belly,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
all used for different things --

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
some of which we know about, some of which we don't.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
and I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
my favorite topic with so many people.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
I do wish, with their budget,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
to pay a consulting fee to some poor, starving graduate student,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
who could have told them that those are the eyes

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
of a fish that's been preserved in formalin.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
These are the eyes of a living anglerfish.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
So, she's got a lure that she sticks out

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
in front of this living mousetrap

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
of needle-sharp teeth

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And this one has a lure

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
was to attract different types of prey,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
but then stomach content analyses on these fish

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
done by scientists, or more likely their graduate students,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
have revealed that

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
they all eat pretty much the same thing.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
So, now we believe that the different shape of the lure

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
is how the male recognizes the female

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
in the anglerfish world,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
because many of these males

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
are what are known as dwarf males.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
This little guy

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
has no visible means of self-support.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
He has no lure for attracting food

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
and no teeth for eating it when it gets there.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
His only hope for existence on this planet

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
is as a gigolo. (Laughter)

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
He's got to find himself a babe

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
and then he's got to latch on for life.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
So this little guy

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
has found himself this babe,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
and you will note that he's had the good sense

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
(Laughter)

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
But he still knows a good thing when he sees it,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
His flesh fuses with her flesh,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
her bloodstream grows into his body,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
(Laughter)

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Well, this is a deep-sea version of Women's Lib.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
She always knows where he is,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
and she doesn't have to be monogamous,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
because some of these females

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
come up with multiple males attached.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
So they can use it for finding food, for attracting mates.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
They use it a lot for defense, many different ways.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
This shrimp is actually

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
spewing light out of its mouth

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
like a fire breathing dragon

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
in order to blind or distract this viperfish

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
And there are a lot of different animals that can do this:

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
There's jellyfish, there's squid,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
there's a whole lot of different crustaceans,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
there's even fish that can do this.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
because it actually has a tube on its shoulder

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
that can squirt out light.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
And I was luck enough to capture one of these

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
when we were on a trawling expedition

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
off the northwest coast of Africa for "Blue Planet,"

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
for the deep portion of "Blue Planet."

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
And we were using a special trawling net

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
that we were able to bring these animals up alive.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
So we captured one of these, and I brought it into the lab.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
So I'm holding it,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
and I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
and when I do, you'll see bioluminescence coming out.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
But to me, what's shocking

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
is not just the amount of light,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
For this fish, it's actually whole cells

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
with nuclei and membranes.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
and we have no idea why it does it --

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Now, another form of defense

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
is something called a burglar alarm --

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car;

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
the honking horn and flashing lights

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
are meant to attract the attention of, hopefully,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
the police that will come and take the burglar away --

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
its only hope for escape may be

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
that will attack their attacker,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
thereby affording them a chance for escape.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
This jellyfish, for example, has

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
a spectacular bioluminescent display.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
This is us chasing it in the submersible.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
That's not luminescence, that's reflected light from the gonads.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
bring it into the lab on the ship.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
And then to generate the display you're about to see,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
all I did was touch it once per second

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
on its nerve ring with a sharp pick

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
that's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
And once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
This is an unbelievable light show.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
It's this pinwheel of light,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
and I've done calculations that show that this could be seen

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
from as much as 300 feet away by a predator.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
And I thought, "You know,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
that might actually make a pretty good lure."

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Because one of the things that's frustrated me

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
as a deep-sea explorer

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
because of the way we explore the ocean.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
is we go out and drag nets behind ships.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
And I defy you to name any other branch of science

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
The other primary way is we go down

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
When I'm sitting in a submersible though,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all --

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters --

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
any animal with any sense is going to be long gone.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
So, I've wanted for a long time

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
to figure out a different way to explore.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
And so, sometime ago, I got this idea for a camera system.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
It's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye-in-the-Sea.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
And scientists have done this on land for years;

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
we just use a color that the animals can't see

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
and then a camera that can see that color.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
You can't use infrared in the sea.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
We use far-red light, but even that's a problem

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
because it gets absorbed so quickly.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
Made an intensified camera,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
wanted to make this electronic jellyfish.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
Thing is, in science,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
before they'll give you the money.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
And I didn't know what I was going to discover,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
so I couldn't get the funding for this.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
So I kluged this together, I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
and then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
gave me time with their ROV

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
so that I could test it and we could figure out,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
you know, for example, which colors of red light we had to use

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
so that we could see the animals, but they couldn't see us --

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
get the electronic jellyfish working.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
because we cast these 16 blue LEDs in epoxy

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
the word Ziploc is still visible.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
Needless to say, when it's kluged together like this,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
But there came a moment when it all came together,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
and everything worked.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
And, remarkably, that moment got caught on film

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
by photographer Mark Richards,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
who happened to be there at the precise moment

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
that we discovered that it all came together.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
That's me on the left,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
my graduate student at the time, Erika Raymond,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
and Lee Fry, who was the engineer on the project.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
with the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once." (Laughter)

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
And we were very, very happy.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
So now we had a system

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
that we could actually take to some place

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
that might be patrolled by large predators.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
And so, the place that we took it to

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
was this place called a Brine Pool,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
It's a magical place.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
And I know this footage isn't going to look like anything to you --

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
we had a crummy camera at the time --

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
but I was ecstatic.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
We're at the edge of the Brine Pool,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
It's clearly undisturbed by us.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
And I had my window into the deep sea.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
I, for the first time, could see what animals were doing down there

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
when we weren't down there disturbing them in some way.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Four hours into the deployment,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
we had programmed the electronic jellyfish

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
to come on for the first time.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
Eighty-six seconds after

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
it went into its pinwheel display,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
we recorded this:

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
This is a squid, over six feet long,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
that is so new to science,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
it cannot be placed in any known scientific family.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
I could not have asked for a better proof of concept.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
And based on this, I went back to the National Science Foundation

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
and said, "This is what we will discover."

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
And they gave me enough money to do it right,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
which has involved developing the world's first deep-sea webcam --

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
which has been installed in

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
the Monterey Canyon for the past year --

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
and now, more recently,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
a modular form of this system,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
a much more mobile form

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
that's a lot easier to launch and recover,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
that I hope can be used on Sylvia's "hope spots"

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
to help explore

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
and protect these areas,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
and, for me, learn more about

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
the bioluminescence in these "hope spots."

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
So one of these take-home messages here

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
is, there is still a lot to explore in the oceans.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
And Sylvia has said

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
and she's right.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
So if you ever, ever get an opportunity

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
to take a dive in a submersible,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
say yes -- a thousand times, yes --

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
and please turn out the lights.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
I promise, you'll love it.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
Thank you.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
(Applause)
