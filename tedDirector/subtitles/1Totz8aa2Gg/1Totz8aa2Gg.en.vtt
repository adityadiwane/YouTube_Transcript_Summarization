00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
If you go on the TED website,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
you can currently find there

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
over a full week of TEDTalk videos,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
over 1.3 million

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
words of transcripts

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
and millions of user ratings.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And that's a huge amount of data.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And it got me wondering:

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
If you took all this data

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
and put it through statistical analysis,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk?

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Could you create

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
the ultimate TEDTalk?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And also, could you create

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
the worst possible TEDTalk

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
that they would still let you get away with?

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
To find this out, I looked at three things:

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
I looked at the topic that you should choose,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
I looked at how you should deliver it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and the visuals onstage.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Now, with the topic: There's a whole range of topics you can choose,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
but you should choose wisely,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
because your topic strongly correlates

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
with how users will react to your talk.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Now, to make this more concrete,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
let's look at the list of top 10 words

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
that statistically stick out

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
in the most favorite TEDTalks

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
and in the least favorite TEDTalks.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
So if you came here

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
to talk about how French coffee

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
will spread happiness in our brains,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
that's a go.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Whereas, if you wanted to talk about

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
your project involving

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
oxygen, girls, aircraft --

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
actually, I would like to hear that talk, (Laughter)

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
but statistics say it's not so good.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Oh, well.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
If you generalize this,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
the most favorite TEDTalks are those

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
that feature topics we can connect with,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
both easily and deeply,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
such as happiness, our own body,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
food, emotions.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And the more technical topics,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
such as architecture, materials and, strangely enough, men,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
those are not good topics to talk about.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
How should you deliver your talk?

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
TED is famous for keeping

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
a very sharp eye on the clock,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
so they're going to hate me

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
for revealing this, because, actually,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
you should talk as long as they will let you. (Laughter)

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Because the most favorite TEDTalks

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
are, on average, over 50 percent longer

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
than the least favorite ones.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
except if you want to have a talk

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
that's beautiful, inspiring or funny.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Then, you should be brief. (Laughter) But other than that,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
talk until they drag you off the stage.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
(Laughter)

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
Now, while ...

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.260
(Applause)

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
While you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I found these rules out by comparing the statistics

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
of four-word phrases

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
I'll give you three examples.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
First of all, I must, as a speaker,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
instead of saying what I can't have.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Secondly, it's imperative

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
that you do not cite The New York Times.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
(Laughter)

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And finally, it's okay for the speaker -- that's the good news --

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
to fake intellectual capacity.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
If I don't understand something, I can just say, "etc., etc."

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
You'll all stay with me.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
It's perfectly fine.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.260
(Applause)

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Now, let's go to the visuals.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And analysis shows if you want to be

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
among the most favorite TED speakers,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
than the average TED speaker.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Slides are okay, though you might consider going for props.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And now the most important thing,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
that is the mood onstage.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Color plays a very important role.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Color closely correlates

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
with the ratings that talks get on the website.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
(Applause)

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
For example, fascinating talks

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
contain a statistically high amount

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
of exactly this blue color, (Laughter)

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
much more than the average TEDTalk.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Ingenious TEDTalks, much more this green color,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
etc., et.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:24.260
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Now, personally, I think

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
I'm not the first one who has done this analysis,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
but I'll leave this

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
to your good judgment.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
So, now it's time to put it all together

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and design the ultimate TEDTalk.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Now, since this is TEDActive,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and I learned from my analysis

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
that I should actually give you something,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
I will not impose the ultimate

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
or worst TEDTalk on you,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
but rather give you a tool to create your own.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And I call this tool the TEDPad.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
(Laughter)

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And the TEDPad is a matrix

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
of 100 specifically selected,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
highly curated sentences

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
You only have to make one decision,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
and that is: Are you going to use the white version

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
for very good TEDTalks,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
about creativity, human genius?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Or are you going to go with a black version,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
mostly about blogs,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
politics and stuff?

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
So, download it and have fun with it.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Now I hope you enjoy the session.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
I hope you enjoy designing your own

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
to create this, which I really want to see.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Thank you very much.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:50.260
(Applause) Thanks.
