00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.089
Five years ago, I was on a sabbatical,

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.481
and I returned to the medical university

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:19.343
where I studied.

00:00:19.343 --> 00:00:24.098
I saw real patients and I wore the white coat

00:00:24.098 --> 00:00:26.907
for the first time in 17 years,

00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:30.384
in fact since I became a management consultant.

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:32.308
There were two things that surprised me

00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:34.425
during the month I spent.

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:36.315
The first one was that the common theme

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:39.823
of the discussions we had were hospital budgets

00:00:39.823 --> 00:00:41.746
and cost-cutting,

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:43.570
and the second thing, which really bothered me,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.439
actually, was that several of the colleagues I met,

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:48.500
former friends from medical school,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.637
who I knew to be some of the smartest,

00:00:50.637 --> 00:00:53.606
most motivated, engaged and passionate people

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:55.160
I'd ever met,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.091
many of them had turned cynical, disengaged,

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:02.598
or had distanced themselves
from hospital management.

00:01:02.598 --> 00:01:05.372
So with this focus on cost-cutting,

00:01:05.372 --> 00:01:09.668
I asked myself, are we forgetting the patient?

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.672
Many countries that you represent

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:13.269
and where I come from

00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:16.175
struggle with the cost of healthcare.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:19.143
It's a big part of the national budgets.

00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:22.928
And many different reforms aim
at holding back this growth.

00:01:22.928 --> 00:01:24.945
In some countries, we have long waiting times

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:27.152
for patients for surgery.

00:01:27.152 --> 00:01:29.670
In other countries, new drugs
are not being reimbursed,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.642
and therefore don't reach patients.

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:34.899
In several countries, doctors and nurses

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.956
are the targets, to some extent, for the governments.

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:42.523
After all, the costly decisions in health care

00:01:42.523 --> 00:01:44.991
are taken by doctors and nurses.

00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:47.531
You choose an expensive lab test,

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:51.158
you choose to operate on an old and frail patient.

00:01:51.158 --> 00:01:55.632
So, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians,

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:58.863
this is a way to hold costs down.

00:01:58.863 --> 00:02:01.135
And ultimately, some physicians will say today

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:03.802
that they don't have the full liberty

00:02:03.802 --> 00:02:07.322
to make the choices they think
are right for their patients.

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:09.692
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:12.058
are frustrated.

00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:14.509
At BCG, we looked at this,

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.340
and we asked ourselves,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.852
this can't be the right way of managing healthcare.

00:02:19.852 --> 00:02:23.072
And so we took a step back and we said,

00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:25.744
"What is it that we are trying to achieve?"

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:27.975
Ultimately, in the healthcare system,

00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:31.936
we're aiming at improving health for the patients,

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:34.213
and we need to do so at a limited,

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:36.070
or affordable, cost.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.793
We call this value-based healthcare.

00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:40.477
On the screen behind me, you see what we mean

00:02:40.477 --> 00:02:42.286
by value:

00:02:42.286 --> 00:02:44.772
outcomes that matter to patients

00:02:44.772 --> 00:02:47.781
relative to the money we spend.

00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:50.526
This was described beautifully in a book in 2006

00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:54.531
by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg.

00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:57.674
On this picture, you have my father-in-law

00:02:57.674 --> 00:03:01.060
surrounded by his three beautiful daughters.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.096
When we started doing our research at BCG,

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:06.756
we decided not to look so much at the costs,

00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:09.296
but to look at the quality instead,

00:03:09.296 --> 00:03:11.877
and in the research, one of the things

00:03:11.877 --> 00:03:14.919
that fascinated us was the variation we saw.

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.292
You compare hospitals in a country,

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:19.508
you'll find some that are extremely good,

00:03:19.508 --> 00:03:22.953
but you'll find a large number
that are vastly much worse.

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:25.115
The differences were dramatic.

00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:27.177
Erik, my father-in-law,

00:03:27.177 --> 00:03:29.708
he suffers from prostate cancer,

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:32.018
and he probably needs surgery.

00:03:32.018 --> 00:03:34.725
Now living in Europe, he can
choose to go to Germany

00:03:34.725 --> 00:03:38.437
that has a well-reputed healthcare system.

00:03:38.437 --> 00:03:42.137
If he goes there and goes to the average hospital,

00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:46.211
he will have the risk of becoming incontinent

00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:48.185
by about 50 percent,

00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:51.158
so he would have to start wearing diapers again.

00:03:51.158 --> 00:03:55.095
You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot.

00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:57.997
If he instead would go to Hamburg,

00:03:57.997 --> 00:04:00.508
and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik,

00:04:00.508 --> 00:04:03.191
the risk would be only one in 20.

00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:04.776
Either you a flip a coin,

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:06.809
or you have a one in 20 risk.

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:10.314
That's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference.

00:04:10.314 --> 00:04:12.299
When we look at many hospitals

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.973
for many different diseases,

00:04:13.973 --> 00:04:16.990
we see these huge differences.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.884
But you and I don't know. We don't have the data.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.731
And often, the data actually doesn't exist.

00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:23.450
Nobody knows.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.803
So going the hospital is a lottery.

00:04:27.803 --> 00:04:32.083
Now, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope.

00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:34.575
In the late '70s, there were a group

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:37.007
of Swedish orthopedic surgeons

00:04:37.007 --> 00:04:38.866
who met at their annual meeting,

00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:40.827
and they were discussing the different procedures

00:04:40.827 --> 00:04:44.131
they used to operate hip surgery.

00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:45.859
To the left of this slide, you see a variety

00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:48.896
of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use

00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:51.755
for somebody who needs a new hip.

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:55.004
They all realized they had
their individual way of operating.

00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:57.401
They all argued that, "My technique is the best,"

00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:00.274
but none of them actually knew,
and they admitted that.

00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:04.223
So they said, "We probably need to measure quality

00:05:04.223 --> 00:05:08.392
so we know and can learn from what's best."

00:05:08.392 --> 00:05:11.591
So they in fact spent two years debating,

00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:13.886
"So what is quality in hip surgery?"

00:05:13.886 --> 00:05:16.260
"Oh, we should measure this."
"No, we should measure that."

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.311
And they finally agreed.

00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:20.962
And once they had agreed, they started measuring,

00:05:20.962 --> 00:05:23.365
and started sharing the data.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.964
Very quickly, they found that if you put cement

00:05:25.964 --> 00:05:27.470
in the bone of the patient

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.648
before you put the metal shaft in,

00:05:29.648 --> 00:05:31.784
it actually lasted a lot longer,

00:05:31.784 --> 00:05:33.542
and most patients would never have to be

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.903
re-operated on in their lifetime.

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:37.571
They published the data,

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.694
and it actually transformed
clinical practice in the country.

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:43.985
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense.

00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:46.022
Since then, they publish every year.

00:05:46.022 --> 00:05:47.970
Once a year, they publish the league table:

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.457
who's best, who's at the bottom?

00:05:50.457 --> 00:05:53.137
And they visit each other to try to learn,

00:05:53.137 --> 00:05:56.927
so a continuous cycle of improvement.

00:05:56.927 --> 00:05:59.734
For many years, Swedish hip surgeons

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.121
had the best results in the world,

00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:04.599
at least for those who actually were measuring,

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:07.035
and many were not.

00:06:07.035 --> 00:06:09.917
Now I found this principle really exciting.

00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:11.720
So the physicians get together,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.845
they agree on what quality is,

00:06:13.845 --> 00:06:17.559
they start measuring, they share the data,

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:21.075
they find who's best, and they learn from it.

00:06:21.075 --> 00:06:23.667
Continuous improvement.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:26.215
Now, that's not the only exciting part.

00:06:26.215 --> 00:06:28.466
That's exciting in itself.

00:06:28.466 --> 00:06:31.417
But if you bring back the cost side of the equation,

00:06:31.417 --> 00:06:32.877
and look at that,

00:06:32.877 --> 00:06:35.882
it turns out, those who have focused on quality,

00:06:35.882 --> 00:06:37.915
they actually also have the lowest costs,

00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:40.584
although that's not been the purpose
in the first place.

00:06:40.584 --> 00:06:43.614
So if you look at the hip surgery story again,

00:06:43.614 --> 00:06:45.985
there was a study done a couple years ago

00:06:45.985 --> 00:06:49.983
where they compared the U.S. and Sweden.

00:06:49.983 --> 00:06:51.908
They looked at how many patients have needed

00:06:51.908 --> 00:06:55.989
to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery.

00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:58.876
In the United States, the number was three times

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:01.064
higher than in Sweden.

00:07:01.064 --> 00:07:04.504
So many unnecessary surgeries,

00:07:04.504 --> 00:07:07.244
and so much unnecessary suffering

00:07:07.244 --> 00:07:08.936
for all the patients who were operated on

00:07:08.936 --> 00:07:11.403
in that seven year period.

00:07:11.403 --> 00:07:12.982
Now, you can imagine how much savings

00:07:12.982 --> 00:07:15.482
there would be for society.

00:07:15.482 --> 00:07:18.653
We did a study where we looked at OECD data.

00:07:18.653 --> 00:07:21.503
OECD does, every so often,

00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:23.659
look at quality of care

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:28.184
where they can find the data
across the member countries.

00:07:28.184 --> 00:07:30.786
The United States has, for many diseases,

00:07:30.786 --> 00:07:32.990
actually a quality which is below the average

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.408
in OECD.

00:07:34.408 --> 00:07:36.562
Now, if the American healthcare system

00:07:36.562 --> 00:07:38.998
would focus a lot more on measuring quality,

00:07:38.998 --> 00:07:43.047
and raise quality just to the level of average OECD,

00:07:43.047 --> 00:07:45.385
it would save the American people

00:07:45.385 --> 00:07:49.511
500 billion U.S. dollars a year.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.738
That's 20 percent of the budget,

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:55.451
of the healthcare budget of the country.

00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:57.558
Now you may say that these numbers

00:07:57.558 --> 00:08:00.449
are fantastic, and it's all logical,

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:02.459
but is it possible?

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:05.098
This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare,

00:08:05.098 --> 00:08:08.678
and I would argue that not only can it be done,

00:08:08.678 --> 00:08:10.912
but it has to be done.

00:08:10.912 --> 00:08:14.303
The agents of change are the doctors and nurses

00:08:14.303 --> 00:08:16.995
in the healthcare system.

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:19.109
In my practice as a consultant,

00:08:19.109 --> 00:08:21.376
I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:24.253
doctors and nurses and other hospital

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:27.210
or healthcare staff every year.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.396
The one thing they have in common is

00:08:29.396 --> 00:08:31.674
they really care about what they achieve

00:08:31.674 --> 00:08:34.908
in terms of quality for their patients.

00:08:34.908 --> 00:08:36.991
Physicians are, like most of you in the audience,

00:08:36.991 --> 00:08:39.527
very competitive.

00:08:39.527 --> 00:08:41.277
They were always best in class.

00:08:41.277 --> 00:08:44.775
We were always best in class.

00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:47.389
And if somebody can show them that the result

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:48.976
they perform for their patients

00:08:48.976 --> 00:08:51.830
is no better than what others do,

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.537
they will do whatever it takes to improve.

00:08:54.537 --> 00:08:56.870
But most of them don't know.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.285
But physicians have another characteristic.

00:08:59.285 --> 00:09:03.127
They actually thrive from peer recognition.

00:09:03.127 --> 00:09:05.361
If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist

00:09:05.361 --> 00:09:07.209
in a competing hospital

00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:09.238
and discusses why that other hospital

00:09:09.238 --> 00:09:12.033
has so much better results, they will share.

00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:15.750
They will share the information on how to improve.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.870
So it is, by measuring and creating transparency,

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.780
you get a cycle of continuous improvement,

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.654
which is what this slide shows.

00:09:25.654 --> 00:09:28.595
Now, you may say this is a nice idea,

00:09:28.595 --> 00:09:30.499
but this isn't only an idea.

00:09:30.499 --> 00:09:32.527
This is happening in reality.

00:09:32.527 --> 00:09:35.681
We're creating a global community,

00:09:35.681 --> 00:09:37.544
and a large global community,

00:09:37.544 --> 00:09:40.091
where we'll be able to measure and compare

00:09:40.091 --> 00:09:41.805
what we achieve.

00:09:41.805 --> 00:09:44.432
Together with two academic institutions,

00:09:44.432 --> 00:09:46.426
Michael Porter at Harvard Business School,

00:09:46.426 --> 00:09:48.310
and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden,

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.275
BCG has formed something we call ICHOM.

00:09:52.275 --> 00:09:54.480
You may think that's a sneeze,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.607
but it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym.

00:09:57.607 --> 00:10:00.183
It stands for the International Consortium

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:03.143
for Health Outcome Measurement.

00:10:03.143 --> 00:10:05.892
We're bringing together leading physicians

00:10:05.892 --> 00:10:09.483
and patients to discuss, disease by disease,

00:10:09.483 --> 00:10:11.585
what is really quality,

00:10:11.585 --> 00:10:13.572
what should we measure,

00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:16.060
and to make those standards global.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.415
They've worked -- four working groups have worked

00:10:18.415 --> 00:10:20.383
during the past year:

00:10:20.383 --> 00:10:23.227
cataracts, back pain,

00:10:23.227 --> 00:10:27.453
coronary artery disease, which is,
for instance, heart attack,

00:10:27.453 --> 00:10:29.634
and prostate cancer.

00:10:29.634 --> 00:10:32.038
The four groups will publish their data

00:10:32.038 --> 00:10:33.880
in November of this year.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.338
That's the first time we'll be comparing

00:10:36.338 --> 00:10:39.284
apples to apples, not only within a country,

00:10:39.284 --> 00:10:42.465
but between countries.

00:10:42.465 --> 00:10:46.443
Next year, we're planning to do eight diseases,

00:10:46.443 --> 00:10:48.997
the year after, 16.

00:10:48.997 --> 00:10:51.453
In three years' time, we plan to have covered

00:10:51.453 --> 00:10:54.566
40 percent of the disease burden.

00:10:54.566 --> 00:10:57.216
Compare apples to apples. Who's better?

00:10:57.216 --> 00:11:00.267
Why is that?

00:11:00.267 --> 00:11:03.132
Five months ago,

00:11:03.132 --> 00:11:06.166
I led a workshop at the largest university hospital

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.876
in Northern Europe.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:11.363
They have a new CEO, and she has a vision:

00:11:11.363 --> 00:11:14.969
I want to manage my big institution much more

00:11:14.969 --> 00:11:19.074
on quality, outcomes that matter to patients.

00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:22.572
This particular day, we sat in a workshop

00:11:22.572 --> 00:11:25.382
together with physicians, nurses and other staff,

00:11:25.382 --> 00:11:29.880
discussing leukemia in children.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.657
The group discussed,

00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:33.697
how do we measure quality today?

00:11:33.697 --> 00:11:36.262
Can we measure it better than we do?

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:38.484
We discussed, how do we treat these kids,

00:11:38.484 --> 00:11:40.535
what are important improvements?

00:11:40.535 --> 00:11:43.316
And we discussed what are
the costs for these patients,

00:11:43.316 --> 00:11:45.664
can we do treatment more efficiently?

00:11:45.664 --> 00:11:47.608
There was an enormous energy in the room.

00:11:47.608 --> 00:11:51.097
There were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm.

00:11:51.097 --> 00:11:53.391
At the end of the meeting,

00:11:53.391 --> 00:11:56.700
the chairman of the department, he stood up.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.277
He looked over the group and he said --

00:12:01.277 --> 00:12:03.062
first he raised his hand, I forgot that --

00:12:03.062 --> 00:12:05.531
he raised his hand, clenched his fist,

00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:08.428
and then he said to the group, "Thank you.

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:11.351
Thank you. Today, we're finally discussing

00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:14.925
what this hospital does the right way."

00:12:14.925 --> 00:12:17.012
By measuring value in healthcare,

00:12:17.012 --> 00:12:19.037
that is not only costs

00:12:19.037 --> 00:12:21.510
but outcomes that matter to patients,

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.308
we will make staff in hospitals

00:12:23.308 --> 00:12:25.167
and elsewhere in the healthcare system

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:29.261
not a problem but an important part of the solution.

00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:31.197
I believe measuring value in healthcare

00:12:31.197 --> 00:12:33.968
will bring about a revolution,

00:12:33.968 --> 00:12:36.077
and I'm convinced that the founder

00:12:36.077 --> 00:12:39.540
of modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates,

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.490
who always put the patient at the center,

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.652
he would smile in his grave.

00:12:44.652 --> 00:12:47.453
Thank you.

00:12:47.453 --> 00:12:51.362
(Applause)
