00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:16.582
It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:20.924
I was working at the ACLU
as the organization's science advisor.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.995
I really, really loved my job,

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.655
but I was having one of those days

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.248
where I was feeling
just a little bit discouraged.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:33.369
So I wandered down the hallway
to my colleague Chris Hansen's office.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:38.021
Chris had been at the ACLU
for more than 30 years,

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:41.120
so he had deep institutional
knowledge and insights.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.613
I explained to Chris
that I was feeling a little bit stuck.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.694
I had been investigating
a number of issues

00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:53.019
at the intersection of science
and civil liberties -- super interesting.

00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:56.953
But I wanted the ACLU to engage
these issues in a much bigger way,

00:00:56.977 --> 00:00:59.222
in a way that could really
make a difference.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.703
So Chris cut right
to the chase, and he says,

00:01:03.727 --> 00:01:07.187
"Well, of all the issues you've been
looking at, what are the top five?"

00:01:07.524 --> 00:01:10.180
"Well, there's genetic discrimination,

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:12.629
and reproductive technologies,

00:01:12.653 --> 00:01:14.794
and biobanking, and ...

00:01:14.818 --> 00:01:16.660
oh, there's this really cool issue,

00:01:16.684 --> 00:01:19.333
functional MRI and using it
for lie detection, and ...

00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:21.478
oh, and of course, there's gene patents."

00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:23.131
"Gene patents?"

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:26.049
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."

00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:27.579
"No!

00:01:27.603 --> 00:01:30.064
You're telling me that the US government

00:01:30.088 --> 00:01:33.012
has been issuing patents
on part of the human body?

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:35.226
That can't be right."

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:39.320
I went back to my office
and sent Chris three articles.

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:43.281
And 20 minutes later,
he came bursting in my office.

00:01:43.305 --> 00:01:46.921
"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?"

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.839
(Laughter)

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:52.087
Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer,

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.020
but he knew almost nothing
about patent law

00:01:55.044 --> 00:01:57.480
and certainly nothing about genetics.

00:01:57.504 --> 00:02:00.382
I knew something about genetics,
but I wasn't even a lawyer,

00:02:00.406 --> 00:02:02.067
let alone a patent lawyer.

00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:05.557
So clearly we had a lot to learn
before we could file a lawsuit.

00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:08.894
First, we needed to understand
exactly what was patented

00:02:08.918 --> 00:02:10.599
when someone patented a gene.

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:15.501
Gene patents typically contain
dozens of claims,

00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:20.302
but the most controversial of these
are to so-called "isolated DNA" --

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:25.140
namely, a piece of DNA
that has been removed from a cell.

00:02:26.073 --> 00:02:27.372
Gene patent proponents say,

00:02:27.396 --> 00:02:30.570
"See? We didn't patent
the gene in your body,

00:02:30.594 --> 00:02:32.529
we patented an isolated gene."

00:02:33.148 --> 00:02:34.349
And that's true,

00:02:34.373 --> 00:02:41.106
but the problem is that any use
of the gene requires that it be isolated.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.915
And the patents weren't just
to a particular gene that they isolated,

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.826
but on every possible
version of that gene.

00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:51.520
So what does that mean?

00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:55.043
That means that you can't give
your gene to your doctor

00:02:55.067 --> 00:02:57.363
and ask him or her to look at it,

00:02:57.387 --> 00:02:59.487
say, to see if it has any mutations,

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:01.587
without permission of the patent holder.

00:03:02.363 --> 00:03:06.556
It also means that the patent holder
has the right to stop anyone

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.062
from using that gene
in research or clinical testing.

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.569
Allowing patent holders,

00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:13.877
often private companies,

00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:18.387
to lock up stretches of the human genome
was harming patients.

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.110
Consider Abigail,

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:22.527
a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome,

00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:25.975
a serious heart condition that,
if left untreated,

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:27.777
can result in sudden death.

00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:32.833
The company that obtained a patent on two
genes associated with this condition

00:03:32.857 --> 00:03:35.339
developed a test to diagnose the syndrome.

00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:38.187
But then they went bankrupt
and they never offered it.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.988
So another lab tried to offer the test,

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:44.000
but the company that held the patents
threatened to sue the lab

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:45.206
for patent infringement.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.389
So as a result,

00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:49.275
for 2 years, no test was available.

00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:51.441
During that time,

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:54.715
Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT.

00:03:55.776 --> 00:03:59.013
Gene patents clearly were a problem
and were harming patients.

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:01.873
But was there a way
we could challenge them?

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:03.998
Turns out that the Supreme Court

00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:07.136
has made clear
through a long line of cases,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.946
that certain things
are not patent eligible.

00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:13.299
You can't patent products of nature --

00:04:14.148 --> 00:04:18.357
the air, the water, minerals,
elements of the periodic table.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.282
And you can't patent laws of nature --

00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:24.472
the law of gravity, E = mc2.

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:29.715
These things are just too fundamental
and must remain free to all

00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:31.562
and reserved exclusively to none.

00:04:32.348 --> 00:04:34.495
It seemed to us that DNA,

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:37.035
the most fundamental structure of life,

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:39.715
that codes for the production
of all of our proteins,

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:42.965
is both a product of nature
and a law of nature,

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:45.691
regardless of whether it's in our bodies

00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:47.753
or sitting in the bottom of a test tube.

00:04:48.523 --> 00:04:49.978
As we delved into this issue,

00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:53.910
we traveled all over the country
to speak with many different experts --

00:04:54.588 --> 00:04:58.301
scientists, medical professionals,
lawyers, patent lawyers.

00:04:58.753 --> 00:05:02.663
Most of them agreed that we were right
as a matter of policy,

00:05:02.687 --> 00:05:05.472
and, at least in theory,
as a matter of law.

00:05:06.313 --> 00:05:07.468
All of them thought

00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:10.062
our chances of winning
a gene-patent challenge

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:11.953
were about zero.

00:05:13.628 --> 00:05:14.991
Why is that?

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:18.102
Well, the patent office
had been issuing these patents

00:05:18.126 --> 00:05:19.827
for more than 20 years.

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:23.566
There were literally thousands
of patents on human genes.

00:05:24.843 --> 00:05:27.784
The patent bar was deeply
entrenched in the status quo,

00:05:28.581 --> 00:05:32.204
the biotech industry had grown up
around this practice,

00:05:32.228 --> 00:05:35.347
and legislation to ban gene patents
had been introduced

00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:36.769
year after year in Congress,

00:05:36.793 --> 00:05:38.584
and had gone absolutely nowhere.

00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:40.615
So the bottom line:

00:05:41.027 --> 00:05:44.202
courts just weren't going to be willing
to overturn these patents.

00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:49.511
Now, neither Chris nor I were the type
to shy away from a challenge,

00:05:49.535 --> 00:05:52.679
and hearing, "Being right
just isn't enough,"

00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:55.233
seemed all the more reason
to take on this fight.

00:05:56.311 --> 00:05:58.246
So we set out to build our case.

00:05:59.494 --> 00:06:02.984
Now, patent cases tend to be:
Company A sues Company B

00:06:03.008 --> 00:06:06.191
over some really narrow,
obscure technical issue.

00:06:06.822 --> 00:06:09.187
We weren't really interested
in that kind of case,

00:06:09.211 --> 00:06:11.600
and we thought this case
was much bigger than that.

00:06:11.624 --> 00:06:14.112
This was about scientific freedom,
medical progress,

00:06:14.136 --> 00:06:15.595
the rights of patients.

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:18.722
So we decided we were going
to develop a case

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:21.264
that was not like
your typical patent case --

00:06:21.645 --> 00:06:23.527
more like a civil rights case.

00:06:24.756 --> 00:06:27.598
We set out to identify
a gene-patent holder

00:06:27.622 --> 00:06:30.407
that was vigorously enforcing its patents

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:33.725
and then to organize a broad coalition
of plaintiffs and experts

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:35.639
that could tell the court

00:06:35.663 --> 00:06:40.052
about all the ways that these patents
were harming patients and innovation.

00:06:41.404 --> 00:06:44.526
We found the prime candidate
to sue in Myriad Genetics,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.405
a company that's based
in Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:06:48.718 --> 00:06:50.968
Myriad held patents on two genes,

00:06:50.992 --> 00:06:54.313
the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.884
Women with certain mutations
along these genes

00:06:57.908 --> 00:07:00.534
are considered to be
at a significantly increased risk

00:07:00.558 --> 00:07:02.503
of developing breast and ovarian cancer.

00:07:03.834 --> 00:07:05.714
Myriad had used its patents to maintain

00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:09.947
a complete monopoly on BRCA testing
in the United States.

00:07:10.544 --> 00:07:14.732
It had forced multiple labs
that were offering BRCA testing to stop.

00:07:14.756 --> 00:07:16.915
It charged a lot of money for its test --

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:18.622
over 3,000 dollars.

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:21.424
It had stopped sharing its clinical data

00:07:21.448 --> 00:07:23.735
with the international
scientific community.

00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:26.425
And perhaps worst of all,

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:28.885
for a period of several years,

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.622
Myriad refused to update its test
to include additional mutations

00:07:32.646 --> 00:07:36.267
that had been identified
by a team of researchers in France.

00:07:36.974 --> 00:07:39.482
It has been estimated
that during that period,

00:07:39.506 --> 00:07:40.879
for several years,

00:07:40.903 --> 00:07:44.655
as many as 12 percent of women
undergoing testing

00:07:44.679 --> 00:07:47.081
received the wrong answer --

00:07:48.377 --> 00:07:52.146
a negative test result
that should have been positive.

00:07:53.485 --> 00:07:55.226
This is Kathleen Maxian.

00:07:56.172 --> 00:07:59.429
Kathleen's sister Eileen
developed breast cancer at age 40

00:07:59.453 --> 00:08:01.293
and she was tested by Myriad.

00:08:02.032 --> 00:08:03.758
The test was negative.

00:08:03.782 --> 00:08:05.308
The family was relieved.

00:08:05.332 --> 00:08:09.120
That meant that Eileen's cancer
most likely didn't run in the family,

00:08:09.144 --> 00:08:12.159
and that other members of her family
didn't need to be tested.

00:08:12.843 --> 00:08:14.073
But two years later,

00:08:14.097 --> 00:08:18.157
Kathleen was diagnosed
with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.

00:08:18.927 --> 00:08:22.799
It turned out that Kathleen's sister
was among the 12 percent

00:08:22.823 --> 00:08:25.692
who received a false-negative test result.

00:08:26.347 --> 00:08:29.436
Had Eileen received the proper result,

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.833
Kathleen would have then been tested,

00:08:31.857 --> 00:08:34.770
and her ovarian cancer
could have been prevented.

00:08:36.818 --> 00:08:38.082
Once we settled on Myriad,

00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:41.991
we then had to form a coalition
of plaintiffs and experts

00:08:42.015 --> 00:08:44.103
that could illuminate these problems.

00:08:44.127 --> 00:08:46.699
We ended up with 20
highly committed plaintiffs:

00:08:47.325 --> 00:08:48.863
genetic counselors,

00:08:48.887 --> 00:08:52.246
geneticists who had received
cease and desist letters,

00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:54.754
advocacy organizations,

00:08:55.532 --> 00:08:58.597
four major scientific organizations
that collectively represented

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:02.151
more than 150,000 scientists
and medical professionals,

00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:06.052
and individual women who either
couldn't afford Myriad's test,

00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:09.080
or who wanted to obtain
a second opinion but could not,

00:09:09.104 --> 00:09:10.848
as a result of the patents.

00:09:12.315 --> 00:09:15.755
One of the major challenges
we had in preparing the case

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:18.645
was figuring out how best
to communicate the science.

00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:22.910
So in order to argue that what Myriad did
was not an invention,

00:09:22.934 --> 00:09:26.211
and that isolated BRCA genes
were products of nature,

00:09:27.124 --> 00:09:29.837
we had to explain a couple
of basic concepts, like:

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:32.005
What's a gene? What's DNA?

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:35.745
How is DNA isolated,
and why isn't that an invention?

00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:41.030
We spent hours and hours
with our plaintiffs and experts,

00:09:41.054 --> 00:09:43.990
trying to come up with ways
of explaining these concepts

00:09:44.014 --> 00:09:45.557
simply yet accurately.

00:09:46.306 --> 00:09:49.638
And we ended up relying heavily
on the use of metaphors,

00:09:49.662 --> 00:09:50.818
like gold.

00:09:51.789 --> 00:09:54.073
So isolating DNA --

00:09:54.097 --> 00:09:56.597
it's like extracting gold from a mountain

00:09:57.105 --> 00:09:59.121
or taking it out of a stream bed.

00:09:59.145 --> 00:10:02.819
You might be able to patent
the process for mining the gold,

00:10:02.843 --> 00:10:04.924
but you can't patent the gold itself.

00:10:05.929 --> 00:10:08.672
It might've taken a lot
of hard work and effort

00:10:08.696 --> 00:10:10.556
to dig the gold out of the mountain;

00:10:11.127 --> 00:10:13.408
you still can't patent it,
it's still gold.

00:10:13.432 --> 00:10:15.188
And the gold, once it's extracted,

00:10:15.212 --> 00:10:17.300
can clearly be used
for all sorts of things

00:10:17.324 --> 00:10:20.060
that it couldn't be used
for when it was in the mountain;

00:10:20.084 --> 00:10:22.266
you can make jewelry
out of it for example --

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.455
still can't patent the gold,
it's still gold.

00:10:25.364 --> 00:10:29.218
So now it's 2009,
and we're ready to file our case.

00:10:30.286 --> 00:10:33.781
We filed in federal court
in the Southern District of New York,

00:10:34.355 --> 00:10:37.721
and the case was randomly assigned
to Judge Robert Sweet.

00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:41.799
In March 2010, Judge Sweet
issued his opinion --

00:10:42.569 --> 00:10:44.427
152 pages --

00:10:44.834 --> 00:10:47.086
and a complete victory for our side.

00:10:47.964 --> 00:10:49.395
In reading the opinion,

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:54.134
we could not get over how eloquently
he described the science in the case.

00:10:54.504 --> 00:10:57.275
I mean, our brief --
it was pretty good,

00:10:57.299 --> 00:10:58.866
but not this good.

00:10:59.778 --> 00:11:03.155
How did he develop such a deep
understanding of this issue

00:11:03.179 --> 00:11:04.339
in such a short time?

00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:07.971
We just could not comprehend
how this had happened.

00:11:07.995 --> 00:11:09.259
So it turned out,

00:11:09.283 --> 00:11:12.593
Judge Sweet's clerk
working for him at the time,

00:11:12.617 --> 00:11:14.097
was not just a lawyer --

00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:15.835
he was a scientist.

00:11:15.859 --> 00:11:17.457
He was not just a scientist --

00:11:17.481 --> 00:11:20.627
he had a PhD in molecular biology.

00:11:20.651 --> 00:11:22.402
(Laughter)

00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:25.001
What an incredible stroke of luck!

00:11:26.058 --> 00:11:27.358
Myriad then appealed

00:11:27.382 --> 00:11:29.877
to the US Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit.

00:11:30.496 --> 00:11:32.512
And here things got really interesting.

00:11:33.465 --> 00:11:36.525
First, in a pivotal moment of this case,

00:11:37.187 --> 00:11:39.818
the US government switched sides.

00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:44.488
So in the district court the government
submitted a brief on Myriad's side.

00:11:44.512 --> 00:11:49.640
But now in direct opposition
to its own patent office,

00:11:49.664 --> 00:11:52.372
the US government files a brief
that states that is has

00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:56.084
reconsidered this issue
in light of the district court's opinion,

00:11:56.108 --> 00:11:59.294
and has concluded that isolated DNA
is not patent eligible.

00:11:59.818 --> 00:12:01.629
This was a really big deal,

00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:03.215
totally unexpected.

00:12:04.773 --> 00:12:06.853
The Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit

00:12:06.877 --> 00:12:08.560
hears all patent cases,

00:12:08.584 --> 00:12:11.742
and it has a reputation for being
very, very pro-patent.

00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:14.731
So even with this remarkable development,

00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:16.434
we expected to lose.

00:12:16.458 --> 00:12:17.805
And we did.

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:19.541
Sort of.

00:12:20.357 --> 00:12:22.944
Ends up split decision, 2 to 1.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.239
But the two judges who ruled against us,

00:12:26.263 --> 00:12:28.504
did so for completely different reasons.

00:12:29.275 --> 00:12:31.101
The first one, Judge Lourie,

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:34.140
made up his own novel,
biological theory --

00:12:34.164 --> 00:12:35.332
totally wrong.

00:12:35.356 --> 00:12:36.367
(Laughter)

00:12:36.391 --> 00:12:38.609
He decided Myriad had created
a new chemical --

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:40.498
made absolutely no sense.

00:12:40.522 --> 00:12:43.308
Myriad didn't even argue this,
so it came out of the blue.

00:12:43.632 --> 00:12:45.609
The other, Judge Moore,

00:12:45.633 --> 00:12:49.511
said she basically agreed with us
that isolated DNA is a product of nature.

00:12:49.987 --> 00:12:53.320
But she's like, "I don't want
to shake up the biotech industry."

00:12:54.248 --> 00:12:56.820
The third, Judge Bryson,

00:12:57.233 --> 00:12:58.449
agreed with us.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.281
So now we sought review
by the Supreme Court.

00:13:02.305 --> 00:13:05.008
And when you petition the Supreme Court,

00:13:05.032 --> 00:13:08.154
you have to present a question
that you want the Court to answer.

00:13:08.534 --> 00:13:12.261
Usually these questions take the form
of a super-long paragraph,

00:13:12.285 --> 00:13:15.308
like a whole page long
with lots and lots of clauses,

00:13:15.332 --> 00:13:17.789
"wherein this" and "therefore that."

00:13:18.294 --> 00:13:22.201
We submitted perhaps
the shortest question presented ever.

00:13:23.312 --> 00:13:24.525
Four words:

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.271
Are human genes patentable?

00:13:28.922 --> 00:13:31.746
Now when Chris first asked me
what I thought of these words,

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.144
I said, "Well, I don't know.

00:13:33.168 --> 00:13:36.335
I think you have to say,
'Is isolated DNA patentable?'"

00:13:36.968 --> 00:13:38.137
"Nope.

00:13:38.487 --> 00:13:43.108
I want the justices to have
the very same reaction that I had

00:13:43.132 --> 00:13:46.219
when you brought this issue
to me seven years ago."

00:13:46.896 --> 00:13:49.053
Well, I certainly couldn't
argue with that.

00:13:49.981 --> 00:13:52.864
The Supreme Court only hears
about one percent

00:13:52.888 --> 00:13:54.554
of the cases that it receives,

00:13:54.578 --> 00:13:56.169
and it agreed to hear ours.

00:13:57.772 --> 00:14:01.899
The day of the oral argument arrives,
and it was really, really exciting --

00:14:01.923 --> 00:14:03.358
long line of people outside,

00:14:03.382 --> 00:14:06.146
people had been standing in line
since 2:30 in the morning

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.904
to try to get into the courthouse.

00:14:07.928 --> 00:14:09.899
Two breast cancer organizations,

00:14:09.923 --> 00:14:11.591
Breast Cancer Action and FORCE,

00:14:11.615 --> 00:14:14.316
had organized a demonstration
on the courthouse steps.

00:14:15.232 --> 00:14:18.102
Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway,

00:14:18.776 --> 00:14:21.790
moments before he was to walk in and argue

00:14:21.814 --> 00:14:24.130
the most important case of his career.

00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:27.144
I was clearly more nervous than he was.

00:14:28.096 --> 00:14:32.856
But any remaining panic subsided
as I walked into the courtroom

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.693
and looked around
at a sea of friendly faces:

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:37.824
our individual women clients

00:14:37.848 --> 00:14:40.289
who had shared their
deeply personal stories,

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.836
the geneticists who had taken huge chunks
of time out of their busy careers

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.685
to dedicate themselves to this fight

00:14:47.122 --> 00:14:49.701
and representatives from a diverse array

00:14:49.725 --> 00:14:51.612
of medical, patient advocacy,

00:14:51.636 --> 00:14:53.712
environmental and religious organizations,

00:14:53.736 --> 00:14:57.268
who had submitted friend of the court
briefs in the case.

00:14:58.609 --> 00:15:01.634
Also in the room were three leaders
of the Human Genome Project,

00:15:01.658 --> 00:15:04.330
including the co-discoverer
of DNA himself,

00:15:04.354 --> 00:15:05.644
James Watson,

00:15:05.668 --> 00:15:07.814
who had submitted a brief to the court,

00:15:07.838 --> 00:15:11.349
where he referred
to gene patenting as "lunacy."

00:15:11.373 --> 00:15:13.221
(Laughter)

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:16.882
The diversity of the communities
represented in this room

00:15:16.906 --> 00:15:20.347
and the contributions each had made
to make this day a reality

00:15:20.371 --> 00:15:22.668
spoke volumes to what was at stake.

00:15:23.386 --> 00:15:25.599
The argument itself was riveting.

00:15:26.205 --> 00:15:27.868
Chris argued brilliantly.

00:15:27.892 --> 00:15:29.137
But for me,

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:32.925
the most thrilling aspect was watching
the Supreme Court justices grapple

00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:34.518
with isolated DNA,

00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:37.768
through a series of colorful analogies
and feisty exchanges,

00:15:37.792 --> 00:15:41.132
very much the same way
as our legal team had done

00:15:41.156 --> 00:15:42.846
for the past seven years.

00:15:43.666 --> 00:15:46.322
Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:49.122
to extracting a medicinal plant
from the Amazon.

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:54.526
Justice Roberts distinguished it
from carving a baseball bat from a tree.

00:15:55.995 --> 00:15:58.477
And in one of my absolutely
favorite moments,

00:15:58.501 --> 00:16:03.770
Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA
to be "just nature sitting there."

00:16:03.794 --> 00:16:04.894
(Laughter)

00:16:05.318 --> 00:16:08.193
We felt pretty confident
leaving the courtroom that day,

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:11.223
but I could never have
anticipated the outcome:

00:16:12.574 --> 00:16:14.081
nine to zero.

00:16:15.025 --> 00:16:18.747
"A naturally occurring DNA segment
is a product of nature,

00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:21.818
and not patent-eligible merely because
it has been isolated.

00:16:22.394 --> 00:16:23.741
And furthermore,

00:16:23.765 --> 00:16:26.310
Myriad did not create anything."

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.156
Within 24 hours of the decision,

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.572
five labs had announced

00:16:31.596 --> 00:16:34.610
that they would begin to offer testing
for the BRCA genes.

00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:38.632
Some of them promised to offer the tests
at a lower price than Myriad's.

00:16:39.142 --> 00:16:42.062
Some promised to provide
a more comprehensive test

00:16:42.086 --> 00:16:43.769
than the one Myriad was offering.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.328
But of course the decision
goes far beyond Myriad.

00:16:47.352 --> 00:16:51.748
It ends a 25-year practice
of allowing patents on human genes

00:16:51.772 --> 00:16:52.979
in the United States.

00:16:53.383 --> 00:16:58.076
It clears a significant barrier
to biomedical discovery and innovation.

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:03.385
And it helps to ensure that patients
like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen

00:17:03.409 --> 00:17:05.565
have access to the tests that they need.

00:17:06.991 --> 00:17:10.206
A few weeks after the court
issued its decision,

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.490
I received a small package in the mail.

00:17:13.246 --> 00:17:14.853
It was from Bob Cook-Deegan,

00:17:14.877 --> 00:17:17.146
a professor at Duke University

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.394
and one the very first people
Chris and I went to visit

00:17:20.418 --> 00:17:23.117
when we started to consider
whether to bring this case.

00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:26.842
I opened it up to find
a small stuffed animal.

00:17:28.344 --> 00:17:31.303
(Laughter)

00:17:33.568 --> 00:17:35.896
We took a big risk in taking this case.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:39.232
Part of what gave us the courage
to take that risk

00:17:39.256 --> 00:17:41.694
was knowing that we were doing
the right thing.

00:17:42.079 --> 00:17:45.809
The process took nearly eight years
from the start to finish,

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:48.054
with many twists and turns along the way.

00:17:48.578 --> 00:17:50.269
A little luck certainly helped,

00:17:50.888 --> 00:17:53.700
but it was the communities
that we bridged,

00:17:53.724 --> 00:17:55.815
the alliances that we created,

00:17:55.839 --> 00:17:57.259
that made pigs fly.

00:17:57.802 --> 00:17:58.958
Thank you.

00:17:58.982 --> 00:18:04.496
(Applause)
