00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.198
What do augmented reality

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:16.604
and professional football

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:18.798
have to do with empathy?

00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:20.983
And what is the air speed velocity

00:00:20.983 --> 00:00:23.158
of an unladen swallow?

00:00:23.158 --> 00:00:25.778
Now unfortunately, I'm only going to answer

00:00:25.778 --> 00:00:26.895
one of those questions today,

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:29.186
so please, try and contain your disappointment.

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:31.658
When most people think about augmented reality,

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:34.063
they think about "Minority Report" and Tom Cruise

00:00:34.063 --> 00:00:35.973
waving his hands in the air,

00:00:35.973 --> 00:00:39.232
but augmented reality is not science fiction.

00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:41.507
Augmented reality is something that will happen

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:43.711
in our lifetime, and it will happen

00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:45.422
because we have the tools to make it happen,

00:00:45.422 --> 00:00:47.205
and people need to be aware of that,

00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:49.686
because augmented reality will change our lives

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:53.469
just as much as the Internet and the cell phone.

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.070
Now how do we get to augmented reality?

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.126
Step one is the step I'm wearing right now,

00:00:58.126 --> 00:00:59.530
Google Glass.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.150
I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.597
What you may not be familiar with

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:06.037
is that Google Glass is a device

00:01:06.037 --> 00:01:09.679
that will allow you to see what I see.

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:11.695
It will allow you to experience what it is like

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:13.991
to be a professional athlete on the field.

00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:17.512
Right now, the only way you can be on the field

00:01:17.512 --> 00:01:19.288
is for me to try and describe it to you.

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:20.799
I have to use words.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.147
I have to create a framework that you then fill in

00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:25.098
with your imagination.

00:01:25.098 --> 00:01:29.275
With Google Glass, we can put that

00:01:29.275 --> 00:01:30.885
underneath a helmet,

00:01:30.885 --> 00:01:33.031
and we can get a sense of what it's like

00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:36.130
to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.203
your blood pounding in your ears.

00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:40.110
You can get a sense of what it's like

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.997
to have a 250-pound man

00:01:42.997 --> 00:01:44.658
sprinting at you

00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:46.634
trying to decapitate you

00:01:46.634 --> 00:01:48.465
with every ounce of his being.

00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:49.851
And I've been on the receiving end of that,

00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:51.408
and it doesn't feel very good.

00:01:51.408 --> 00:01:53.987
Now, I have some footage to show you of what it's like

00:01:53.987 --> 00:01:55.914
to wear Google Glass underneath the helmet

00:01:55.914 --> 00:01:57.148
to give you a taste of that.

00:01:57.148 --> 00:02:00.059
Unfortunately, it's not NFL practice footage

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:02.474
because the NFL thinks emergent technology

00:02:02.474 --> 00:02:04.722
is what happens when a submarine surfaces,

00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:08.685
but — (Laughter) — we do what we can.

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:12.160
So let's pull up some video.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.560
(Video) Chris Kluwe: Go.

00:02:19.292 --> 00:02:21.429
Ugh, getting tackled sucks.

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:24.387
Hold on, let's get a little closer.

00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:25.765
All right, ready?

00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:28.814
Go!

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:31.459
Chris Kluwe: So as you can see,

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.726
small taste of what it's like to get tackled

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:34.848
on the football field

00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:36.727
from the perspective of the tacklee.

00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:37.980
Now, you may have noticed there are

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.075
some people missing there:

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:40.901
the rest of the team.

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:42.641
We have some video of that

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:44.145
courtesy of the University of Washington.

00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:48.501
(Video) Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54! Mice 54!

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.984
Blue 8! Blue 8! Go!

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:54.645
Oh!

00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:58.076
CK: So again, this takes you a little bit closer

00:02:58.076 --> 00:03:00.026
to what it's like to be on that field,

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:01.999
but this is nowhere what it's like

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.437
to be on the NFL.

00:03:04.437 --> 00:03:06.198
Fans want that experience.

00:03:06.198 --> 00:03:07.442
Fans want to be on that field.

00:03:07.442 --> 00:03:09.606
They want to be their favorite players,

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:12.338
and they've already talked to me on YouTube,

00:03:12.338 --> 00:03:13.414
they've talked to me on Twitter, saying,

00:03:13.414 --> 00:03:15.362
"Hey, can you get this on a quarterback?

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.554
Can you get this on a running back?

00:03:16.554 --> 00:03:18.147
We want that experience."

00:03:18.147 --> 00:03:20.292
Well, once we have that experience with GoPro

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:21.615
and Google Glass,

00:03:21.615 --> 00:03:23.006
how do we make it more immersive?

00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:24.201
How do we take that next step?

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:26.120
Well, we take that step

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.789
by going to something called the Oculus Rift,

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.896
which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with.

00:03:30.896 --> 00:03:32.883
The Oculus Rift has been described as one of

00:03:32.883 --> 00:03:35.790
the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.273
and that is not empty hype.

00:03:37.273 --> 00:03:39.433
I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:42.230
with this video.

00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:48.240
(Video) Man: Oh! Oh!

00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:53.391
No! No! No! I don't want to play anymore! No!

00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:57.952
Oh my God! Aaaah!

00:03:57.952 --> 00:04:01.237
CK: So that is the experience of a man

00:04:01.237 --> 00:04:03.251
on a roller coaster

00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.030
in fear of his life.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.702
What do you think that fan's experience

00:04:08.702 --> 00:04:10.663
is going to be when we take the video footage

00:04:10.663 --> 00:04:13.775
of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line,

00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:15.513
shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm

00:04:15.513 --> 00:04:17.607
before sprinting in for a touchdown?

00:04:17.607 --> 00:04:19.000
What do you think that fan's experience

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.156
is going to be when he's Messi

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:22.376
sprinting down the pitch

00:04:22.376 --> 00:04:23.878
putting the ball in the back of the net,

00:04:23.878 --> 00:04:26.160
or Federer serving in Wimbledon?

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.492
What do you think his experience is going to be

00:04:28.492 --> 00:04:30.430
when he is going down the side of a mountain

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.207
at over 70 miles an hour

00:04:32.207 --> 00:04:35.226
as an Olympic downhill skier?

00:04:35.226 --> 00:04:37.551
I think adult diaper sales may surge.

00:04:37.551 --> 00:04:38.460
(Laughter)

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.391
But this is not yet augmented reality.

00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:43.307
This is only virtual reality, V.R.

00:04:43.307 --> 00:04:45.721
How do we get to augmented reality, A.R.?

00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:47.830
We get to augmented reality

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.403
when coaches and managers and owners

00:04:50.403 --> 00:04:52.557
look at this information streaming in

00:04:52.557 --> 00:04:53.943
that people want to see, and they say,

00:04:53.943 --> 00:04:56.915
"How do we use this to make our teams better?

00:04:56.915 --> 00:04:58.940
How do we use this to win games?"

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.402
Because teams always use technology to win games.

00:05:01.402 --> 00:05:03.180
They like winning. It makes them money.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.156
So a brief history of technology in the NFL.

00:05:06.156 --> 00:05:08.167
In 1965, the Baltimore Colts

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:09.820
put a wristband on their quarterback

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.114
to allow him to call plays quicker.

00:05:12.114 --> 00:05:13.518
They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year.

00:05:13.518 --> 00:05:15.113
Other teams followed suit.

00:05:15.113 --> 00:05:17.276
More people watched the game
because it was more exciting.

00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:18.730
It was faster.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.130
In 1994, the NFL put helmet radios

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.057
into the helmets of the quarterbacks,

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:25.301
and later the defense.

00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:27.690
More people watched games because it was faster.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.356
It was more entertaining.

00:05:29.356 --> 00:05:32.469
In 2023, imagine you're a player

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:33.920
walking back to the huddle,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.260
and you have your next play displayed

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.226
right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor

00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:41.468
that you already wear right now.

00:05:41.468 --> 00:05:43.335
No more having to worry about forgetting plays.

00:05:43.335 --> 00:05:45.996
No more worrying about having
to memorize your playbook.

00:05:45.996 --> 00:05:47.923
You just go out and react.

00:05:47.923 --> 00:05:49.371
And coaches really want this,

00:05:49.371 --> 00:05:51.924
because missed assignments lose you games,

00:05:51.924 --> 00:05:53.980
and coaches hate losing games.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.237
Losing games gets you fired as a coach.

00:05:56.237 --> 00:05:58.024
They don't want that.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.667
But augmented reality is not just

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:02.331
an enhanced playbook.

00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:05.635
Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data

00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:07.180
and use it in real time

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.773
to enhance how you play the game.

00:06:09.773 --> 00:06:11.830
What would that be like?

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.385
Well, a very simple setup would be a camera

00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:16.040
on each corner of the stadium looking down,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.304
giving you a bird's-eye view

00:06:17.304 --> 00:06:18.858
of all the people down there.

00:06:18.858 --> 00:06:21.432
You also have information from helmet sensors

00:06:21.432 --> 00:06:22.540
and accelerometers,

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.473
technology that's being worked on right now.

00:06:25.473 --> 00:06:28.032
You take all that information,
and you stream it to your players.

00:06:28.032 --> 00:06:30.226
The good teams stream it in a
way that the players can use.

00:06:30.226 --> 00:06:32.208
The bad ones have information overload.

00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:34.264
That determines good teams from bad.

00:06:34.264 --> 00:06:37.010
And now, your I.T. department

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.582
is just as important as your scouting department,

00:06:39.582 --> 00:06:42.167
and data-mining is not for nerds anymore.

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:44.598
It's also for jocks. Who knew?

00:06:44.598 --> 00:06:46.474
What would that look like on the field?

00:06:46.474 --> 00:06:48.583
Well, imagine you're the quarterback.

00:06:48.583 --> 00:06:50.077
You take the snap and you drop back.

00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:52.124
You're scanning downfield for an open receiver.

00:06:52.124 --> 00:06:54.291
All of a sudden, a bright flash

00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:55.975
on the left side of your visor lets you know,

00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:58.246
blind side linebacker is blitzing in.

00:06:58.246 --> 00:06:59.722
Normally, you wouldn't be able to see him,

00:06:59.722 --> 00:07:01.963
but the augmented reality system lets you know.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.132
You step up into the pocket.

00:07:03.132 --> 00:07:05.258
Another flash alerts you to an open receiver.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.556
You throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.

00:07:07.556 --> 00:07:09.325
The ball comes off track.

00:07:09.325 --> 00:07:10.783
You don't know where it's going to land.

00:07:10.783 --> 00:07:12.361
However, on the receiver's visor,

00:07:12.361 --> 00:07:14.494
he sees a patch of grass light up,

00:07:14.494 --> 00:07:16.290
and he knows to readjust.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.519
He goes, catches the ball,

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:19.047
sprints in, touchdown.

00:07:19.047 --> 00:07:20.973
Crowd goes wild, and the fans are with him

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.314
every step of the way,

00:07:22.314 --> 00:07:24.498
watching from every perspective.

00:07:24.498 --> 00:07:27.378
Now this is something that will create

00:07:27.378 --> 00:07:29.184
massive excitement in the game.

00:07:29.184 --> 00:07:31.452
It will make tons of people watch,

00:07:31.452 --> 00:07:33.843
because people want this experience.

00:07:33.843 --> 00:07:35.669
Fans want to be on the field.

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:37.932
They want to be their favorite player.

00:07:37.932 --> 00:07:40.050
Augmented reality will be a part of sports,

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.496
because it's too profitable not to.

00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:45.395
But the question I ask you is,

00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:48.746
is that's all that we're content
to use augmented reality for?

00:07:48.746 --> 00:07:51.454
Are we going to use it solely for our panem,

00:07:51.454 --> 00:07:53.902
our circenses, our entertainment as normal?

00:07:53.902 --> 00:07:56.708
Because I believe that we can use augmented reality

00:07:56.718 --> 00:07:58.119
for something more.

00:07:58.119 --> 00:08:00.286
I believe we can use augmented reality

00:08:00.286 --> 00:08:02.279
as a way to foster more empathy

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:04.583
within the human species itself,

00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:06.245
by literally showing someone

00:08:06.245 --> 00:08:07.684
what it looks like

00:08:07.684 --> 00:08:10.970
to walk a mile in another person's shoes.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.712
We know what this technology is worth

00:08:12.712 --> 00:08:13.930
to sports leagues.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.158
It's worth revenue, to the tune
of billions of dollars a year.

00:08:17.158 --> 00:08:19.208
But what is this technology worth

00:08:19.208 --> 00:08:21.080
to a teacher in a classroom

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.516
trying to show a bully

00:08:22.516 --> 00:08:24.232
just how harmful his actions are

00:08:24.232 --> 00:08:26.839
from the perspective of the victim?

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.485
What is this technology worth

00:08:28.485 --> 00:08:30.417
to a gay Ugandan or Russian

00:08:30.417 --> 00:08:32.040
trying to show the world what it's like

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.790
living under persecution?

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.723
What is this technology worth

00:08:35.723 --> 00:08:39.297
to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson

00:08:39.297 --> 00:08:42.040
trying to inspire a generation of children

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.806
to think more about space and science

00:08:44.806 --> 00:08:48.511
instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians?

00:08:48.511 --> 00:08:51.256
Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality

00:08:51.256 --> 00:08:53.426
is coming.

00:08:53.426 --> 00:08:57.264
The questions we ask, the choices we make,

00:08:57.264 --> 00:08:58.897
and the challenges we face

00:08:58.897 --> 00:09:01.267
are, as always, up to us.

00:09:01.267 --> 00:09:03.020
Thank you.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.267
(Applause)
