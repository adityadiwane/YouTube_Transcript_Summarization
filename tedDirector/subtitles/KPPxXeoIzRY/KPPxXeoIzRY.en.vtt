00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:17.249
As you might imagine, I'm absolutely passionate

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.454
about dance. I'm passionate about making it,

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:22.058
about watching it, about encouraging others

00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:23.927
to participate in it,

00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:26.550
and I'm also really passionate about creativity.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.667
Creativity for me is something that's absolutely critical,

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.052
and I think it's something that you can teach.

00:00:33.052 --> 00:00:35.313
I think the technicities of creativity can be taught

00:00:35.313 --> 00:00:37.479
and shared, and I think you can find out things

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.748
about your own personal physical signature,

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:41.660
your own cognitive habits, and use that as

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.112
a point of departure to misbehave beautifully.

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:49.515
I was born in the 1970s, and John Travolta was big

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.986
in those days: "Grease," "Saturday Night Fever,"

00:00:51.986 --> 00:00:54.663
and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me

00:00:54.663 --> 00:00:57.443
to start dancing. My parents were very up for me going.

00:00:57.443 --> 00:01:00.305
They absolutely encouraged me to take risks, to go,

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:04.530
to try, to try. I had an opportunity, an access

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.121
to a local dance studio, and I had an enlightened teacher

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:11.226
who allowed me to make up my own and invent

00:01:11.226 --> 00:01:14.220
my own dances, so what she did was let me make up

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.169
my own ballroom and Latin American dances to teach

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:18.541
to my peers.

00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:21.310
And that was the very first time that I found an opportunity

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.195
to feel that I was able to express my own voice,

00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:27.013
and that's what's fueled me, then, to become a choreographer.

00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:30.029
I feel like I've got something to say and something to share.

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:33.606
And I guess what's interesting is, is that I am now obsessed

00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:35.193
with the technology of the body.

00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:38.489
I think it's the most technologically literate thing that we have,

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:41.588
and I'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way

00:01:41.588 --> 00:01:44.886
of communicating ideas through the body to audiences

00:01:44.886 --> 00:01:47.039
that might move them, touch them,

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.141
help them think differently about things.

00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:52.743
So for me, choreography is very much a process

00:01:52.743 --> 00:01:56.152
of physical thinking. It's very much in mind,

00:01:56.152 --> 00:01:59.415
as well as in body, and it's a collaborative process.

00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:01.241
It's something that I have to do with other people.

00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:03.995
You know, it's a distributed cognitive process in a way.

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:06.593
I work often with designers and visual artists,

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.201
obviously dancers and other choreographers,

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:13.572
but also, more and more, with economists,

00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:17.878
anthropologists, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists,

00:02:17.878 --> 00:02:20.645
people really who come from very different domains of

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:23.638
expertise, where they bring their intelligence to bear

00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:26.026
on a different kind of creative process.

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:29.229
What I thought we would do today a little bit is

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.490
explore this idea of physical thinking,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.291
and we're all experts in physical thinking.

00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:34.669
Yeah, you all have a body, right?

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:36.860
And we all know what that body is like in the real world,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.554
so one of the aspects of physical thinking

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:41.468
that we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception,

00:02:41.468 --> 00:02:44.533
the sense of my own body in the space in the real world.

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:47.919
So, we all understand what it feels like to know

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.272
where the ends of your fingers are

00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:51.269
when you hold out your arms, yeah?

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.084
You absolutely know that when you're going to grab a cup,

00:02:54.084 --> 00:02:55.994
or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it.

00:02:55.994 --> 00:02:57.952
So we're experts in physical thinking already.

00:02:57.952 --> 00:02:59.988
We just don't think about our bodies very much.

00:02:59.988 --> 00:03:03.093
We only think about them when they go wrong, so, when

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:05.331
there's a broken arm, or when you have a heart attack,

00:03:05.331 --> 00:03:07.796
then you become really very aware of your bodies.

00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:10.083
But how is it that we can start to think about using

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:13.491
choreographic thinking, kinesthetic intelligence, to arm

00:03:13.491 --> 00:03:15.849
the ways in which we think about things more generally?

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.805
What I thought I'd do is, I'd make a TED premiere.

00:03:18.805 --> 00:03:21.108
I'm not sure if this is going to be good or not.

00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:23.083
I'll just be doing it.

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:25.170
I thought what I'd do is, I'd use three versions

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.814
of physical thinking to make something.

00:03:26.814 --> 00:03:29.930
I want to introduce you. This is Paolo. This is Catarina.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.778
(Applause)

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:35.382
They have no idea what we're going to do.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.726
So this is not the type of choreography where

00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:40.070
I already have in mind what I'm going to make,

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.611
where I've fixed the routine in my head

00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:44.201
and I'm just going to teach it to them,

00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:46.510
and these so-called empty vessels are just going to learn it.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.444
That's not the methodology at all that we work with.

00:03:49.444 --> 00:03:53.777
But what's important about it is how it is that they're

00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:55.824
grasping information, how they're taking information,

00:03:55.824 --> 00:03:57.955
how they're using it, and how they're thinking with it.

00:03:57.955 --> 00:03:59.403
I'm going to start really, really simply.

00:03:59.403 --> 00:04:02.380
Usually, dance has a stimulus or stimuli, and I thought

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.484
I'd take something simple, TED logo, we can all see it,

00:04:05.484 --> 00:04:07.833
it's quite easy to work with, and I'm going to do something

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:10.622
very simply, where you take one idea from a body,

00:04:10.622 --> 00:04:12.626
and it happens to be my body, and translate that

00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:14.818
into somebody else's body,

00:04:14.818 --> 00:04:18.172
so it's a direct transfer, transformation of energy.

00:04:18.172 --> 00:04:20.952
And I'm going to imagine this, you can do this too if you like,

00:04:20.952 --> 00:04:23.190
that I'm going to just take the letter "T" and I'm going

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.065
to imagine it in mind, and I'm going to place that outside in

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:29.969
the real world. So I absolutely see a letter "T" in front of me.

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.374
Yeah? It's absolutely there.

00:04:31.374 --> 00:04:34.354
I can absolutely walk around it when I see it, yeah?

00:04:34.354 --> 00:04:36.279
It has a kind of a grammar. I know what I'm going to do

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.214
with it, and I can start to describe it, so I can describe it

00:04:39.214 --> 00:04:42.185
very simply. I can describe it in my arms, right?

00:04:42.185 --> 00:04:44.863
So all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand.

00:04:44.863 --> 00:04:47.050
I can describe it, whoa, in my head, you know? Whoa.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.358
Okay. I can do also my shoulder. Yeah?

00:04:49.358 --> 00:04:52.366
It gives me something to do, something to work towards.

00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:54.484
If I were to take that letter "T" and flatten it down

00:04:54.484 --> 00:04:57.420
on the floor, here, maybe just off the floor,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.893
all of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee,

00:04:58.893 --> 00:05:01.444
yeah? Whoa. So If I put the knee and the arms together,

00:05:01.444 --> 00:05:05.004
I've got something physical, yeah? And I can start to build something.

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:07.465
So what I'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so

00:05:07.465 --> 00:05:10.065
is I'm going to take that concept, I'm going to make something,

00:05:10.065 --> 00:05:12.943
and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it,

00:05:12.943 --> 00:05:14.587
they're going to snapshot it, they're going to take

00:05:14.587 --> 00:05:17.566
aspects of it, and it's almost like I'm offloading memory

00:05:17.566 --> 00:05:19.682
and they're holding onto memory? Yeah?

00:05:19.682 --> 00:05:21.086
And we'll see what we come up with.

00:05:21.086 --> 00:05:23.241
So just have a little watch about how they're, how they're

00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:24.549
accessing this and what they're doing,

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:26.510
and I'm just going to take this letter "T," the letter "E,"

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.541
and the letter "D," to make something. Okay. Here goes.

00:05:29.541 --> 00:05:32.925
So I have to get myself in the zone. Right.

00:05:47.137 --> 00:05:50.011
It's a bit of a cross of my arm.

00:05:55.698 --> 00:06:00.349
So all I'm doing is exploring this space of "T"

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:05.664
and flashing through it with some action.

00:06:05.664 --> 00:06:08.067
I'm not remembering what I'm doing.

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:10.830
I'm just working on my task. My task is this "T."

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.438
Going to watch it from the side, whoa.

00:06:16.207 --> 00:06:18.077
Strike moment.

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:21.618
That's it.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:27.375
So we're starting to build a phrase.

00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:29.344
So what they're doing, let's see, something like that,

00:06:29.344 --> 00:06:32.491
so what they're doing is grasping aspects of that movement

00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:34.396
and they're generating it into a phrase.

00:06:34.396 --> 00:06:36.654
You can see the speed is extremely quick, yeah?

00:06:36.654 --> 00:06:38.944
I'm not asking them to copy exactly.

00:06:38.944 --> 00:06:41.301
They're using the information that they receive

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:44.617
to generate the beginnings of a phrase.

00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:46.538
I can watch that and that can tell me something

00:06:46.538 --> 00:06:49.291
about how it is that they're moving.

00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:52.371
Yeah, they're super quick, right?

00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:56.155
So I've taken this aspect of TED and translated it

00:06:56.155 --> 00:06:58.830
into something that's physical.

00:07:00.876 --> 00:07:03.460
Some dancers, when they're watching action,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.935
take the overall shape, the arc of the movement,

00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:08.040
the kinetic sense of the movement,

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.635
and use that for memory.

00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:11.918
Some work very much in specific detail.

00:07:11.918 --> 00:07:15.736
They start with small little units and build it up.

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.764
Okay, you've got something? One more thing.

00:07:33.272 --> 00:07:36.420
So they're solving this problem for me,

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.253
having a little --

00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:42.114
They're constructing that phrase.

00:07:42.114 --> 00:07:43.590
They have something and they're going to hold on to it,

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.613
yeah? One way of making.

00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:47.969
That's going to be my beginning in this world premiere.

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:49.943
Okay. From there I'm going to do a very different thing.

00:07:49.943 --> 00:07:52.659
So basically I'm going to make a duet.

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:56.154
I want you to think about them as architectural objects,

00:07:56.154 --> 00:07:58.450
so what they are, are just pure lines.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.006
They're no longer people, just pure lines, and I'm going

00:08:01.006 --> 00:08:05.231
to work with them almost as objects to think with, yeah?

00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:07.708
So what I'm thinking about is taking

00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:11.633
a few physical extensions from the body as I move, and

00:08:11.633 --> 00:08:13.931
I move them, and I do that by suggesting things to them:

00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:17.108
If, then; if, then. Okay, so here we go.

00:08:17.108 --> 00:08:18.284
Just grab this arm.

00:08:18.284 --> 00:08:21.309
Can you place that down into the floor?

00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:23.515
Yeah, down to the floor. Can you go underneath?

00:08:23.515 --> 00:08:27.332
Yeah. Cat, can you put leg over that side? Yeah.

00:08:27.332 --> 00:08:28.781
Can you rotate?

00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:29.897
Whoom, just go back to the beginning.

00:08:29.897 --> 00:08:36.245
Here we go, ready? And ... bam, bake ... (clicks metronome)

00:08:36.245 --> 00:08:38.169
Great. Okay, from there, you're both getting up.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.694
You're both getting up. Here we go. Good, now? Them.

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:43.278
(Applause)

00:08:43.278 --> 00:08:45.979
So from there, from there, we're both getting up,

00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:47.222
we're both getting up, going in this direction,

00:08:47.222 --> 00:08:49.560
going underneath. Whoa, whoa, underneath.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.524
Whoa, underneath, whoo-um. Yeah? Underneath. Jump.

00:08:53.524 --> 00:08:57.706
Underneath. Jump. Paolo, kick. Don't care where. Kick.

00:08:57.706 --> 00:09:01.125
Kick, replace, change a leg. Kick, replace, change the leg.

00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:04.834
Yeah? Okay? Cat, almost get his head. Almost get his head.

00:09:04.834 --> 00:09:09.699
Whoaa. Just after it, maybe. Whoaa, whaaay, ooh.

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:14.017
Grab her waist, come up back into her first, whoom, spin,

00:09:14.017 --> 00:09:15.623
turn her, whoo-aa. (Snaps) Great.

00:09:15.623 --> 00:09:17.982
Okay, let's have a little go from the beginning of that.

00:09:17.982 --> 00:09:23.491
Just, let me slow down here. Fancy having eight -- (Laughter)

00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:26.293
Fancy having eight hours with me in a day.

00:09:26.293 --> 00:09:30.799
So, maybe too much. So, here we go, ready, and -- (Clicks metronome)

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:38.382
(Clicks metronome)

00:09:38.382 --> 00:09:41.523
Nice, good job. Yeah? Okay. (Applause)

00:09:41.523 --> 00:09:44.521
Okay, not bad. (Applause) A little bit more?

00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:47.313
Yeah. Just a little bit more, here we go, from that place.

00:09:47.313 --> 00:09:49.786
Separate. Face the front. Separate. Face the front.

00:09:49.786 --> 00:09:52.011
Imagine that there's a circle in front of you, yeah?

00:09:52.011 --> 00:09:56.906
Avoid it. Avoid it. Whoom. Kick it out of the way.

00:09:56.906 --> 00:10:00.995
Kick it out of the way. Throw it into the audience. Whoom.

00:10:00.995 --> 00:10:02.038
Throw it into the audience again.

00:10:02.038 --> 00:10:03.920
We've got mental architecture, we're sharing it,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.812
therefore solving a problem. They're enacting it.

00:10:05.812 --> 00:10:07.995
Let me just see that a little bit. Ready, and go.

00:10:07.995 --> 00:10:12.498
(Clicks metronome)

00:10:12.498 --> 00:10:14.163
Okay, brilliant. Okay, here we go. From the beginning,

00:10:14.163 --> 00:10:17.101
can we do our phrases first? And then that.

00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:18.790
And we're going to build something now, organize it,

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.439
the phrases. Here we go. Nice and slow?

00:10:20.439 --> 00:10:23.841
Ready and go ... um. (Clicks metronome)

00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:28.237
(Clicks metronome)

00:10:28.237 --> 00:10:31.921
The duet starts. (Clicks metronome)

00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:45.247
(Clicks metronome)

00:10:45.247 --> 00:10:48.684
So yeah, okay, good. Okay, nice, very nice. (Applause)

00:10:48.684 --> 00:10:50.394
So good. So -- (Applause)

00:10:50.394 --> 00:10:53.641
Okay. So that was -- (Applause)

00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:55.535
Well done. (Applause)

00:10:55.535 --> 00:10:57.094
That was the second way of working.

00:10:57.094 --> 00:10:59.466
The first one, body-to-body transfer, yeah,

00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:02.214
with an outside mental architecture that I work with

00:11:02.214 --> 00:11:04.286
that they hold memory with for me.

00:11:04.286 --> 00:11:06.524
The second one, which is using them as objects to think

00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:08.292
with their architectural objects, I do a series of

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:10.765
provocations, I say, "If this happens, then that.

00:11:10.765 --> 00:11:13.120
If this, if that happens -- " I've got lots of methods like that,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.751
but it's very, very quick, and this is a third method.

00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:18.505
They're starting it already, and this is a task-based method,

00:11:18.505 --> 00:11:20.186
where they have the autonomy to make

00:11:20.186 --> 00:11:21.992
all of the decisions for themselves.

00:11:21.992 --> 00:11:23.251
So I'd like us just to do, we're going to do a little

00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:26.673
mental dance, a little, in this little one minute,

00:11:26.673 --> 00:11:28.572
so what I'd love you to do is imagine,

00:11:28.572 --> 00:11:30.673
you can do this with your eyes closed, or open, and if you

00:11:30.673 --> 00:11:33.151
don't want to do it you can watch them, it's up to you.

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:36.891
Just for a second, think about that word "TED" in front of

00:11:36.891 --> 00:11:40.192
you, so it's in mind, and it's there right in front of your mind.

00:11:40.192 --> 00:11:42.429
What I'd like you to do is transplant that outside

00:11:42.429 --> 00:11:45.972
into the real world, so just imagine that word "TED"

00:11:45.972 --> 00:11:48.305
in the real world.

00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:51.245
What I'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it.

00:11:51.245 --> 00:11:54.385
I'm going to zone in on the "E," and I'm going to

00:11:54.385 --> 00:11:57.032
scale that "E" so it's absolutely massive,

00:11:57.032 --> 00:11:59.744
so I'm scaling that "E" so it's absolutely massive,

00:11:59.744 --> 00:12:00.915
and then I'm going to give it dimensionality.

00:12:00.915 --> 00:12:03.167
I'm going to think about it in 3D space. So now,

00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:05.640
instead of it just being a letter that's in front of me,

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.521
it's a space that my body can go inside of.

00:12:08.521 --> 00:12:11.238
I now decide where I'm going to be in that space,

00:12:11.238 --> 00:12:15.709
so I'm down on this small part of the bottom rib

00:12:15.709 --> 00:12:18.577
of the letter "E," and I'm thinking about it, and I'm imagining

00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:22.031
this space that's really high and above. If I asked you to

00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:24.788
reach out — you don't have to literally do it, but in mind —

00:12:24.788 --> 00:12:27.838
reach out to the top of the "E," where would you reach?

00:12:27.838 --> 00:12:29.816
If you reach with your finger, where would it be?

00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:32.708
If you reach with your elbow, where would it be?

00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:36.605
If I already then said about that space that you're in,

00:12:36.605 --> 00:12:38.964
let's infuse it with the color red, what does that do

00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:41.690
to the body? If I then said to you, what happens if

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.964
that whole wall on the side of "E" collapses and you have to

00:12:44.964 --> 00:12:46.810
use your weight to put it back up,

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.234
what would you be able to do with it?

00:12:49.234 --> 00:12:51.131
So this is a mental picture, I'm describing a mental,

00:12:51.131 --> 00:12:55.136
vivid picture that enables dancers to make choices

00:12:55.136 --> 00:12:57.517
for themselves about what to make.

00:12:57.517 --> 00:12:58.952
Okay, you can open your eyes if you had them closed.

00:12:58.952 --> 00:13:00.326
So the dancers have been working on them.

00:13:00.326 --> 00:13:02.182
So just keep working on them for a little second.

00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:05.198
So they've been working on those mental architectures in the here.

00:13:05.198 --> 00:13:07.700
I know, I think we should keep them as a surprise.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.280
So here goes, world premiere dance. Yeah? Here we go.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.801
TED dance. Okay. Here it comes. I'm going to organize it quickly.

00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:17.085
So, you're going to do the first solo that we made,

00:13:17.085 --> 00:13:19.884
yeah blah blah blah blah, we go into the duet, yeah,

00:13:19.884 --> 00:13:23.634
blah blah blah blah. The next solo, blah blah blah blah,

00:13:23.634 --> 00:13:27.358
yeah, and both at the same time, you do the last solutions.

00:13:27.358 --> 00:13:29.900
Okay? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, world premiere,

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.668
TED dance, three versions of physical thinking. (Applause)

00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:35.364
Well, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah? (Laughter)

00:13:35.364 --> 00:13:37.863
So yeah, let's clap -- yeah, let's clap afterwards.

00:13:37.863 --> 00:13:40.025
Here we go. Catarina, big moment, here we go, one.

00:13:40.025 --> 00:14:05.406
(Clicks metronome)

00:14:05.406 --> 00:14:10.617
Here it comes, Cat. (Clicks metronome)

00:14:10.617 --> 00:14:15.053
Paolo, go. (Clicks metronome) Last you solo.

00:14:15.053 --> 00:14:18.462
The one you made. (Clicks metronome)

00:14:18.462 --> 00:14:30.264
(Clicks metronome)

00:14:30.264 --> 00:14:32.223
Well done. Okay, good. Super. So --

00:14:32.223 --> 00:14:34.104
(Applause)

00:14:34.104 --> 00:14:36.395
So -- (Applause)

00:14:36.395 --> 00:14:38.186
Thank you. (Applause)

00:14:38.186 --> 00:14:47.171
So -- three versions. (Applause) Oh. (Laughs)

00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:50.152
(Applause) Three versions of physical thinking, yeah?

00:14:50.152 --> 00:14:53.111
Three versions of physical thinking. I'm hoping that today,

00:14:53.111 --> 00:14:54.685
what you're going to do is go away and make a dance

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.638
for yourself, and if not that,

00:14:56.638 --> 00:14:58.865
at least misbehave more beautifully, more often.

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:01.483
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:06.213
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

00:15:06.213 --> 00:15:08.524
Here we go. (Applause)

00:15:08.524 --> 00:15:12.520
(Applause)
