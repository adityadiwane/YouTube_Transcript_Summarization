00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm actually here

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
to make a challenge to people.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I know there have been many challenges made to people.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
The one I'm going to make

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
is that it is time for us to reclaim

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
what peace really means.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord."

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Peace is not the dove and the rainbow --

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
as lovely as they are.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
When I see the symbols

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
of the rainbow and the dove,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
I think of personal serenity.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
I think of meditation.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
I do not think

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
about what I consider to be peace,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
which is sustainable peace

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
with justice and equality.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
It is a sustainable peace

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
in which the majority of people

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
on this planet

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
have access to enough resources

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
to live dignified lives,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
where these people have enough access

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
to education

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and health care,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
so that they can live in freedom from want

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
and freedom from fear.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
This is called human security.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
And I am not a complete pacifist

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
like some of my really, really heavy-duty,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
non-violent friends,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
like Mairead McGuire.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
I understand that humans

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
are so "messed up" --

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
to use a nice word,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
because I promised my mom

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I'd stop using the F-bomb in public.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And I'm trying harder and harder.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Mom, I'm really trying.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
We need a little bit of police;

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
we need a little bit of military,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
but for defense.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
We need to redefine

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
what makes us secure

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
in this world.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
It is not arming our country

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
to the teeth.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
It is not getting other countries

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
to arm themselves to the teeth

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
with the weapons that we produce

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and we sell them.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
It is using that money more rationally

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.260
to make the countries of the world secure,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
to make the people of the world secure.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
I was thinking about

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
the recent ongoings

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
in Congress,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
where the president is offering

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
8.4 billion dollars

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
to try to get the START vote.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
I certainly support the START vote.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
But he's offering 84 billion dollars

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
for the modernizing

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
of nuclear weapons.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
is 80 billion dollars?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Just that little bit of money,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
which to me, I wish it was in my bank account --

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
it's not, but ...

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
In global terms, it's a little bit of money.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
But it's going to modernize weapons

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
we do not need

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
unless we get up off our ...

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and take action to make it happen,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
unless we begin to believe

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
that all of the things that we've been hearing about

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
in these last two days

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
are elements of what come together

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
to make human security.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
It is saving the tigers.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
It is stopping the tar sands.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
It is having access

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
to medical equipment

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
that can actually tell who does have cancer.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
It is all of those things.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
It is using our money for all of those things.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
It is about action.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
I was in Hiroshima

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
a couple of weeks ago,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and His Holiness --

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
We're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and he leans over to me, and he says,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
"Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk."

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
I said, "Yes, Your Holiness.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Your robe gives it away."

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
(Laughter)

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
He said, "You know

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
that I kind of like meditation, and I pray."

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
I said, "That's good. That's good.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
We need that in the world.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
I don't follow that, but that's cool."

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And he says, "But I have become skeptical.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
I do not believe

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
that meditation and prayer

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
will change this world.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
I think what we need

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
is action."

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
His Holiness, in his robes,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
is my new action hero.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
a couple of days ago.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
As most of you know,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
she's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
You probably also know

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
imprisoned for her efforts

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
to bring about democracy.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
She was just released a couple of weeks ago,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
agitating for change.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
She is already out in the streets, working with the party

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
to try to rebuild it.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
But I talked to her for a range of issues.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
But one thing that I want to say,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
because it's similar to what His Holiness said.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
She said, "You know, we have a long road to go

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
to finally get democracy in my country.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
But I don't believe in hope

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
without endeavor.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
I don't believe in the hope of change,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
unless we take action

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
to make it so."

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Here's another woman hero of mine.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
the first Muslim woman

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
She has been in exile

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
for the last year and a half.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
You ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exile?

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
She says the airports of the world.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
She is traveling because she was out of the country

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
at the time of the elections.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
And instead of going home,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
she conferred with all the other women that she works with,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
who said to her, "Stay out. We need you out.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
We need to be able to talk to you out there,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
so that you can give the message

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
of what's happening here."

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
A year and a half --

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
she's out speaking

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
on behalf of the other women in her country.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Wangari Maathai --

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
2004 Peace laureate.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
They call her the "Tree Lady,"

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
but she's more than the Tree Lady.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Working for peace

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
is very creative.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
It's hard work every day.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
When she was planting those trees,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
I don't think most people understand

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
that, at the same time,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
she was using the action

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
of getting people together to plant those trees

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
to talk about how to overcome

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
the authoritarian government in her country.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
People could not gather

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
without getting busted and taken to jail.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
But if they were together planting trees for the environment,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
it was okay --

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
creativity.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
But it's not just iconic women

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
like Shirin,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai --

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
it is other women in the world

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
who are also struggling together

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
to change this world.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
The Women's League of Burma,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
11 individual organizations of Burmese women

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
came together because there's strength in numbers.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Working together is what changes our world.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
The Million Signatures Campaign

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
of women inside Burma

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
working together to change human rights,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
to bring democracy to that country.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
When one is arrested and taken to prison,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
another one comes out and joins the movement,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
recognizing that if they work together,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
they will ultimately bring change

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
in their own country.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
Mairead McGuire in the middle,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Betty Williams on the right-hand side --

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
bringing peace to Northern Ireland.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
I'll tell you the quick story.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
An IRA driver was shot,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
and his car plowed into people

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
on the side of the street.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
There was a mother and three children.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
The children were killed on the spot.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
It was Mairead's sister.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Instead of giving in

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
to grief, depression, defeat

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
in the face of that violence,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Mairead hooked up with Betty --

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic --

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
and they took to the streets

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
to say, "No more violence."

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And they were able to get

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
tens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
in the streets to bring about change.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
And they have been

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and they're still working on it,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
because there's still a lot more to do.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
She also received the Peace Prize.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
She is now running for president.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
She is educating the indigenous people of her country

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
about what it means to be a democracy,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
about how you bring democracy to the country,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
about educating, about how to vote --

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
but that democracy is not just about voting;

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
it's about being an active citizen.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
That's what I got stuck doing --

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
the landmine campaign.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
One of the things that made this campaign work

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
is because we grew from two NGOs

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
to thousands

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
in 90 countries around the world,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
working together in common cause to ban landmines.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
Some of the people who worked in our campaign

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
could only work maybe an hour a month.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
They could maybe volunteer that much.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
There were others, like myself,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
who were full-time.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
But it was the actions, together, of all of us

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
that brought about that change.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
In my view, what we need today

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
is people getting up

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
and taking action

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
to reclaim the meaning of peace.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
It's not a dirty word.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
It's hard work every single day.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
And if each of us

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
who cares about the different things we care about

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
got up off our butts

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and volunteered

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
as much time as we could,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
we would change this world,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
we would save this world.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
Thank you.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
(Applause)
