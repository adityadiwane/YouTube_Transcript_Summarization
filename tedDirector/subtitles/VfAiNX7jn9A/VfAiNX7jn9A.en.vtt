00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.719
The great philosopher Aristotle said

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.320
if something doesn't exist,
there's no word for it,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.776
and if there's no word for something,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.440
that something doesn't exist.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.335
So when we talk about elections,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.936
we in established democracies,
we know what we're talking about.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.056
We've got the words.
We have the vocabulary.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.976
We know what a polling station is.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.720
We know what a ballot paper is.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.720
But what about countries
where democracy doesn't exist,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.056
countries where there are
no words to describe the concepts

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.520
that underpin a democratic society?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.856
I work in the field
of electoral assistance,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.016
so that's to say we assist

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.176
emerging democracies to organize

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.080
what is often their first elections.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.896
When people ask me what I do,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.336
quite often I get this answer.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.176
"Oh, so you're one of these people
who goes around the world

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120
imposing Western democracy
on countries that can't handle it."

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.840
Well, the United Nations
does not impose anything on anybody.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.816
It really doesn't,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.216
and also, what we do

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.536
is firmly anchored in the 1948
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.656
Article 21, that says

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.200
that everybody should have the right
to choose who governs them.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.536
So that's the basis of the work.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.456
I specialize in public outreach.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.896
What does that mean? Another jargon.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.696
It actually means
designing information campaigns

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.136
so that candidates and voters

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.456
who have never had the opportunity
to participate or to vote

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.216
understand where, when, how to register;

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.456
where, when, how to vote;

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.000
why, why it is important to take part.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.016
So I'll probably devise a specific
campaign to reach out to women

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.056
to make sure that they can take part,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.376
that they can be part of the process.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.256
Young people as well.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.496
All sorts of people.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.936
Handicapped people.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.560
We try to reach everybody.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.256
And it's not always easy,
because very often in this work,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.416
I've noticed now over the years
that I've been doing it

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.856
that words are lacking,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.520
and so what do you do?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.320
Afghanistan.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.696
It's a country with
high levels of illiteracy,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.576
and the thing about that was,
it was in 2005,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.576
and we organized two elections
on the same day.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.816
The reason was because the logistics
are so incredibly difficult,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.096
it seemed to be more efficient to do that.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.336
It was,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.816
but on the other hand,
explaining two elections instead of one

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.336
was even more complicated.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.696
So we used a lot of images,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.520
and when it came to the actual ballot,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.456
we had problems, because
so many people wanted to take part,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.416
we had 300 candidates for 52 seats

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.480
in the Wolesi Jirga,
which is the parliamentary elections.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.216
And for the Provincial Council,
we had even more candidates.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.800
We had 330 for 54 seats.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.520
So talking about ballot design,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.640
this is what the ballot looked like.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.216
It's the size of a newspaper.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.000
This was the Wolesi Jirga ballot --

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:32.576
(Laughter)

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.960
Yeah, and --

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.080
this was the Provincial Council ballot.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.696
Even more.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.656
So you see, we did use
a lot of symbols and things like that.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.456
And we had other problems
in Southern Sudan.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.216
Southern Sudan was a very different story.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.336
We had so many people
who had never, of course, voted,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.160
but we had extremely, extremely
high levels of illiteracy,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.896
very, very poor infrastructure.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.496
For example -- I mean, it's a country
the size of Texas, more or less.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.400
We had seven kilometers of paved roads,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.336
seven kilometers in the whole country,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.496
and that includes the tarmac
where we landed the planes

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.056
in Juba Airport.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.216
So transporting electoral materials, etc.,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.496
is exceedingly difficult.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.495
People had no idea
about what a box looked like.

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:30.815
It was very complicated,

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:34.936
so using verbal communication
was obviously the way to go,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.960
but there were 132 languages.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.720
So that was extremely challenging.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.336
Then I arrived in Tunisia in 2011.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.016
It was the Arab Spring.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.336
A huge amount of hope was generated
by that enormous movement

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.936
that was going on in the region.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.096
There was Libya,
there was Egypt, there was Yemen.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.136
It was an enormous, enormous
historical moment.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.736
And I was sitting
with the election commission,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.496
and we were talking
about various aspects of the election,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.856
and I was hearing them using words
that I hadn't actually heard before,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.096
and I'd worked with Iraqis,
I'd worked with Jordanians, Egyptians,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.536
and suddenly they were using these words,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.416
and I just thought, "This is strange."

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.336
And what really gave rise to it
was this word "observer."

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.616
We were discussing election observers,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.456
and the election commissioner
was talking about "mulahiz" in Arabic.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.576
This means "to notice"
in a passive sort of sense,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.216
as in, "I noticed
he was wearing a light blue shirt."

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.936
Did I go and check whether
the shirt was light blue or not?

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.936
That is the role of an election observer.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.016
It's very active, it's governed
by all kinds of treaties,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.816
and it has got
that control function in it.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.016
And then I got wind
of the fact that in Egypt,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.376
they were using this term "mutabiâ€™,"
which means "to follow."

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.696
So we were now having
followers of an election.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.296
So that's not quite right either,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.082
because there is a term
that's already accepted and in use,

00:06:02.106 --> 00:06:05.376
which was the word "muraqib"
which means "a controller."

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.536
It's got that notion of control.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.296
So I thought, three words
for one concept. This is not good.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.416
And with our colleagues,
we thought perhaps it's our role

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.496
to actually help make sure
that the words are understood

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.656
and actually create a work of reference

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.336
that could be used across the Arab region.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.616
And that's what we did.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.296
So together with these colleagues,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.296
we launched the "Arabic Lexicon
of Electoral Terminology,"

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.640
and we worked
in eight different countries.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.176
It meant actually defining 481 terms

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.056
which formed the basis
of everything you need to know

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.440
if you're going to organize
a democratic election.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.216
And we defined these terms,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.216
and we worked with the Arab colleagues

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.016
and came to an agreement
about what would be the appropriate word

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.616
to use in Arabic.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.896
Because the Arabic language is very rich,
and that's part of the problem.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.896
But there are 22 countries
that speak Arabic,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.616
and they use modern standard Arabic,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.496
which is the Arabic
that is used across the whole region

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.016
in newspapers and broadcasts,

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.936
but of course, then from one country
to the next in day to day language and use

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.296
it varies -- dialect, colloquialisms, etc.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.896
So that was another
added layer of complication.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.416
So in one sense you had the problem

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.096
that language wasn't
fully ripe, if you like,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.800
neologisms were coming up,
new expressions.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.056
And so we defined all these terms,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.376
and then we had
eight correspondents in the region.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.296
We submitted the draft to them,

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.896
they responded back to us.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.536
"Yes, we understand the definition.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.256
We agree with it,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.456
but this is what we say in our country."

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.096
Because we were not going
to harmonize or force harmonization.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.120
We were trying to facilitate
understanding among people.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.696
So in yellow, you see
the different expressions in use

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.040
in the various countries.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.936
So this, I'm happy to say,
it took three years to produce this

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.296
because we also finalized the draft
and took it actually into the field,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.463
sat with the election commissions
in all these different countries,

00:08:13.487 --> 00:08:16.376
debated and defined and refined the draft,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.416
and finally published it
in November 2014 in Cairo.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.696
And it's gone a long way.
We published 10,000 copies.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.936
To date, there's about 3,000 downloads
off the internet in PDF form.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.856
I heard just recently from a colleague
that they've taken it up in Somalia.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.776
They're going to produce
a version of this in Somalia,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.816
because there's nothing in Somalia at all.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.856
So that's very good to know.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.135
And this newly formed Arab Organization
for Electoral Management Bodies,

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:49.096
which is trying to professionalize

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.416
how elections are run in the region,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.535
they're using it as well.

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:59.496
And the Arab League have now
built up a pan-Arab observation unit,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.776
and they're using it.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.416
So that's all really good.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.256
However, this work of reference
is quite high-pitched.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.176
It's complex, and a lot of the terms
are quite technical,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.360
so the average person probably doesn't
need to know at least a third of it.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.016
But the people of the Middle East

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.536
have been deprived of any form
of what we know as civic education.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.336
It's part of our curriculum at school.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.456
It doesn't really exist
in that part of the world,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.896
and I feel it's really
the right of everybody

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.016
to know how these things work.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.656
And it's a good thing to think about
producing a work of reference

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.336
for the average person,

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.496
and bearing in mind that now

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.696
we have a basis to work with,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.856
but also we have technology,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.256
so we can reach out using telephone apps,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.416
video, animation.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.736
There's all sorts of tools
that can be used now

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.256
to communicate these ideas to people

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.000
for the first time in their own language.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.456
We hear a lot of misery
about the Middle East.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.656
We hear the chaos of war.
We hear terrorism.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.216
We hear about sectarianism
and all this horrible negative news

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.896
that comes to us all the time.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.776
What we're not hearing is what are
the people, the everyday people, thinking?

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.400
What are they aspiring to?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.880
Let's give them the means,
let's give them the words.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.696
The silent majority is silent

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.800
because they don't have the words.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.720
The silent majority needs to know.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.456
It is time to provide people
with the knowledge tools

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.720
that they can inform themselves with.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.056
The silent majority
does not need to be silent.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.376
Let's help them have a voice.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.656
Thank you very much.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.502
