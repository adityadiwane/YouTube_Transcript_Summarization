00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.640
It began with one question:

00:00:17.222 --> 00:00:22.360
If Africa was a bar, what would
your country be drinking or doing?

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.456
I kicked it off with a guess
about South Africa,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.536
which wasn't exactly
according to the rules

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.080
because South Africa's not my country.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.896
But alluding to the country's
continual attempts

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.256
to build a postracial society

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.576
after being ravaged
for decades by apartheid,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.936
I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa
would be drinking all kinds of alcohol

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.320
and begging them
to get along in its stomach.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.656
And then I waited.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.136
And then I had that funny feeling
where I wondered if I crossed the line.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.336
So, I sent out a few other tweets
about my own country

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.920
and a few other African countries
I'm familiar with.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.656
And then I waited again,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.056
but this time

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.496
I read through almost every tweet
I had ever tweeted

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.256
to convince myself,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.376
no, to remind myself that I'm really funny

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.519
and that if nobody gets it, that's fine.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.176
But luckily,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.416
I didn't have to do that for very long.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.480
Very soon, people were participating.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.536
In fact, by the end of that week in July,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.096
the hashtag #ifafricawasabar

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.816
would have garnered around 60,000 tweets,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.496
lit up the continent

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.680
and made its way to publications
all over the world.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.400
People were using the hashtag
to do many different things.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.456
To poke fun at their stereotypes:

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.096
[#IfAfricaWasABar
Nigeria would be outside explaining

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.896
that he will pay the entrance fee,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.336
all he needs is
the bouncer's account details.]

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.576
(Laughter)

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.976
To criticize government spending:

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.576
[#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be
ordering bottles it can't pronounce

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.456
running a tab it won't be able to pay]

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.056
To make light of geopolitical tensions:

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.456
[#IfAfricaWasABar
South Sudan would be the new guy

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.696
with serious anger management issues.]

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.576
To remind us that even in Africa

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.056
there are some countries
we don't know exist:

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.456
[#IfAfricaWasABar
Lesotho would be that person

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.496
who nobody really knows
but is always in the pictures.]

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.776
And also to make fun of the countries
that don't think that they're in Africa:

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.816
[#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya,
Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.056
be like "What the hell
are we doing here?!!"]

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.976
(Laughter)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.096
And to note the countries
that had made a big turnaround:

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.136
[#ifAfricawasabar
Rwanda would be that girl

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.776
that comes with no money and no transport
but leaves drunk, happy and rich]

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.480
But most importantly,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.000
people were using the hashtag to connect.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.520
People were connecting
over their Africanness.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.296
So for one week in July,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.040
Twitter became a real African bar.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.976
And I was really thrilled,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.360
mainly because I realized
that Pan-Africanism could work,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.496
that we had before us,
between us, at our fingertips

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.976
a platform that just needed a small spark

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.400
to light in us a hunger for each other.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.296
My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.056
I'm 22 years old

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.400
and I am Pan-Africanist by birth.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.656
Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.056
because my parents are
from two different African countries.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.816
My father's from a country
called Botswana in southern Africa.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.856
It's only slightly bigger than Germany.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.976
This year we celebrate
our 50th year of stable democracy.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.576
And it has some very progressive
social policies.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.616
My mother's country
is the Kingdom of Swaziland.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.856
It's a very, very small country,
also in southern Africa.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.960
It is Africa's last complete monarchy.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.336
So it's been ruled by a king
and a royal family

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.776
in line with their tradition,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.120
for a very long time.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.856
On paper, these countries
seem very different.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.416
And when I was a kid,
I could see the difference.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.896
It rained a lot in one country,
it didn't rain quite as much in the other.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.296
But outside of that,
I didn't really realize

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.200
why it mattered that my parents
were from two different places.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.896
But it would go on
to have a very peculiar effect on me.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.656
You see, I was born in one country

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.079
and raised in the other.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.656
When we moved to Botswana,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.616
I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.216
and nothing else.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.936
So I was being introduced to my new home,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.216
my new cultural identity,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.256
as a complete outsider,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.536
incapable of comprehending
anything that was being said to me

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.976
by the family and country whose traditions
I was meant to move forward.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.216
But very soon, I would shed SiSwati.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.496
And when I would go back to Swaziland,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.120
I would be constantly confronted
by how very non-Swazi I was becoming.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.496
Add to that my entry
into Africa's private school system,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.160
whose entire purpose
is to beat the Africanness out of you,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.680
and I would have
a very peculiar adolescence.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.096
But I think that my interest
in ideas of identity was born here,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.376
in the strange intersection
of belonging to two places at once

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.496
but not really belonging
to either one very well

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.720
and belonging to this vast space
in between and around simultaneously.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.760
I became obsessed with the idea
of a shared African identity.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.336
Since then, I have continued
to read about politics

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.776
and geography and identity
and what all those things mean.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.536
I've also held on to a deep curiosity
about African philosophies.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.816
When I began to read,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.256
I gravitated towards the works
of black intellectuals

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.736
like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.576
who tackled complex ideas

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.656
like decolonization
and black consciousness.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.896
And when I thought, at 14,
that I had digested these grand ideas,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.976
I moved on to the speeches
of iconic African statesmen

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.016
like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.456
and Congo's Patrice Lumumba.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.856
I read every piece of African fiction
that I could get my hands on.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.536
So when Twitter came,

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.736
I hopped on with the enthusiasm
of a teenage girl

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.240
whose friends are super, super bored
of hearing about all this random stuff.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.616
The year was 2011

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.696
and all over southern Africa
and the whole continent,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.616
affordable data packages
for smartphones and Internet surfing

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.456
became much easier to get.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.936
So my generation, we were sending
messages to each other on this platform

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.416
that just needed 140 characters
and a little bit of creativity.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.856
On long commutes to work,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.336
in lectures that some of us
should have been paying attention to,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.936
on our lunch breaks,

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.976
we would communicate as much as we could

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.200
about the everyday realities
of being young and African.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.376
But of course, this luxury
was not available to everybody.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.096
So this meant that if you were
a teenage girl in Botswana

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.176
and you wanted
to have fun on the Internet,

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.856
one, you had to tweet in English.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.656
Two, you had to follow more than just
the three other people you knew online.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.736
You had to follow South Africans,
Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.536
And suddenly, your whole world opened up.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.896
And my whole world did open up.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.736
I followed vibrant Africans
who were travelling around the continent,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.216
taking pictures of themselves

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.336
and posting them
under the hashtag #myafrica.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.816
Because at that time,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.896
if you were to search Africa
on Twitter or on Google

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.176
or any kind of social media,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.976
you would think that the entire continent
was just pictures of animals

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.496
and white guys drinking cocktails
in hotel resorts.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.776
(Laughter)

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.336
But Africans were using this platform

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.416
to take some kind of ownership
of the tourism sectors.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.456
It was Africans taking selfies
on the beaches of Nigeria.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.440
It was Africans
in cocktail bars in Nairobi.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.517
And these were the same Africans
that I began to meet

00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:19.976
in my own travels around the continent.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.976
We would discuss African literature,
politics, economic policy.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.136
But almost invariably, every single time,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.520
we would end up discussing Twitter.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.600
And that's when I realized what this was.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.416
We were standing in the middle
of something amazing,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.736
because for the first time ever

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.816
young Africans could discuss
the future of our continent in real time,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.240
without the restriction of borders,
finances and watchful governments.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.655
Because the little known truth is

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:56.536
many Africans know a lot less
about other African countries

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.640
than some Westerners
might know about Africa as a whole.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.736
This is by accident,

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.896
but sometimes, it's by design.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.856
For example, in apartheid South Africa,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.376
black South Africans
were constantly being bombarded

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.496
with this message that any country
ruled by black people

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.496
was destined for failure.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.056
And this was done to convince them

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.736
that they were much better off
under crushing white rule

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.120
than they were living
in a black and free nation.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.856
Add to that Africa's colonial,
archaic education system,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.856
which has been unthinkingly
carried over from the 1920s --

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.176
and at the age of 15,
I could name all the various causes

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.256
of the wars that had happened
in Europe in the past 200 years,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.120
but I couldn't name the president
of my neighboring country.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.496
And to me, this doesn't make any sense

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.536
because whether we like it or not,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.200
the fates of African people
are deeply intertwined.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.176
When disaster hits, when turmoil hits,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.336
we share the consequences.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.336
When Burundians flee political turmoil,

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.696
they go to us,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.736
to other African countries.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.520
Africa has six of the world's
largest refugee centers.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.976
What was once a Burundian problem

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.016
becomes an African problem.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.616
So to me, there are no Sudanese problems

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.056
or South African problems
or Kenyan problems,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.656
only African problems

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.000
because eventually, we share the turmoil.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.336
So if we share the problems,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.600
why aren't we doing a better job
of sharing the successes?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.416
How can we do that?

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.696
Well, in the long term,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.576
we can shoot towards
increasing inter-African trade,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.136
removing borders
and putting pressure on leaders

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.560
to fulfill regional agreements
they've already signed.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.336
But I think that the biggest way
for Africa to share its successes

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.800
is to foster something
I like to call social Pan-Africanism.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.176
Now, political Pan-Africanism
already exists,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.800
so I'm not inventing anything
totally new here.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.936
But political Pan-Africanism

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.496
is usually the African unity
of the political elite.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.856
And who does that benefit?

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.640
Well, African leaders, almost exclusively.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.176
No, what I'm talking about

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.280
is the Pan-Africanism
of the ordinary African.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.896
Young Africans like me,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.896
we are bursting with creative energy,

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.416
with innovative ideas.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.816
But with bad governance
and shaky institutions,

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.496
all of this potential could go to waste.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.056
On a continent where more
than a handful of leaders

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.936
have been in power longer

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.360
than the majority
of the populations has been alive,

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.160
we are in desperate need of something new,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.480
something that works.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.960
And I think that thing
is social Pan-Africanism.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.696
My dream is that young Africans

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.256
stop allowing borders and circumstance
to suffocate our innovation.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.616
My dream is that when a young African
comes up with something brilliant,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.056
they don't say, "Well,
this wouldn't work in my country,"

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.496
and then give up.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.176
My dream is that young Africans
begin to realize

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.520
that the entire continent
is our canvas, is our home.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.256
Using the Internet,
we can begin to think collaboratively,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.856
we can begin to innovate together.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.456
In Africa, we say,
"If you want to go fast, you go alone,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.336
but if you want to go far,
you go together."

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:38.120
And I believe that social Pan-Africanism
is how we can go far together.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.496
And this is already happening.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.496
Access to these online networks
has given young Africans

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.896
something we've always
had to violently take: a voice.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.816
We now have a platform.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.776
Before now, if you wanted
to hear from the youth in Africa,

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.536
you waited for the 65-year-old
minister of youth --

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.856
(Laughter)

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.400
to wake up in the morning,

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.040
take his heartburn medication

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.256
and then tell you the plans
he has for your generation

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.760
in 20 years time.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.336
Before now, if you wanted to be heard
by your possibly tyrannical government,

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.736
you were pushed to protest,
suffer the consequences

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.416
and have your fingers crossed

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.960
that some Western paper somewhere
might make someone care.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.376
But now we have opportunities
to back each other up

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.616
in ways we never could before.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.376
We support South African students

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.016
who are marching against
ridiculously high tertiary fees.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.376
We support Zimbabwean women
who are marching to parliament.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.840
We support Angolan journalists
who are being illegally detained.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.696
For the first time ever,

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.176
African pain and African aspiration

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.496
has the ability to be witnessed

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.136
by those who can empathize
with it the most:

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.440
other Africans.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.856
I believe that with
a social Pan-Africanist thinking

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.920
and using the Internet as a tool,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.776
we can begin to rescue each other,

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.376
and ultimately, to rescue ourselves.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.616
Thank you.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:21.548
(Applause)
