00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.565
One billion people in the world today

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:17.845
do not have access to all-season roads.

00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:19.550
One billion people.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.721
One seventh of the Earth's population

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:25.030
are totally cut off for some part of the year.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.358
We cannot get medicine to them reliably,

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:29.704
they cannot get critical supplies,

00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:31.693
and they cannot get their goods to market

00:00:31.693 --> 00:00:35.583
in order to create a sustainable income.

00:00:35.583 --> 00:00:37.727
In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance,

00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:41.640
85 percent of roads are unusable in the wet season.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.659
Investments are being made,

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.204
but at the current level,

00:00:45.204 --> 00:00:46.601
it's estimated it's going to take them

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:49.707
50 years to catch up.

00:00:49.707 --> 00:00:52.001
In the U.S. alone, there's more than four million

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.132
miles of roads, very expensive to build,

00:00:55.132 --> 00:00:58.503
very expensive to maintain infrastructure,

00:00:58.503 --> 00:01:00.772
with a huge ecological footprint,

00:01:00.772 --> 00:01:04.444
and yet, very often, congested.

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:06.826
So we saw this and we thought,

00:01:06.826 --> 00:01:08.309
can there be a better way?

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:11.764
Can we create a system using today's
most advanced technologies

00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:14.884
that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog

00:01:14.884 --> 00:01:17.239
in the same way they've done with mobile telephones

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:19.114
in the last 10 years?

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:22.059
Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:25.036
without ever putting copper lines in the ground.

00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:28.386
Could we do the same for transportation?

00:01:28.386 --> 00:01:30.701
Imagine this scenario.

00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:33.859
Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali,

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.089
and have a newborn in need of urgent medication.

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:39.321
What would you do today?

00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:41.718
Well, you would place a request via mobile phone,

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:44.582
and someone would get the request immediately.

00:01:44.582 --> 00:01:46.575
That's the part that works.

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:48.612
The medication may take days to arrive, though,

00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:50.022
because of bad roads.

00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:52.378
That's the part that's broken.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.895
We believe we can deliver it within hours

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:57.476
with an electric autonomous flying vehicle

00:01:57.476 --> 00:01:58.881
such as this.

00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:01.766
This can transport a small payload
today, about two kilograms,

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:04.400
over a short distance, about 10 kilometers,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.755
but it's part of a wider network that may cover

00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:10.715
the entire country, maybe even the entire continent.

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:15.053
It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.

00:02:15.053 --> 00:02:17.988
It's a network for a transportation of matter.

00:02:17.988 --> 00:02:19.765
We call it Matternet.

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.279
We use three key technologies.

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.914
The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles.

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:26.625
The second is automated ground stations

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:28.604
that the vehicles fly in and out of

00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:30.862
to swap batteries and fly farther,

00:02:30.862 --> 00:02:32.604
or pick up or deliver loads.

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:34.335
And the third is the operating system

00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:37.078
that manages the whole network.

00:02:37.078 --> 00:02:40.417
Let's look at each one of those
technologies in a bit more detail.

00:02:40.417 --> 00:02:42.662
First of all, the UAVs.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.746
Eventually, we're going to be
using all sorts of vehicles

00:02:44.746 --> 00:02:47.200
for different payload capacities and different ranges.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.456
Today, we're using small quads.

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:51.799
These are able to transport two kilograms

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.612
over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes.

00:02:54.612 --> 00:02:57.138
Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road

00:02:57.138 --> 00:02:58.552
in the developing world,

00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:00.772
or even being stuck in traffic

00:03:00.772 --> 00:03:02.817
in a developed world country.

00:03:02.817 --> 00:03:04.527
These fly autonomously.

00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:06.083
This is the key to the technology.

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:08.443
So they use GPS and other sensors on board

00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:12.137
to navigate between ground stations.

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:14.562
Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic

00:03:14.562 --> 00:03:17.600
payload and battery exchange mechanism,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.006
so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations,

00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:22.122
they dock, swap a battery automatically,

00:03:22.122 --> 00:03:23.826
and go out again.

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:26.582
The ground stations are located on safe locations

00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:28.144
on the ground.

00:03:28.144 --> 00:03:30.143
They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission,

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:31.997
which is the landing.

00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:34.089
They are at known locations on the ground,

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:36.009
so the paths between them are also known,

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.747
which is very important from a reliability perspective

00:03:38.747 --> 00:03:40.298
from the whole network.

00:03:40.298 --> 00:03:43.122
Apart from fulfilling the energy
requirements of the vehicles,

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.494
eventually they're going to be becoming

00:03:45.494 --> 00:03:48.194
commercial hubs where people can take out loads

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:51.257
or put loads into the network.

00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:53.480
The last component is the operating system

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.374
that manages the whole network.

00:03:55.374 --> 00:03:58.115
It monitors weather data from all the ground stations

00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:01.456
and optimizes the routes of
the vehicles through the system

00:04:01.456 --> 00:04:04.047
to avoid adverse weather conditions,

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:06.050
avoid other risk factors,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.770
and optimize the use of the resources

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.668
throughout the network.

00:04:09.668 --> 00:04:11.310
I want to show you what one of those flights

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.078
looks like.

00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:17.020
Here we are flying in Haiti last summer,

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.463
where we've done our first field trials.

00:04:19.463 --> 00:04:21.607
We're modeling here a medical delivery

00:04:21.607 --> 00:04:26.447
in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake.

00:04:26.447 --> 00:04:28.998
People there love this.

00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:31.127
And I want to show you

00:04:31.127 --> 00:04:36.003
what one of those vehicles looks like up close.

00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:38.011
So this is a $3,000 vehicle.

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:42.028
Costs are coming down very rapidly.

00:04:42.028 --> 00:04:45.203
We use this in all sorts of weather conditions,

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:46.998
very hot and very cold climates,

00:04:46.998 --> 00:04:53.096
very strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles.

00:04:53.096 --> 00:04:57.115
Imagine if your life depended on this package,

00:04:57.115 --> 00:04:58.559
somewhere in Africa

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:02.822
or in New York City, after Sandy.

00:05:02.822 --> 00:05:06.128
The next big question is, what's the cost?

00:05:06.128 --> 00:05:09.938
Well, it turns out that the cost to transport

00:05:09.938 --> 00:05:13.897
two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:17.270
is just 24 cents.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.342
(Applause)

00:05:22.342 --> 00:05:25.086
And it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy

00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:27.075
expended for the flight is only two cents

00:05:27.075 --> 00:05:28.413
of a dollar today,

00:05:28.413 --> 00:05:30.546
and we're just at the beginning of this.

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:33.148
When we saw this, we felt that this is something

00:05:33.148 --> 00:05:36.147
that can have significant impact in the world.

00:05:36.147 --> 00:05:38.565
So we said, okay, how much does it cost

00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:40.633
to set up a network somewhere in the world?

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:42.663
And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho

00:05:42.663 --> 00:05:45.704
for transportation of HIV/AIDS samples.

00:05:45.704 --> 00:05:48.111
The problem there is how do you take them

00:05:48.111 --> 00:05:50.340
from clinics where they're being collected

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.360
to hospitals where they're being analyzed?

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.502
And we said, what if we wanted to cover an area

00:05:55.502 --> 00:05:58.159
spanning around 140 square kilometers?

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.633
That's roughly one and a half times
the size of Manhattan.

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:03.800
Well it turns out that the cost to do that there

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.775
would be less than a million dollars.

00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:10.006
Compare this to normal infrastructure investments.

00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:13.163
We think this can be -- this is the power

00:06:13.163 --> 00:06:15.882
of a new paradigm.

00:06:15.882 --> 00:06:18.365
So here we are: a new idea

00:06:18.365 --> 00:06:20.235
about a network for transportation

00:06:20.235 --> 00:06:22.881
that is based on the ideas of the Internet.

00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.110
It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.813
it's bidirectional, highly adaptable,

00:06:27.813 --> 00:06:30.323
with very low infrastructure investment,

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:34.456
very low ecological footprint.

00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:36.740
If it is a new paradigm, though,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.886
there must be other uses for it.

00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:41.052
It can be used perhaps in other places in the world.

00:06:41.052 --> 00:06:45.230
So let's look at the other end of the spectrum:

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.235
our cities and megacities.

00:06:47.235 --> 00:06:50.107
Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today.

00:06:50.107 --> 00:06:52.827
Half a billion of us live in megacities.

00:06:52.827 --> 00:06:55.507
We are living through an amazing urbanization trend.

00:06:55.507 --> 00:06:57.480
China alone is adding a megacity

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.587
the size of New York City every two years.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.240
These are places that do have road infrastructure,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.554
but it's very inefficient.

00:07:05.554 --> 00:07:07.686
Congestion is a huge problem.

00:07:07.686 --> 00:07:09.626
So we think it makes sense in those places

00:07:09.626 --> 00:07:11.996
to set up a network of transportation

00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:14.162
that is a new layer that sits between the road

00:07:14.162 --> 00:07:15.433
and the Internet,

00:07:15.433 --> 00:07:18.339
initially for lightweight, urgent stuff,

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:20.388
and over time, we would hope to develop this

00:07:20.388 --> 00:07:22.380
into a new mode of transportation

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.832
that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.

00:07:25.832 --> 00:07:27.386
It's ultimately scalable

00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:30.244
with a very small ecological footprint,

00:07:30.244 --> 00:07:33.220
operating in the background 24/7,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.566
just like the Internet.

00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:37.988
So when we started this

00:07:37.988 --> 00:07:40.990
a couple of years ago now,

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.334
we've had a lot of people come up to us who said,

00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:46.166
"This is a very interesting but crazy idea,

00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:48.000
and certainly not something that you should

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.714
engage with anytime soon."

00:07:50.714 --> 00:07:52.857
And of course, we're talking about drones, right,

00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:56.559
a technology that's not only unpopular in the West

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.507
but one that has become a very, very unpleasant

00:07:58.507 --> 00:08:01.372
fact of life for many living in poor countries,

00:08:01.372 --> 00:08:04.183
especially those engaged in conflict.

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:08.717
So why are we doing this?

00:08:08.717 --> 00:08:11.501
Well, we chose to do this one

00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:13.287
not because it's easy,

00:08:13.287 --> 00:08:16.122
but because it can have amazing impact.

00:08:16.122 --> 00:08:18.947
Imagine one billion people being connected

00:08:18.947 --> 00:08:21.342
to physical goods in the same way

00:08:21.342 --> 00:08:24.366
that mobile telecommunications connected them

00:08:24.366 --> 00:08:26.458
to information.

00:08:26.458 --> 00:08:30.198
Imagine if the next big network we built in the world

00:08:30.198 --> 00:08:33.961
was a network for the transportation of matter.

00:08:33.961 --> 00:08:36.363
In the developing world, we would hope

00:08:36.363 --> 00:08:39.068
to reach millions of people with better vaccines,

00:08:39.068 --> 00:08:40.952
reach them with better medication.

00:08:40.952 --> 00:08:42.810
It would give us an unfair advantage against battling

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.802
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.

00:08:46.802 --> 00:08:48.498
Over time, we would hope it would become

00:08:48.498 --> 00:08:50.672
a new platform for economic transactions,

00:08:50.672 --> 00:08:53.133
lifting millions of people out of poverty.

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:55.343
In the developed world and the emerging world,

00:08:55.343 --> 00:08:56.811
we would hope it would become a new mode

00:08:56.811 --> 00:09:00.532
of transportation that could help make our cities

00:09:00.532 --> 00:09:02.385
more livable.

00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:05.728
So for those that still believe
that this is science fiction,

00:09:05.728 --> 00:09:08.543
I firmly say to you that it is not.

00:09:08.543 --> 00:09:10.212
We do need to engage, though,

00:09:10.212 --> 00:09:13.280
in social fiction to make it happen.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.447
Thank you.

00:09:15.447 --> 00:09:19.447
(Applause)
