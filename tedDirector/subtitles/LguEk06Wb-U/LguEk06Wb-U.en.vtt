00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.330
If you're at all like me,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco:

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
you build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
capable of more than 30 knots.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
and it can do amazing things.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
And one day, a vessel not unlike this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
will probably break the world speed record.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
But kites aren't just toys like this.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
Kites: I'm going to give you a brief history,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.330
and tell you about the magnificent future

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
of every child's favorite plaything.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
So, kites are more than a thousand years old,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
and the Chinese used them for military applications,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.330
and even for lifting men.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
I'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
(Laughter)

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
In 1827, a fellow called George Pocock

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.330
in races against horse carriages across the English countryside.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
Then of course, at the dawn of aviation,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
all of the great inventors of the time --

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
like Hargreaves, like Langley,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
even Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, who was flying this kite --

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
were doing so in the pursuit of aviation.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
Then these two fellows came along,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
and they were flying kites to develop the control systems

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
that would ultimately enable powered human flight.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
So this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
and the Wright Flyer.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
And their experiments with kites led to this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
momentous occasion, where we powered up and took off for the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
first-ever 12-second human flight.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.330
And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.330
But unfortunately, it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.330
That was until the 1970s, where we had the last energy crisis.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.330
in the Journal of Energy

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.330
about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
to generate enormous amounts of electricity.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
The real key observation he made is that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.330
a free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.330
in a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.330
So turbines grew. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
but they can't really go a lot higher,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
and more height is where the more wind is, and more power --

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
as much as twice as much.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
So cut to now. We still have an energy crisis,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
and now we have a climate crisis as well. You know,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
so humans generate about 12 trillion watts,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
or 12 terawatts, from fossil fuels.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.330
And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.330
and in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.330
we have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.330
Wind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar:

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
3600 terawatts, more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.330
The majority of it is in the higher altitudes, above 300 feet,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.330
where we don't have a technology as yet to get there.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
So this is the dawn of the new age of kites.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.330
This is our test site on Maui, flying across the sky.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
I'm now going to show you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
the first autonomous generation of power

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
by every child's favorite plaything.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.330
As you can tell, you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
It makes you a little nauseous.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
And here we're actually generating about 10 kilowatts --

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
so, enough to power probably five United States households --

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
with a kite not much larger than this piano.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
And the real significant thing here

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
is we're developing the control systems,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.330
as did the Wright brothers, that would enable sustained, long-duration flight.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.330
And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow --

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
that's tracing your name in the sky.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
And this is where we're actually going.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
So we're beyond the 12-second steps.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
And we're working towards megawatt-scale machines

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.330
that fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
So you ask, how big are those machines?

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
Well, this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop!

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
That would be enough to power your cell phone.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
Your Cessna would be 230 killowatts.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.330
If you'd loan me your Gulfstream, I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
If you give me a 747, I'll make six megawatts,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
which is more than the largest wind turbines today.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
So that is audacious, you say. I agree.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
But audacious is what has happened many times before in history.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
This is a refrigerator factory,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
churning out airplanes for World War II.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
Prior to World War II, they were making 1000 planes a year.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
By 1945, they were making 100,000.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
With this factory and 100,000 planes a year,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.330
we could make all of America's electricity in about 10 years.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
So really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
with these dreams. There are many of us.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
I am lucky enough to work with 30 of them.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
And I think we need to support all of the dreams

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
of the kids out there doing these crazy things.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.330
Thank you.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.330
(Applause)
