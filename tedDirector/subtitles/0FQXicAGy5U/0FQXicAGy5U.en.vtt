00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:14.405
I'm very pleased to be here today

00:00:14.405 --> 00:00:16.959
to talk to you all about how we might repair

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:18.995
the damaged brain,

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:21.237
and I'm particularly excited by this field,

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:23.722
because as a neurologist myself,

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.523
I believe that this offers one of the great ways

00:00:25.523 --> 00:00:27.455
that we might be able to offer hope

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:30.028
for patients who today live with devastating

00:00:30.028 --> 00:00:33.986
and yet untreatable diseases of the brain.

00:00:33.986 --> 00:00:36.076
So here's the problem.

00:00:36.076 --> 00:00:38.876
You can see here the picture of somebody's brain

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:40.408
with Alzheimer's disease

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:42.327
next to a healthy brain,

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:44.943
and what's obvious is, in the Alzheimer's brain,

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:49.661
ringed red, there's obvious
damage -- atrophy, scarring.

00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:51.378
And I could show you equivalent pictures

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:53.605
from other disease: multiple sclerosis,

00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:56.123
motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease,

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:58.260
even Huntington's disease,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.229
and they would all tell a similar story.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.369
And collectively these brain disorders represent

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.935
one of the major public health threats of our time.

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:11.183
And the numbers here are really rather staggering.

00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:14.375
At any one time, there are 35 million people today

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:17.332
living with one of these brain diseases,

00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:19.871
and the annual cost globally

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.891
is 700 billion dollars.

00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:23.753
I mean, just think about that.

00:01:23.753 --> 00:01:25.240
That's greater than one percent

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.986
of the global GDP.

00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:29.892
And it gets worse,

00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:32.054
because all these numbers are rising

00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:33.512
because these are by and large

00:01:33.512 --> 00:01:36.700
age-related diseases, and we're living longer.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.095
So the question we really need to ask ourselves is,

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:43.092
why, given the devastating impact of these diseases

00:01:43.092 --> 00:01:44.572
to the individual,

00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:47.325
never mind the scale of the societal problem,

00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:50.906
why are there no effective treatments?

00:01:50.906 --> 00:01:52.884
Now in order to consider this,

00:01:52.884 --> 00:01:55.167
I first need to give you a crash course

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:57.492
in how the brain works.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.378
So in other words, I need to tell you

00:01:59.378 --> 00:02:01.434
everything I learned at medical school.

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:03.474
(Laughter)

00:02:03.474 --> 00:02:05.712
But believe me, this isn't going to take very long.

00:02:05.712 --> 00:02:08.167
Okay? (Laughter)

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:10.136
So the brain is terribly simple:

00:02:10.136 --> 00:02:13.183
it's made up of four cells,

00:02:13.183 --> 00:02:14.985
and two of them are shown here.

00:02:14.985 --> 00:02:16.498
There's the nerve cell,

00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:18.038
and then there's the myelinating cell,

00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:19.536
or the insulating cell.

00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:22.026
It's called oligodendrocyte.

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:23.815
And when these four cells work together

00:02:23.815 --> 00:02:25.674
in health and harmony,

00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:29.642
they create an extraordinary
symphony of electrical activity,

00:02:29.642 --> 00:02:31.882
and it is this electrical activity

00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:35.255
that underpins our ability to think, to emote,

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.599
to remember, to learn, move, feel and so on.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.940
But equally, each of these individual four cells

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.030
alone or together, can go rogue or die,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.275
and when that happens, you get damage.

00:02:49.275 --> 00:02:50.490
You get damaged wiring.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.554
You get disrupted connections.

00:02:53.554 --> 00:02:57.712
And that's evident here with the slower conduction.

00:02:57.712 --> 00:03:00.175
But ultimately, this damage will manifest

00:03:00.175 --> 00:03:02.657
as disease, clearly.

00:03:02.657 --> 00:03:05.755
And if the starting dying nerve cell

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:07.571
is a motor nerve, for example,

00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:09.986
you'll get motor neuron disease.

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:12.609
So I'd like to give you a real-life illustration

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.017
of what happens with motor neuron disease.

00:03:16.017 --> 00:03:18.546
So this is a patient of mine called John.

00:03:18.546 --> 00:03:21.559
John I saw just last week in the clinic.

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:25.183
And I've asked John to tell us something 
about what were his problems

00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:27.082
that led to the initial diagnosis

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:28.721
of motor neuron disease.

00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:33.670
John: I was diagnosed in October in 2011,

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.250
and the main problem was a breathing problem,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.943
difficulty breathing.

00:03:38.943 --> 00:03:41.203
Siddharthan Chandran: I don't know if you
caught all of that, but what John was telling us

00:03:41.203 --> 00:03:43.443
was that difficulty with breathing

00:03:43.443 --> 00:03:45.537
led eventually to the diagnosis

00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:48.390
of motor neuron disease.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.954
So John's now 18 months
further down in that journey,

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:54.187
and I've now asked him to tell us something about

00:03:54.187 --> 00:03:56.476
his current predicament.

00:03:56.476 --> 00:03:59.336
John: What I've got now is 
the breathing's gotten worse.

00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:05.033
I've got weakness in my hands, 
my arms and my legs.

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:09.853
So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time.

00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:12.679
SC: John's just told us he's in a wheelchair

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:14.803
most of the time.

00:04:14.803 --> 00:04:17.021
So what these two clips show

00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:19.777
is not just the devastating
consequence of the disease,

00:04:19.777 --> 00:04:21.320
but they also tell us something about

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.620
the shocking pace of the disease,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.932
because in just 18 months,

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:29.628
a fit adult man has been rendered

00:04:29.628 --> 00:04:32.959
wheelchair- and respirator-dependent.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:35.264
And let's face it, John could be anybody's father,

00:04:35.264 --> 00:04:37.451
brother or friend.

00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:39.704
So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies.

00:04:39.704 --> 00:04:44.304
But what happens when that myelin cell dies?

00:04:44.304 --> 00:04:46.524
You get multiple sclerosis.

00:04:46.524 --> 00:04:48.343
So the scan on your left

00:04:48.343 --> 00:04:51.066
is an illustration of the brain,

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:53.917
and it's a map of the connections of the brain,

00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:55.884
and superimposed upon which

00:04:55.884 --> 00:04:57.258
are areas of damage.

00:04:57.258 --> 00:04:59.449
We call them lesions of demyelination.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.281
But they're damage, and they're white.

00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:03.796
So I know what you're thinking here.

00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:06.304
You're thinking, "My God, this bloke came up

00:05:06.304 --> 00:05:08.235
and said he's going to talk about hope,

00:05:08.235 --> 00:05:10.744
and all he's done is give a really rather bleak

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:12.308
and depressing tale."

00:05:12.308 --> 00:05:13.903
I've told you these diseases are terrible.

00:05:13.903 --> 00:05:16.564
They're devastating, numbers are rising,

00:05:16.564 --> 00:05:18.691
the costs are ridiculous, and worst of all,

00:05:18.691 --> 00:05:20.977
we have no treatment. Where's the hope?

00:05:20.977 --> 00:05:23.522
Well, you know what? I think there is hope.

00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:25.916
And there's hope in this next section,

00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:28.211
of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.,

00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:29.739
because what it illustrates

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:32.212
is, amazingly, the brain can repair itself.

00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:34.790
It just doesn't do it well enough.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.915
And so again, there are two
things I want to show you.

00:05:36.915 --> 00:05:40.341
First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S.

00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:43.824
And again, it's another one of these white masses.

00:05:43.824 --> 00:05:47.262
But crucially, the area that's ringed red

00:05:47.262 --> 00:05:49.485
highlights an area that is pale blue.

00:05:49.485 --> 00:05:52.311
But that area that is pale blue was once white.

00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:55.922
So it was damaged. It's now repaired.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:58.684
Just to be clear: It's not because of doctors.

00:05:58.684 --> 00:06:01.001
It's in spite of doctors, not because of doctors.

00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:03.184
This is spontaneous repair.

00:06:03.184 --> 00:06:04.732
It's amazing and it's occurred

00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:07.946
because there are stem cells in the brain, even,

00:06:07.946 --> 00:06:11.120
which can enable new myelin, new insulation,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.449
to be laid down over the damaged nerves.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.936
And this observation is important for two reasons.

00:06:17.936 --> 00:06:21.176
The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies

00:06:21.176 --> 00:06:22.805
that we learnt at medical school,

00:06:22.805 --> 00:06:26.425
or at least I did, admittedly last century,

00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:28.996
which is that the brain doesn't repair itself,

00:06:28.996 --> 00:06:32.117
unlike, say, the bone or the liver.

00:06:32.117 --> 00:06:35.616
But actually it does, but it
just doesn't do it well enough.

00:06:35.616 --> 00:06:37.258
And the second thing it does,

00:06:37.258 --> 00:06:41.233
and it gives us a very clear direction 
of travel for new therapies --

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:42.952
I mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist

00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:44.472
to know what to do here.

00:06:44.472 --> 00:06:47.405
You simply need to find ways of promoting

00:06:47.405 --> 00:06:51.929
the endogenous, spontaneous
repair that occurs anyway.

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:54.386
So the question is, why, if we've known that

00:06:54.386 --> 00:06:56.343
for some time, as we have,

00:06:56.343 --> 00:07:00.637
why do we not have those treatments?

00:07:00.637 --> 00:07:02.756
And that in part reflects the complexity

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:05.367
of drug development.

00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:07.401
Now, drug development you might think of

00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:10.125
as a rather expensive but risky bet,

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:12.078
and the odds of this bet are roughly this:

00:07:12.078 --> 00:07:14.675
they're 10,000 to one against,

00:07:14.675 --> 00:07:17.480
because you need to screen
about 10,000 compounds

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.551
to find that one potential winner.

00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.468
And then you need to spend 15 years

00:07:21.468 --> 00:07:22.966
and spend over a billion dollars,

00:07:22.966 --> 00:07:26.109
and even then, you may not have a winner.

00:07:26.109 --> 00:07:27.788
So the question for us is,

00:07:27.788 --> 00:07:29.379
can you change the rules of the game

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:31.928
and can you shorten the odds?

00:07:31.928 --> 00:07:33.972
And in order to do that, you have to think,

00:07:33.972 --> 00:07:36.802
where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery?

00:07:36.802 --> 00:07:39.915
And one of the bottlenecks is 
early in drug discovery.

00:07:39.915 --> 00:07:43.877
All that screening occurs in animal models.

00:07:43.877 --> 00:07:47.336
But we know that the proper 
study of mankind is man,

00:07:47.336 --> 00:07:49.440
to borrow from Alexander Pope.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.811
So the question is, can we study these diseases

00:07:51.811 --> 00:07:54.199
using human material?

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:56.262
And of course, absolutely we can.

00:07:56.262 --> 00:07:57.791
We can use stem cells,

00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:00.591
and specifically we can use human stem cells.

00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:02.695
And human stem cells are these extraordinary

00:08:02.695 --> 00:08:05.097
but simple cells that can do two things:

00:08:05.097 --> 00:08:07.891
they can self-renew or make more of themselves,

00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:09.949
but they can also become specialized

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:12.548
to make bone, liver or, crucially, nerve cells,

00:08:12.548 --> 00:08:14.388
maybe even the motor nerve cell

00:08:14.388 --> 00:08:16.548
or the myelin cell.

00:08:16.548 --> 00:08:18.069
And the challenge has long been,

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:20.041
can we harness the power,

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.326
the undoubted power of these stem cells

00:08:22.326 --> 00:08:24.344
in order to realize their promise

00:08:24.344 --> 00:08:25.971
for regenerative neurology?

00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:28.900
And I think we can now, and the reason we can

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.808
is because there have been
several major discoveries

00:08:31.808 --> 00:08:33.545
in the last 10, 20 years.

00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:35.157
One of them was here in Edinburgh,

00:08:35.157 --> 00:08:39.269
and it must be the only celebrity sheep, Dolly.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:40.894
So Dolly was made in Edinburgh,

00:08:40.894 --> 00:08:42.577
and Dolly was an example

00:08:42.577 --> 00:08:45.791
of the first cloning of a mammal

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:47.739
from an adult cell.

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:50.544
But I think the even more significant breakthrough

00:08:50.544 --> 00:08:53.466
for the purposes of our discussion today

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:55.955
was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist

00:08:55.955 --> 00:08:57.552
called Yamanaka.

00:08:57.552 --> 00:08:58.856
And what Yamaka did,

00:08:58.856 --> 00:09:01.288
in a fantastic form of scientific cookery,

00:09:01.288 --> 00:09:03.326
was he showed that four ingredients,

00:09:03.326 --> 00:09:05.189
just four ingredients,

00:09:05.189 --> 00:09:08.376
could effectively convert any cell, adult cell,

00:09:08.376 --> 00:09:10.618
into a master stem cell.

00:09:10.618 --> 00:09:13.602
And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate,

00:09:13.602 --> 00:09:15.842
because what it means that
from anybody in this room,

00:09:15.842 --> 00:09:17.646
but particularly patients,

00:09:17.646 --> 00:09:18.977
you could now generate

00:09:18.977 --> 00:09:21.703
a bespoke, personalized tissue repair kit.

00:09:21.703 --> 00:09:24.651
Take a skin cell, make it a master pluripotent cell,

00:09:24.651 --> 00:09:26.390
so you could then make those cells

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.829
that are relevant to their disease,

00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:31.471
both to study but potentially to treat.

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.533
Now, the idea of that at medical school --

00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:36.158
this is a recurring theme, isn't 
it, me and medical school? —

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:37.976
would have been ridiculous,

00:09:37.976 --> 00:09:40.035
but it's an absolute reality today.

00:09:40.035 --> 00:09:42.169
And I see this as the cornerstone

00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:45.346
of regeneration, repair and hope.

00:09:45.346 --> 00:09:47.296
And whilst we're on the theme of hope,

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:49.437
for those of you who might have failed at school,

00:09:49.437 --> 00:09:51.662
there's hope for you as well,

00:09:51.662 --> 00:09:54.158
because this is the school report of John Gerdon.

00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:55.370
["I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist;
on his present showing this is quite ridiculous."]

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.806
So they didn't think much of him then.

00:09:56.806 --> 00:09:59.664
But what you may not know is that he 
got the Nobel Prize for medicine

00:09:59.664 --> 00:10:02.216
just three months ago.

00:10:02.216 --> 00:10:04.782
So to return to the original problem,

00:10:04.782 --> 00:10:06.925
what is the opportunity of these stem cells,

00:10:06.925 --> 00:10:08.586
or this disruptive technology,

00:10:08.586 --> 00:10:10.140
for repairing the damaged brain,

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.271
which we call regenerative neurology?

00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:14.698
I think there are two ways you can think about this:

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:18.146
as a fantastic 21st-century drug discovery tool,

00:10:18.146 --> 00:10:20.963
and/or as a form of therapy.

00:10:20.963 --> 00:10:22.990
So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.439
in the next few moments.

00:10:25.439 --> 00:10:27.470
Drug discovery in a dish is how people often

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.700
talk about this.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.627
It's very simple: You take a patient with a disease,

00:10:31.627 --> 00:10:33.446
let's say motor neuron disease,

00:10:33.446 --> 00:10:35.203
you take a skin sample,

00:10:35.203 --> 00:10:38.261
you do the pluripotent reprogramming,

00:10:38.261 --> 00:10:40.352
as I've already told you,

00:10:40.352 --> 00:10:42.869
and you generate live motor nerve cells.

00:10:42.869 --> 00:10:44.603
That's straightforward, because that's what

00:10:44.603 --> 00:10:46.340
pluripotent cells can do.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.296
But crucially, you can then compare their behavior

00:10:49.296 --> 00:10:51.719
to their equivalent but healthy counterparts,

00:10:51.719 --> 00:10:53.749
ideally from an unaffected relative.

00:10:53.749 --> 00:10:56.991
That way, you're matching for genetic variation.

00:10:56.991 --> 00:10:59.338
And that's exactly what we did here.

00:10:59.338 --> 00:11:01.261
This was a collaboration with colleagues:

00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:04.784
in London, Chris Shaw; in the U.S., 
Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis.

00:11:04.784 --> 00:11:07.306
And what you're looking at, and this is amazing,

00:11:07.306 --> 00:11:10.106
these are living, growing, motor nerve cells

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:12.349
from a patient with motor neuron disease.

00:11:12.349 --> 00:11:14.274
It happens to be an inherited form.

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:15.973
I mean, just imagine that.

00:11:15.973 --> 00:11:18.454
This would have been unimaginable 10 years ago.

00:11:18.454 --> 00:11:21.808
So apart from seeing them
grow and put out processes,

00:11:21.808 --> 00:11:24.250
we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce,

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.309
but crucially, we can then
track their individual health

00:11:27.309 --> 00:11:29.829
and compare the diseased motor nerve cells

00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:31.701
to the healthy ones.

00:11:31.701 --> 00:11:35.188
And when you do all that and put it together,

00:11:35.188 --> 00:11:37.287
you realize that the diseased ones,

00:11:37.287 --> 00:11:39.075
which is represented in the red line,

00:11:39.075 --> 00:11:42.696
are two and a half times more likely to die

00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:45.401
than the healthy counterpart.

00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:48.044
And the crucial point about this is that you then have

00:11:48.044 --> 00:11:51.633
a fantastic assay to discover drugs,

00:11:51.633 --> 00:11:53.542
because what would you ask of the drugs,

00:11:53.542 --> 00:11:55.303
and you could do this through a high-throughput

00:11:55.303 --> 00:11:57.712
automated screening system,

00:11:57.712 --> 00:12:00.158
you'd ask the drugs, give me one thing:

00:12:00.158 --> 00:12:02.983
find me a drug that will bring the red line

00:12:02.983 --> 00:12:04.873
closer to the blue line,

00:12:04.873 --> 00:12:08.092
because that drug will be a high-value candidate

00:12:08.092 --> 00:12:10.992
that you could probably take direct to human trial

00:12:10.992 --> 00:12:13.579
and almost bypass that bottleneck

00:12:13.579 --> 00:12:15.980
that I've told you about in drug discovery

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.793
with the animal models,

00:12:17.793 --> 00:12:20.446
if that makes sense. It's fantastic.

00:12:20.446 --> 00:12:22.010
But I want to come back

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.059
to how you might use stem cells directly

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:25.834
to repair damage.

00:12:25.834 --> 00:12:27.659
And again there are two ways to think about this,

00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:29.674
and they're not mutually exclusive.

00:12:29.674 --> 00:12:31.964
The first, and I think in the long run

00:12:31.964 --> 00:12:34.193
the one that will give us the biggest dividend,

00:12:34.193 --> 00:12:36.797
but it's not thought of that way just yet,

00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:40.053
is to think about those stem cells that are already

00:12:40.053 --> 00:12:41.893
in your brain, and I've told you that.

00:12:41.893 --> 00:12:43.747
All of us have stem cells in the brain,

00:12:43.747 --> 00:12:45.382
even the diseased brain,

00:12:45.382 --> 00:12:47.000
and surely the smart way forward

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.497
is to find ways that you can promote and activate

00:12:49.497 --> 00:12:51.533
those stem cells in your brain already

00:12:51.533 --> 00:12:54.720
to react and respond appropriately to damage

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.004
to repair it.

00:12:56.004 --> 00:12:57.436
That will be the future.

00:12:57.436 --> 00:13:00.309
There will be drugs that will do that.

00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:04.572
But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells,

00:13:04.572 --> 00:13:06.376
transplant them in,

00:13:06.376 --> 00:13:10.854
to replace dying or lost cells, even in the brain.

00:13:10.854 --> 00:13:12.942
And I want to tell you now an experiment,

00:13:12.942 --> 00:13:14.836
it's a clinical trial that we did,

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.692
which recently completed,

00:13:16.692 --> 00:13:19.209
which is with colleagues in UCL,

00:13:19.209 --> 00:13:21.964
David Miller in particular.

00:13:21.964 --> 00:13:23.877
So this study was very simple.

00:13:23.877 --> 00:13:26.979
We took patients with multiple sclerosis

00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:28.517
and asked a simple question:

00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:30.191
Would stem cells from the bone marrow

00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:31.914
be protective of their nerves?

00:13:31.914 --> 00:13:35.759
So what we did was we took this bone marrow,

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:37.976
grew up the stem cells in the lab,

00:13:37.976 --> 00:13:40.315
and then injected them back into the vein.

00:13:40.315 --> 00:13:42.115
I'm making this sound really simple.

00:13:42.115 --> 00:13:45.222
It took five years off a lot of people, okay?

00:13:45.222 --> 00:13:46.910
And it put gray hair on me

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.391
and caused all kinds of issues.

00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:52.414
But conceptually, it's essentially simple.

00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:55.721
So we've given them into the vein, right?

00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:59.354
So in order to measure whether
this was successful or not,

00:13:59.354 --> 00:14:01.102
we measured the optic nerve

00:14:01.102 --> 00:14:02.788
as our outcome measure.

00:14:02.788 --> 00:14:04.553
And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.,

00:14:04.553 --> 00:14:06.626
because patients with M.S. sadly suffer

00:14:06.626 --> 00:14:08.098
with problems with vision --

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.288
loss of vision, unclear vision.

00:14:10.288 --> 00:14:12.371
And so we measured the size of the optic nerve

00:14:12.371 --> 00:14:14.425
using the scans with David Miller

00:14:14.425 --> 00:14:16.523
three times -- 12 months, six months,

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:18.139
and before the infusion --

00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:21.265
and you can see the gently declining red line.

00:14:21.265 --> 00:14:23.493
And that's telling you that
the optic nerve is shrinking,

00:14:23.493 --> 00:14:25.836
which makes sense, because their nerves are dying.

00:14:25.836 --> 00:14:28.142
We then gave the stem cell infusion

00:14:28.142 --> 00:14:30.243
and repeated the measurement twice --

00:14:30.243 --> 00:14:31.882
three months and six months --

00:14:31.882 --> 00:14:33.855
and to our surprise, almost,

00:14:33.855 --> 00:14:36.011
the line's gone up.

00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:38.542
That suggests that the intervention

00:14:38.542 --> 00:14:40.439
has been protective.

00:14:40.439 --> 00:14:42.356
I don't think myself that what's happened

00:14:42.356 --> 00:14:44.392
is that those stem cells have made new myelin

00:14:44.392 --> 00:14:45.856
or new nerves.

00:14:45.856 --> 00:14:48.001
What I think they've done is they've promoted

00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:50.610
the endogenous stem cells, or precursor cells,

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.061
to do their job, wake up, lay down new myelin.

00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:56.360
So this is a proof of concept.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.985
I'm very excited about that.

00:14:58.985 --> 00:15:01.474
So I just want to end with the theme I began on,

00:15:01.474 --> 00:15:03.464
which was regeneration and hope.

00:15:03.464 --> 00:15:05.234
So here I've asked John

00:15:05.234 --> 00:15:07.532
what his hopes are for the future.

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.286
John: I would hope that

00:15:09.286 --> 00:15:11.086
sometime in the future

00:15:11.086 --> 00:15:13.526
through the research that you people are doing,

00:15:13.526 --> 00:15:15.735
we can come up with a cure

00:15:15.735 --> 00:15:19.559
so that people like me can lead a normal life.

00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:22.154
SC: I mean, that speaks volumes.

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:24.693
But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John --

00:15:24.693 --> 00:15:26.422
thanking John for allowing me to share

00:15:26.422 --> 00:15:29.592
his insights and these clips with you all.

00:15:29.592 --> 00:15:32.127
But I'd also like to add to John and to others

00:15:32.127 --> 00:15:34.704
that my own view is, I'm hopeful for the future.

00:15:34.704 --> 00:15:37.056
I do believe that the disruptive technologies

00:15:37.056 --> 00:15:39.114
like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you

00:15:39.114 --> 00:15:40.935
do offer very real hope.

00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:42.698
And I do think that the day that we might be able

00:15:42.698 --> 00:15:44.134
to repair the damaged brain

00:15:44.134 --> 00:15:45.423
is sooner than we think.

00:15:45.423 --> 00:15:47.226
Thank you.

00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:51.919
(Applause)
