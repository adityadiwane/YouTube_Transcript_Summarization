00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
We are drowning in news.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Reuters alone puts out

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
three and a half million news stories a year.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
That's just one source.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
My question is: How many of those stories

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
are actually going to matter in the long run?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
That's the idea behind The Long News.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
It's a project by The Long Now Foundation,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
which was founded by TEDsters including

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And when you look at the news through that filter,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
a lot falls by the wayside.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
is this going to matter in a decade?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Or this?

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Or this?

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Really?

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Okay, that was kind of cool.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
(Laughter)

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
But the top story of this past year was the economy,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and I'm just betting that, sooner or later,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
this particular recession is going to be old news.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
So, what kind of stories might

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
make a difference for the future?

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Well, let's take science.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Someday, little robots will go

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
through our bloodstreams fixing things.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
That someday is already here if you're a mouse.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Some recent stories:

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom;

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
they're sending genes into the brain;

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
a robot they built that can crawl through the human body.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
What about resources? How are we going to feed nine billion people?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
We're having trouble feeding six billion today.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
What about global politics?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and they may.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and they've started doing DNA tests on kids

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
to choose their careers.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Some recent discoveries:

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
spread to every continent but Antarctica;

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery --

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
soon, science may no longer need us,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
and life may no longer need us either;

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
It seems that with or without us,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
life will go on.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
was this one: water found on the moon.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
And if NASA doesn't do it, China might,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
or somebody in this room might write a big check.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
My point is this:

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
In the long run, some news stories

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
are more important than others.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.260
(Applause)
