00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.344
It's the fifth time I stand on this shore,

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:22.966
the Cuban shore,

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:26.851
looking out at that distant horizon,

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:31.205
believing, again,

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:34.430
that I'm going to make it all the way

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:38.505
across that vast,
dangerous wilderness of an ocean.

00:00:39.547 --> 00:00:41.271
Not only have I tried four times,

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:44.982
but the greatest swimmers in the world
have been trying since 1950,

00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:47.722
and it's still never been done.

00:00:49.378 --> 00:00:52.774
The team is proud of our four attempts.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.860
It's an expedition of some 30 people.

00:00:55.884 --> 00:00:59.838
Bonnie is my best friend and head handler,

00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:03.124
who somehow summons will,

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:06.907
that last drop of will within me,
when I think it's gone,

00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:09.883
after many, many hours and days out there.

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:12.892
The shark experts
are the best in the world --

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:15.334
large predators below.

00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:21.503
The box jellyfish, the deadliest venom
in all of the ocean,

00:01:21.527 --> 00:01:23.103
is in these waters,

00:01:23.127 --> 00:01:26.946
and I have come close to dying from them
on a previous attempt.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.532
The conditions themselves,

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:34.802
besides the sheer distance
of over 100 miles in the open ocean --

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.862
the currents and whirling eddies
and the Gulf Stream itself,

00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:43.794
the most unpredictable
of all of the planet Earth.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.882
And by the way -- it's amusing to me

00:01:49.815 --> 00:01:54.465
that journalists and people,
before these attempts, often ask me,

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.893
"Well, are you going to go with any boats
or any people or anything?"

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.380
(Laughter)

00:01:59.404 --> 00:02:01.540
And I'm thinking, what are they imagining?

00:02:01.564 --> 00:02:04.584
That I'll just sort of do
some celestial navigation --

00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:05.715
(Laughter)

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.243
And carry a bowie knife in my mouth,

00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:12.806
and I'll hunt fish and skin them
alive and eat them,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.577
and maybe drag a desalinization plant
behind me for fresh water.

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:22.307
(Laughter)

00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:23.588
Yes, I have a team.

00:02:23.612 --> 00:02:26.115
(Laughter)

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.418
And the team is expert,

00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:30.590
and the team is courageous,

00:02:30.614 --> 00:02:34.776
and brimming with innovation
and scientific discovery,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.887
as is true of any major
expedition on the planet.

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:42.134
And we've been on a journey.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.179
And the debate has raged, hasn't it,

00:02:45.203 --> 00:02:46.559
since the Greeks,

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.700
of isn't it what it's all about?

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:53.307
Isn't life about the journey,
not really the destination?

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:56.130
And here we've been on this journey,

00:02:56.154 --> 00:02:58.402
and the truth is, it's been thrilling.

00:02:58.426 --> 00:03:00.173
We haven't reached that other shore,

00:03:00.197 --> 00:03:03.925
and still, our sense
of pride and commitment,

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.088
unwavering commitment.

00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:10.097
When I turned 60,
the dream was still alive

00:03:10.566 --> 00:03:15.165
from having tried this in my 20s --
dreamed it and imagined it.

00:03:16.303 --> 00:03:20.908
The most famous body of water
on the Earth today, I imagine,

00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:22.346
Cuba to Florida.

00:03:22.894 --> 00:03:26.281
And it was deep. It was deep in my soul.

00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:28.715
When I turned 60,

00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:32.040
it wasn't so much
about the athletic accomplishment,

00:03:32.064 --> 00:03:35.355
it wasn't the ego
of "I want to be the first."

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.633
That's always there and it's undeniable.

00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:39.874
But it was deeper.

00:03:39.898 --> 00:03:41.931
It was "how much life is there left?"

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:44.766
Let's face it -- we're all
on a one-way street, aren't we?

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:46.762
And what are we going to do?

00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:51.061
What are we going to do as we go forward,
to have no regrets looking back?

00:03:52.194 --> 00:03:54.832
And all this past year in training,

00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:57.543
I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote

00:03:57.567 --> 00:03:59.820
to paraphrase it,
floating around in my brain.

00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:01.659
It says, "You go ahead.

00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:04.779
You go ahead and sit back
in your comfortable chair

00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:07.731
and you be the critic,
you be the observer,

00:04:08.775 --> 00:04:12.169
while the brave one
gets in the ring and engages

00:04:12.943 --> 00:04:17.400
and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails
over and over and over again,

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:22.146
but yet isn't afraid and isn't timid
and lives life in a bold way."

00:04:22.944 --> 00:04:25.377
And so of course I want to make it across.

00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:30.244
It is the goal, and I should
be so shallow to say that this year,

00:04:30.673 --> 00:04:34.174
the destination was even sweeter
than the journey.

00:04:34.198 --> 00:04:36.101
(Laughter)

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:39.533
(Applause)

00:04:39.557 --> 00:04:41.934
But the journey itself
was worthwhile taking.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:45.257
And at this point, by this summer,

00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:48.413
everybody -- scientists,
sports scientists,

00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:52.070
endurance experts, neurologists,

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.713
my own team, Bonnie --

00:04:57.755 --> 00:04:59.007
said it's impossible.

00:04:59.582 --> 00:05:02.130
It just simply can't be done,
and Bonnie said to me,

00:05:02.154 --> 00:05:04.140
"But if you're going to take the journey,

00:05:04.164 --> 00:05:06.355
I'm going to see you
through to the end of it,

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:07.542
so I'll be there."

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:09.007
And now we're there.

00:05:12.132 --> 00:05:15.005
As we're looking out,
kind of a surreal moment

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:16.333
before the first stroke,

00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:18.859
standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway,

00:05:18.883 --> 00:05:21.552
the Cuban flag is flying above,

00:05:21.576 --> 00:05:25.826
all my team is out in their boats,
hands up in the air,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.168
"We're here!

00:05:27.914 --> 00:05:29.093
We're here for you!"

00:05:31.017 --> 00:05:33.106
Bonnie and I look at each other and say,

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.379
this year, the mantra is --
and I've been using it in training --

00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:38.372
Find a way.

00:05:39.137 --> 00:05:40.338
You have a dream

00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:44.862
and you have obstacles
in front of you, as we all do.

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.300
None of us ever get through this life

00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:49.860
without heartache,

00:05:52.058 --> 00:05:53.323
without turmoil,

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:57.173
and if you believe and you have faith

00:05:57.197 --> 00:05:59.569
and you can get knocked down
and get back up again

00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:02.494
and you believe in perseverance

00:06:02.518 --> 00:06:06.136
as a great human quality,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.449
you find your way.

00:06:07.473 --> 00:06:09.094
And Bonnie grabbed my shoulders,

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:12.238
and she said, "Let's find
our way to Florida."

00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:15.923
And we started, and for the next 53 hours,

00:06:15.947 --> 00:06:20.373
it was an intense,
unforgettable life experience.

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:23.864
The highs were high, the awe --

00:06:23.888 --> 00:06:26.213
I'm not a religious person,
but I'll tell you,

00:06:26.237 --> 00:06:29.662
to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream

00:06:29.686 --> 00:06:31.566
as if, as you're breathing,

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.609
you're looking down miles
and miles and miles,

00:06:36.253 --> 00:06:41.162
to feel the majesty
of this blue planet we live on --

00:06:41.186 --> 00:06:44.576
it's awe-inspiring.

00:06:45.055 --> 00:06:47.533
I have a playlist of about 85 songs,

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:49.670
and especially in the middle
of the night ...

00:06:49.694 --> 00:06:52.810
That night, because we use
no lights -- lights attract jellyfish,

00:06:52.834 --> 00:06:54.030
lights attract sharks,

00:06:54.054 --> 00:06:56.415
lights attract baitfish
that attract sharks,

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.916
so we go in the pitch black of the night.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.403
You've never seen black this black.

00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:04.333
You can't see the front of your hand,

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:07.346
and the people on the boat,
Bonnie and my team on the boat --

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.403
they just hear the slapping of the arms,

00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:10.618
and they know where I am,

00:07:10.642 --> 00:07:12.560
because there's no visual at all.

00:07:12.584 --> 00:07:16.697
And I'm out there kind of tripping out
on my little playlist.

00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:19.225
(Laughter)

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:22.293
I've got tight rubber caps,
I don't hear a thing.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:25.434
I've got goggles and I'm turning
my head 50 times a minute,

00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:26.733
and I'm singing ...

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.099
(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven

00:07:30.123 --> 00:07:31.710
(Laughter)

00:07:31.734 --> 00:07:33.416
doo doo doo doo doo

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.260
It's easy if you try

00:07:36.284 --> 00:07:37.488
doo doo doo doo doo

00:07:37.512 --> 00:07:40.046
And I can sing that song
a thousand times in a row.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.305
(Laughter)

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:44.955
Now there's a talent unto itself.

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:46.783
(Laughter)

00:07:46.807 --> 00:07:49.387
(Applause)

00:07:49.411 --> 00:07:51.785
And each time I get done with,

00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:56.629
(Singing) Oh, you may say I'm a dreamer
but I'm not the only one

00:07:58.627 --> 00:08:00.157
222.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.006
(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.112
(Laughter)

00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:07.651
And when I get through the end

00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:09.731
of a thousand of John Lennon's "Imagine,"

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.003
I have swum nine hours and 45 minutes ...

00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:13.958
exactly.

00:08:13.982 --> 00:08:16.379
(Laughter)

00:08:16.403 --> 00:08:18.355
And then there are the crises.

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:19.529
Of course there are.

00:08:20.957 --> 00:08:24.275
And the vomiting starts,
the seawater -- you're not well.

00:08:24.299 --> 00:08:27.908
You're wearing a jellyfish mask
for the ultimate protection.

00:08:27.932 --> 00:08:29.391
It's difficult to swim in.

00:08:29.415 --> 00:08:32.049
It's causing abrasions
on the inside of the mouth,

00:08:32.073 --> 00:08:33.881
but the tentacles can't get you.

00:08:34.707 --> 00:08:37.268
And the hypothermia sets in.

00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:40.677
The water's 85 degrees,
and yet you're losing weight

00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:42.020
and using calories.

00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:44.482
And as you come over
toward the side of the boat --

00:08:44.506 --> 00:08:46.846
not allowed to touch it,
not allowed to get out,

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.000
but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition

00:08:49.024 --> 00:08:52.353
and ask me how I'm doing, am I all right.

00:08:52.377 --> 00:08:55.236
I am seeing the Taj Mahal --

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.481
(Laughter)

00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:57.788
Over here.

00:08:57.812 --> 00:09:01.575
I'm in a very different state --

00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:02.971
(Laughter)

00:09:02.995 --> 00:09:05.757
And I'm thinking, "Wow!

00:09:05.781 --> 00:09:09.370
I never thought I'd be running
into the Taj Mahal out here.

00:09:09.663 --> 00:09:11.424
It's gorgeous!

00:09:11.448 --> 00:09:14.037
I mean, how long
did it take them to build that?

00:09:14.061 --> 00:09:15.748
It's just ...

00:09:16.315 --> 00:09:18.415
So, uh -- wooo -- you know?

00:09:18.439 --> 00:09:21.618
(Laughter)

00:09:22.626 --> 00:09:24.494
We kind of have a cardinal rule

00:09:24.518 --> 00:09:27.987
that I'm never told how far it is,
because we don't know how far it is.

00:09:28.011 --> 00:09:31.188
What's going to happen to you
between this point and that point?

00:09:31.212 --> 00:09:33.816
What's going to happen
to the weather and the currents

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.800
and, God forbid, you're stung,

00:09:35.824 --> 00:09:39.718
when you don't think you could
be stung in all this armor.

00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:43.623
Bonnie made a decision
coming into that third morning

00:09:44.772 --> 00:09:46.543
that I was suffering,

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:49.880
and I was hanging on by a thread.

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:51.704
And she said, "Come here,"

00:09:51.728 --> 00:09:53.815
and I came close
to the boat, and she said,

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:55.037
"Look, look out there."

00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:56.214
And I saw light,

00:09:56.238 --> 00:09:58.240
because the day is easier than the night,

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.094
and I thought we were coming into day.

00:10:00.118 --> 00:10:03.776
I saw a stream of white light
along the horizon,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.078
and I said, "It's going
to be morning soon."

00:10:06.102 --> 00:10:09.366
And she said, "No, those
are the lights of Key West."

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.492
It was 15 more hours,

00:10:13.516 --> 00:10:15.725
which for most swimmers
would be a long time.

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:18.875
(Laughter)

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:22.216
(Applause)

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.244
You have no idea how many
15-hour training swims I had done.

00:10:26.785 --> 00:10:30.602
So here we go, and I somehow,
without a decision,

00:10:30.626 --> 00:10:32.944
went into no counting of strokes

00:10:32.968 --> 00:10:34.277
and no singing

00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:39.492
and no quoting Stephen Hawking
on the parameters of the universe.

00:10:39.516 --> 00:10:45.743
I just went into thinking
about this dream, and why and how.

00:10:46.188 --> 00:10:48.330
As I said, when I turned 60,

00:10:48.354 --> 00:10:52.358
it wasn't about that concrete
"Can you do it?"

00:10:52.382 --> 00:10:55.318
That's the everyday machinations.

00:10:55.342 --> 00:10:58.089
That's the discipline,
and it's the preparation,

00:10:58.113 --> 00:10:59.818
and there's a pride in that.

00:10:59.842 --> 00:11:03.732
But I decided to think, as I went along,

00:11:04.391 --> 00:11:08.256
about -- you know, the phrase usually is,
"reaching for the stars."

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.843
And in my case,
it's reaching for the horizon.

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.309
And when you reach for the horizon,

00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:15.451
as I've proven, you may not get there.

00:11:16.036 --> 00:11:21.463
But what a tremendous build
of character and spirit

00:11:22.392 --> 00:11:24.385
that you lay down;

00:11:24.409 --> 00:11:28.299
what a foundation you lay down
in reaching for those horizons.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:31.742
And now, the shore is coming.

00:11:32.432 --> 00:11:34.976
And there's just a little part
of me that's sad.

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:37.796
The epic journey is going to be over.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.886
So many people come up to me now and say,

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.103
"What's next?"

00:11:41.127 --> 00:11:42.549
(Laughter)

00:11:42.573 --> 00:11:43.878
"We love that!"

00:11:43.902 --> 00:11:44.989
(Laughter)

00:11:45.013 --> 00:11:46.893
"That little tracker on the computer?

00:11:46.917 --> 00:11:48.758
When are you going to do the next one?

00:11:48.782 --> 00:11:50.614
We can't wait to follow the next one."

00:11:50.638 --> 00:11:52.818
Well, they were just there for 53 hours,

00:11:52.842 --> 00:11:54.787
and I was there for years.

00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:58.634
And so there won't be another
epic journey in the ocean.

00:11:58.658 --> 00:12:02.209
But the point is, and the point was,

00:12:02.233 --> 00:12:06.486
that every day of our lives is epic.

00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:09.889
And I'll tell you,
when I walked up onto that beach,

00:12:09.913 --> 00:12:11.751
staggered up onto that beach ...

00:12:11.908 --> 00:12:18.335
I had so many times,
in a very puffed-up ego way,

00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:20.394
rehearsed what I would say ...

00:12:20.418 --> 00:12:22.065
(Laughter)

00:12:22.089 --> 00:12:23.339
on the beach.

00:12:23.363 --> 00:12:26.303
When Bonnie thought the back
of my throat was swelling up,

00:12:26.327 --> 00:12:28.496
she brought the medical team
over to our boat

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.728
to say, "She's really beginning
to have trouble breathing;

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.807
another 12, 24 hours
in the saltwater ..." --

00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:39.576
the whole thing -- I just thought,
in my hallucinatory moment,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.986
that I heard the word "tracheotomy."

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.340
(Laughter)

00:12:44.871 --> 00:12:48.141
Bonnie said to the doctor,
"I'm not worried about her not breathing.

00:12:48.165 --> 00:12:50.306
If she can't talk
when she gets to the shore,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.857
she's going to be pissed off."

00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:57.088
(Laughter)

00:12:57.112 --> 00:13:01.017
But the truth is, all those orations
that I had practiced,

00:13:01.041 --> 00:13:04.917
just to get myself through some
training swims as motivation --

00:13:04.941 --> 00:13:06.409
it wasn't like that.

00:13:06.433 --> 00:13:08.881
It was a very real moment,

00:13:08.905 --> 00:13:10.929
with that crowd, with my team.

00:13:11.368 --> 00:13:13.853
We did it. I didn't do it. We did it.

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.654
And we'll never forget it.
It'll always be part of us.

00:13:17.181 --> 00:13:21.199
The three things I did sort of blurt out
when we got there, was first:

00:13:21.223 --> 00:13:23.386
Never, ever give up.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.952
I live it.

00:13:25.976 --> 00:13:28.275
What's the phrase
from today from Socrates?

00:13:28.867 --> 00:13:30.063
Audience: To be is to do.

00:13:30.087 --> 00:13:31.395
Diana Nyad: To be is to do.

00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:34.408
So I don't stand up and say,
"Don't ever give up."

00:13:34.432 --> 00:13:35.784
I didn't give up.

00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:38.268
There was action behind these words.

00:13:38.292 --> 00:13:39.986
The second is:

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:43.286
You can chase your dreams
at any age; you're never too old.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:48.389
Sixty-four; a thing no one,
at any age, any gender, could ever do

00:13:48.413 --> 00:13:49.569
has done it.

00:13:49.593 --> 00:13:51.132
And there's no doubt in my mind

00:13:51.156 --> 00:13:53.824
that I am at the prime of my life today.

00:13:53.848 --> 00:13:56.652
(Applause)

00:13:56.676 --> 00:13:57.924
Yeah.

00:13:57.948 --> 00:14:02.234
(Applause)

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.434
Thank you.

00:14:04.081 --> 00:14:06.224
And the third thing
I said on that beach was,

00:14:06.248 --> 00:14:08.900
it looks like the most solitary
endeavor in the world,

00:14:08.924 --> 00:14:11.027
and in many ways, of course, it is.

00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:14.700
And in other ways,
and the most important ways,

00:14:14.724 --> 00:14:15.912
it's a team.

00:14:15.936 --> 00:14:18.645
And if you think I'm a badass,
you want to meet Bonnie.

00:14:18.669 --> 00:14:20.121
(Laughter)

00:14:20.145 --> 00:14:21.403
Bonnie, where are you?

00:14:22.741 --> 00:14:24.014
Where are you?

00:14:25.236 --> 00:14:26.615
There's Bonnie Stoll.

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:29.026
(Applause)

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.344
My buddy.

00:14:30.368 --> 00:14:33.373
(Applause)

00:14:33.397 --> 00:14:35.717
The Henry David Thoreau quote goes,

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:39.011
"When you achieve your dreams,
it's not so much what you get

00:14:39.035 --> 00:14:41.333
as who you have become in achieving them."

00:14:41.904 --> 00:14:43.815
And yeah, I stand before you now.

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:45.839
In the three months since that swim ended,

00:14:45.863 --> 00:14:47.667
I've sat down with Oprah,

00:14:47.691 --> 00:14:51.449
and I've been in
President Obama's Oval Office;

00:14:51.473 --> 00:14:54.024
I've been invited to speak
in front of esteemed groups

00:14:54.048 --> 00:14:55.199
such as yourselves;

00:14:55.223 --> 00:14:57.474
I've signed a wonderful
major book contract.

00:14:57.498 --> 00:15:00.209
All of that's great,
and I don't denigrate it.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.124
I'm proud of it all, but the truth is,

00:15:02.148 --> 00:15:03.441
I'm walking around tall

00:15:03.465 --> 00:15:09.408
because I am that bold, fearless person,
and I will be, every day,

00:15:09.432 --> 00:15:13.581
until it's time for these days to be done.

00:15:13.605 --> 00:15:15.763
Thank you very much
and enjoy the conference.

00:15:15.787 --> 00:15:17.894
Thank you. Thank you!

00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:20.657
(Applause)

00:15:20.681 --> 00:15:24.442
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you! Thank you.

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:27.171
(Applause)

00:15:27.195 --> 00:15:28.612
Find a way!

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:30.621
(Applause)
