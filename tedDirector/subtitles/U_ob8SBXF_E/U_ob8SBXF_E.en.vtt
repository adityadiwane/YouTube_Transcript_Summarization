00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
♫ and time ♫

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.330

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.330
Thank you very much.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.330
Good morning everybody.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
We are They Might Be Giants.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.330
(Applause)

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
I am wearing the Al Gore in-ear monitors

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.330
he wore on the Larry King show

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
and I'm hearing that transmission and not mine.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
But I guess that's in keeping,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
This is a brand new song.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
In the spirit of TED, we're bringing you something

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.330
that has not been released.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.330
John, do you want to introduce the song?

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
which imitates another creature

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.330
which imitates yet another creature.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.330
It's completely fucked up

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.330
and can only be explained in song.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.330
♫ Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying ♫

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.330
♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
♫ You can't walk, you can't ramble ♫

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
♫ Catbird is a cat ♫

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330

♫ Now the moth ♫

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
♫ defeats the mouse and man. ♫

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
♫ It's messing with the plan. ♫

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
♫ It can't be believed ♫

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.330

(Applause)

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
Thanks a lot.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
Thank you very much.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.330
So we are past our 1,000th show.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.330
Probably somewhere around 1,500.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
It's hard to know.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
We've only done two shows in 2007 so far,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.330
but our first show

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.330
was actually the coldest performance we've ever had.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
It was 19 degrees in St. Louis about a month ago

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
and I'm happy to report

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.330
that this performance you are seeing today

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
is the earliest we have ever performed.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.330
So thank you.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.330
How early can a rock performance begin?

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
Not all the facts are in about performing

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.330
at 8.30 in the morning.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
I can tell you the 19 degree thing

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
was fantastic.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.330
All right.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
So we don't know that much

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
about the history of violinists

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.330
but we do know that when we entered

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.330
the state of New Jersey

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.330
there is an uptick in violence.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
This song is called "Asbury Park."

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
It's based on a real life experience.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
♫ I ♫

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
♫ I got ♫

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
♫ I got kicked ♫

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.330
♫ I got kicked in the head ♫

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
♫ backstage at the Stone. ♫

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
♫ Stone Pone. ♫

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.330
♫ Stone Pony. ♫

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.330
♫ I got kicked in the head ♫

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.330
♫ backstage at the Stone Pony ♫

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.330
♫ where I swore to the guy ♫

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
♫ that the guy who took his beer wasn't me. ♫

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
♫ Me got ♫

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
♫ Me got kicked ♫

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.330
♫ Me got kicked in the head ♫

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
♫ backstage at the Stone. ♫

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
♫ Stone Pone. ♫

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.330
♫ Stone Pony. ♫

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.330
♫ Me got kicked in the head ♫

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
♫ backstage at the Stone Pony ♫

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.330
♫ where I swore to the guy ♫

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.330
♫ that the guy who took his beer ♫

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
♫ was a guy dressed like me. ♫

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.330
♫ Not me! ♫

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.330
♫ Not me! ♫

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
♫ Not me! ♫

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
Thank you.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
Marty Beller on the drums over there.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.330
(Applause)

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
We want to get in as many songs as possible

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
during our brief time here

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
so this is the one to play.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
This song is called "Fingertips."

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
♫ Everything is catching on fire ♫

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
♫ Yes, everything is catching on fire ♫

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.330
♫ Yes, everything is catching on fire. ♫

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
♫ Fingertips ♫

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
♫ I hear the wind blow ♫

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.330
♫ I hear the wind blow ♫

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.330
♫ It seems to say ♫

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
♫ Hello ♫

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.330

♫ All alone, all alone. ♫

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.330
♫ All by myself. ♫

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:51.330
♫ What's that blue thing doing here? ♫

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
♫ Something grabbed ahold of my hand ♫

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
♫ I didn't know what had my hand ♫

♫ I don't understand you ♫

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.330

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
♫ Don't understand you ♫

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
♫ I turn around ♫

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.330
♫ See the sound ♫

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.330
♫ Turn around and see the thing ♫

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
♫ that made the sound. ♫

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:40.330
♫ Mysterious whisper ♫

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:45.330
♫ Mysterious whisper ♫

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.330
♫ Mysterious whisper ♫

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:57.330
♫ Mysterious whisper ♫

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:05.330
♫ The day that love came to play. ♫

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:11.330
♫ I'm having a heart attack ♫

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.330

♫ I'm having a heart attack ♫

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:28.330
♫ I'm having a ... ♫

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.330
♫ Fingertips ♫

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
♫ Fingertips ♫

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:50.330
♫ I walk along darkened corridors ♫

00:12:50.330 --> 00:13:06.330
♫ And I walk along darkened corridors ♫

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
Thank you very much -- "Fingertips."

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.330
(Applause)

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
♫ We're taking calls -- from the dead. ♫

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.330
♫ We're taking calls -- from the dead. ♫

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.330
♫ We're taking phone calls from the dead. ♫

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
♫ They're calling from beyond the grave. ♫

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.330
♫ Beyond the grave. ♫

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.330
♫ They have some questions ♫

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.330
♫ And things to share ♫

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:33.330
♫ From underneath the cold, cold ground. ♫

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.330
We're soliciting phone calls from dead people

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.330
as a special TED presentation.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.330
We're taking calls live on stage

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.330
here at TED in Monterey.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:49.330
And I think we have a caller coming in here.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
Hello there.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
You're live.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
Hello. Who's there, please?

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
Am I on the air?

00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.330
Hi there.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
You're on with They Might Be Giants.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.330
This is Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.330
Hello, Eleanor, please ...

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.330
I want to talk to ...

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
Please turn off your radio, Eleanor.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:08.330
I wanna talk to Randi.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
I've got a question for Randi.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.330
What's your question, please?

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.330
I want to talk to the Amazing Randi.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.330
Do you have a laminated badge, Eleanor?

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
I want my million dollars.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.330
Eleanor, I'm sorry,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.330
do you have a laminated badge?

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.330
No, I don't have a badge.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.330
Well, I think we're going to stop

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.330
that part of the show.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
Here's a song we like to think of

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.330
as the future anthem of TED.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
It's actually a children's song

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.330
but like so many projects for children

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
it's really just a Trojan horse

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
for adult work.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
This song is called

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:53.330
"The Alphabet ...

00:14:53.330 --> 00:15:00.330
Of Nations!"
