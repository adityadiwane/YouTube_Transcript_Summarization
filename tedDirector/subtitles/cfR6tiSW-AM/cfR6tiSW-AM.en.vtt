00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:19.243
So the first robot
to talk about is called STriDER.

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:22.736
It stands for Self-excited
Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.118
It's a robot that has three legs,
which is inspired by nature.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.171
But have you seen anything in nature,
an animal that has three legs?

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:35.065
Probably not. So why do I call this
a biologically inspired robot?

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:36.251
How would it work?

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:38.437
But before that,
let's look at pop culture.

00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:41.929
So, you know H.G. Wells's
"War of the Worlds," novel and movie.

00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:45.274
And what you see over here
is a very popular video game,

00:00:45.298 --> 00:00:48.998
and in this fiction, they describe
these alien creatures and robots

00:00:49.022 --> 00:00:51.284
that have three legs that terrorize Earth.

00:00:51.308 --> 00:00:54.843
But my robot, STriDER,
does not move like this.

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:57.918
This is an actual dynamic
simulation animation.

00:00:57.942 --> 00:00:59.999
I'm going to show you how the robot works.

00:01:00.023 --> 00:01:02.415
It flips its body 180 degrees

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:04.497
and it swings its leg between the two legs

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:05.680
and catches the fall.

00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:06.866
So that's how it walks.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.602
But when you look at us
human beings, bipedal walking,

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:10.784
what you're doing is,

00:01:10.808 --> 00:01:14.895
you're not really using muscle
to lift your leg and walk like a robot.

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:18.256
What you're doing is,
you swing your leg and catch the fall,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.736
stand up again, swing your leg
and catch the fall.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.927
You're using your built-in dynamics,
the physics of your body,

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:25.702
just like a pendulum.

00:01:25.726 --> 00:01:29.084
We call that the concept
of passive dynamic locomotion.

00:01:29.108 --> 00:01:31.246
What you're doing is, when you stand up,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.351
potential energy to kinetic energy,

00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:35.352
potential energy to kinetic energy.

00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:37.353
It's a constantly falling process.

00:01:37.377 --> 00:01:40.426
So even though there is nothing
in nature that looks like this,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.579
really, we're inspired by biology
and applying the principles of walking

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:45.760
to this robot.

00:01:45.784 --> 00:01:47.761
Thus, it's a biologically inspired robot.

00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:50.198
What you see here,
this is what we want to do next.

00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:53.736
We want to fold up the legs
and shoot it up for long-range motion.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.554
And it deploys legs --
it looks almost like "Star Wars" --

00:01:56.578 --> 00:01:59.442
so when it lands, it absorbs
the shock and starts walking.

00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:02.671
What you see over here, this yellow thing,
this is not a death ray.

00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:03.707
(Laughter)

00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:04.890
This is just to show you

00:02:04.914 --> 00:02:07.601
that if you have cameras
or different types of sensors,

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:09.142
because it's 1.8 meters tall,

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:12.252
you can see over obstacles like bushes
and those kinds of things.

00:02:12.276 --> 00:02:13.623
So we have two prototypes.

00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:16.590
The first version,
in the back, that's STriDER I.

00:02:16.614 --> 00:02:18.781
The one in front,
the smaller, is STriDER II.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.313
The problem we had with STriDER I is,
it was just too heavy in the body.

00:02:22.337 --> 00:02:24.921
We had so many motors aligning the joints

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.199
and those kinds of things.

00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:29.423
So we decided to synthesize
a mechanical mechanism

00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:32.516
so we could get rid of all the motors,
and with a single motor,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.217
we can coordinate all the motions.

00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:37.618
It's a mechanical solution to a problem,
instead of using mechatronics.

00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:41.054
So with this, now the top body
is lighted up; it's walking in our lab.

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:43.137
This was the very first successful step.

00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:45.829
It's still not perfected,
its coffee falls down,

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:47.835
so we still have a lot of work to do.

00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:51.381
The second robot I want
to talk about is called IMPASS.

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:55.864
It stands for Intelligent Mobility
Platform with Actuated Spoke System.

00:02:55.888 --> 00:02:58.483
It's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.

00:02:58.507 --> 00:03:02.364
So think of a rimless wheel
or a spoke wheel,

00:03:02.388 --> 00:03:05.365
but the spokes individually
move in and out of the hub;

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.476
so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.742
We're literally reinventing
the wheel here.

00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:12.229
Let me demonstrate how it works.

00:03:12.253 --> 00:03:16.102
So in this video we're using an approach
called the reactive approach.

00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:19.103
Just simply using
the tactile sensors on the feet,

00:03:19.127 --> 00:03:21.937
it's trying to walk
over a changing terrain,

00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:24.661
a soft terrain where it pushes
down and changes.

00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:26.882
And just by the tactile information,

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:29.661
it successfully crosses
over these types of terrains.

00:03:29.685 --> 00:03:33.490
But, when it encounters
a very extreme terrain --

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:37.427
in this case, this obstacle
is more than three times the height

00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:38.621
of the robot --

00:03:38.645 --> 00:03:40.519
then it switches to a deliberate mode,

00:03:40.543 --> 00:03:43.357
where it uses a laser range finder
and camera systems

00:03:43.381 --> 00:03:45.207
to identify the obstacle and the size.

00:03:45.231 --> 00:03:48.215
And it carefully plans
the motion of the spokes

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.948
and coordinates it so it can show
this very impressive mobility.

00:03:51.972 --> 00:03:54.613
You probably haven't seen
anything like this out there.

00:03:54.637 --> 00:03:58.307
This is a very high-mobility robot
that we developed called IMPASS.

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:01.661
Ah, isn't that cool?

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:04.979
When you drive your car,

00:04:05.003 --> 00:04:08.925
when you steer your car, you use
a method called Ackermann steering.

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.800
The front wheels rotate like this.

00:04:10.824 --> 00:04:13.339
For most small-wheeled robots,

00:04:13.363 --> 00:04:15.612
they use a method
called differential steering

00:04:15.636 --> 00:04:18.493
where the left and right wheel
turn the opposite direction.

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:21.415
For IMPASS, we can do many,
many different types of motion.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.708
For example, in this case,

00:04:22.732 --> 00:04:25.132
even though the left and right
wheels are connected

00:04:25.156 --> 00:04:27.922
with a single axle rotating
at the same angle of velocity,

00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:31.080
we simply change the length
of the spoke, it affects the diameter,

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.191
then can turn to the left
and to the right.

00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:36.568
These are just some examples
of the neat things we can do with IMPASS.

00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:38.366
This robot is called CLIMBeR:

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.790
Cable-suspended Limbed Intelligent
Matching Behavior Robot.

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.941
I've been talking
to a lot of NASA JPL scientists --

00:04:44.965 --> 00:04:47.115
at JPL, they are famous
for the Mars rovers --

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.510
and the scientists,
geologists always tell me

00:04:49.534 --> 00:04:52.661
that the real interesting science,
the science-rich sites,

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:54.196
are always at the cliffs.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.170
But the current rovers cannot get there.

00:04:56.194 --> 00:04:58.677
So, inspired by that,
we wanted to build a robot

00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:01.818
that can climb
a structured cliff environment.

00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:03.066
So this is CLIMBeR.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.601
It has three legs.

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:08.208
It's probably difficult to see, but it has
a winch and a cable at the top.

00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:10.813
It tries to figure out
the best place to put its foot.

00:05:10.837 --> 00:05:12.472
And then once it figures that out,

00:05:12.496 --> 00:05:15.473
in real time, it calculates
the force distribution:

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:18.020
how much force it needs
to exert to the surface

00:05:18.044 --> 00:05:20.021
so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.

00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:22.186
Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot,

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.513
and then with the winch,
it can climb up these kinds of cliffs.

00:05:26.045 --> 00:05:28.661
Also for search and rescue
applications as well.

00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:31.104
Five years ago,
I actually worked at NASA JPL

00:05:31.128 --> 00:05:32.978
during the summer as a faculty fellow.

00:05:33.002 --> 00:05:36.452
And they already had
a six-legged robot called LEMUR.

00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:38.116
So this is actually based on that.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.431
This robot is called MARS:

00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:41.072
Multi-Appendage Robotic System.

00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:42.334
It's a hexapod robot.

00:05:42.358 --> 00:05:44.335
We developed our adaptive gait planner.

00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:46.884
We actually have a very interesting
payload on there.

00:05:46.908 --> 00:05:48.355
The students like to have fun.

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.474
And here you can see that it's walking
over unstructured terrain.

00:05:51.498 --> 00:05:52.615
(Motor sound)

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.436
It's trying to walk
on the coastal terrain, a sandy area,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.108
but depending on the moisture content
or the grain size of the sand,

00:06:00.132 --> 00:06:03.976
the foot's soil sinkage model changes,
so it tries to adapt its gait

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.240
to successfully cross
over these kind of things.

00:06:06.264 --> 00:06:07.771
It also does some fun stuff.

00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:11.280
As you can imagine,
we get so many visitors visiting our lab.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:14.036
So when the visitors come,
MARS walks up to the computer,

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.108
starts typing, "Hello, my name is MARS.

00:06:16.132 --> 00:06:17.661
Welcome to RoMeLa,

00:06:17.685 --> 00:06:20.298
the Robotics Mechanisms
Laboratory at Virginia Tech."

00:06:20.322 --> 00:06:21.792
(Laughter)

00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:23.941
This robot is an amoeba robot.

00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:26.853
Now, we don't have enough time
to go into technical details,

00:06:26.877 --> 00:06:28.934
I'll just show you
some of the experiments.

00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.470
These are some of the early
feasibility experiments.

00:06:31.494 --> 00:06:34.579
We store potential energy
to the elastic skin to make it move,

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:38.406
or use active tension cords
to make it move forward and backward.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.587
It's called ChIMERA.

00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:42.623
We also have been working
with some scientists and engineers

00:06:42.647 --> 00:06:43.798
from UPenn

00:06:43.822 --> 00:06:47.655
to come up with a chemically actuated
version of this amoeba robot.

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:49.562
We do something to something,

00:06:49.586 --> 00:06:52.254
and just like magic, it moves.

00:06:52.886 --> 00:06:54.468
"The Blob."

00:06:55.193 --> 00:06:56.970
This robot is a very recent project.

00:06:56.994 --> 00:06:58.145
It's called RAPHaEL:

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.856
Robotic Air-Powered Hand
with Elastic Ligaments.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.879
There are a lot of really neat,
very good robotic hands

00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:05.066
out there on the market.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.270
The problem is,
they're just too expensive --

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:08.699
tens of thousands of dollars.

00:07:08.723 --> 00:07:11.744
So for prosthesis applications
it's probably not too practical,

00:07:11.768 --> 00:07:13.113
because it's not affordable.

00:07:13.137 --> 00:07:16.611
We wanted to tackle this problem
in a very different direction.

00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:19.684
Instead of using electrical motors,
electromechanical actuators,

00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:21.464
we're using compressed air.

00:07:21.488 --> 00:07:24.935
We developed these novel actuators
for the joints, so it's compliant.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.661
You can actually change the force,

00:07:26.685 --> 00:07:28.511
simply just changing the air pressure.

00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:30.725
And it can actually crush
an empty soda can.

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:33.799
It can pick up very delicate
objects like a raw egg,

00:07:33.823 --> 00:07:35.411
or in this case, a lightbulb.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.719
The best part: it took only 200 dollars
to make the first prototype.

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:43.914
This robot is actually
a family of snake robots

00:07:43.938 --> 00:07:45.306
that we call HyDRAS,

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.041
Hyper Degrees-of-freedom Robotic
Articulated Serpentine.

00:07:48.065 --> 00:07:50.236
This is a robot that can climb structures.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.343
This is a HyDRAS's arm.

00:07:52.367 --> 00:07:54.376
It's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.748
But the cool part is the user interface.

00:07:56.772 --> 00:07:59.515
The cable over there,
that's an optical fiber.

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:01.975
This student, it's probably
her first time using it,

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:04.356
but she can articulate it
in many different ways.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.843
So, for example, in Iraq, the war zone,
there are roadside bombs.

00:08:07.867 --> 00:08:11.878
Currently, you send these remotely
controlled vehicles that are armed.

00:08:11.902 --> 00:08:15.441
It takes really a lot of time
and it's expensive to train the operator

00:08:15.465 --> 00:08:17.203
to operate this complex arm.

00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:19.194
In this case, it's very intuitive;

00:08:19.218 --> 00:08:21.486
this student, probably
his first time using it,

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.488
is doing very complex manipulation tasks,

00:08:23.512 --> 00:08:26.873
picking up objects and doing
manipulation, just like that.

00:08:26.897 --> 00:08:28.102
Very intuitive.

00:08:30.025 --> 00:08:32.622
Now, this robot
is currently our star robot.

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:35.631
We actually have a fan club
for the robot, DARwIn:

00:08:35.655 --> 00:08:38.556
Dynamic Anthropomorphic
Robot with Intelligence.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.463
As you know, we're very interested
in human walking,

00:08:42.487 --> 00:08:44.679
so we decided to build
a small humanoid robot.

00:08:44.703 --> 00:08:46.465
This was in 2004; at that time,

00:08:46.489 --> 00:08:48.759
this was something really,
really revolutionary.

00:08:48.783 --> 00:08:50.584
This was more of a feasibility study:

00:08:50.608 --> 00:08:53.259
What kind of motors should we use?
Is it even possible?

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.017
What kinds of controls should we do?

00:08:55.041 --> 00:08:58.561
This does not have any sensors,
so it's an open-loop control.

00:08:58.585 --> 00:09:01.355
For those who probably know,
if you don't have any sensors

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:03.952
and there's any disturbances,
you know what happens.

00:09:03.976 --> 00:09:06.089
(Laughter)

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:11.337
Based on that success, the following year
we did the proper mechanical design,

00:09:11.361 --> 00:09:12.585
starting from kinematics.

00:09:12.609 --> 00:09:15.519
And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.

00:09:15.543 --> 00:09:17.854
It stands up, it walks -- very impressive.

00:09:17.878 --> 00:09:21.235
However, still, as you can see,
it has a cord, an umbilical cord.

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:23.431
So we're still using
an external power source

00:09:23.455 --> 00:09:25.054
and external computation.

00:09:26.002 --> 00:09:29.313
So in 2006, now it's really
time to have fun.

00:09:29.337 --> 00:09:30.796
Let's give it intelligence.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.941
We give it all the computing
power it needs:

00:09:32.965 --> 00:09:35.495
a 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip,
two FireWire cameras,

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:38.365
rate gyros, accelerometers,
four forced sensors on the foot,

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:39.739
lithium polymer batteries --

00:09:39.763 --> 00:09:42.913
and now DARwIn II
is completely autonomous.

00:09:43.406 --> 00:09:46.097
It is not remote controlled.
There's no tethers.

00:09:46.121 --> 00:09:49.854
It looks around, searches for the ball ...
looks around, searches for the ball,

00:09:49.878 --> 00:09:54.807
and it tries to play a game of soccer
autonomously -- artificial intelligence.

00:09:54.831 --> 00:09:55.985
Let's see how it does.

00:09:56.009 --> 00:09:57.956
This was our very first trial, and ...

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.347
(Video) Spectators: Goal!

00:10:03.498 --> 00:10:06.448
Dennis Hong: There is actually
a competition called RoboCup.

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:09.059
I don't know how many of you
have heard about RoboCup.

00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:13.457
It's an international autonomous
robot soccer competition.

00:10:13.481 --> 00:10:16.229
And the actual goal of RoboCup is,

00:10:16.253 --> 00:10:18.446
by the year 2050,

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.201
we want to have full-size,
autonomous humanoid robots

00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:25.299
play soccer against the human
World Cup champions

00:10:25.323 --> 00:10:26.476
and win.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.532
(Laughter)

00:10:27.556 --> 00:10:28.774
It's a true, actual goal.

00:10:28.798 --> 00:10:32.695
It's a very ambitious goal,
but we truly believe we can do it.

00:10:32.719 --> 00:10:34.453
This is last year in China.

00:10:34.477 --> 00:10:37.490
We were the very first team
in the United States that qualified

00:10:37.514 --> 00:10:39.314
in the humanoid RoboCup competition.

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:41.518
This is this year in Austria.

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:44.109
You're going to see the action
is three against three,

00:10:44.133 --> 00:10:45.324
completely autonomous.

00:10:45.348 --> 00:10:46.439
(Video) (Crowd groans)

00:10:46.463 --> 00:10:47.793
DH: There you go. Yes!

00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:52.733
The robots track and they team-play
amongst themselves.

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:54.345
It's very impressive.

00:10:54.369 --> 00:10:55.845
It's really a research event,

00:10:55.869 --> 00:11:00.109
packaged in a more exciting
competition event.

00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:03.661
What you see here is the beautiful
Louis Vuitton Cup trophy.

00:11:03.685 --> 00:11:05.204
This is for the best humanoid.

00:11:05.228 --> 00:11:08.897
We'd like to bring this, for the first
time, to the United States next year,

00:11:08.921 --> 00:11:10.076
so wish us luck.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.136
(Applause)

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.312
Thank you.

00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:14.417
(Applause)

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:16.509
DARwIn also has a lot of other talents.

00:11:16.533 --> 00:11:20.249
Last year, it actually conducted
the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra

00:11:20.273 --> 00:11:22.661
for the holiday concert.

00:11:22.685 --> 00:11:25.661
This is the next generation
robot, DARwIn IV,

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:28.661
much smarter, faster, stronger.

00:11:28.685 --> 00:11:30.662
And it's trying to show off its ability:

00:11:30.686 --> 00:11:32.483
"I'm macho, I'm strong."

00:11:32.507 --> 00:11:33.951
(Laughter)

00:11:33.975 --> 00:11:38.200
"I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion,
martial art movements."

00:11:38.224 --> 00:11:40.236
(Laughter)

00:11:41.685 --> 00:11:43.620
And it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV.

00:11:43.644 --> 00:11:45.779
Again, you'll be able
to see it in the lobby.

00:11:45.803 --> 00:11:48.995
We truly believe this will be
the very first running humanoid robot

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:50.170
in the United States.

00:11:50.194 --> 00:11:51.348
So stay tuned.

00:11:51.372 --> 00:11:54.373
All right. So I showed you
some of our exciting robots at work.

00:11:54.397 --> 00:11:56.585
So, what is the secret of our success?

00:11:56.609 --> 00:11:58.426
Where do we come up with these ideas?

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.343
How do we develop these kinds of ideas?

00:12:00.367 --> 00:12:02.157
We have a fully autonomous vehicle

00:12:02.181 --> 00:12:04.057
that can drive into urban environments.

00:12:04.081 --> 00:12:06.980
We won a half a million dollars
in the DARPA Urban Challenge.

00:12:07.004 --> 00:12:10.661
We also have the world's very first
vehicle that can be driven by the blind.

00:12:10.685 --> 00:12:13.209
We call it the Blind Driver
Challenge, very exciting.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:16.405
And many, many other robotics
projects I want to talk about.

00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:19.066
These are just the awards
that we won in 2007 fall

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.661
from robotics competitions
and those kinds of things.

00:12:21.685 --> 00:12:23.578
So really, we have five secrets.

00:12:23.602 --> 00:12:26.038
First is: Where do we get inspiration?

00:12:26.062 --> 00:12:28.141
Where do we get this spark of imagination?

00:12:28.165 --> 00:12:30.186
This is a true story, my personal story.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.987
At night, when I go to bed,
at three, four in the morning,

00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:35.900
I lie down, close my eyes,
and I see these lines and circles

00:12:35.924 --> 00:12:37.718
and different shapes floating around.

00:12:37.742 --> 00:12:40.505
And they assemble, and they form
these kinds of mechanisms.

00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:42.137
And I think, "Ah, this is cool."

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:45.038
So right next to my bed
I keep a notebook, a journal,

00:12:45.062 --> 00:12:47.418
with a special pen
that has an LED light on it,

00:12:47.442 --> 00:12:50.479
because I don't want to turn on the light
and wake up my wife.

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:53.772
So I see this, scribble everything down,
draw things, and go to bed.

00:12:53.796 --> 00:12:56.186
Every day in the morning,
the first thing I do,

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.817
before my first cup of coffee,
before I brush my teeth,

00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:00.003
I open my notebook.

00:13:00.027 --> 00:13:02.690
Many times it's empty;
sometimes I have something there.

00:13:02.714 --> 00:13:04.780
If something's there, sometimes it's junk.

00:13:04.804 --> 00:13:07.161
But most of the time,
I can't read my handwriting.

00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:09.509
Four in the morning --
what do you expect, right?

00:13:09.533 --> 00:13:11.437
So I need to decipher what I wrote.

00:13:11.461 --> 00:13:14.661
But sometimes I see
this ingenious idea in there,

00:13:14.685 --> 00:13:16.170
and I have this eureka moment.

00:13:16.194 --> 00:13:18.710
I directly run to my home office,
sit at my computer,

00:13:18.734 --> 00:13:20.711
I type in the ideas, I sketch things out

00:13:20.735 --> 00:13:22.626
and I keep a database of ideas.

00:13:23.288 --> 00:13:25.649
So when we have these calls for proposals,

00:13:25.673 --> 00:13:29.243
I try to find a match
between my potential ideas

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:30.427
and the problem.

00:13:30.451 --> 00:13:32.768
If there's a match,
we write a research proposal,

00:13:32.792 --> 00:13:34.139
get the research funding in,

00:13:34.163 --> 00:13:36.323
and that's how we start
our research programs.

00:13:36.347 --> 00:13:38.840
But just a spark of imagination
is not good enough.

00:13:38.864 --> 00:13:40.744
How do we develop these kinds of ideas?

00:13:40.768 --> 00:13:43.548
At our lab RoMeLa, the Robotics
and Mechanisms Laboratory,

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:46.184
we have these fantastic
brainstorming sessions.

00:13:46.208 --> 00:13:50.543
So we gather around, we discuss problems
and solutions and talk about it.

00:13:50.567 --> 00:13:53.544
But before we start,
we set this golden rule.

00:13:53.568 --> 00:13:55.217
The rule is:

00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:58.218
nobody criticizes anybody's ideas.

00:13:58.242 --> 00:14:00.247
Nobody criticizes any opinion.

00:14:00.685 --> 00:14:04.232
This is important, because many times,
students fear or feel uncomfortable

00:14:04.256 --> 00:14:07.525
about how others might think
about their opinions and thoughts.

00:14:07.549 --> 00:14:11.339
So once you do this, it is amazing
how the students open up.

00:14:11.363 --> 00:14:14.661
They have these wacky, cool,
crazy, brilliant ideas,

00:14:14.685 --> 00:14:18.114
and the whole room is just electrified
with creative energy.

00:14:18.138 --> 00:14:20.411
And this is how we develop our ideas.

00:14:20.998 --> 00:14:22.555
Well, we're running out of time.

00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:24.481
One more thing I want to talk about is,

00:14:24.505 --> 00:14:27.661
you know, just a spark of idea
and development is not good enough.

00:14:27.685 --> 00:14:32.396
There was a great TED moment --
I think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it?

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.858
He gave a talk about how education
and school kill creativity.

00:14:36.882 --> 00:14:39.661
Well, actually,
there's two sides to the story.

00:14:39.685 --> 00:14:44.898
So there is only so much one can do
with just ingenious ideas

00:14:44.922 --> 00:14:47.938
and creativity
and good engineering intuition.

00:14:47.962 --> 00:14:49.756
If you want to go beyond a tinkering,

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.930
if you want to go
beyond a hobby of robotics

00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:55.395
and really tackle
the grand challenges of robotics

00:14:55.419 --> 00:14:56.661
through rigorous research,

00:14:56.685 --> 00:14:57.840
we need more than that.

00:14:57.864 --> 00:14:59.878
This is where school comes in.

00:14:59.902 --> 00:15:02.396
Batman, fighting against the bad guys,

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.813
he has his utility belt,
he has his grappling hook,

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:06.661
he has all different kinds of gadgets.

00:15:06.685 --> 00:15:09.098
For us roboticists,
engineers and scientists,

00:15:09.122 --> 00:15:13.279
these tools are the courses
and classes you take in class.

00:15:13.303 --> 00:15:15.305
Math, differential equations.

00:15:15.329 --> 00:15:18.069
I have linear algebra, science, physics --

00:15:18.093 --> 00:15:21.061
even, nowadays, chemistry
and biology, as you've seen.

00:15:21.085 --> 00:15:22.843
These are all the tools we need.

00:15:22.867 --> 00:15:24.743
So the more tools you have, for Batman,

00:15:24.767 --> 00:15:26.744
more effective at fighting the bad guys,

00:15:26.768 --> 00:15:29.674
for us, more tools to attack
these kinds of big problems.

00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:32.707
So education is very important.

00:15:33.828 --> 00:15:36.425
Also -- it's not only about that.

00:15:36.449 --> 00:15:38.517
You also have to work really, really hard.

00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:39.994
So I always tell my students,

00:15:40.018 --> 00:15:42.069
"Work smart, then work hard."

00:15:42.093 --> 00:15:44.817
This picture in the back --
this is three in the morning.

00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:47.170
I guarantee if you come
to our lab at 3, 4am,

00:15:47.194 --> 00:15:48.750
we have students working there,

00:15:48.774 --> 00:15:51.983
not because I tell them to,
but because we are having too much fun.

00:15:52.007 --> 00:15:53.661
Which leads to the last topic:

00:15:53.685 --> 00:15:55.554
do not forget to have fun.

00:15:55.578 --> 00:15:58.791
That's really the secret of our success,
we're having too much fun.

00:15:58.815 --> 00:16:02.281
I truly believe that highest productivity
comes when you're having fun,

00:16:02.305 --> 00:16:03.661
and that's what we're doing.

00:16:03.685 --> 00:16:04.839
And there you go.

00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:06.030
Thank you so much.

00:16:06.054 --> 00:16:10.156
(Applause)
