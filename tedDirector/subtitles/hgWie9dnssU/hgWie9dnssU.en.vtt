00:00:12.738 --> 00:00:14.735
If you remember that first decade of the web,

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:16.990
it was really a static place.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.235
You could go online, you could look at pages,

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:21.748
and they were put up either by organizations

00:00:21.748 --> 00:00:23.269
who had teams to do it

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.498
or by individuals who were really tech-savvy

00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:27.235
for the time.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.810
And with the rise of social media

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.209
and social networks in the early 2000s,

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:33.358
the web was completely changed

00:00:33.358 --> 00:00:36.966
to a place where now the vast majority of content

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:40.278
we interact with is put up by average users,

00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:42.975
either in YouTube videos or blog posts

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:46.290
or product reviews or social media postings.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.637
And it's also become a much more interactive place,

00:00:48.637 --> 00:00:51.274
where people are interacting with others,

00:00:51.274 --> 00:00:52.970
they're commenting, they're sharing,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.584
they're not just reading.

00:00:54.584 --> 00:00:56.450
So Facebook is not the only place you can do this,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.548
but it's the biggest,

00:00:57.548 --> 00:00:59.332
and it serves to illustrate the numbers.

00:00:59.332 --> 00:01:02.809
Facebook has 1.2 billion users per month.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.739
So half the Earth's Internet population

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.392
is using Facebook.

00:01:06.392 --> 00:01:08.324
They are a site, along with others,

00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:11.543
that has allowed people to create an online persona

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:13.325
with very little technical skill,

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:15.801
and people responded by putting huge amounts

00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:17.784
of personal data online.

00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:20.327
So the result is that we have behavioral,

00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:22.313
preference, demographic data

00:01:22.313 --> 00:01:24.414
for hundreds of millions of people,

00:01:24.414 --> 00:01:26.440
which is unprecedented in history.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.000
And as a computer scientist, 
what this means is that

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.664
I've been able to build models

00:01:30.664 --> 00:01:32.986
that can predict all sorts of hidden attributes

00:01:32.986 --> 00:01:35.270
for all of you that you don't even know

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.472
you're sharing information about.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:39.854
As scientists, we use that to help

00:01:39.854 --> 00:01:41.968
the way people interact online,

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:44.467
but there's less altruistic applications,

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:46.848
and there's a problem in that users don't really

00:01:46.848 --> 00:01:49.318
understand these techniques and how they work,

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:52.446
and even if they did, they don't
have a lot of control over it.

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:53.936
So what I want to talk to you about today

00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:56.638
is some of these things that we're able to do,

00:01:56.638 --> 00:01:59.401
and then give us some ideas
of how we might go forward

00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:02.170
to move some control back into the hands of users.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.756
So this is Target, the company.

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.080
I didn't just put that logo

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.250
on this poor, pregnant woman's belly.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.090
You may have seen this anecdote that was printed

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.151
in Forbes magazine where Target

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:13.512
sent a flyer to this 15-year-old girl

00:02:13.512 --> 00:02:15.222
with advertisements and coupons

00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:17.776
for baby bottles and diapers and cribs

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:19.460
two weeks before she told her parents

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.324
that she was pregnant.

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:24.028
Yeah, the dad was really upset.

00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:25.744
He said, "How did Target figure out

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:27.568
that this high school girl was pregnant

00:02:27.568 --> 00:02:29.528
before she told her parents?"

00:02:29.528 --> 00:02:32.149
It turns out that they have the purchase history

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.450
for hundreds of thousands of customers

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.180
and they compute what they 
call a pregnancy score,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.512
which is not just whether or 
not a woman's pregnant,

00:02:39.512 --> 00:02:41.242
but what her due date is.

00:02:41.242 --> 00:02:42.546
And they compute that

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:44.314
not by looking at the obvious things,

00:02:44.314 --> 00:02:46.826
like, she's buying a crib or baby clothes,

00:02:46.826 --> 00:02:49.769
but things like, she bought more vitamins

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.486
than she normally had,

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:52.950
or she bought a handbag

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.661
that's big enough to hold diapers.

00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:56.571
And by themselves, those purchases don't seem

00:02:56.571 --> 00:02:59.040
like they might reveal a lot,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.018
but it's a pattern of behavior that,

00:03:01.018 --> 00:03:04.135
when you take it in the context 
of thousands of other people,

00:03:04.135 --> 00:03:06.892
starts to actually reveal some insights.

00:03:06.892 --> 00:03:08.685
So that's the kind of thing that we do

00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:11.252
when we're predicting stuff
about you on social media.

00:03:11.252 --> 00:03:14.048
We're looking for little
patterns of behavior that,

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:16.730
when you detect them among millions of people,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.436
lets us find out all kinds of things.

00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:21.183
So in my lab and with colleagues,

00:03:21.183 --> 00:03:22.960
we've developed mechanisms where we can

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.520
quite accurately predict things

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.245
like your political preference,

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:29.997
your personality score, gender, sexual orientation,

00:03:29.997 --> 00:03:32.870
religion, age, intelligence,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.264
along with things like

00:03:34.264 --> 00:03:36.201
how much you trust the people you know

00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:38.005
and how strong those relationships are.

00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:39.790
We can do all of this really well.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.987
And again, it doesn't come from what you might

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:44.089
think of as obvious information.

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.370
So my favorite example is from this study

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.610
that was published this year

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.405
in the Proceedings of the National Academies.

00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:50.690
If you Google this, you'll find it.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.562
It's four pages, easy to read.

00:03:52.562 --> 00:03:55.565
And they looked at just people's Facebook likes,

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:57.485
so just the things you like on Facebook,

00:03:57.485 --> 00:03:59.623
and used that to predict all these attributes,

00:03:59.623 --> 00:04:01.268
along with some other ones.

00:04:01.268 --> 00:04:04.229
And in their paper they listed the five likes

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.016
that were most indicative of high intelligence.

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:09.340
And among those was liking a page

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.245
for curly fries. (Laughter)

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:13.338
Curly fries are delicious,

00:04:13.338 --> 00:04:15.868
but liking them does not necessarily mean

00:04:15.868 --> 00:04:17.948
that you're smarter than the average person.

00:04:17.948 --> 00:04:21.155
So how is it that one of the strongest indicators

00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:22.725
of your intelligence

00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:24.172
is liking this page

00:04:24.172 --> 00:04:26.424
when the content is totally irrelevant

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:28.951
to the attribute that's being predicted?

00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:30.535
And it turns out that we have to look at

00:04:30.535 --> 00:04:32.153
a whole bunch of underlying theories

00:04:32.153 --> 00:04:34.722
to see why we're able to do this.

00:04:34.722 --> 00:04:37.635
One of them is a sociological
theory called homophily,

00:04:37.635 --> 00:04:40.727
which basically says people are
friends with people like them.

00:04:40.727 --> 00:04:42.741
So if you're smart, you tend to
be friends with smart people,

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.371
and if you're young, you tend
to be friends with young people,

00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:46.998
and this is well established

00:04:46.998 --> 00:04:48.743
for hundreds of years.

00:04:48.743 --> 00:04:49.975
We also know a lot

00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:52.525
about how information spreads through networks.

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:54.279
It turns out things like viral videos

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.685
or Facebook likes or other information

00:04:56.685 --> 00:04:58.573
spreads in exactly the same way

00:04:58.573 --> 00:05:01.027
that diseases spread through social networks.

00:05:01.027 --> 00:05:02.818
So this is something we've studied for a long time.

00:05:02.818 --> 00:05:04.394
We have good models of it.

00:05:04.394 --> 00:05:06.551
And so you can put those things together

00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:09.639
and start seeing why things like this happen.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.453
So if I were to give you a hypothesis,

00:05:11.453 --> 00:05:14.680
it would be that a smart guy started this page,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.619
or maybe one of the first people who liked it

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:18.355
would have scored high on that test.

00:05:18.355 --> 00:05:20.643
And they liked it, and their friends saw it,

00:05:20.643 --> 00:05:23.765
and by homophily, we know that
he probably had smart friends,

00:05:23.765 --> 00:05:26.821
and so it spread to them, 
and some of them liked it,

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:28.010
and they had smart friends,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.817
and so it spread to them,

00:05:28.817 --> 00:05:30.790
and so it propagated through the network

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.359
to a host of smart people,

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:35.415
so that by the end, the action

00:05:35.415 --> 00:05:37.959
of liking the curly fries page

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:39.574
is indicative of high intelligence,

00:05:39.574 --> 00:05:41.377
not because of the content,

00:05:41.377 --> 00:05:43.899
but because the actual action of liking

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:45.799
reflects back the common attributes

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:48.267
of other people who have done it.

00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:51.164
So this is pretty complicated stuff, right?

00:05:51.164 --> 00:05:53.363
It's a hard thing to sit down and explain

00:05:53.363 --> 00:05:56.211
to an average user, and even if you do,

00:05:56.211 --> 00:05:58.399
what can the average user do about it?

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.447
How do you know that 
you've liked something

00:06:00.447 --> 00:06:01.939
that indicates a trait for you

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:05.484
that's totally irrelevant to the
content of what you've liked?

00:06:05.484 --> 00:06:08.030
There's a lot of power that users don't have

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.260
to control how this data is used.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.372
And I see that as a real 
problem going forward.

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.349
So I think there's a couple paths

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:16.350
that we want to look at

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.260
if we want to give users some control

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.000
over how this data is used,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.940
because it's not always going to be used

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.321
for their benefit.

00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:24.743
An example I often give is that,

00:06:24.743 --> 00:06:26.389
if I ever get bored being a professor,

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.042
I'm going to go start a company

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:29.496
that predicts all of these attributes

00:06:29.496 --> 00:06:31.098
and things like how well you work in teams

00:06:31.098 --> 00:06:33.769
and if you're a drug user, if you're an alcoholic.

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:35.209
We know how to predict all that.

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:36.970
And I'm going to sell reports

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.070
to H.R. companies and big businesses

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.343
that want to hire you.

00:06:41.343 --> 00:06:42.520
We totally can do that now.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.308
I could start that business tomorrow,

00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:46.360
and you would have
absolutely no control

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.498
over me using your data like that.

00:06:48.498 --> 00:06:50.790
That seems to me to be a problem.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.700
So one of the paths we can go down

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.732
is the policy and law path.

00:06:54.732 --> 00:06:57.778
And in some respects, I think
that that would be most effective,

00:06:57.778 --> 00:07:00.534
but the problem is we'd
actually have to do it.

00:07:00.534 --> 00:07:03.314
Observing our political process in action

00:07:03.314 --> 00:07:05.693
makes me think it's highly unlikely

00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:07.290
that we're going to get a bunch of representatives

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.276
to sit down, learn about this,

00:07:09.276 --> 00:07:11.382
and then enact sweeping changes

00:07:11.382 --> 00:07:13.539
to intellectual property law in the U.S.

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:16.000
so users control their data.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.304
We could go the policy route,

00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:18.783
where social media companies say,

00:07:18.783 --> 00:07:20.185
you know what? You own your data.

00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:22.674
You have total control over how it's used.

00:07:22.674 --> 00:07:24.522
The problem is that the revenue models

00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:26.246
for most social media companies

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:30.277
rely on sharing or exploiting 
users' data in some way.

00:07:30.277 --> 00:07:32.110
It's sometimes said of Facebook that the users

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.638
aren't the customer, they're the product.

00:07:34.638 --> 00:07:37.352
And so how do you get a company

00:07:37.352 --> 00:07:39.910
to cede control of their main asset

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.159
back to the users?

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:42.860
It's possible, but I don't think it's something

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.180
that we're going to see change quickly.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.680
So I think the other path

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.968
that we can go down that's
going to be more effective

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.476
is one of more science.

00:07:50.476 --> 00:07:52.986
It's doing science that allowed us to develop

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:54.736
all these mechanisms for computing

00:07:54.736 --> 00:07:56.788
this personal data in the first place.

00:07:56.788 --> 00:07:58.894
And it's actually very similar research

00:07:58.894 --> 00:08:00.332
that we'd have to do

00:08:00.332 --> 00:08:02.718
if we want to develop mechanisms

00:08:02.718 --> 00:08:04.139
that can say to a user,

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:06.368
"Here's the risk of that action you just took."

00:08:06.368 --> 00:08:08.448
By liking that Facebook page,

00:08:08.448 --> 00:08:10.983
or by sharing this piece of personal information,

00:08:10.983 --> 00:08:12.485
you've now improved my ability

00:08:12.485 --> 00:08:14.571
to predict whether or not you're using drugs

00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:17.433
or whether or not you get
along well in the workplace.

00:08:17.433 --> 00:08:19.281
And that, I think, can affect whether or not

00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:20.791
people want to share something,

00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:24.030
keep it private, or just keep it offline altogether.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.593
We can also look at things like

00:08:25.593 --> 00:08:28.321
allowing people to encrypt data that they upload,

00:08:28.321 --> 00:08:30.176
so it's kind of invisible and worthless

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.607
to sites like Facebook

00:08:31.607 --> 00:08:34.236
or third party services that access it,

00:08:34.236 --> 00:08:37.483
but that select users who the person who posted it

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:40.153
want to see it have access to see it.

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:42.319
This is all super exciting research

00:08:42.319 --> 00:08:43.939
from an intellectual perspective,

00:08:43.939 --> 00:08:45.798
and so scientists are going to be willing to do it.

00:08:45.798 --> 00:08:49.408
So that gives us an advantage over the law side.

00:08:49.408 --> 00:08:51.133
One of the problems that people bring up

00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:52.728
when I talk about this is, they say,

00:08:52.728 --> 00:08:55.374
you know, if people start
keeping all this data private,

00:08:55.374 --> 00:08:57.487
all those methods that you've been developing

00:08:57.487 --> 00:09:00.140
to predict their traits are going to fail.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.660
And I say, absolutely, and for me, that's success,

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.446
because as a scientist,

00:09:05.446 --> 00:09:09.134
my goal is not to infer information about users,

00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:11.901
it's to improve the way people interact online.

00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:15.119
And sometimes that involves
inferring things about them,

00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:18.141
but if users don't want me to use that data,

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.179
I think they should have the right to do that.

00:09:20.179 --> 00:09:22.830
I want users to be informed and consenting

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.942
users of the tools that we develop.

00:09:24.942 --> 00:09:27.894
And so I think encouraging this kind of science

00:09:27.894 --> 00:09:29.240
and supporting researchers

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.263
who want to cede some of that control back to users

00:09:32.263 --> 00:09:34.574
and away from the social media companies

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.245
means that going forward, as these tools evolve

00:09:37.245 --> 00:09:38.721
and advance,

00:09:38.721 --> 00:09:40.135
means that we're going to have an educated

00:09:40.135 --> 00:09:41.829
and empowered user base,

00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:42.929
and I think all of us can agree

00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:45.493
that that's a pretty ideal way to go forward.

00:09:45.493 --> 00:09:47.677
Thank you.

00:09:47.677 --> 00:09:50.757
(Applause)
