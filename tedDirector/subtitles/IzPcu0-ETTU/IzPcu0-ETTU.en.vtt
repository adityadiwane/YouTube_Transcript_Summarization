Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.554
What I'm going to do is to just give a few notes,

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:23.370
and this is from a book I'm preparing called

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.795
"Letters to a Young Scientist."

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:27.946
I'd thought it'd be appropriate to

00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:33.035
present it, on the basis that I have had extensive experience

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:36.731
in teaching, counseling scientists across a broad array of fields.

00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:42.130
And you might like to hear some of the principles that I've developed in doing

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.811
that teaching and counseling.

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:46.709
So let me begin by urging you,

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:49.258
particularly you on the youngsters' side,

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:51.234
on this path you've chosen,

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:53.138
to go as far as you can.

00:00:53.138 --> 00:00:56.606
The world needs you, badly.

00:00:56.606 --> 00:01:01.124
Humanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age.

00:01:01.124 --> 00:01:03.603
There is going to be no turning back.

00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:08.528
Although varying among disciplines -- say, astrophysics,

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:12.490
molecular genetics, the immunology, the microbiology, the public

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.684
health, to the new area of the human body as a symbiont,

00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:21.165
to public health, environmental science.

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:24.281
Knowledge in medical science and science overall

00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:27.418
is doubling every 15 to 20 years.

00:01:27.418 --> 00:01:30.506
Technology is increasing at a comparable rate.

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:33.490
Between them, the two already pervade,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.354
as most of you here seated realize,

00:01:36.354 --> 00:01:38.739
every dimension of human life.

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:43.795
So swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution,

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:48.522
so startling in its countless twists and turns, that no one can predict

00:01:48.522 --> 00:01:52.970
its outcome even a decade from the present moment.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.667
There will come a time, of course,

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:58.418
when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge,

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:00.554
which actually began in the 1600s,

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:03.370
has to peak and level off,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.618
but that's not going to matter to you.

00:02:04.618 --> 00:02:05.932
The revolution is going to continue

00:02:05.932 --> 00:02:08.890
for at least several more decades.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.634
It'll render the human condition

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:12.980
radically different from what it is today.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.298
Traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow

00:02:19.298 --> 00:02:24.123
and in so doing, inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines.

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:27.970
In time, all of science will come to be

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.426
a continuum of description, an explanation of networks, of principles and laws.

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:36.626
That's why you need not just be training

00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:41.066
in one specialty, but also acquire breadth in other fields,

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:44.754
related to and even distant from your own initial choice.

00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:48.699
Keep your eyes lifted and your head turning.

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.764
The search for knowledge is in our genes.

00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:55.276
It was put there by our distant ancestors

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:56.899
who spread across the world,

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.594
and it's never going to be quenched.

00:02:58.594 --> 00:03:01.787
To understand and use it sanely,

00:03:01.787 --> 00:03:05.746
as a part of the civilization yet to evolve

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:11.588
requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you.

00:03:11.588 --> 00:03:15.626
In education, medicine, law, diplomacy,

00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:19.914
government, business and the media that exist today.

00:03:19.914 --> 00:03:24.874
Our political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific

00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:27.970
literacy, which most badly lack today --

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.514
no applause, please.

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:31.972
It will be better for all

00:03:31.972 --> 00:03:36.643
if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job.

00:03:36.643 --> 00:03:39.802
Therefore you will do well to act on the side,

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:42.507
no matter how far into the laboratory

00:03:42.507 --> 00:03:45.826
you may go, to serve as teachers

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:47.834
during the span of your career.

00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:49.909
I'll now proceed quickly,

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.098
and before else, to a subject that is both a vital asset

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:56.530
and a potential barrier to a scientific career.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.010
If you are a bit short in mathematical skills,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.339
don't worry.

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.850
Many of the most successful scientists

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.050
at work today are mathematically semi-literate.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.535
A metaphor will serve here:

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:16.538
Where elite mathematicians and statisticians

00:04:16.538 --> 00:04:21.603
and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm

00:04:21.603 --> 00:04:25.306
of science, the remaining large majority of

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:30.018
basic applied scientists, including a large portion of those who could be

00:04:30.018 --> 00:04:35.370
said to be of the first rank, are the ones who map the terrain, they scout

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.122
the frontiers, they cut the pathways,

00:04:38.122 --> 00:04:40.858
they raise the buildings along the way.

00:04:40.858 --> 00:04:44.034
Some may have considered me foolhardy,

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:47.795
but it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics

00:04:47.795 --> 00:04:49.858
when talking to candidate scientists.

00:04:49.858 --> 00:04:53.658
During 41 years of teaching biology at Harvard,

00:04:53.658 --> 00:04:57.775
I watched sadly as bright students turned away

00:04:57.775 --> 00:05:00.699
from the possibility of a scientific career

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.427
or even from taking non-required courses in science

00:05:04.427 --> 00:05:06.258
because they were afraid of failure.

00:05:06.258 --> 00:05:09.618
These math-phobes deprive science and medicine

00:05:09.618 --> 00:05:12.867
of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent.

00:05:12.867 --> 00:05:16.818
Here's how to relax your anxieties, if you have them:

00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:19.410
Understand that mathematics is a language

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.234
ruled like other verbal languages,

00:05:23.234 --> 00:05:26.233
or like verbal language generally, by its own grammar

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:28.138
and system of logic.

00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:30.996
Any person with average quantitative intelligence

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:34.138
who learns to read and write mathematics

00:05:34.138 --> 00:05:40.890
at an elementary level will, as in verbal language, have little difficulty

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.954
picking up most of the fundamentals

00:05:42.954 --> 00:05:48.291
if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science.

00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:52.074
The longer you wait to become at least semi-literate

00:05:52.074 --> 00:05:58.082
the harder the language of mathematics will be to master, just as again in any verbal

00:05:58.082 --> 00:06:01.059
language, but it can be done at any age.

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:02.770
I speak as an authority

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.621
on that subject, because I'm an extreme case.

00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:10.282
I didn't take algebra until my freshman year

00:06:10.282 --> 00:06:12.313
at the University of Alabama.

00:06:12.313 --> 00:06:14.634
They didn't teach it before then.

00:06:14.634 --> 00:06:19.538
I finally got around to calculus as a 32-year-old tenured professor at Harvard,

00:06:19.538 --> 00:06:24.164
where I sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students,

00:06:24.164 --> 00:06:26.594
little more than half my age.

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:28.066
A couple of them were students

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:31.322
in a course I was giving on evolutionary biology.

00:06:31.322 --> 00:06:36.578
I swallowed my pride, and I learned calculus.

00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:39.674
I found out that in science and all its applications,

00:06:39.674 --> 00:06:43.636
what is crucial is not that technical ability,

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:46.805
but it is imagination in all of its applications.

00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:51.139
The ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.075
pictured by intuition.

00:06:54.075 --> 00:06:58.419
I found out that advances in science rarely come upstream

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:01.451
from an ability to stand at a blackboard

00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:04.586
and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions

00:07:04.586 --> 00:07:06.442
and equations.

00:07:06.442 --> 00:07:11.874
They are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work,

00:07:11.874 --> 00:07:16.434
during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant.

00:07:16.434 --> 00:07:21.633
Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied

00:07:21.633 --> 00:07:23.050
for its own sake.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:28.691
Of foremost importance is a thorough, well-organized knowledge

00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:35.340
of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.780
you propose to enter.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.906
When something new is discovered,

00:07:38.906 --> 00:07:43.875
it's logical then that one of the follow-up steps is

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:48.027
to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward.

00:07:48.027 --> 00:07:50.579
If that step proves too difficult for

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:54.751
the person or team that made the discovery,

00:07:54.751 --> 00:08:00.050
a mathematician can then be added by them

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.347
as a collaborator.

00:08:02.347 --> 00:08:04.506
Consider the following principle,

00:08:04.506 --> 00:08:09.706
which I will modestly call Wilson's Principle Number One:

00:08:09.706 --> 00:08:14.106
It is far easier for scientists

00:08:14.106 --> 00:08:18.675
including medical researchers, to require needed collaboration

00:08:18.675 --> 00:08:20.793
in mathematics and statistics

00:08:20.793 --> 00:08:24.474
than it is for mathematicians and statisticians

00:08:24.474 --> 00:08:28.570
to find scientists able to make use of their equations.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.664
It is important in choosing the direction to take in science

00:08:32.664 --> 00:08:38.410
to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply,

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:40.050
and focus on that.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:44.746
Keep in mind, then, Wilson's Second Principle:

00:08:44.746 --> 00:08:49.282
For every scientist, whether researcher, technician,

00:08:49.282 --> 00:08:52.377
teacher, manager or businessman,

00:08:52.377 --> 00:08:56.364
working at any level of mathematical competence,

00:08:56.364 --> 00:08:59.818
there exists a discipline in science or medicine

00:08:59.818 --> 00:09:03.754
for which that level is enough to achieve excellence.

00:09:03.754 --> 00:09:06.314
Now I'm going to offer quickly

00:09:06.314 --> 00:09:08.722
several more principles that will be useful

00:09:08.722 --> 00:09:11.410
in organizing your education and career,

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:15.795
or if you're teaching, how you might

00:09:15.795 --> 00:09:20.683
enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists.

00:09:20.683 --> 00:09:24.482
In selecting a subject in which to conduct original research,

00:09:24.482 --> 00:09:27.682
or to develop world-class expertise,

00:09:27.682 --> 00:09:33.010
take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.722
Judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:39.258
are on hand.

00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:42.908
This is not to de-emphasize the essential requirement

00:09:42.908 --> 00:09:46.347
of broad training, or the value of apprenticing yourself

00:09:46.347 --> 00:09:50.810
in ongoing research to programs of high quality.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:55.538
It is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful

00:09:55.538 --> 00:09:59.426
programs, and to make friends and colleagues of your age

00:09:59.426 --> 00:10:01.282
for mutual support.

00:10:01.282 --> 00:10:03.970
But through it all, look for a way to break out,

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.906
to find a field and subject not yet popular.

00:10:07.906 --> 00:10:11.683
We have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine.

00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:16.794
There is the quickest way advances are likely to occur,

00:10:16.794 --> 00:10:20.411
as measured in discoveries per investigator per year.

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:22.018
You may have heard the

00:10:22.018 --> 00:10:25.778
military dictum for the gathering of armies:

00:10:25.778 --> 00:10:28.499
March to the sound of the guns.

00:10:28.499 --> 00:10:35.009
In science, the exact opposite is the case: March away from the sound of the guns.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:37.714
So Wilson's Principle Number Three:

00:10:37.714 --> 00:10:41.058
March away from the sound of the guns.

00:10:41.058 --> 00:10:42.922
Observe from a distance,

00:10:42.922 --> 00:10:45.019
but do not join the fray.

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:47.387
Make a fray of your own.

00:10:47.387 --> 00:10:51.642
Once you have settled on a specialty,

00:10:51.642 --> 00:10:56.922
and the profession you can love, and you've secured opportunity,

00:10:56.922 --> 00:11:02.203
your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.883
enough to become an expert.

00:11:04.883 --> 00:11:08.210
There are thousands of professionally delimited

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.686
subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry

00:11:10.686 --> 00:11:12.602
to biology and medicine.

00:11:12.602 --> 00:11:15.498
And on then into the social sciences,

00:11:15.498 --> 00:11:18.700
where it is possible in short time to acquire

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.274
the status of an authority.

00:11:21.274 --> 00:11:24.786
When the subject is still very thinly populated,

00:11:24.786 --> 00:11:27.407
you can with diligence and hard work become

00:11:27.407 --> 00:11:29.618
the world authority.

00:11:29.618 --> 00:11:33.579
The world needs this kind of expertise,

00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:35.754
and it rewards the kind of people

00:11:35.754 --> 00:11:37.906
willing to acquire it.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:42.402
The existing information and what you self-discover

00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:46.513
may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect

00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:48.549
to other bodies of knowledge.

00:11:48.549 --> 00:11:50.418
Well, if that's the case,

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:54.560
good. Why hard instead of easy?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.415
The answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four.

00:11:59.415 --> 00:12:02.834
In the attempt to make scientific discoveries,

00:12:02.834 --> 00:12:04.827
every problem is an opportunity,

00:12:04.827 --> 00:12:06.322
and the more difficult the problem,

00:12:06.322 --> 00:12:09.082
the greater will be the importance of its solution.

00:12:09.082 --> 00:12:12.890
Now this brings me to a basic categorization

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.765
in the way scientific discoveries are made.

00:12:15.765 --> 00:12:19.129
Scientists, pure mathematicians among them,

00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:22.396
follow one or the other of two pathways:

00:12:22.396 --> 00:12:24.506
First through early discoveries,

00:12:24.506 --> 00:12:26.650
a problem is identified

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.482
and a solution is sought.

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:31.011
The problem may be relatively small;

00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:36.432
for example, where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread?

00:12:36.432 --> 00:12:42.338
Or larger, what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe?

00:12:42.338 --> 00:12:46.797
As the answer is sought, other phenomena are typically discovered

00:12:46.797 --> 00:12:48.442
and other questions are asked.

00:12:48.442 --> 00:12:51.458
This first of the two strategies is like a hunter,

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:55.707
exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry,

00:12:55.707 --> 00:12:58.626
who finds other quarries along the way.

00:12:58.626 --> 00:13:01.458
The second strategy of research

00:13:01.458 --> 00:13:03.250
is to study a subject broadly

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:08.026
searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena

00:13:08.026 --> 00:13:11.827
like a hunter in what we call "the naturalist's trance,"

00:13:11.827 --> 00:13:15.490
the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting,

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.874
any quarry worth taking.

00:13:16.874 --> 00:13:19.227
The search is not for the solution of the problem,

00:13:19.227 --> 00:13:22.434
but for problems themselves worth solving.

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:24.426
The two strategies of research,

00:13:24.426 --> 00:13:27.611
original research, can be stated as follows,

00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:31.899
in the final principle I'm going to offer you:

00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:36.163
For every problem in a given discipline of science,

00:13:36.163 --> 00:13:39.738
there exists a species or entity or phenomenon

00:13:39.738 --> 00:13:41.684
ideal for its solution.

00:13:41.684 --> 00:13:47.082
And conversely, for every species or other entity

00:13:47.082 --> 00:13:50.018
or phenomenon, there exist important problems

00:13:50.018 --> 00:13:57.595
for the solution of which, those particular objects of research are ideally suited.

00:13:57.595 --> 00:13:59.532
Find out what they are.

00:13:59.532 --> 00:14:02.667
You'll find your own way to discover,

00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:04.850
to learn, to teach.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:08.283
The decades ahead will see dramatic advances

00:14:08.283 --> 00:14:12.850
in disease prevention, general health, the quality of life.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:18.875
All of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science

00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:20.458
behind it you will master.

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:23.922
You have chosen a calling that will come in steps

00:14:23.922 --> 00:14:29.333
to give you satisfaction, at its conclusion, of a life well lived.

00:14:29.333 --> 00:14:31.946
And I thank you for having me here tonight.

00:14:31.946 --> 00:14:37.314
(Applause)

00:14:37.314 --> 00:14:38.586
Oh, thank you.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:45.742
Thank you very much.

00:14:45.742 --> 00:14:50.274
I salute you.
