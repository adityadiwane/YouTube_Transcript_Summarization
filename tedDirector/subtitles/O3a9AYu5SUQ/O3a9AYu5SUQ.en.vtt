00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.040
I'm an underwater explorer,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.280
more specifically a cave diver.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.816
I wanted to be an astronaut
when I was a little kid,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.440
but growing up in Canada as a young girl,
that wasn't really available to me.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.456
But as it turns out,
we know a lot more about space

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.816
than we do about the underground waterways
coursing through our planet,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.800
the very lifeblood of Mother Earth.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.096
So I decided to do something
that was even more remarkable.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.576
Instead of exploring outer space,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.760
I wanted to explore
the wonders of inner space.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.576
Now, a lot of people will tell you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.720
that cave diving is perhaps
one of the most dangerous endeavors.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.456
I mean, imagine yourself
here in this room,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.376
if you were suddenly
plunged into blackness,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.816
with your only job to find the exit,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.176
sometimes swimming
through these large spaces,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.536
and at other times
crawling beneath the seats,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.096
following a thin guideline,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.856
just waiting for the life support
to provide your very next breath.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.600
Well, that's my workplace.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.736
But what I want to teach you today

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.136
is that our world
is not one big solid rock.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.120
It's a whole lot more like a sponge.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.816
I can swim through a lot of the pores
in our earth's sponge,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.256
but where I can't,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.296
other life-forms and other materials
can make that journey without me.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.336
And my voice is the one
that's going to teach you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.280
about the inside of Mother Earth.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.616
There was no guidebook available to me

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.696
when I decided to be the first person
to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.136
In 2000, this was the largest
moving object on the planet.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.176
It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.136
and we went down there
to explore ice edge ecology

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.800
and search for life-forms beneath the ice.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.616
We use a technology called rebreathers.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.856
It's an awful lot like the same technology
that is used for space walks.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.336
This technology enables us to go deeper

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.096
than we could've imagined
even 10 years ago.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.176
We use exotic gases,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.400
and we can make missions
even up to 20 hours long underwater.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.336
I work with biologists.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.896
It turns out that caves
are repositories of amazing life-forms,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.720
species that we never knew existed before.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.056
Many of these life-forms
live in unusual ways.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.016
They have no pigment
and no eyes in many cases,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.536
and these animals
are also extremely long-lived.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.016
In fact, animals swimming
in these caves today

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.536
are identical in the fossil record

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.896
that predates the extinction
of the dinosaurs.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.656
So imagine that: these are
like little swimming dinosaurs.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.120
What can they teach us
about evolution and survival?

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.136
When we look at an animal
like this remipede swimming in the jar,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.016
he has giant fangs with venom.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.296
He can actually attack something
40 times his size and kill it.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.096
If he were the size of a cat,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.720
he'd be the most dangerous
thing on our planet.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.176
And these animals live
in remarkably beautiful places,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.816
and in some cases,
caves like this, that are very young,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.576
yet the animals are ancient.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.880
How did they get there?

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.056
I also work with physicists,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.696
and they're interested oftentimes
in global climate change.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.016
They can take rocks within the caves,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.096
and they can slice them
and look at the layers within with rocks,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.056
much like the rings of a tree,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.096
and they can count back in history

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.816
and learn about the climate on our planet
at very different times.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.336
The red that you see in this photograph

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.696
is actually dust from the Sahara Desert.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.816
So it's been picked up by wind,
blown across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.216
It's rained down in this case
on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.856
It soaks in through the ground

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.856
and deposits itself
in the rocks within these caves.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.696
And when we look back in the layers
of these rocks, we can find times

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.496
when the climate
was very, very dry on earth,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.279
and we can go back
many hundreds of thousands of years.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.816
Paleoclimatologists are also interested

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.136
in where the sea level stands were
at other times on earth.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.376
Here in Bermuda, my team and I embarked

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.456
on the deepest manned dives
ever conducted in the region,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.096
and we were looking for places

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.656
where the sea level
used to lap up against the shoreline,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.520
many hundreds of feet
below current levels.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.376
I also get to work with paleontologists
and archaeologists.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.776
In places like Mexico,
in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.496
we're looking at cultural remains
and also human remains in caves,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.776
and they tell us a lot

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.880
about some of the earliest
inhabitants of these regions.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.256
But my very favorite project of all
was over 15 years ago,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.804
when I was a part of the team
that made the very first

00:05:16.828 --> 00:05:20.136
accurate, three-dimensional map
of a subterranean surface.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.536
This device that I'm
driving through the cave

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.016
was actually creating
a three-dimensional model as we drove it.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.096
We also used ultra low frequency radio

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.800
to broadcast back to the surface
our exact position within the cave.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.136
So I swam under houses and businesses
and bowling alleys and golf courses,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.320
and even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.176
Pretty remarkable, and what that taught me

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.096
was that everything we do
on the surface of our earth

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.536
will be returned to us to drink.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.336
Our water planet is not just
rivers, lakes and oceans,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.136
but it's this vast network of groundwater
that knits us all together.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.016
It's a shared resource
from which we all drink.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.336
And when we can understand
our human connections with our groundwater

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.016
and all of our water resources
on this planet,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.776
then we'll be working on the problem

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.160
that's probably the most important
issue of this century.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.456
So I never got to be that astronaut
that I always wanted to be,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.096
but this mapping device,
designed by Dr. Bill Stone, will be.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.536
It's actually morphed.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.856
It's now a self-swimming autonomous robot,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.536
artificially intelligent,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.136
and its ultimate goal
is to go to Jupiter's moon Europa

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.760
and explore oceans beneath
the frozen surface of that body.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.400
And that's pretty amazing.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.880
(Applause)
