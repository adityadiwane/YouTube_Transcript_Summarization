00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I grew up in Mobile, Alabama --

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? --

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
forming this beautiful delta.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And the delta has alligators crawling

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
in and out of rivers filled with fish

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and cypress trees dripping with snakes,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
birds of every flavor.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in --

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And I remember my first real contact with octopus

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
was probably at age five or six.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.260
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
and started flashing colors,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
just pulsing all of these colors.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
raised into a spherical shape

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
so I put him down.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.260
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing:

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
It landed on the bottom in the rubble

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and -- fwoosh! -- vanished

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.260
right before my eyes.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And I knew, right then, at age six,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
at the University of Hawaii.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
but not a lot of invertebrate displays,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and being the spineless guy, I thought, well

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
I had been learning about as a student

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
but they didn't really interact with people.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
But the octopus did.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
If you walked up to an octopus tank,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
especially early in the morning before anyone arrived,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
the octopus would rise up and look at you

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.260
that these animals all have different personalities:

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Some of them would hold their ground,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.260
others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and one in particular, this amazing animal ...

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and he had little horns come up above his eyes.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
So I went right up to the front of the tank --

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
I was three or four inches from the front glass --

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and at that time I could actually focus that close;

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.260
now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Anyway, there we were, staring at each other,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
from the filtration system,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it --

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
because I was out and he had six left. (Laughter)

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.260
But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
was that this octopus was playing,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
So, about three years into my degree,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
a funny thing happened on the way to the office,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
which actually changed the course of my life.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
to collect animals for him,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
He said, "Make a movie about this expedition."

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
"OK, a couple of biologists making a movie --

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.260
this'll be interesting,"

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and off we went. And we did, we made a movie,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
which had to be the worst movie ever made

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
in the history of movie making,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
but it was a blast. I had so much fun.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
thinking, "Wait a minute.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Maybe I can do this all the time.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Yeah, I'll be a filmmaker."

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
So I literally came back from that job,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
quit school, hung my filmmaking shingle

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
It's been a good ride.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
If you're a wildlife filmmaker

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
and you're going out into the field to film animals,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
especially behavior,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
it helps to have a fundamental background

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
on who these animals are,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
But where I really learned about octopus

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
was in the field, as a filmmaker

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
making films with them,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
where you're allowed to spend large periods of time

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
with the animals, seeing octopus being octopus

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
in their ocean homes.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
I remember I took a trip to Australia,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
went to an island called One Tree Island.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And apparently, evolution had occurred

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
between the time they named it and the time I arrived,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
because I'm sure there were at least three trees

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
on that island when we were there.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Anyway, one tree is situated right next to

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
a beautiful coral reef.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
In fact, there's a surge channel

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
where the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And there's a beautiful reef,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
very complex reef, with lots of animals,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
including a lot of octopus.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And not uniquely

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
but certainly, the octopus in Australia

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
are masters at camouflage.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
As a matter of fact,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
there's one right there.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
So our first challenge was to find these things,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
and that was a challenge, indeed.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
But the idea is, we were there for a month

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
So the first week was pretty much spent

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
just getting as close as we could,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and you'd back up, come back in a few hours.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And after the first week, they ignored us.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
So they went on about their business

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and from a foot away, we're watching mating

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and courting and fighting

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and it is just an unbelievable experience.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And one of the most fantastic displays

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
that I remember, or at least visually,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
was a foraging behavior.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And they had a lot of different techniques

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
that they would use for foraging,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
but this particular one used vision.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And they would see a coral head,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
maybe 10 feet away,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and start moving over toward that coral head.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.260
And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and then the web between the arms

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
would completely engulf the coral head,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
and they would fish out, swim for crabs.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
And I always wondered what happened under that web.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
So we created a way to find out, (Laughter)

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
It was fantastic.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
you might as well pick one that's fairly common.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And octopus are, they live in all the oceans.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
They also live deep.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And I can't say octopus are responsible

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
for my really strong interest

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
in getting in subs and going deep,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
but whatever the case, I like that.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
It's like nothing you've ever done.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
If you ever really want to get away from it all

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and see something that you have never seen,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
and have an excellent chance of seeing something

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
no one has ever seen, get in a sub.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
turn on the scrubber,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Down you go. There's no connection to the surface

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
apart from a pretty funky radio.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And as you go down, the washing machine

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
at the surface calms down.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And it gets quiet.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And it starts getting really nice.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched in

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
gives way to darker and darker blue.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And finally, it's a rich lavender,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
And now you've entered the realm

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
of the mid-water community.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
You could give an entire talk

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
about the creatures that live in the mid-water.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
without question, the most bizarre designs

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
and outrageous behaviors

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
are in the animals that live in the mid-water community.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
But we're just going to zip right past this area,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
this area that includes about 95 percent

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
of the living space on our planet

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
some of which are tens of thousands of feet

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and bust through the surface,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
creating islands like Hawaii.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
And the top of this mountain range

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
is splitting apart, creating a rift valley.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
because literally thousands of active volcanoes

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
are going off at any point in time

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
all along this 40,000 mile range.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
and you're looking land -- new land --

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
being created right before your eyes.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
creating enormous pressure,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
until it hits a magma chamber

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
where it becomes superheated

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and supersaturated with minerals,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
In fact, this whole area

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
So it immediately cools,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
and it can no longer hold in suspension

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
all of the material that it's dissolved,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
and it precipitates out, forming black smoke.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And it forms these towers, these chimneys

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
that are 10, 20, 30 feet tall.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
And all along the sides of these chimneys

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
is shimmering with heat and loaded with life.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
You've got black smokers going all over the place

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
and chimneys that have tube worms

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
that might be eight to 10 feet long.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
And out of the tops of these tube worms

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
are these beautiful red plumes.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
is an entire community of animals:

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
clams and swarms of arthropods

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
that are playing that dangerous game

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And this whole ecosystem

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
wasn't even known about

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
until 33 years ago.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
And it completely threw science on its head.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
It made scientists rethink

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
where life on Earth might have actually begun.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
And before the discovery of these vents,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
But down there, there is no sun,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
there is no photosynthesis;

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
and it's all so ephemeral.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
You might film this

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
unbelievable hydrothermal vent,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
which you think at the time has to be on another planet.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
it looks like aliens in an alien environment.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
But you go back to the same vent eight years later

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
and it can be completely dead.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
There's no hot water.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
All of the animals are gone, they're dead,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
and the chimneys are still there

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
creating a really nice ghost town,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
an eerie, spooky ghost town,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
but essentially devoid of animals, of course.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
But 10 miles down the ridge...

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
pshhh! There's another volcano going.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
is going on every 30 or 40 years

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
all along the ridge.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
And that ephemeral nature

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
of the hydrothermal vent community

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
isn't really different from some of the

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
areas that I've seen

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
in 35 years of traveling around, making films.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And you go back, and I'm at home,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
Ah! I know where I can shoot that.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods."

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
And you show up, and it's dead.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
You think, "Well, what happened?"

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
And you turn around,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
And over here

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
there's a golf course going in.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And this is the tropics.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
It's raining like crazy here.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
carrying with it sediments from the construction site,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
smothering the coral and killing it.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
And fertilizers and pesticides

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
are flowing into the bay from the golf course --

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom --

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
and there's your pea soup.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck,"

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
and go and work on the other side of the island.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
Five years later, come back,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
It's got living coral, fish all over the place,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
Well, how it happened is

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
the local community galvanized.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it;

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
enacted laws and made permits required

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
to do responsible construction

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
and golf course maintenance

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
and the bay recovered.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
The ocean has an amazing ability

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
to recover, if we'll just leave it alone.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
I think Margaret Mead

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
said it best.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
She said that a small group of thoughtful people

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
could change the world.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
And a small group of thoughtful people

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
changed that bay.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
I've been to a lot of lectures

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
where, at the end of it, inevitably,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
one of the first questions that comes up is,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
"But, but what can I do?

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
I'm an individual. I'm one person.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming."

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
Fair enough question.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
My answer to that is don't look

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
at the big, overwhelming issues of the world.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
Look in your own backyard.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
Look in your heart, actually.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
What do you really care about that isn't right where you live?

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
And fix it.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
Create a healing zone in your neighborhood

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
and encourage others to do the same.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
little dots on a map.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
And in fact, the way that we can communicate today --

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
and the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ...

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
and everybody is talking to everyone else --

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
it's not isolated points on a map anymore,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
it's a network we've created.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
And maybe these healing zones can start growing,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
So that's how I answer that question.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
What can you do that is more responsible

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
than what you're doing now?

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
And do that, and spread the word.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
The vent community animals

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
can't really do much

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
about the life and death

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
that's going on where they live, but up here we can.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
And we can make changes to our behavior

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
that will influence and affect the environment,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
like those people changed the health of that bay.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
Now, Sylvia's TED Prize wish

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
was to beseech us to do anything we could,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
everything we could,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
to set aside not pin pricks,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
but significant expanses

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
of the ocean for preservation,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
"hope spots," she calls them.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
And it's my hope that some of these "hope spots"

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
can be in the deep ocean,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
an area that has historically

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
been seriously neglected, if not abused.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
The term "deep six" comes to mind:

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
"If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
deep six it!"

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
So, I hope that we can also keep

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
some of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
Now, I don't get a wish,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
but I certainly can say

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
that I will do anything I can

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
to support Sylvia Earle's wish.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
And that I do.
