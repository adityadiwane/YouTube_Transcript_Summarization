00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:15.424
The will to live life differently can start

00:00:15.424 --> 00:00:18.870
in some of the most unusual places.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.816
This is where I come from, Todmorden.

00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:22.836
It's a market town in the north of England,

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:25.507
15,000 people, between Leeds and Manchester,

00:00:25.507 --> 00:00:27.580
fairly normal market town.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.750
It used to look like this,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.498
and now it's more like this,

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:36.223
with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place.

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:40.940
We call it propaganda gardening. (Laughter)

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.955
Corner row railway, station car park,

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:47.707
front of a health center, people's front gardens,

00:00:47.707 --> 00:00:51.244
and even in front of the police station. (Laughter)

00:00:51.244 --> 00:00:54.234
We've got edible canal towpaths,

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:56.400
and we've got sprouting cemeteries.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.901
The soil is extremely good. (Laughter)

00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:05.144
We've even invented a new form of tourism.

00:01:05.144 --> 00:01:08.751
It's called vegetable tourism, and believe it or not,

00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:12.675
people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds,

00:01:12.675 --> 00:01:15.659
even when there's not much growing. (Laughter)

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.289
But it starts a conversation. (Laughter)

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.297
And, you know, we're not doing it because we're bored. (Laughter)

00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:28.114
We're doing it because we want to start a revolution.

00:01:28.114 --> 00:01:29.432
We tried to answer this simple question:

00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:32.322
Can you find a unifying language that cuts across age

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:36.539
and income and culture that will help people themselves

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.200
find a new way of living,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.325
see spaces around them differently,

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:42.928
think about the resources they use differently,

00:01:42.928 --> 00:01:44.921
interact differently?

00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:47.290
Can we find that language?

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.257
And then, can we replicate those actions?

00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:54.015
And the answer would appear to be yes,

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:57.418
and the language would appear to be food.

00:01:57.418 --> 00:01:59.437
So, three and a half years ago, a few of us

00:01:59.437 --> 00:02:01.056
sat around a kitchen table and

00:02:01.056 --> 00:02:04.424
we just invented the whole thing. (Laughter)

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:07.661
(Applause)

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.252
We came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting.

00:02:10.252 --> 00:02:12.565
We did not consult. We did not write a report.

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:15.140
Enough of all that. (Laughter)

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.158
And we said to that public meeting in Todmorden,

00:02:18.158 --> 00:02:21.104
look, let's imagine that our town

00:02:21.104 --> 00:02:22.860
is focused around three plates:

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.084
a community plate, the way we live our everyday lives;

00:02:25.084 --> 00:02:28.132
a learning plate, what we teach our kids in school

00:02:28.132 --> 00:02:30.893
and what new skills we share amongst ourselves;

00:02:30.893 --> 00:02:34.012
and business, what we do with the pound in our pocket

00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:35.833
and which businesses we choose to support.

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:38.640
Now, let's imagine those plates agitated

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.280
with community actions around food.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.521
If we start one of those community plates spinning,

00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:46.905
that's really great, that really starts to empower people,

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:48.992
but if we can then spin that community plate

00:02:48.992 --> 00:02:51.888
with the learning plate, and then spin it with the business plate,

00:02:51.888 --> 00:02:55.624
we've got a real show there, we've got some action theater.

00:02:55.624 --> 00:02:58.969
We're starting to build resilience ourselves.

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:02.360
We're starting to reinvent community ourselves,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.827
and we've done it all without a flipping strategy document.

00:03:05.827 --> 00:03:11.138
(Applause)

00:03:11.138 --> 00:03:13.930
And here's the thing as well.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.346
We've not asked anybody's permission to do this,

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:18.639
we're just doing it. (Laughter)

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.400
And we are certainly not waiting for that check

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.138
to drop through the letterbox before we start,

00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:25.470
and most importantly of all, we are not daunted

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.322
by the sophisticated arguments that say,

00:03:27.322 --> 00:03:31.218
"These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems,"

00:03:31.218 --> 00:03:34.886
because I have seen the power of small actions,

00:03:34.886 --> 00:03:36.957
and it is awesome.

00:03:36.957 --> 00:03:40.070
So, back to the public meeting. (Laughter)

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.959
We put that proposition to the meeting, two seconds,

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.667
and then the room exploded.

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:48.555
I have never, ever experienced anything like that in my life.

00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:51.937
And it's been the same in every single room, in every town

00:03:51.937 --> 00:03:53.492
that we've ever told our story.

00:03:53.492 --> 00:03:57.836
People are ready and respond to the story of food.

00:03:57.836 --> 00:04:00.093
They want positive actions they can engage in,

00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:02.692
and in their bones, they know it's time

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:04.581
to take personal responsibility

00:04:04.581 --> 00:04:07.152
and invest in more kindness to each other

00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:10.075
and to the environment.

00:04:10.075 --> 00:04:13.389
And since we had that meeting three and a half years ago,

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.639
it's been a heck of a roller coaster.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.535
We started with a seed swap, really simple stuff,

00:04:19.535 --> 00:04:21.784
and then we took an area of land, a strip on the side

00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:24.286
of our main road, which was a dog toilet, basically,

00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:27.640
and we turned it into a really lovely herb garden.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.926
We took the corner of the car park in the station

00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:31.661
that you saw, and we made vegetable beds

00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:35.185
for everybody to share and pick from themselves.

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:36.494
We went to the doctors. We've just had

00:04:36.494 --> 00:04:39.399
a 6-million-pound health center built in Todmorden,

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:42.087
and for some reason that I cannot comprehend,

00:04:42.087 --> 00:04:45.880
it has been surrounded by prickly plants. (Laughter)

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.969
So we went to the doctors, said, "Would you mind us taking them up?"

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.323
They said, "Absolutely fine, provided you get planning permission

00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:53.245
and you do it in Latin and you do it in triplicate,"

00:04:53.245 --> 00:04:56.035
so we did — (Laughter) — and now there are fruit trees

00:04:56.035 --> 00:04:59.330
and bushes and herbs and vegetables

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.560
around that doctor's surgery.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.836
And there's been lots of other examples, like the corn

00:05:04.836 --> 00:05:06.692
that was in front of the police station,

00:05:06.692 --> 00:05:08.509
and the old people's home that we've planted it with food

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.481
that they can pick and grow.

00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:12.191
But it isn't just about growing,

00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:14.736
because we all are part of this jigsaw.

00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:17.610
It's about taking those artistic people in your community

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.843
and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds

00:05:19.843 --> 00:05:21.914
to explain to people what's growing there,

00:05:21.914 --> 00:05:24.130
because there's so many people that don't really recognize

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.018
a vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic

00:05:26.018 --> 00:05:28.090
with a bit of an instruction packet on the top. (Laughter)

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.986
So we have some people who designed these things,

00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:33.003
"If it looks like this, please don't pick it, but if it looks like this,

00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:34.980
help yourself."

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.849
This is about sharing and investing in kindness.

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.706
And for those people that don't want to do either

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.705
of those things, maybe they can cook,

00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:44.578
so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street,

00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:46.811
or in the pub, or in the church,

00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:48.443
or wherever people are living their lives.

00:05:48.443 --> 00:05:50.985
This is about us going to the people and saying,

00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:53.394
"We are all part of the local food jigsaw,

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:56.049
we are all part of a solution."

00:05:56.049 --> 00:05:58.265
And then, because we know we've got vegetable tourists

00:05:58.265 --> 00:06:00.973
and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic,

00:06:00.973 --> 00:06:03.549
we thought, what could we do to give them an even better experience?

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:05.953
So we invented, without asking, of course,

00:06:05.953 --> 00:06:08.059
the Incredible Edible Green Route.

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:10.784
And this is a route of exhibition gardens,

00:06:10.784 --> 00:06:15.495
and edible towpaths, and bee-friendly sites, and the story

00:06:15.495 --> 00:06:18.363
of pollinators, and it's a route that we designed

00:06:18.363 --> 00:06:20.969
that takes people through the whole of our town,

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.188
past our cafes and our small shops, through our market,

00:06:24.188 --> 00:06:27.601
not just to and fro from the supermarket,

00:06:27.601 --> 00:06:29.899
and we're hoping that, in changing people's footfall

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:32.754
around our town, we're also changing their behavior.

00:06:32.754 --> 00:06:36.474
And then there's the second plate, the learning plate.

00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:38.054
Well, we're in partnership with a high school.

00:06:38.054 --> 00:06:41.127
We've created a company. We are designing and building

00:06:41.127 --> 00:06:43.175
an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare

00:06:43.175 --> 00:06:45.082
at the back of the high school, like you do,

00:06:45.082 --> 00:06:47.275
and now we're going to be growing fish and vegetables

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:49.824
in an orchard with bees,

00:06:49.824 --> 00:06:52.082
and the kids are helping us build that,

00:06:52.082 --> 00:06:54.895
and the kids are on the board, and because the community

00:06:54.895 --> 00:06:56.427
was really keen on working with the high school,

00:06:56.427 --> 00:06:59.795
the high school is now teaching agriculture,

00:06:59.795 --> 00:07:02.911
and because it's teaching agriculture, we started to think,

00:07:02.911 --> 00:07:05.694
how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification

00:07:05.694 --> 00:07:08.245
before in their lives but are really excited about growing,

00:07:08.245 --> 00:07:09.949
how can we give them some more experience?

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:11.908
So we got some land that was donated

00:07:11.908 --> 00:07:13.166
by a local garden center.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.500
It was really quite muddy, but in a truly incredible way,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.110
totally voluntary-led, we have turned that

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.307
into a market garden training center,

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:24.271
and that is polytunnels and raised beds

00:07:24.271 --> 00:07:26.975
and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers

00:07:26.975 --> 00:07:29.296
and think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future.

00:07:29.296 --> 00:07:31.504
And because we were doing that, some local academics said,

00:07:31.504 --> 00:07:32.836
"You know, we could help design

00:07:32.836 --> 00:07:34.608
a commercial horticulture course for you.

00:07:34.608 --> 00:07:36.003
There's not one that we know of."

00:07:36.003 --> 00:07:38.647
So they're doing that, and we're going to launch it later this year,

00:07:38.647 --> 00:07:41.232
and it's all an experiment, and it's all voluntary.

00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:42.851
And then there's the third plate,

00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:44.669
because if you walk through an edible landscape,

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:47.264
and if you're learning new skills, and if you start to get

00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:49.312
interested in what's growing seasonally,

00:07:49.312 --> 00:07:51.224
you might just want to spend more of your own money

00:07:51.224 --> 00:07:53.304
in support of local producers,

00:07:53.304 --> 00:07:55.056
not just veg, but meat and cheese and beer

00:07:55.056 --> 00:07:57.135
and whatever else it might be.

00:07:57.135 --> 00:07:59.872
But then, we're just a community group, you know.

00:07:59.872 --> 00:08:01.830
We're just all volunteers. What could we actually do?

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.580
So we did some really simple things.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.367
We fundraised, we got some blackboards,

00:08:05.367 --> 00:08:06.537
we put "Incredible Edible" on the top,

00:08:06.537 --> 00:08:08.713
we gave it every market trader that was selling locally,

00:08:08.713 --> 00:08:11.640
and they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.096
Really popular. People congregated around it.

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:15.744
Sales were up.

00:08:15.744 --> 00:08:18.740
And then, we had a chat with the farmers, and we said,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.717
"We're really serious about this,"

00:08:19.717 --> 00:08:22.135
but they didn't actually believe us, so we thought,

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:24.760
okay, what should we do? I know. If we can create

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.334
a campaign around one product and show them

00:08:27.334 --> 00:08:29.377
there is local loyalty to that product,

00:08:29.377 --> 00:08:31.720
maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.711
So we launched a campaign -- because it just amuses me --

00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:36.784
called Every Egg Matters. (Laughter)

00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:40.405
And what we did was we put people on our egg map.

00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:42.556
It's a stylized map of Togmorden.

00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:44.195
Anybody that's selling their excess eggs

00:08:44.195 --> 00:08:46.733
at the garden gate, perfectly legally, to their neighbors,

00:08:46.733 --> 00:08:49.150
we've stuck on there. We started with four,

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.424
and we've now got 64 on, and the result of that was

00:08:51.424 --> 00:08:52.924
that people were then going into shops

00:08:52.924 --> 00:08:55.605
asking for a local Todmorden egg, and the result of that

00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:57.894
was, some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got

00:08:57.894 --> 00:09:00.003
of free range birds, and then they went on to meat birds,

00:09:00.003 --> 00:09:02.584
and although these are really, really small steps,

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:07.273
that increasing local economic confidence

00:09:07.273 --> 00:09:09.850
is starting to play out in a number of ways,

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.152
and we now have farmers doing cheese

00:09:11.152 --> 00:09:12.941
and they've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs,

00:09:12.941 --> 00:09:14.349
they're doing pasties and pies and things

00:09:14.349 --> 00:09:16.722
that they would have never done before.

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:19.343
We've got increasing market stalls selling local food,

00:09:19.343 --> 00:09:23.557
and in a survey that local students did for us, 49 percent

00:09:23.557 --> 00:09:26.510
of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.916
had increased because of what we were actually doing.

00:09:28.916 --> 00:09:32.006
And we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment.

00:09:32.006 --> 00:09:33.410
(Laughter)

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.820
Now, none of this is rocket science.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.699
It certainly is not clever, and it's not original.

00:09:38.699 --> 00:09:42.506
But it is joined up, and it is inclusive.

00:09:42.506 --> 00:09:44.629
This is not a movement for those people

00:09:44.629 --> 00:09:46.551
that are going to sort themselves out anyway.

00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:47.885
This is a movement for everyone.

00:09:49.447 --> 00:09:53.313
We have a motto: If you eat, you're in. (Laughter)

00:09:53.313 --> 00:09:55.228
(Applause)

00:09:59.402 --> 00:10:04.479
Across age, across income, across culture.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:08.086
It's been really quite a roller coaster experience,

00:10:08.086 --> 00:10:08.634
but going back to that first question that we asked,

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:13.818
is it replicable? Yeah. It most certainly is replicable.

00:10:13.818 --> 00:10:16.632
More than 30 towns in England now are spinning

00:10:16.632 --> 00:10:18.760
the Incredible Edible plate.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.255
Whichever way they want to do it, of their own volition,

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:24.949
they're trying to make their own lives differently,

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:27.697
and worldwide, we've got communities across America

00:10:27.697 --> 00:10:29.441
and Japan -- it's incredible, isn't it? I mean,

00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:31.956
America and Japan and New Zealand.

00:10:31.956 --> 00:10:34.480
People after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.531
in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness

00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:42.183
around local growing into the heart of Christchurch.

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:45.030
And none of this takes more money

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.157
and none of this demands a bureaucracy,

00:10:48.157 --> 00:10:51.020
but it does demand that you think things differently

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.717
and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs

00:10:54.717 --> 00:10:56.845
in order to create that supportive framework

00:10:56.845 --> 00:10:59.559
that communities can bounce off.

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:02.475
And there's some great ideas already in our patch.

00:11:02.475 --> 00:11:05.259
Our local authority has decided to make everywhere

00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:07.921
Incredible Edible, and in support of that

00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:09.406
have decided to do two things.

00:11:09.406 --> 00:11:12.515
First, they're going to create an asset register of spare land

00:11:12.515 --> 00:11:14.746
that they've got, put it in a food bank so that communities

00:11:14.746 --> 00:11:16.482
can use that wherever they live,

00:11:16.482 --> 00:11:18.659
and they're going to underpin that with a license.

00:11:18.659 --> 00:11:21.040
And then they've said to every single one of their workforce,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.537
if you can, help those communities grow,

00:11:23.537 --> 00:11:25.650
and help them to maintain their spaces.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.689
Suddenly, we're seeing actions on the ground

00:11:27.689 --> 00:11:29.969
from local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed.

00:11:29.969 --> 00:11:34.394
We are responding creatively at last to what Rio demanded

00:11:34.394 --> 00:11:36.573
of us, and there's lots more you could do.

00:11:36.573 --> 00:11:38.933
I mean, just to list a few. One, please stop putting

00:11:38.933 --> 00:11:42.301
prickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space.

00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:45.703
(Laughter) Secondly, please create -- please, please create

00:11:45.703 --> 00:11:48.482
edible landscapes so that our children start to walk

00:11:48.482 --> 00:11:50.665
past their food day in, day out, on our high streets,

00:11:50.665 --> 00:11:53.251
in our parks, wherever that might be.

00:11:53.251 --> 00:11:56.945
Inspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart

00:11:56.945 --> 00:12:00.208
of the town and the city plan, not relegate them

00:12:00.208 --> 00:12:03.528
to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see.

00:12:03.528 --> 00:12:06.345
Encourage all our schools to take this seriously.

00:12:06.345 --> 00:12:08.578
This isn't a second class exercise.

00:12:08.578 --> 00:12:11.546
If we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow,

00:12:11.546 --> 00:12:14.595
then please let us say to every school,

00:12:14.595 --> 00:12:18.575
create a sense of purpose around the importance

00:12:18.575 --> 00:12:21.375
to the environment, local food and soils.

00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:23.262
Put that at the heart of your school culture,

00:12:23.262 --> 00:12:26.424
and you will create a different generation.

00:12:26.424 --> 00:12:28.863
There are so many things you can do, but ultimately

00:12:28.863 --> 00:12:31.151
this is about something really simple.

00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:34.776
Through an organic process, through

00:12:34.776 --> 00:12:39.063
an increasing recognition of the power of small actions,

00:12:39.063 --> 00:12:42.888
we are starting, at last, to believe in ourselves again,

00:12:42.888 --> 00:12:46.729
and to believe in our capacity, each and every one of us,

00:12:46.729 --> 00:12:51.122
to build a different and a kinder future,

00:12:51.122 --> 00:12:53.545
and in my book, that's incredible.

00:12:53.545 --> 00:12:57.410
Thank you. (Applause)

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:07.902
(Applause)

00:13:07.902 --> 00:13:11.724
Thank you very much. (Applause)
