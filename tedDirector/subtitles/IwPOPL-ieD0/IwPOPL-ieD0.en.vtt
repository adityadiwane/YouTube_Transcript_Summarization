00:00:18.437 --> 00:00:20.444
(Guitar music)

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:29.982
I was just thinking

00:00:32.118 --> 00:00:36.530
that I have been missing you way too long

00:00:37.526 --> 00:00:42.694
There's something inside this weary head

00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:47.744
that wants us to love just instead

00:00:47.768 --> 00:00:50.913
But I was just thinking,

00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:57.599
merely thinking

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:03.923
I've got loads of pictures,

00:01:05.912 --> 00:01:11.055
I've got the one of you
in that dancing dress

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.197
But man I feel silly in that dim light

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:21.654
Just after doing you
by the sight of my Kodak delights,

00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:26.050
I am sinking,

00:01:26.074 --> 00:01:29.131
merely sinking

00:01:33.535 --> 00:01:39.868
I think about long distance rates
instead of kissing you babe

00:01:39.892 --> 00:01:44.810
I'm a singer without a song

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.345
If I wait for you longer

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.799
my affection is stronger

00:01:50.823 --> 00:01:56.816
and I ... I was just thinking,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.256
merely thinking

00:02:04.203 --> 00:02:07.976
that this boat is sinking

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:22.674
I'm tired of postcards,

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:29.802
especially the ones
with cute dogs and cupids

00:02:30.527 --> 00:02:34.910
I'm tired of calling you and missing you

00:02:34.934 --> 00:02:37.815
and dreaming I slept with you

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:42.099
Don't get me wrong
I still desperately love you

00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:45.876
inside this weary head

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.560
I just want us to love just instead

00:02:50.584 --> 00:02:56.413
But I was just thinking and thinking,

00:02:56.437 --> 00:03:00.062
merely thinking

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.290
I think about long distance rates
instead of kissing you babe

00:03:10.314 --> 00:03:15.040
and time is running me still

00:03:15.064 --> 00:03:17.644
If I wait for you longer

00:03:17.668 --> 00:03:21.602
my affection is stronger

00:03:21.626 --> 00:03:26.922
I ... I was just thinking

00:03:30.873 --> 00:03:36.950
I ... I was just thinking

00:03:39.315 --> 00:03:43.631
that I'm tired of calling you once a week

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:49.981
thinking of long distance rates
instead of kissing you

00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:55.904
So baby I'm sinking,

00:03:55.928 --> 00:03:58.102
merely sinking

00:03:59.788 --> 00:04:01.788
(Guitar music ends)

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.513
(Applause)

00:04:09.865 --> 00:04:11.022
Thank you.

00:04:12.403 --> 00:04:14.579
Singing is sharing.

00:04:16.314 --> 00:04:20.608
When you sing, you have to know
what you're talking about intimately,

00:04:20.632 --> 00:04:23.918
and you have to be willing
to share this insight

00:04:23.942 --> 00:04:26.031
and give away a piece of yourself.

00:04:26.055 --> 00:04:30.568
I look for this intention
to share in everything,

00:04:30.592 --> 00:04:36.199
and I ask: what are the intentions
behind this architecture or this product

00:04:36.223 --> 00:04:38.274
or this restaurant or this meal?

00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:41.980
And if your intentions
are to impress people

00:04:42.004 --> 00:04:44.610
or to get the big applause at the end,

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:46.872
then you are taking, not giving.

00:04:48.193 --> 00:04:50.662
And this is a song that's about --

00:04:50.686 --> 00:04:53.384
it's the kind of song that everyone
has their version of.

00:04:53.408 --> 00:04:55.572
This song is called "Home,"

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:59.342
and it's sort of a "This is where
I'm from, nice to meet you all,"

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:00.518
kind of song.

00:05:00.542 --> 00:05:02.739
(Laughter)

00:05:02.763 --> 00:05:06.539
(Applause)

00:05:09.186 --> 00:05:11.186
(Piano music)

00:05:55.179 --> 00:06:01.262
Home is the sound of birds
early in the morning

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:06.545
Home is a song I've always remembered

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.564
Home is the memory
of my first day in school

00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:16.227
Home is the books that I carry around

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:20.732
Home is an alley in a faraway town

00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:26.584
Home is the places I’ve been
and where I’d like to go

00:06:30.742 --> 00:06:32.957
Home

00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:37.251
I'm always gonna feel at home

00:06:37.275 --> 00:06:41.885
No matter where I may roam

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.226
I'm always gonna find my way back home

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.051
No matter how far I’m gone

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:57.003
I’m always gonna feel this longing

00:06:57.027 --> 00:07:02.898
No matter where I might stay

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.695
Home is a feather twirling in the air

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:17.828
Home is flowers in a windowsill

00:07:17.852 --> 00:07:21.298
Home is all the things she said to me

00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:26.227
Home is a photo I never threw away

00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:31.640
Home is the smile on my face when I die

00:07:32.775 --> 00:07:37.949
Home is the taste of an apple pie

00:07:44.175 --> 00:07:50.660
I met a woman, she always lived
in the same place

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:57.373
And she said home is where
you’re born and raised

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.518
And I met a man, he sat
looking out to the sea

00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:13.600
And he said home is where you want to be

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.985
I met a girl in some downtown bar

00:08:23.877 --> 00:08:29.199
And she said I'll have
whatever he's having

00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:37.170
And I asked her how come
we never met before?

00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:45.346
And she said all my life I’ve been trying

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.107
to get a place of my own

00:08:49.582 --> 00:08:53.049
I’m always gonna feel at home

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.265
No matter where I may roam

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:02.777
Always gonna find my way back home

00:09:02.801 --> 00:09:06.331
No matter how far I’m gone

00:09:06.816 --> 00:09:12.478
I'm always gonna feel this longing

00:09:13.517 --> 00:09:19.185
No matter where I might stay

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:24.033
(Piano music)

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.840
(Piano music ends)

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:44.146
(Applause)
