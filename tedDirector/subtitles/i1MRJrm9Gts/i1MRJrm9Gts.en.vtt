00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.536
Tonight, I'm going to share with you
my passion for science.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.576
I'm not talking about science
that takes baby steps.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.856
I'm talking about science
that takes enormous leaps.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.256
I'm talking Darwin, I'm talking Einstein,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.880
I'm talking revolutionary science
that turns the world on its head.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.840
In a moment, I'm going to talk
about two ideas that might do this.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.016
I say "might"

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.816
because, with revolutionary ideas,
most are flat wrong,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.296
and even those that are right
seldom have the impact

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.016
that we want them to have.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.536
To explain why I picked
two ideas in particular,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.240
I'm going to start with a mystery.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.920
1847, Vienna, Austria.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.696
Ignaz Semmelweis was a somber,
compulsively thorough doctor

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.576
who ran two maternity clinics.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.040
They were identical except for one thing.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.376
Women were dying of high fevers
soon after giving birth

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.960
three times more often
at one of the clinics than at the other.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.536
Trying to figure out
what the difference was that caused this,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.576
Semmelweis looked at everything he could.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.336
Sanitation? No.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.360
Medical procedures? No.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.920
Air flow? No.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.056
The puzzle went unsolved
until he happened to autopsy a doctor

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.080
who died of an infected scalpel cut.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.536
The doctor's symptoms were identical
to those of the mothers who were dying.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.936
How was that possible?

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.840
How could a male doctor
get the same thing as new mothers?

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.816
Semmelweis reconstructed
everything the doctor had done

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.096
right before he got sick,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.416
and he discovered
that he'd been autopsying a corpse.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.240
Had something gotten
in his wound that killed him?

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.536
With growing excitement,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.376
Semmelweis looked
for any connection he could

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.776
between dead bodies in the morgue
and dead mothers in his delivery room,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.400
and he found it.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.176
It turned out that at the hospital
with the high death rate,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.976
but not the others,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.136
doctors delivered babies immediately
after autopsying corpses in the morgue.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.096
Aha! Corpses were contaminating
the doctors' hands

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.360
and killing his mothers.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.295
So he ordered the doctors
to sterilize their hands,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.600
and the deaths stopped.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.800
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis
had discovered infectious disease.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.816
But the doctors of the day
thought he was crazy,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.336
because they knew,
and had for hundreds of years,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.456
that odorous vapors
called miasmas caused disease,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.880
not these hypothetical particles
that you couldn't see.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.056
It took 20 years
for Frenchman Louis Pasteur

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.040
to prove that Semmelweis was right.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.376
Pasteur was an agricultural chemist

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.576
who tried to figure out
why milk and beer spoiled so often.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.040
He found that bacteria were the culprits.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.016
He also found that bacteria
could kill people in exactly the same way

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.360
that Semmelweis's patients were dying.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.520
We now look at what I want
to talk about tonight, in two ideas.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.520
We saw it with Semmelweis,
that he was a revolutionary.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.816
He did it for two reasons.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.080
One, he opened our eyes
to a completely new world.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.696
We'd known since the 1680s about bacteria.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.176
We just didn't know
that bacteria killed people.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.256
And he also demolished fond ideas
that people kept close to their heart.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.600
Miasmas didn't kill people.
Bacteria killed people.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.416
So this brings me to the two ideas
I want to talk about tonight.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.256
One has opened our eyes
to a completely new universe,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.256
and the other attacks long-held beliefs.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.216
Let's get started with Dr. Eric Betzig.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.136
He's a physicist who has opened our eyes
to an entirely new world

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.040
by violating the laws of physics.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.000
Betzig is a true rebel.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.456
He quit a job at prestigious
Bell Laboratory

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.736
inventing new microscopes for biology

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.096
because he thought scientists
were taking his brilliant inventions

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.640
and doing lousy work with them.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.920
So he became a househusband,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.936
but he never lost his passion
for figuring out

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.856
how to get microscopes
to see finer and finer details

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.357
than had ever been seen before
or ever could be seen.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.416
This is crucial if we're ever
going to understand how cells work,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.935
and how cancer works,

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:35.376
and how something
150th the size of a head of a pin

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.536
can do all these amazing things,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.136
like make proteins

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.056
and move charges around

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.360
and all of those things.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.080
There's just one problem.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.016
There's this thing
called the law of physics,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.496
and part of the law of physics
is the thing called the diffraction limit.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.896
The diffraction limit is kind of like
when you go to a doctor's office,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.056
you can only see so far down,
no matter how good glasses you have.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.456
This was a so-called impossible problem.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.656
But one of Betzig's friends
figured out how to take a tiny molecule

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.096
that was smaller than
the best microscope could see

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.256
and get it to light up and fluoresce.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.776
"Aha!" Betzig said.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.496
"I think maybe the laws of physics
are not so unbreakable after all."

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.376
So he lashed together a microscope
in his friend's living room.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.216
He had no laboratory.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.816
This revolutionary instrument
got different protein molecules

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.400
to light up in different colors,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.776
and with a computer, he was able
to turn very, very fuzzy blurs

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.496
into very sharp dots and produce images
of unprecedented and startling clarity.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.816
For this work, last year,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.440
Eric Betzig won the Nobel Prize.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.576
Why?

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.696
Because now we can see
with unprecedented detail

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.536
things that we never had seen before,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.400
and now doctors can get
a better handle on things like cancer.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.576
But do you think
Betzig was satisfied there?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.896
No.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.776
He wanted movies.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.016
The problem was

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.016
that even the genius microscopes
that he invented were just too slow.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.296
So what did he do?

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.896
He came up with a 200-year-old idea

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.616
called moirÃ© patterns.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.096
So the way that works is
if you take two very, very fine patterns

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.896
and you move them across each other,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.936
you will see a gross pattern

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.440
that a microscope can see

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.456
that otherwise you would not
be able to see.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.776
So he applied this technique
to taking a really blurry image of a cell

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.376
and moving lots of structured
light patterns across it

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.840
until this cell became crystal clear.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.856
And here is the result:

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.616
a mysterious new world,

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.776
full of strange things zipping around

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.200
doing things that
we don't know what they're doing.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.576
But when we figure it out,
we'll have a better handle on life itself.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.696
For example, those
green globs that you see?

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.400
Those things are called clathrins.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.376
They're molecules
that protect other molecules

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.776
as they move through a cell.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.136
Unfortunately, viruses sometimes
hijack those to infect cells.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.256
Also, you see those little squiggly
wormlike things moving around?

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.576
Those are actin molecules.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.016
Unfortunately, viruses
also climb down those things

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.496
to get into the cell nucleus

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.640
to replicate themselves and make you sick.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.096
Now that we can look at movies

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.976
of what's actually going on
deep inside a cell,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.080
we have a much better chance
of curing viral diseases like AIDS.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.536
So when you look at a movie like this,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.560
it's very clear that Betzig has opened
our eyes to a completely new world.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.680
But he hasn't shattered
any cherished beliefs.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.136
That leads us to Dr. Aubrey de Grey

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.360
at Cambridge.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.776
De Grey definitely has scientists
squirming with an interesting idea:

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.176
we can be immortal.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.816
We can beat aging.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.400
Now, most scientists
think he's a crackpot.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.616
Any Biology 101 student knows

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.656
that aging is an inevitable
consequence of living.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.776
For example, when we eat,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.656
we take in food and we metabolize it,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.056
and that throws off
what we call free radicals.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.536
You might have heard of those.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.496
Also known as oxygen ions,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.896
those bind to our DNA, cause it to mutate,

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.976
and cause us to get old and lose our hair.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.576
(Laughter)

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.336
It's just like, no, it's exactly like

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.536
oxygen binding to iron and making it rust.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.016
So you age because you rust out.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.216
(Laughter)

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.336
Oh, and scientists also know
there is something called immortality:

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.336
in cancer cells.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.656
So if you stop aging,

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.600
all of you are going to turn
into giant walking malignant tumors.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.840
These are cherished beliefs,
but could de Grey be on to something?

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.816
I think he deserves a closer look.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.976
First of all, I have a really hard time
seeing him as a crackpot.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.336
Yeah, he started off life
as a computer scientist,

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.856
not a biologist,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.696
but he earned a PhD
in biology from Cambridge,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.096
and he has published
some very significant work

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.576
on mitochondrial DNA
and a bunch of other stuff.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.696
Secondly, he started
an antiaging foundation

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.296
that has identified
seven different causes of aging,

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.576
to me, that seem very plausible,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.736
and he is hot in pursuit
of fixes for every single one of them.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.776
For example, one of the reasons we age
is that our mitochondrial DNA mutates,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.480
and we get kind of old
and our cells lose energy.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.496
He believes, and he's made
a convincing case,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.056
that using viruses we can do gene therapy,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.736
fix that DNA

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.480
and rejuvenate our cells.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.736
One more thing.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.616
We have an existent proof

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.360
that extreme longevity is possible.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.680
Bristlecone pine trees live 5,000 years,

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.520
and some lobsters don't age at all.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.976
Now, this doesn't mean that de Grey
is going to revolutionize our lifespans.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.816
I mean, after all, we're not trees,
and most of us are not lobsters.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.056
(Laughter)

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.880
But I've got to believe that there are
Darwins and Einsteins out there,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.216
and I'll tell you why.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.440
Consider this:

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.456
there are seven times more people
alive today than during Darwin's time.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.936
There are four times as many people
alive today as Einstein.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.176
When you consider

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.416
that the proportion of scientists
in the population has skyrocketed,

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.816
there are now seven million scientists.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.280
I've got to believe, and I do believe,
that there's one of them out there

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.056
who is working right now in obscurity

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.496
to rock our lives,
and I don't know about you,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.336
but I can't wait to be rocked.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.616
Thank you.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:46.601
(Applause)
