00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
on his first successful telephone call,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
"Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?"

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
(Laughter)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I just really want to thank you very much.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
As another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
"What a strange, long trip."

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And he should have said,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
"What a strange, long trip it's about to become."

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
At this very moment, you are viewing my upper half.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
My lower half is appearing at a different conference

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
(Laughter)

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
in a different country.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You can, it turns out, be in two places at once.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But still, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'll explain at another time.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And though I'm a rock star,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But what really turns me on about technology

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The revolution -- this revolution -- is much bigger than that.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I hope, I believe.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What turns me on about the digital age,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
what excites me personally,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
you needed a studio and a producer.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Now, you need a laptop.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If you wanted to make a film, you needed a mass of equipment

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and a Hollywood budget.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now, you need a camera that fits in your palm,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And that really, really excites me.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Political, economic, psychological, whatever.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
From the ease with which you swept away obstacles

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that no one knew could even be budged.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And that's actually what I'd like to talk about today.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
First, though, I should probably explain why, and how,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I got to this place.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's a journey that started 20 years ago.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
You may remember that song, "We Are the World,"

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
or, "Do They Know It's Christmas?"

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Band Aid, Live Aid.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Another very tall, grizzled rock star, my friend Sir Bob Geldof,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
issued a challenge to "feed the world."

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That summer, my wife, Ali, and myself went to Ethiopia.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The children had a name for me.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
They called me, "The girl with the beard."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
(Laughter)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Don't ask.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Anyway, we found Africa to be a magical place.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Big skies, big hearts, big, shining continent.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Beautiful, royal people.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Ethiopia didn't just blow my mind; it opened my mind.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Anyway, on our last day at this orphanage

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
a man handed me his baby and said,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
"Would you take my son with you?"

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
He knew, in Ireland, that his son would live,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and that in Ethiopia, his son would die.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
It was the middle of that awful famine.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Well, I turned him down.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And in that moment, I started this journey.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
In that moment, I became the worst thing of all:

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I became a rock star with a cause. (Laughter)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Except this isn't the cause, is it?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Six-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
a preventable, treatable disease --

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That's not a cause. That's an emergency.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
11 million AIDS orphans in Africa,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
20 million by the end of the decade.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
That's not a cause. That's an emergency.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Today, every day, 9,000 more Africans

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
That's not a cause. That's an emergency.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So what we're talking about here is human rights.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
The right to live like a human.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
The right to live, period.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And what we're facing in Africa is

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
The next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and what this problem isn't.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Because this is not all about charity.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
This is about justice. Really.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
This is not about charity. This is about justice.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
That's right.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And that's too bad, because we're very good at charity.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Americans, like Irish people, are good at it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
We like to give, and we give a lot.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Look at the response to the tsunami -- it's inspiring.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
But justice is a tougher standard than charity.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It makes a farce of our idea of equality.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It questions our commitment.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and if we're honest,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
As you heard in the film, anywhere else, not here.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Not here, not in America, not in Europe.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
In fact, a head of state that you're all familiar with

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
admitted this to me. And it's really true.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Africa is a continent in flames.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And deep down, if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
we would all do more to put the fire out.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
We're standing around with watering cans,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
when what we really need is the fire brigade.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
You see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It's crazy, really, when you think about it.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
to exist in the front of our brain?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The slow extinguishing of countless lives

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
is just not dramatic enough, it would appear.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Catastrophes that we can avert

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
are not as interesting as ones we could avert.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Funny, that.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Anyway, I believe that that kind of thinking

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
offends the intellectual rigor in this room.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Six-and-a-half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
but the fact that it's not on the nightly news,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that we in Europe, or you in America,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
are not treating it like an emergency --

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
it could be soon.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Every week, religious extremists take another African village.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
They're attempting to bring order to chaos.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Well, why aren't we?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Poverty breeds despair. We know this.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Despair breeds violence. We know this.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
In turbulent times, isn't it cheaper, and smarter,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to make friends out of potential enemies

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
than to defend yourself against them later?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
"The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty."

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Now when the military are telling us that this is a war

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that cannot be won by military might alone,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
maybe we should listen.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
There's an opportunity here, and it's real.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
The problems facing the developing world

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
afford us in the developed world

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
a chance to re-describe ourselves to the world.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
We will not only transform other people's lives,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
but we will also transform the way those other lives see us.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And that might be smart in these nervous, dangerous times.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Don't you think that on a purely commercial level,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
for Western ingenuity and technology?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Doesn't compassion look well on us?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And let's cut the crap for a second.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
In certain quarters of the world, brand EU, brand USA,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
is not at its shiniest.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
The neon sign is fizzing and cracking.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Someone's put a brick through the window.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
The regional branch managers are getting nervous.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Our values: do we have any?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Our credibility?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
These things are under attack around the world.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Brand USA could use some polishing.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And I say that as a fan, you know?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
As a person who buys the products.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
But think about it.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
More anti-retrovirals make sense.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
But that's just the easy part, or ought to be.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
But equality for Africa --

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
that's a big, expensive idea.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
You see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
What on earth can we all do about this?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Well, much more than we think.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
We can't fix every problem, but the ones we can,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
I want to argue, we must.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And because we can, we must.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
This is the straight truth, the righteous truth.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
It is not a theory.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
The fact is that ours is the first generation

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
look across the ocean to Africa, and say this, and mean it:

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
we do not have to stand for this.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
A whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:24.000
(Applause)

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And let me say this without a trace of irony --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Forget the '60s. We can change the world.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I can't; you can't, as individuals; but we can change the world.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I really believe that, the people in this room.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Look at the Gates Foundation.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
They've done incredible stuff, unbelievable stuff.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
But working together, we can actually change the world.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
We can turn the inevitable outcomes,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and transform the quality of life for millions of lives

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
who look and feel rather like us, when you're up close.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I'm sorry to laugh here, but you do look so different

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
than you did in Haight-Ashbury in the '60s.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
(Laughter)

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
It is the flowering of the seeds you planted

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
in earlier, headier days.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Ideas that you gestated in your youth.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
This is what excites me.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This room was born for this moment,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
is really what I want to say to you tonight.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Most of you started out wanting to change the world, didn't you?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Most of you did, the digital world.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Well, now, actually because of you,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
it is possible to change the physical world.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
It's a fact.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Economists confirm it, and they know much more than I do.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Probably because when we admit we can do something about it,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
we've got to do something about it.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
It is a pain in the arse.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
This equality business is actually a pain in the arse.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
But for the first time in history, we have the technology;

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
we have the know-how; we have the cash;

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
we have the life-saving drugs.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Do we have the will?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I hope this is obvious, but I'm not a hippie.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And I'm not really one for the warm, fuzzy feeling.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I do not have flowers in my hair.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Actually, I come from punk rock.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
The Clash wore big army boots, not sandals.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
But I know toughness when I see it.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
there was muscle to the movement that started out here.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
You see, idealism detached from action is just a dream.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
But idealism allied with pragmatism,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
is very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And it's very present in a crowd like you.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Last year at DATA, this organization I helped set up,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
we launched a campaign to summon this spirit

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
We're calling it the ONE Campaign.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
It's based on our belief that the action of one person

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
can change a lot,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
but the actions of many coming together as one

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
can change the world.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Well, we feel that now is the time to prove we're right.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
We believe this is one.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
This could be the time that we finally get serious

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Momentum has been building.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Lurching a little, but it's building.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
This year is a test for us all,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
especially the leaders of the G8 nations,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
who really are on the line here,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
with all the world in history watching.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I have been, of late, disappointed with the Bush Administration.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
They started out with such promise on Africa.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
They made some really great promises,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
and actually have fulfilled a lot of them.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
But some of them they haven't.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
They don't feel the push from the ground, is the truth.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
But my disappointment has much more perspective

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
when I talk to American people,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and I hear their worries about the deficit,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and the fiscal well being of their country.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I understand that.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
But there's much more push from the ground than you'd think,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
if we got organized.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
What I try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
is that aid for Africa is just great value for money

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
at a time when America really needs it.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Putting it in the crassest possible terms,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
the investment reaps huge returns.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Not only in lives saved, but in goodwill, stability

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and security that we'll gain.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
So this is what I hope that you will do, if I could be so bold,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
and not have it deducted from my number of wishes.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
(Laughter)

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
by America and by the world.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Give them permission, if you like,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
to spend their political capital and your financial capital,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
That's really what I would like you to do.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Because we also need your intellectual capital:

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
your ideas, your skills, your ingenuity.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And you, at this conference, are in a unique position.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Some of the technologies we've been talking about, you invented them,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
or at least revolutionized the way that they're used.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
and pushed the boundaries.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And we'd like you to give us that energy.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Give us that kind of dreaming, that kind of doing.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
As I say, there're two things on the line here.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
There's the continent Africa.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
But there's also our sense of ourselves.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
People are starting to figure this out.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Movements are springing up.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Artists, politicians, pop stars, priests, CEOs,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
NGOs, mothers' unions, student unions.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
A lot of people are getting together, and working

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
under this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I think they just have one idea in their mind,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
which is, where you live in the world

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
should not determine whether you live in the world.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
(Applause)

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
History, like God, is watching what we do.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
When the history books get written,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I think our age will be remembered for three things.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Really, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
The digital revolution, yes.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
The war against terror, yes.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Some say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:52.000
(Applause)

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Okay, my three wishes.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
The ones that TED has offered to grant.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
You see, if this is true, and I believe it is,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
that the digital world you all created has uncoupled

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
this should be a piece of piss.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
(Laughter)

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Most of them impossible, some of them impractical

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and one or two of them certainly immoral.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
(Laughter)

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
This business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
when somebody else is picking up the tab.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Anyway, here's number one.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000
I wish for you to help build a social movement

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
of more than one million American activists for Africa.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
That is my first wish.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
I believe it's possible.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
A few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
You know, there's lots out there.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
And with this one campaign as our umbrella,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
my organization, DATA, and other groups,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
that's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
We know there's more than enough energy to power this movement.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
We just need your help in making it happen.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
We want all of you here, church America, corporate America,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Microsoft America, Apple America, Coke America,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Pepsi America, nerd America, noisy America.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
I do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
we're not going to be denied.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
We will have the ear of Congress.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
We'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
and right into the Oval Office.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
If there's one million Americans -- and I really know this --

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
who are ready to make phone calls,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
who are ready to be on email,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
I am absolutely sure that we can actually change

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
the course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Anyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
but there's lots of you we'd like to talk to.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Right, my second wish, number two.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
I would like one media hit for every person on the planet

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
who is living on less than one dollar a day.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
That's one billion media hits.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Could be on Google, could be on AOL.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Steve Case, Larry, Sergey -- they've done a lot already.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
It could be NBC. It could be ABC.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
We have a film, produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
But you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
We need to get the math; we need to get the statistics out to the American people.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
I really believe that old Truman line,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
that if you give the American people the facts,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
they'll do the right thing.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
And, the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
This has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
(Video): One by one they step forward,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
a nurse, a teacher, a homemaker,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
and lives are saved.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
The problem is enormous.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Every three seconds one person dies.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Another three seconds, one more.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Asia, even America,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
that aid groups, just as they did for the tsunami,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
are uniting as one, acting as one.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
We can beat extreme poverty, starvation, AIDS.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
But we need your help.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
One more person, letter, voice

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
will mean the difference between life and death

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
for millions of people.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Please join us by working together.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Americans have an unprecedented opportunity.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
We can make history.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
We can start to make poverty history.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
One, by one, by one.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Please visit ONE at this address.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Bono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
by connecting every hospital, health clinic and school

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
in one African country.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
And I would like it to be Ethiopia.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
every health clinic, every hospital --

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
we can connect to the Internet.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
That is my wish, my third wish.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
I think it's possible.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
And that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
I've been to Ethiopia, as I said earlier.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
It's actually where it all started for me.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
The idea that the Internet, which changed all of our lives,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
can transform a country -- and a continent

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000
that has hardly made it to analog, let alone digital -- blows my mind.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
But it didn't start out that way.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
The first long-distance line from Boston to New York

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
was used in 1885 on the phone.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
was connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Since then, not that much has changed.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
is actually about seven or eight years.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
But wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Anyway, I'm Irish, and as you can see,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
I know how important talking is.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Communication is very important for Ethiopia -- will transform the country.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Nurses getting better training,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
pharmacists being able to order supplies,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
It's a very, very good idea to get them wired.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Thank you very much once again.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
(Applause)
