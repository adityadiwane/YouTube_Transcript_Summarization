00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.996
So I've been "futuring,"
which is a term I made up --

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.276
(Laughter)

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.516
about three seconds ago.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.356
I've been futuring for about 20 years,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.716
and when I first started,
I would sit down with people,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.636
and say, "Hey,
let's talk 10, 20 years out."

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.436
And they'd say, "Great."

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.956
And I've been seeing that time horizon

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.036
get shorter and shorter

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.676
and shorter,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.076
so much so that I met
with a CEO two months ago

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.476
and I said -- we started
our initial conversation.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.236
He goes, "I love what you do.
I want to talk about the next six months."

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.860
(Laughter)

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.996
We have a lot of problems
that we are facing.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.740
These are civilizational-scale problems.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.780
The issue though is,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.116
we can't solve them

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.716
using the mental models
that we use right now

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.316
to try and solve these problems.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.996
Yes, a lot of great
technical work is being done,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.396
but there is a problem that
we need to solve for a priori, before,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.220
if we want to really
move the needle on those big problems.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.716
"Short-termism."

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.196
Right? There's no marches.
There's no bracelets.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.076
There's no petitions that you can sign
to be against short-termism.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.916
I tried to put one up, and no one signed.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.156
It was weird.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.380
(Laughter)

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.116
But it prevents us from doing so much.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.836
Short-termism, for many reasons,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.756
has pervaded every
nook and cranny of our reality.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.356
I just want you to take a second

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.196
and just think about an issue
that you're thinking, working on.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.196
It could be personal, it could be at work

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.276
or it could be
move-the-needle world stuff,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.636
and think about
how far out you tend to think

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.180
about the solution set for that.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.156
Because short-termism prevents the CEO

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.820
from buying really
expensive safety equipment.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.716
It'll hurt the bottom line.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.540
So we get the Deepwater Horizon.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.956
Short-termism prevents teachers

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.516
from spending quality
one-on-one time with their students.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.676
So right now in America,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.540
a high school student
drops out every 26 seconds.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.916
Short-termism prevents Congress --

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.556
sorry if there's anyone
in here from Congress --

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.116
(Laughter)

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.196
or not really that sorry --

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.436
(Laughter)

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.636
from putting money
into a real infrastructure bill.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.276
So what we get
is the I-35W bridge collapse

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.116
over the Mississippi a few years ago,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.340
13 killed.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.340
It wasn't always like this.
We did the Panama Canal.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.676
We pretty much
have eradicated global polio.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.500
We did the transcontinental railroad,
the Marshall Plan.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.180
And it's not just big, physical
infrastructure problems and issues.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.636
Women's suffrage, the right to vote.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.436
But in our short-termist time,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.956
where everything seems to happen right now

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.476
and we can only think out
past the next tweet or timeline post,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.516
we get hyper-reactionary.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.820
So what do we do?

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.956
We take people who are fleeing
their war-torn country,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.236
and we go after them.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.876
We take low-level drug offenders,
and we put them away for life.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.276
And then we build McMansions
without even thinking

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.166
about how people are going
to get between them and their job.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.670
It's a quick buck.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.916
Now, the reality is,
for a lot of these problems,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.716
there are some technical fixes,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.956
a lot of them.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.516
I call these technical fixes
sandbag strategies.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.236
So you know there's a storm coming,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.996
the levee is broken,
no one's put any money into it,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.836
you surround your home with sandbags.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.660
And guess what? It works.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.436
Storm goes away,
the water level goes down,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.836
you get rid of the sandbags,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.380
and you do this storm
after storm after storm.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.220
And here's the insidious thing.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.836
A sandbag strategy

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.060
can get you reelected.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.516
A sandbag strategy

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.500
can help you make your quarterly numbers.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.036
Now, if we want to move forward

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.836
into a different future
than the one we have right now,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.916
because I don't think we've hit --

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.916
2016 is not peak civilization.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.276
(Laughter)

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.076
There's some more we can do.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.716
But my argument is that unless we shift
our mental models and our mental maps

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.076
on how we think about the short,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.796
it's not going to happen.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.796
So what I've developed
is something called "longpath,"

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.556
and it's a practice.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.516
And longpath isn't
a kind of one-and-done exercise.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.236
I'm sure everyone here
at some point has done an off-site

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.356
with a lot of Post-It notes
and whiteboards,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.276
and you do --

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.756
no offense to the consultants
in here who do that --

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.396
and you do a long-term plan,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.860
and then two weeks later,
everyone forgets about it.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.660
Right? Or a week later.
If you're lucky, three months.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.236
It's a practice because
it's not necessarily a thing that you do.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.036
It's a process where you have
to revisit different ways of thinking

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.476
for every major decision
that you're working on.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.980
So I want to go through
those three ways of thinking.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.340
So the first: transgenerational thinking.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.396
I love the philosophers:

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.236
Plato, Socrates, Habermas, Heidegger.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.460
I was raised on them.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.796
But they all did one thing

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.796
that didn't actually seem like a big deal

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.156
until I really started
kind of looking into this.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.996
And they all took,

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.916
as a unit of measure
for their entire reality

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.893
of what it meant to be virtuous and good,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.900
the single lifespan,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.980
from birth to death.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.516
But here's a problem with these issues:

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.956
they stack up on top of us,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.116
because the only way we know
how to do something good in the world

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.356
is if we do it between
our birth and our death.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.076
That's what we're programmed to do.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.556
If you go to the self-help section
in any bookstore,

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.820
it's all about you.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.076
Which is great,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.020
unless you're dealing
with some of these major issues.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.220
And so with transgenerational thinking,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.756
which is really kind of
transgenerational ethics,

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.396
you're able to expand
how you think about these problems,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.180
what is your role
in helping to solve them.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.700
Now, this isn't something that just has to
be done at the Security Council chamber.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.556
It's something that you can do
in a very kind of personal way.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.996
So every once in a while, if I'm lucky,
my wife and I like to go out to dinner,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.276
and we have three children
under the age of seven.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.729
So you can imagine
it's a very peaceful, quiet meal.

00:06:31.753 --> 00:06:32.956
(Laughter)

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.556
So we sit down and literally
all I want to do is just eat and chill,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.236
and my kids have a completely
and totally different idea

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.836
of what we're going to be doing.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.196
And so my first idea

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.116
is my sandbag strategy, right?

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.476
It's to go into my pocket
and take out the iPhone

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.956
and give them "Frozen"

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.940
or some other bestselling game thing.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.756
And then I stop

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.356
and I have to kind of put on
this transgenerational thinking cap.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.356
I don't do this in the restaurant,
because it would be bizarre,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.676
but I have to --

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.316
I did it once, and that's how
I learned it was bizarre.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.356
(Laughter)

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.500
And you have to kind of think,
"OK, I can do this."

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.980
But what is this teaching them?

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.916
So what does it mean
if I actually bring some paper

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.676
or engage with them in conversation?

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.556
It's hard. It's not easy,
and I'm making this very personal.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.956
It's actually more traumatic

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.716
than some of the big issues
that I work on in the world --

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.580
entertaining my kids at dinner.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.516
But what it does is it connects them
here in the present with me,

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.796
but it also --

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.276
and this is the crux
of transgenerational thinking ethics --

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.596
it sets them up to how they're
going to interact with their kids

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.700
and their kids and their kids.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.860
Second, futures thinking.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.476
When we think about the future,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.740
10, 15 years out,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.598
give me a vision of what the future is.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.476
You don't have to give it to me,
but think in your head.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.636
And what you're probably going to see

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.476
is the dominant cultural lens

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.556
that dominates our thinking
about the future right now:

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.780
technology.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.396
So when we think about the problems,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.596
we always put it through
a technological lens,

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.876
a tech-centric, a techno-utopia,
and there's nothing wrong with that,

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.196
but it's something that we have to
really think deeply about

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.076
if we're going to move
on these major issues,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.156
because it wasn't always like this. Right?

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.820
The ancients had their way of thinking

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.180
about what the future was.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.356
The Church definitely had their idea
of what the future could be,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.316
and you could actually pay your way
into that future. Right?

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.276
And luckily for humanity,

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.436
we got the scientific revolution.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.116
From there, we got the technology,

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.796
but what has happened --

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.180
And by the way, this is not a critique.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.516
I love technology.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.475
Everything in my house talks back to me,

00:08:54.499 --> 00:08:56.676
from my children
to my speakers to everything.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.516
(Laughter)

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:05.236
But we've abdicated the future
from the high priests in Rome

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.340
to the high priests of Silicon Valley.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.036
So when we think, well,
how are we going to deal with climate

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.636
or with poverty or homelessness,

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.780
our first reaction is to think about it
through a technology lens.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.516
And look, I'm not advocating
that we go to this guy.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.460
I love Joel, don't get me wrong,

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.876
but I'm not saying we go to Joel.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.716
What I'm saying is we have to rethink

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.516
our base assumption about
only looking at the future in one way,

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.676
only looking at it
through the dominant lens.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.876
Because our problems
are so big and so vast

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.716
that we need to open ourselves up.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.460
So that's why I do everything in my power
not to talk about the future.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.860
I talk about futures.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.476
It opens the conversation again.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.956
So when you're sitting and thinking

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.156
about how do we move forward
on this major issue --

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.716
it could be at home,

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.716
it could be at work,

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.596
it could be again on the global stage --

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:07.036
don't cut yourself off from thinking
about something beyond technology as a fix

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.596
because we're more concerned
about technological evolution right now

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.756
than we are about moral evolution.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.796
And unless we fix for that,

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.396
we're not going to be able
to get out of short-termism

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.236
and get to where we want to be.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.020
The final, telos thinking.
This comes from the Greek root.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.756
Ultimate aim and ultimate purpose.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.140
And it's really asking one question:

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.140
to what end?

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.116
When was the last time
you asked yourself: To what end?

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.940
And when you asked yourself that,
how far out did you go?

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.460
Because long isn't long enough anymore.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.276
Three, five years doesn't cut it.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.580
It's 30, 40, 50, 100 years.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.836
In Homer's epic, "The Odyssey,"

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.916
Odysseus had the answer to his "what end."

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.340
It was Ithaca.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.796
It was this bold vision
of what he wanted --

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.196
to return to Penelope.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.836
And I can tell you,
because of the work that I'm doing,

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.716
but also you know it intuitively --
we have lost our Ithaca.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.276
We have lost our "to what end,"
so we stay on this hamster wheel.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.476
And yes, we're trying
to solve these problems,

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.340
but what comes after we solve the problem?

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.220
And unless you define what comes after,
people aren't going to move.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.636
The businesses --
this isn't just about business --

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.996
but the businesses that do consistently,
who break out of short-termism

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.036
not surprisingly
are family-run businesses.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.636
They're transgenerational. They're telos.
They think about the futures.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.356
And this is an ad for Patek Philippe.
They're 175 years old,

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.436
and what's amazing
is that they literally embody

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.276
this kind of longpathian sense
in their brand,

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.196
because, by the way,
you never actually own a Patek Philippe,

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.796
and I definitely won't --

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.836
(Laughter)

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.860
unless somebody wants to just
throw 25,000 dollars on the stage.

00:11:45.884 --> 00:11:49.084
You merely look after it
for the next generation.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.116
So it's important that we remember,

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.276
the future, we treat it like a noun.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.556
It's not. It's a verb.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.836
It requires action.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.676
It requires us to push into it.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.636
It's not this thing that washes over us.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.316
It's something that we
actually have total control over.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.236
But in a short-term society,
we end up feeling like we don't.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.596
We feel like we're trapped.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.820
We can push through that.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.260
Now I'm getting more comfortable

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.260
in the fact that at some point

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.460
in the inevitable future,

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.020
I will die.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.156
But because of these new ways
of thinking and doing,

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.116
both in the outside world
and also with my family at home,

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.276
and what I'm leaving my kids,
I get more comfortable in that fact.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.436
And it's something that a lot of us
are really uncomfortable with,

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.660
but I'm telling you,

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.076
think it through.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.836
Apply this type of thinking
and you can push yourself past

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.916
what's inevitably
very, very uncomfortable.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.660
And it all begins really
with yourself asking this question:

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.420
What is your longpath?

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.596
But I ask you, when you ask yourself that

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.876
now or tonight or behind a steering wheel

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.260
or in the boardroom or the situation room:

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.316
push past the longpath,

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.636
quick, oh, what's my longpath
the next three years or five years?

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.276
Try and push past your own life if you can

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.676
because it makes you do things
a little bit bigger

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.380
than you thought were possible.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.620
Yes, we have huge,
huge problems out there.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.020
With this process, with this thinking,

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.540
I think we can make a difference.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.596
I think you can make a difference,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.236
and I believe in you guys.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.476
Thank you.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.523
(Applause)
