00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:22.141
The filmmaker Georges Méliès was first a magician.

00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:28.901
Now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic.

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:34.382
With complete control of everything the audience can see,

00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:38.739
moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.033
to further their deceptions.

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:47.848
Motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life,

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:51.691
produced by the sequential projection of still frames,

00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:56.559
and they astonished the Lumière brothers' early audiences.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.255
Even today's sophisticated moviegoers

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:02.175
still lose themselves to the screen,

00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:05.855
and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:08.402
to great effect.

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:12.712
Now imaginative people have been having fun with this

00:01:12.712 --> 00:01:14.781
for over 400 years.

00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:18.582
Giambattista della Porta, a Neapolitan scholar

00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:24.184
in the 16th century, examined and studied the natural world

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:27.831
and saw how it could be manipulated.

00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:31.247
Playing with the world, and our perception of it,

00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:34.537
really is the essence of visual effects.

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:36.719
So digging deeper into this

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.071
with the Science and Technology Council

00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:42.231
of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:46.719
reveals some truth behind the trickery.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.063
Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions:

00:01:52.063 --> 00:01:55.743
assumption, things are as we know them;

00:01:55.743 --> 00:01:59.816
presumption, things will behave as we expect;

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:02.313
and context in reality,

00:02:02.313 --> 00:02:04.905
our knowledge of the world as we know it,

00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:06.507
such as scale.

00:02:06.507 --> 00:02:10.584
Now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession,

00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:14.689
which is, never betray the illusion.

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.792
And that last point has made visual effects

00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:21.144
a constant quest for perfection.

00:02:21.144 --> 00:02:25.871
So from the hand-cranked jump cut early days of cinema

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:30.951
to last Sunday's Oscar winner, what follows are some steps

00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:36.158
and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects.

00:02:36.158 --> 00:02:39.646
I hope you will enjoy.

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.985
