00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.276
[This talk contains graphic language
and descriptions of sexual violence]

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.729
[Viewer discretion is advised]

00:00:16.753 --> 00:00:19.753
"Ashley Judd, stupid fucking slut.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.140
"You can't sue someone
for calling them a cunt."

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.540
"If you can't handle the Internet,
fuck off, whore."

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.516
"I wish Ashley Judd
would die a horrible death.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.916
She is the absolute worst."

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.140
"Ashley Judd, you're the reason
women shouldn't vote."

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.396
"'Twisted' is such a bad movie,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.140
I don't even want to rape it."

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.556
"Whatever you do,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.740
don't tell Ashley Judd.
She'll die alone with a dried out vagina."

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.756
"If I had to fuck an older woman,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.036
oh my God,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.236
I would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.516
that bitch is hot af.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.380
The unforgivable shit I would do to her."

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.300
Online misogyny is a global
gender rights tragedy,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.876
and it is imperative that it ends.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.100
(Applause)

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.236
Girls' and women's voices,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.076
and our allies' voices
are constrained in ways

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.116
that are personally, economically,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.756
professionally and politically damaging.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.780
And when we curb abuse,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.540
we will expand freedom.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.836
I am a Kentucky basketball fan,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.916
so on a fine March day last year,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.516
I was doing one of the things I do best:

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.476
I was cheering for my Wildcats.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.876
The daffodils were blooming,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.356
but the referees were not blowing
the whistle when I was telling them to.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.636
(Laughter)

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.396
Funny, they're very friendly
to me before the opening tip,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.476
but they really ignore me during the game.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.516
(Laughter)

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.996
Three of my players were bleeding,
so I did the next best thing ...

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.236
I tweeted.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.436
[@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss
my team's free throw making a --

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.396
@KySportsRadio @marchmadness
@espn Bloodied 3 players so far.]

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.076
It is routine for me to be treated
in the ways I've already described to you.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.716
It happens to me every single day

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.356
on social media platforms
such as Twitter and Facebook.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.756
Since I joined Twitter in 2011,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.796
misogyny and misogynists
have amply demonstrated

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.796
they will dog my every step.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.196
My spirituality, my faith,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.506
being a hillbilly --
I can say that, you can't --

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.690
all of it is fair game.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.876
And I have responded to this
with various strategies.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.236
I've tried engaging people.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.876
This one guy was sending me
hypersexual, nasty stuff,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.556
and there was a girl in his avatar.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.260
I wrote him back and said ...

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.820
"Is that your daughter?

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.036
I feel a lot of fear
that you may think about

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.716
and talk to women this way."

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.196
And he surprised me by saying,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.636
"You know what?
You're right. I apologize."

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.100
Sometimes people
want to be held accountable.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.876
This one guy was musing
to I don't know who

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.940
that maybe I was the definition of a cunt.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.596
I was married to a Scot for 14 years,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.196
so I said, "Cunt means many
different things in different countries --

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.436
(Laughter)

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.556
but I'm pretty sure you epitomize
the global standard of a dick."

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.796
(Laughter)

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.980
(Applause)

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.316
I've tried to rise above it,
I've tried to get in the trenches,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.276
but mostly I would scroll through
these social media platforms

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.916
with one eye partially closed,
trying not to see it,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.180
but you can't make
a cucumber out of a pickle.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.556
What is seen goes in.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.780
It's traumatic.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.916
And I was always secretly hoping
in some part of me

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.580
that what was being said to me
and about me wasn't ...

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.260
true.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.956
Because even I,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.140
an avowed, self-declared feminist,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.140
who worships at the altar of Gloria --

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.260
(Laughter)

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.940
internalize the patriarchy.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.356
This is really critical.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.156
Patriarchy is not boys and men.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.916
It is a system
in which we all participate,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.140
including me.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.236
On that particular day, for some reason,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.796
that particular tweet
after the basketball game

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.396
triggered something called a "cyber mob."

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.436
This vitriolic, global outpouring
of the most heinous hate speech:

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.396
death threats, rape threats.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.635
And don't you know,

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.996
when I was sitting at home
alone in my nightgown,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.716
I got a phone call,
and it was my beloved former husband,

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.076
and he said on a voice mail,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.300
"Loved one ...

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.820
what is happening to you is not OK."

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.100
And there was something about him
taking a stand for me that night ...

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.516
that allowed me
to take a stand for myself.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.780
And I started to write.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.196
I started to write about sharing the fact

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.556
that I'm a survivor
of all forms of sexual abuse,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.996
including three rapes.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.276
And the hate speech
I get in response to that --

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.700
these are just some of the comments
posted to news outlets.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.660
Being told I'm a "snitch" is really fun.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.876
[Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!]

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.116
Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.956
Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus.
May your grace and mercy shine.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.660
So, I wrote this feminist op-ed,
it is entitled,

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.076
"Forget Your Team:

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.916
It Is Your Online Gender Violence
Toward Girls And Women

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.436
That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.996
(Laughter)

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.020
(Applause)

00:05:36.285 --> 00:05:38.476
And I did that alone,
and I published it alone,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.956
because my chief advisor said,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.196
"Please don't,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.996
the rain of retaliatory garbage
that is inevitable --

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.436
I fear for you."

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.556
But I trust girls and I trust women,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.156
and I trust our allies.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.836
It was published, it went viral,

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.956
it proves that every single day

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.476
online misogyny is a phenomenon
endured by us all,

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.716
all over the world,

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.476
and when it is intersectional,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.716
it is worse.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.676
Sexual orientation, gender identity,

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.516
race, ethnicity, religion --

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.756
you name it,

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.316
it amplifies the violence
endured by girls and women,

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.580
and for our younger girls, it is worse.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.636
It's clearly traumatizing.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.836
Our mental health,
our emotional well-being

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.316
are so gravely affected

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.796
because the threat of violence

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.036
is experienced
neurobiologically as violence.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.116
The cortisol shoots up,
the limbic system gets fired,

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.220
we lose productivity at work.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.476
And let's talk about work.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.420
Our ability to work is constrained.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.716
Online searches of women applying for jobs
reveal nude pictures of them,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.326
false allegations they have STDs,

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.796
their addresses indicating
that they are available for sex

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.356
with real examples

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.020
of people showing up
at this house for said sex.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.220
Our ability to go to school is impaired.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.356
96 percent of all postings

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.500
of sexual images of our young people ...

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.836
girls.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.060
Our girls.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.356
Our boys are two to three
times more likely --

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.740
nonconsensually --

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.180
to share images.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.500
And I want to say a word
about revenge porn.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.476
Part of what came out of this tweet

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.316
was my getting connected
with allies and other activists

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.940
who are fighting
for a safe and free internet.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.236
We started something
called the Speech Project;

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.756
curbing abuse, expanding freedom.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.460
And that website
provides a critical forum,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.900
because there is no global, legal thing

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.156
to help us figure this out.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.796
But we do provide on that website
a standardized list of definitions,

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.916
because it's hard to attack
a behavior in the right way

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.356
if we're not all sharing
a definition of what that behavior is.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.156
And I learned that revenge porn
is often dangerously misapplied.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.900
It is the nonconsensual
sharing of an image

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.956
used tactically to shame
and humiliate a girl or woman

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.596
that attempts to pornography us.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.476
Our natural sexuality is --

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.300
I don't know about yours --
pretty gorgeous and wonderful.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.340
And my expressing it
does not pornography make.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.940
(Applause)

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.516
So, I have all these resources

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.860
that I'm keenly aware
so many people in the world do not.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.460
I was able to start
the Speech Project with colleagues.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.636
I can often get a social media
company's attention.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.620
I have a wonderful visit
to Facebook HQ coming up.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.700
Hasn't helped the idiotic
reporting standards yet ...

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.820
I actually pay someone
to scrub my social media feeds,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.756
attempting to spare my brain

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.996
the daily iterations
of the trauma of hate speech.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.236
And guess what?

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.636
I get hate speech for that.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.280
"Oh, you live in an echo chamber."

00:09:07.304 --> 00:09:08.556
Well, guess what?

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.276
Having someone post a photograph
of me with my mouth open

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.356
saying they "can't wait
to cum on my face,"

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.140
I have a right to set that boundary.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.420
(Applause)

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.556
And this distinction
between virtual and real is specious

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.796
because guess what --

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.316
that actually happened to me
once when I was a child,

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.916
and so that tweet brought up that trauma,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.716
and I had to do work on that.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.916
But you know what we do?
We take all of this hate speech,

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.820
and we disaggregate it,

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.036
and we code it,

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.916
and we give that data

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.636
so that we understand
the intersectionality of it:

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.916
when I get porn,

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.796
when it's about political affiliation,

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.020
when it's about age,
when it's about all of it.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.660
We're going to win this fight.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.260
There are a lot of solutions --

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.740
thank goodness.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.316
I'm going to offer just a few,

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.980
and of course I challenge you
to create and contribute your own.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.436
Number one: we have to start
with digital media literacy,

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.996
and clearly it must have a gendered lens.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.516
Kids, schools, caregivers, parents:

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.740
it's essential.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.420
Two ...

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.380
shall we talk about our friends in tech?

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.420
Said with dignity and respect,

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.076
the sexism in your workplaces must end.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.556
(Applause)

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.780
(Cheers)

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.796
EDGE,

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.676
the global standard for gender equality,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.236
is the minimum standard.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.476
And guess what, Silicon Valley?

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.476
If L'Oréal in India,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.676
in the Philippines, in Brazil

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.596
and in Russia can do it,

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.660
you can, too.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.980
Enough excuses.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.796
Only when women have critical mass
in every department at your companies,

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.636
including building platforms
from the ground up,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.996
will the conversations
about priorities and solutions change.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.076
And more love for my friends in tech:

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.020
profiteering off misogyny
in video games must end.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.076
I'm so tired of hearing you
talk to me at cocktail parties --

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.436
like you did a couple
weeks ago in Aspen --

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.396
about how deplorable #Gamergate was,

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.036
when you're still making
billions of dollars off games

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.276
that maim and dump women for sport.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.836
Basta! -- as the Italians would say.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.116
Enough.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.860
(Applause)

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.556
Our friends in law enforcement
have much to do,

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.196
because we've seen

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.660
that online violence
is an extension of in-person violence.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.796
In our country,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.820
more girls and women have been
murdered by their intimate partners

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.396
than died on 9/11

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.036
and have died since
in Afghanistan and Iraq combined.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.156
And it's not cool to say that,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.380
but it is true.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.076
We care so much geopolitically
about what men are doing over there

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.300
to women over there ...

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.740
In 2015,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:17.916
72,828 women used intimate
partner violence services in this country.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.380
That is not counting the girls
and women and boys who needed them.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.340
Law enforcement must be empowered

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.316
with up-to-date internet technology,

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.556
the devices and an understanding
of these platforms --

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.780
how they work.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.036
The police wanted to be helpful
when Amanda Hess called

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.596
about the death threat
she was getting on Twitter,

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.756
but they couldn't really when they said,

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.980
"What's Twitter?"

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:48.356
Our legislators must write
and pass astute legislation

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.276
that reflects today's technology

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.500
and our notions of free and hate speech.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.636
In New York recently, the law
could not be applied to a perpetrator

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.836
because the crimes
must have been committed --

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.196
even if it was anonymous --

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.676
they must have been committed
by telephone, in mail,

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.116
by telegraph --

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.620
(Laughter)

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.260
The language must be
technologically neutral.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.996
So apparently,

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.820
I've got a pretty bold voice.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.055
So, let's talk about our friends ...

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.100
white men.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.580
You have a role to play
and a choice to make.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.596
You can do something,

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.900
or you can do nothing.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.356
We're cool in this room,

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.380
but when this goes out, everyone will say,

00:13:39.404 --> 00:13:41.124
"Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.916
That quote was said
by a white man, Robert Moritz,

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.356
chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers,

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.420
he asked me to include it in my talk.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.660
We need to grow support lines
and help groups,

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.260
so victims can help each other

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.876
when their lives and finances
have been derailed.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.276
We must as individuals disrupt
gender violence as it is happening.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.076
92 percent of young people

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.900
29 and under witness it.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.020
72 percent of us have witnessed it.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.636
We must have the courage and urgency

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.340
to practice stopping it
as it is unfolding.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.260
And lastly,

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.740
believe her.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.636
Believe her.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.140
(Applause)

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.380
This is fundamentally
a problem of human interaction.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.516
And as I believe that human interaction
is at the core of our healing,

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.540
trauma not transformed
will be trauma transferred.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.516
Edith Wharton said,
"The end is latent in the beginning,"

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.516
so we are going to end this talk
replacing hate speech with love speech.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.476
Because I get lonely in this,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.340
but I know that we are allies.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.116
I recently learned

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.756
about how gratitude and affirmations
offset negative interactions.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.236
It takes five of those
to offset one negative interaction,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.716
and gratitude in particular --

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.436
free, available globally
any time, anywhere,

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.556
to anyone in any dialect --

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.796
it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate,

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.636
a watershed part of the brain

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.276
that floods it with great, good stuff.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.916
So I'm going to say
awesome stuff about myself.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.276
I would like for you
to reflect it back to me.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.436
It might sound something like this --

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.916
(Laughter)

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.956
I am a powerful and strong woman,
and you would say, "Yes, you are."

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.636
Audience: Yes, you are.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.396
Ashley Judd: My mama loves me.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.836
A: Yes, she does.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.916
AJ: I did a great job with my talk.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.556
A: Yes, you did.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.716
AJ: I have a right to be here.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.516
A: Yes, you do.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.756
AJ: I'm really cute.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.036
(Laughter)

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.516
A: Yes, you are.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.276
AJ: God does good work.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.076
A: Yes, He does.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.836
AJ: And I love you.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.180
Thank you so much
for letting me be of service.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.356
Bless you.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.550
(Applause)
