00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.974
I was offered a position
as associate professor of medicine

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:21.806
and chief of scientific visualization

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.807
at Yale University

00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:25.440
in the department of medicine.

00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:28.236
And my job was to write
many of the algorithms and code

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.236
for NASA to do virtual surgery

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.236
in preparation for the astronauts
going into deep-space flight,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.236
so they could be kept in robotic pods.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.166
One of the fascinating things
about what we were working on

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.208
is that we were seeing,
using new scanning technologies,

00:00:41.232 --> 00:00:43.213
things that had never been seen before.

00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:44.811
Not only in disease management,

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:48.236
but also things that allowed us
to see things about the body

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.236
that just made you marvel.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.236
I remember one of the first times
we were looking at collagen.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.236
And your entire body, everything --

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.236
your hair, skin, bone, nails --

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.236
everything is made of collagen.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.188
And it's a kind of rope-like structure
that twirls and swirls like this.

00:01:05.212 --> 00:01:09.417
And the only place that collagen
changes its structure

00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:11.217
is in the cornea of your eye.

00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:14.616
In your eye,
it becomes a grid formation,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.947
and therefore, it becomes
transparent, as opposed to opaque.

00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:20.236
So perfectly organized a structure,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.774
it was hard not to attribute
divinity to it.

00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:27.896
Because we kept on seeing this
in different parts of the body.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.236
One of the opportunities I had

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.641
was one person was working
on a really interesting

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:35.236
micromagnetic resonance
imaging machine with the NIH.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.236
And what we were going to do

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.236
was scan a new project

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.090
on the development of the fetus
from conception to birth

00:01:42.114 --> 00:01:43.788
using these new technologies.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.769
So I wrote the algorithms and code,

00:01:45.793 --> 00:01:48.236
and he built the hardware --
Paul Lauterbur --

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.793
then went onto win the Nobel
Prize for inventing the MRI.

00:01:51.817 --> 00:01:53.236
I got the data.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.920
And I'm going to show you
a sample of the piece,

00:01:55.944 --> 00:01:57.236

00:05:57.101 --> 00:05:59.501
Alexander Tsiaras: Thank you.

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:00.802
But as you can see,

00:06:00.826 --> 00:06:03.003
when you actually start
working on this data,

00:06:03.027 --> 00:06:04.236
it's pretty spectacular.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.875
And as we kept on scanning more and more,

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.094
working on this project,

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:11.189
looking at these two simple cells

00:06:11.213 --> 00:06:15.236
that have this unbelievable machinery
that will become the magic of you.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.236
And as we kept on working on this data,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.236
looking at small clusters of the body,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.236
these little pieces of tissue

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.192
that were the trophoblasts
coming off of the blastocyst,

00:06:26.216 --> 00:06:29.178
all of a sudden burrowing itself
into the side of the uterus,

00:06:29.202 --> 00:06:30.536
saying, "I'm here to stay."

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.436
Having conversation and communications

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.336
with the estrogens, the progesterones,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.965
saying, "I'm here to stay, plant me,"

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.326
building this incredible trilinear fetus

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.436
that becomes, within 44 days,
something that you can recognize,

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.236
and then at nine weeks
is really kind of a little human being.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.236
The marvel of this information:

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.628
How do we actually have
this biological mechanism

00:06:52.652 --> 00:06:53.952
inside our body

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:55.865
to actually see this information?

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.176
I'm going to show you
something pretty unique.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.193
Here's a human heart at 25 days.

00:07:00.217 --> 00:07:01.810
It's just basically two strands.

00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:03.536
And like this magnificent origami,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.236
cells are developing at one million cells
per second at four weeks,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.236
as it's just folding on itself.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.041
Within five weeks, you start to see
the early atrium and the early ventricles.

00:07:14.065 --> 00:07:16.285
Six weeks, these folds are now beginning

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:18.466
with the papilla
on the inside of the heart

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.936
actually being able to pull down
each one of those valves in your heart

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.236
until you get a mature heart --

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.149
and then basically the development
of the entire human body.

00:07:27.173 --> 00:07:31.236
The magic of the mechanisms
inside each genetic structure

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.236
saying exactly where
that nerve cell should go --

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.266
the complexity of these,

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.187
the mathematical models
of how these things are indeed done

00:07:39.211 --> 00:07:41.082
are beyond human comprehension.

00:07:41.106 --> 00:07:43.029
Even though I am a mathematician,

00:07:43.053 --> 00:07:44.968
I look at this with marvel

00:07:44.992 --> 00:07:49.236
of how do these instruction sets
not make these mistakes

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.236
as they build what is us?

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
It's a mystery, it's magic, it's divinity.

00:07:53.284 --> 00:07:56.236
Then you start to take
a look at adult life.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.499
Take a look at this
little tuft of capillaries.

00:07:58.523 --> 00:08:01.236
It's just a tiny
sub-substructure, microscopic.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.907
But basically by the time you're
nine months and you're given birth,

00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:10.236
you have almost 60,000 miles
of vessels inside your body.

00:08:10.577 --> 00:08:12.704
And only one mile is visible.

00:08:12.728 --> 00:08:15.236
59,999 miles

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.236
that are basically bringing
nutrients and taking waste away.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.921
The complexity of building
that within a single system

00:08:20.945 --> 00:08:24.830
is, again, beyond any comprehension
or any existing mathematics today.

00:08:24.854 --> 00:08:26.236
And then instructions set,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.045
from the brain to every other
part of the body --

00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:30.923
look at the complexity of the folding.

00:08:30.947 --> 00:08:32.336
Where does this intelligence

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.175
of knowing that a fold can
actually hold more information,

00:08:35.199 --> 00:08:37.791
so as you actually watch
the baby's brain grow.

00:08:37.815 --> 00:08:39.959
And this is one of the things we're doing.

00:08:39.983 --> 00:08:41.536
We're launching two new studies

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.333
of scanning babies' brains
from the moment they're born.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.548
Every six months
until they're six years old,

00:08:46.572 --> 00:08:49.236
we're going to be doing
about 250 children,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.963
watching exactly how the gyri
and the sulci of the brains fold

00:08:52.987 --> 00:08:55.024
to see how this magnificent development

00:08:55.048 --> 00:08:57.636
actually turns into memories
and the marvel that is us.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.436
And it's not just our own existence,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.302
but how does the woman's body understand

00:09:02.326 --> 00:09:05.007
to have genetic structure
that not only builds her own,

00:09:05.031 --> 00:09:06.536
but then has the understanding

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.236
that allows her to become

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.236
a walking immunological,
cardiovascular system

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.236
that basically is a mobile system

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.095
that can actually nurture,

00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:17.236
treat this child with a kind of marvel

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.065
that is beyond, again,
our comprehension --

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:24.274
the magic that is existence, that is us?

00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:25.436
Thank you.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.460
(Applause)
