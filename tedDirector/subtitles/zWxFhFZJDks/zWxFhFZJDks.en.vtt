00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:18.383
B.J. was one of many fellow inmates

00:00:18.383 --> 00:00:20.668
who had big plans for the future.

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:22.899
He had a vision. When he got out,

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.754
he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight,

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:30.881
and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:32.395
He'd spent 10,000 dollars

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:35.679
to buy a website that exclusively featured women

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:41.568
having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars. (Laughter)

00:00:41.568 --> 00:00:44.554
It was my first week in federal prison,

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:48.371
and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:52.274
In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:55.015
whose business instincts were in many cases

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:57.417
as sharp as those of the CEOs

00:00:57.417 --> 00:00:59.246
who had wined and dined me six months earlier

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:03.798
when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.

00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:06.639
Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:09.379
had been drug dealers on the outside,

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:12.787
but when they talked about what they did,

00:01:12.787 --> 00:01:15.490
they talked about it in a different jargon,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.274
but the business concepts that they talked about

00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:20.954
weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton:

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:25.458
promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user,

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:29.029
focus-grouping new product launches,

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:31.266
territorial expansion.

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.537
But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:37.386
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.

00:01:37.386 --> 00:01:39.583
It's a lot harder than you might think.

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:42.370
Contrary to what most people think,

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.748
people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life

00:01:45.748 --> 00:01:47.538
when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life.

00:01:47.538 --> 00:01:50.290
You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.588
toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.

00:01:52.588 --> 00:01:53.940
And it's hard for a couple of reasons.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.335
First, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent

00:01:56.335 --> 00:01:57.702
from what you'd pay on the street,

00:01:57.702 --> 00:02:00.284
and second, you don't make a lot of money.

00:02:00.284 --> 00:02:02.553
I unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job,

00:02:02.553 --> 00:02:04.842
unloading trucks at a food warehouse,

00:02:04.842 --> 00:02:09.195
for $5.25, not an hour, but per month.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.353
So how do you survive?

00:02:11.353 --> 00:02:14.872
Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.

00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:16.471
There's legal hustles.

00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:18.639
You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.055
You charge another inmate to clean his cell.

00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:25.958
There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:30.180
There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.463
And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in,

00:02:33.463 --> 00:02:37.566
you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography,

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:41.033
cell phones, and just as in the outer world,

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:44.536
there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise,

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:46.400
the more profitable it can potentially be.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.336
You want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars.

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:54.641
You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:58.287
and is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks.

00:02:58.287 --> 00:03:00.623
You want a dirty magazine?

00:03:00.623 --> 00:03:04.007
Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:07.113
So as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects

00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:10.663
of prison life is ingenuity.

00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:13.067
Whether it was concocting delicious meals

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:17.266
from stolen scraps from the warehouse,

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:20.416
sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers,

00:03:20.416 --> 00:03:26.040
or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.809
tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less,

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.480
and many of them want to take this ingenuity

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.666
that they've learned to the outside

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:37.912
and start restaurants, barber shops,

00:03:37.912 --> 00:03:40.257
personal training businesses.

00:03:40.257 --> 00:03:43.752
But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that,

00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:46.047
no rehabilitation at all in prison,

00:03:46.047 --> 00:03:48.248
no one to help them write a business plan,

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:51.506
figure out a way to translate the business concepts

00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:54.529
they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises,

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.104
no access to the Internet, even.

00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:59.688
And then, when they come out, most states

00:03:59.688 --> 00:04:02.040
don't even have a law prohibiting employers

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.760
from discriminating against people with a background.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.064
So none of us should be surprised

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:10.908
that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend

00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:13.496
within five years.

00:04:13.496 --> 00:04:18.808
Look, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.

00:04:18.808 --> 00:04:22.467
But when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do

00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:24.293
whatever I could to make sure

00:04:24.293 --> 00:04:26.726
that guys like the ones I was locked up with

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:30.773
didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.

00:04:30.773 --> 00:04:34.421
So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.

00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:36.989
The best thing we can do is figure out ways

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:39.677
to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit

00:04:39.677 --> 00:04:42.921
and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons,

00:04:42.921 --> 00:04:45.996
because if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills

00:04:45.996 --> 00:04:48.545
that's going to help them, and they'll be right back.

00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:51.421
All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.

00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:55.421
Thank you. (Applause)
