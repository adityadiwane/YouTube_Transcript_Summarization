00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
Believe me or not, I come offering a solution

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.330
to a very important part of this larger problem,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
with the requisite focus on climate.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
And the solution I offer

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
is to the biggest culprit

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.330
in this massive mistreatment of the earth

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
by humankind,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
and the resulting decline of the biosphere.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
That culprit is business and industry,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.330
since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
As an industrial engineer,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.330
cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
After founding my company, Interface, from scratch

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
in 1973, 36 years ago,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
to produce carpet tiles in America

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
for the business and institution markets,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
and shepherding it through start-up and survival

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
to prosperity and global dominance in its field,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
I read Paul Hawken's book,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
"The Ecology of Commerce,"

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
the summer of 1994.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
In his book, Paul charges business and industry

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
as, one, the major culprit

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
in causing the decline of the biosphere,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
and, two, the only institution that is large enough,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
and pervasive enough, and powerful enough,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.330
to really lead humankind out of this mess.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
And by the way he convicted me

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
as a plunderer of the earth.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
And I then challenged the people of Interface, my company,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.330
to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
which we defined as eventually operating

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
our petroleum-intensive company in such a way

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
as to take from the earth

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.330
only what can be renewed by the earth, naturally and rapidly --

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
not another fresh drop of oil --

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.330
and to do no harm to the biosphere.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
Take nothing: do no harm.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
I simply said, "If Hawken is right

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
and business and industry must lead,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
who will lead business and industry?

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
Unless somebody leads, nobody will."

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
It's axiomatic. Why not us?

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
And thanks to the people of Interface,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.330
I have become a recovering plunderer.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.330
(Laughter)

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.330
(Applause)

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.330
I once told a Fortune Magazine writer

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
that someday people like me would go to jail.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
And that became the headline of a Fortune article.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.330
They went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
From plunderer to recovering plunderer,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
to America's greenest CEO in five years --

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
that, frankly, was a pretty sad commentary

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.330
on American CEOs in 1999.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
Asked later in the Canadian documentary, "The Corporation,"

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
what I meant by the "go to jail" remark,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.330
I offered that theft is a crime.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.330
And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
But I realized, for that to be true --

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
for theft of our children's future to be a crime --

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
there must be a clear, demonstrable alternative

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
to the take-make-waste industrial system

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
that so dominates our civilization,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
and is the major culprit, stealing our children's future,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
by digging up the earth

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.330
and converting it to products that quickly become waste

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
in a landfill or an incinerator --

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.330
in short, digging up the earth and converting it to pollution.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
and a well-known environmental impact equation,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
impact -- a bad thing --

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.330
is the product of population, affluence and technology.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.330
That is, impact is generated by people,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
what they consume in their affluence,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
and how it is produced.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
And though the equation is largely subjective,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.330
you can perhaps quantify people, and perhaps quantify affluence,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.330
but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
So the equation is conceptual.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
Still it works to help us understand the problem.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.330
So we set out at Interface, in 1994,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
to create an example:

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
to transform the way we made carpet,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.330
a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
and to transform our technologies

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
so they diminished environmental impact,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
rather than multiplied it.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
Paul and Anne Ehrlich's environmental impact equation:

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
I is equal to P times A times T:

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
population, affluence and technology.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.330
I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
I equals P times A divided by T.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
Now, the mathematically-minded will see immediately

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
that T in the numerator increases impact -- a bad thing --

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.330
but T in the denominator decreases impact.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.330
So I ask, "What would move T, technology,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
from the numerator -- call it T1 --

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
where it increases impact,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
to the denominator -- call it T2 --

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
where it reduces impact?

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.330
I thought about the characteristics

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
of first industrial revolution,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
T1, as we practiced it at Interface,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.330
and it had the following characteristics.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.330
Extractive: taking raw materials from the earth.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
Linear: take, make, waste.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.330
Wasteful: abusive and focused on labor productivity.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
More carpet per man-hour.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
Thinking it through, I realized that all those attributes

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.330
must be changed to move T to the denominator.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.330
In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable;

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
linear by cyclical;

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.330
fossil fuel energy by renewable energy, sunlight;

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
wasteful by waste-free;

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
and abusive by benign;

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.330
and labor productivity by resource productivity.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.330
And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
and get rid of T1 altogether,

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.330
we could reduce our impact to zero,

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
including our impact on the climate.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
And that became the Interface plan in 1995,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
and has been the plan ever since.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.330
We have measured our progress very rigorously.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.330
So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
Net greenhouse gas emissions

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.330
down 82 percent in absolute tonnage.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.330
(Applause)

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
Over the same span of time

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
So an 82 percent absolute reduction

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.330
translates into a 90 percent reduction

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.330
in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
This is the magnitude

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
of the reduction the entire global technosphere

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
must realize by 2050

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
to avoid catastrophic climate disruption --

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
so the scientists are telling us.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.330
Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
due to efficiencies in renewables.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
The cheapest, most secure barrel of oil there is

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
is the one not used through efficiencies.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
Water usage is down 75 percent

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
in our worldwide carpet tile business.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
which we acquired in 1993

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.330
right here in California, City of Industry,

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
where water is so precious.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.330
Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total, and growing rapidly.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.330
Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
going for 100 percent.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
We have diverted 148 million pounds --

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
that's 74,000 tons --

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
of used carpet from landfills,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
closing the loop on material flows

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
through reverse logistics

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.330
and post-consumer recycling technologies

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.330
that did not exist when we started 14 years ago.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
Those new cyclical technologies

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.330
85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
since 2004,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.330
meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.330
from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation --

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
independent third-party certified.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
We call it Cool Carpet.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator,

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
increasing sales and profits.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.330
Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home,

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
under the brand Flor,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.330
misspelled F-L-O-R.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.330
You can point and click today at Flor.com

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.330
and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
It is practical, and pretty too.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.330
(Laughter)

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:13.330
(Applause)

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
We reckon that we are a bit over halfway

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:20.330
to our goal: zero impact, zero footprint.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
We've set 2020 as our target year for zero,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.330
for reaching the top, the summit of Mount Sustainability.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
We call this Mission Zero.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.330
And this is perhaps the most important facet:

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.330
we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
A better business model,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
a better way to bigger profits.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
Here is the business case for sustainability.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.330
From real life experience, costs are down, not up,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
reflecting some 400 million dollars

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.330
of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste --

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
the first face of Mount Sustainability.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.330
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
And this dispels a myth too,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.330
this false choice between the environment and the economy.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
Our products are the best they've ever been,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
inspired by design for sustainability,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.330
an unexpected wellspring of innovation.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
You cannot beat it for attracting the best people

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
and bringing them together.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.330
No amount of advertising, no clever marketing campaign,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
at any price, could have produced or created

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.330
this much goodwill.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
Costs, products, people, marketplaces --

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
what else is there?

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
It is a better business model.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.330
And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.330
There is a dip there, from 2001 to 2003:

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
a dip when our sales, over a three-year period,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
were down 17 percent.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.330
But the marketplace was down 36 percent.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
We literally gained market share.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.330
We might not have survived that recession

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.330
but for the advantages of sustainability.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.330
If every business were pursuing Interface plans,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
would that solve all our problems?

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
I don't think so.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.330
I equals P times A divided by T2.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
That A is a capital A,

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:28.330
suggesting that affluence is an end in itself.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.330
But what if we reframed Ehrlich further?

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
And what if we made A a lowercase 'a,'

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
suggesting that it is a means to an end,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
and that end is happiness --

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
more happiness with less stuff.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
You know that would reframe civilization itself --

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:54.330
(Applause) --

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.330
and our whole system of economics,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:03.330
if not for our species, then perhaps for the one that succeeds us:

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
the sustainable species, living on a finite earth,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
ethically, happily and ecologically

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
in balance with nature

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.330
and all her natural systems for a thousand generations,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
or 10,000 generations --

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
that is to say, into the indefinite future.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.330
But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species?

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
Well maybe so. But I don't think so.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
sustainable, zero-footprint industrial company

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
fully into existence by 2020.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
We can see our way now,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.330
clear to the top of that mountain.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.330
And now the challenge is in execution.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.330
"If something exists, it must be possible."

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
(Laughter)

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
If we can actually do it, it must be possible.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.330
If we, a petro-intensive company can do it, anybody can.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.330
And if anybody can, it follows that everybody can.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.330
Hawken fulfilled business and industry,

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.330
leading humankind away from the abyss

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:16.330
because, with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.330
a very dear person is at risk here --

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.330
frankly, an unacceptable risk.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
Who is that person?

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
Not you. Not I.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.330
And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.330
On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
I was talking to people, as I did at every opportunity back then,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.330
bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
But about five days later back in Atlanta,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.330
I received an email from Glenn Thomas,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
one of my people in the California meeting.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
He was sending me an original poem

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.330
And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.330
Because it told me, by God, one person got it.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.330
Here is what Glenn wrote. And here is that person, most at risk.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.330
Please meet "Tomorrow's Child."

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.330
"Without a name, an unseen face, and knowing not your time or place,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
Tomorrow's child, though yet unborn,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
I met you first last Tuesday morn.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
A wise friend introduced us two.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
And through his sobering point of view

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:31.330
I saw a day that you would see, a day for you but not for me.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.330
Knowing you has changed my thinking.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.330
For I never had an inkling

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
that perhaps the things I do might someday,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
somehow threaten you.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
Tomorrow's child, my daughter, son,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good,

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.330
though always having known I should.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.330
Begin, I will.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.330
The way the cost of what I squander, what is lost,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
if ever I forget that you

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.330
will someday come and live here too."

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
Well, every day of my life since,

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.330
"Tomorrow's Child" has spoken to me

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
with one simple but profound message,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
which I presume to share with you.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.330
We are, each and every one,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.330
a part of the web of life.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.330
The continuum of humanity, sure, but in a larger sense, the web of life itself.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
And we have a choice to make

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
during our brief, brief visit

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.330
to this beautiful blue and green living planet:

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
to hurt it or to help it.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
For you, it's your call.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.330
Thank you.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:48.330
(Applause)
