00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.962
Five years ago, I had my dream job.

00:00:16.473 --> 00:00:18.877
I was a foreign correspondent
in the Middle East

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:21.041
reporting for ABC News.

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:23.129
But there was a crack in the wall,

00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:25.535
a problem with our industry,

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.548
that I felt we needed to fix.

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:32.542
You see, I got to the Middle East
right around the end of 2007,

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.823
which was just around the midpoint

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:36.547
of the Iraq War.

00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:40.020
But by the time I got there,
it was already nearly impossible

00:00:40.044 --> 00:00:42.572
to find stories about Iraq on air.

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:45.595
Coverage had dropped across the board,

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:46.932
across networks.

00:00:46.956 --> 00:00:49.012
And of the stories that did make it,

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:52.357
more than 80 percent
of them were about us.

00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:54.934
We were missing the stories about Iraq,

00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.051
the people who live there,

00:00:57.075 --> 00:00:59.983
and what was happening to them
under the weight of the war.

00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:04.630
Afghanistan had already
fallen off the agenda.

00:01:04.654 --> 00:01:08.295
There were less than one percent
of all news stories in 2008

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.558
that went to the war in Afghanistan.

00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:13.525
It was the longest war in US history,

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.511
but information was so scarce

00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:17.770
that schoolteachers we spoke to

00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:20.921
told us they had trouble
explaining to their students

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:22.485
what we were doing there,

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.406
when those students had parents

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.963
who were fighting
and sometimes dying overseas.

00:01:28.997 --> 00:01:30.661
We had drawn a blank,

00:01:30.685 --> 00:01:33.467
and it wasn't just Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:36.164
From conflict zones to climate change

00:01:36.188 --> 00:01:40.474
to all sorts of issues
around crises in public health,

00:01:40.498 --> 00:01:43.894
we were missing what I call
the species-level issues,

00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:47.460
because as a species,
they could actually sink us.

00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:52.203
And by failing to understand
the complex issues of our time,

00:01:52.227 --> 00:01:55.561
we were facing certain
practical implications.

00:01:55.585 --> 00:01:57.337
How were we going to solve problems

00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:59.632
that we didn't fundamentally understand,

00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:01.920
that we couldn't track in real time,

00:02:01.944 --> 00:02:04.258
and where the people working on the issues

00:02:04.282 --> 00:02:05.625
were invisible to us

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.214
and sometimes invisible to each other?

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.444
When you look back on Iraq,

00:02:11.468 --> 00:02:14.897
those years when we
were missing the story,

00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:17.683
were the years when the society
was falling apart,

00:02:17.707 --> 00:02:21.642
when we were setting the conditions
for what would become the rise of ISIS,

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:23.828
the ISIS takeover of Mosul

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.895
and terrorist violence that would spread

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.420
beyond Iraq's borders
to the rest of the world.

00:02:29.577 --> 00:02:32.884
Just around that time
where I was making that observation,

00:02:32.908 --> 00:02:34.750
I looked across the border of Iraq

00:02:34.774 --> 00:02:37.813
and noticed there was another
story we were missing:

00:02:37.837 --> 00:02:39.369
the war in Syria.

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:44.109
If you were a Middle-East specialist,
you knew that Syria was that important

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:45.378
from the start.

00:02:45.402 --> 00:02:46.942
But it ended up being, really,

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.904
one of the forgotten stories
of the Arab Spring.

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:53.312
I saw the implications up front.

00:02:54.064 --> 00:02:57.431
Syria is intimately tied
to regional security,

00:02:57.455 --> 00:02:59.402
to global stability.

00:02:59.426 --> 00:03:01.315
I felt like we couldn't let that become

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:03.798
another one of the stories we left behind.

00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:10.101
So I left my big TV job to start
a website, called "Syria Deeply."

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:12.875
It was designed to be a news
and information source

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:16.248
that made it easier to understand
a complex issue,

00:03:16.272 --> 00:03:18.641
and for the past four years,
it's been a resource

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:23.264
for policymakers and professionals
working on the conflict in Syria.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.183
We built a business model

00:03:25.207 --> 00:03:28.462
based on consistent,
high-quality information,

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:31.497
and convening the top minds on the issue.

00:03:32.227 --> 00:03:35.067
And we found it was a model that scaled.

00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:38.871
We got passionate requests
to do other things "Deeply."

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:42.139
So we started to work our way
down the list.

00:03:42.987 --> 00:03:45.989
I'm just one of many entrepreneurs,

00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:48.595
and we are just one of many start-ups

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:51.480
trying to fix what's wrong with news.

00:03:51.504 --> 00:03:53.450
All of us in the trenches know

00:03:53.474 --> 00:03:55.949
that something is wrong
with the news industry.

00:03:55.973 --> 00:03:57.188
It's broken.

00:03:58.376 --> 00:04:01.723
Trust in the media
has hit an all-time low.

00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:05.142
And the statistic you're seeing up there
is from September --

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:07.162
it's arguably gotten worse.

00:04:07.924 --> 00:04:09.396
But we can fix this.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.138
We can fix the news.

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:13.902
I know that that's true.

00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:19.215
You can call me an idealist;
I call myself an industrious optimist.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.764
And I know there are
a lot of us out there.

00:04:21.788 --> 00:04:24.180
We have ideas for how
to make things better,

00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:28.192
and I want to share three of them
that we've picked up in our own work.

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:30.457
Idea number one:

00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:34.144
we need news that's built
on deep-domain knowledge.

00:04:34.168 --> 00:04:37.926
Given the waves and waves of layoffs
at newsrooms across the country,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.228
we've lost the art of specialization.

00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:42.935
Beat reporting is an endangered thing.

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:45.206
When it comes to foreign news,

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.391
the way we can fix that
is by working with more local journalists,

00:04:48.415 --> 00:04:50.796
treating them like our partners
and collaborators,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.663
not just fixers who fetch us
phone numbers and sound bites.

00:04:54.687 --> 00:04:58.903
Our local reporters in Syria
and across Africa and across Asia

00:04:58.927 --> 00:05:02.914
bring us stories that we certainly
would not have found on our own.

00:05:02.938 --> 00:05:07.154
Like this one from the suburbs
of Damascus, about a wheelchair race

00:05:07.178 --> 00:05:09.651
that gave hope
to those wounded in the war.

00:05:10.063 --> 00:05:11.936
Or this one from Sierra Leone,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.417
about a local chief
who curbed the spread of Ebola

00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:18.664
by self-organizing
a quarantine in his district.

00:05:19.346 --> 00:05:21.472
Or this one from the border of Pakistan,

00:05:21.496 --> 00:05:25.425
about Afghan refugees being forced
to return home before they are ready,

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.906
under the threat of police intimidation.

00:05:28.525 --> 00:05:30.579
Our local journalists are our mentors.

00:05:30.603 --> 00:05:32.705
They teach us something new every day,

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.759
and they bring us stories
that are important for all of us to know.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.244
Idea number two:

00:05:39.268 --> 00:05:42.907
we need a kind of Hippocratic oath
for the news industry,

00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:46.534
a pledge to first do no harm.

00:05:46.558 --> 00:05:48.169
(Applause)

00:05:48.193 --> 00:05:49.711
Journalists need to be tough.

00:05:49.735 --> 00:05:51.647
We need to speak truth to power,

00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:53.772
but we also need to be responsible.

00:05:53.796 --> 00:05:56.140
We need to live up to our own ideals,

00:05:56.164 --> 00:05:58.095
and we need to recognize

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:02.008
when what we're doing
could potentially harm society,

00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:05.086
where we lose track of journalism
as a public service.

00:06:06.173 --> 00:06:08.148
I watched us cover the Ebola crisis.

00:06:08.172 --> 00:06:10.568
We launched Ebola Deeply. We did our best.

00:06:10.592 --> 00:06:12.498
But what we saw was a public

00:06:12.522 --> 00:06:16.139
that was flooded with hysterical
and sensational coverage,

00:06:16.163 --> 00:06:19.308
sometimes inaccurate,
sometimes completely wrong.

00:06:19.332 --> 00:06:23.960
Public health experts tell me
that that actually cost us in human lives,

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:28.657
because by sparking more panic
and by sometimes getting the facts wrong,

00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:30.853
we made it harder for people to resolve

00:06:30.877 --> 00:06:32.947
what was actually happening on the ground.

00:06:32.971 --> 00:06:36.015
All that noise made it harder
to make the right decisions.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.057
We can do better as an industry,

00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:43.446
but it requires us recognizing
how we got it wrong last time,

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.309
and deciding not to go that way next time.

00:06:46.841 --> 00:06:48.057
It's a choice.

00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:52.379
We have to resist the temptation
to use fear for ratings.

00:06:52.403 --> 00:06:55.310
And that decision has to be made
in the individual newsroom

00:06:55.334 --> 00:06:57.505
and with the individual news executive.

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.184
Because the next deadly virus
that comes around

00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:03.989
could be much worse
and the consequences much higher,

00:07:04.013 --> 00:07:05.948
if we do what we did last time;

00:07:05.972 --> 00:07:09.548
if our reporting isn't responsible
and it isn't right.

00:07:11.012 --> 00:07:12.563
The third idea?

00:07:12.587 --> 00:07:14.718
We need to embrace complexity

00:07:14.742 --> 00:07:17.460
if we want to make sense
of a complex world.

00:07:17.956 --> 00:07:19.838
Embrace complexity --

00:07:19.862 --> 00:07:21.339
(Applause)

00:07:21.363 --> 00:07:26.734
not treat the world simplistically,
because simple isn't accurate.

00:07:26.758 --> 00:07:28.750
We live in a complex world.

00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:31.241
News is adult education.

00:07:31.265 --> 00:07:34.720
It's our job as journalists
to get elbow deep in complexity

00:07:34.744 --> 00:07:38.781
and to find new ways to make it easier
for everyone else to understand.

00:07:39.447 --> 00:07:40.616
If we don't do that,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.450
if we pretend there are
just simple answers,

00:07:43.474 --> 00:07:46.438
we're leading everyone off a steep cliff.

00:07:47.144 --> 00:07:50.595
Understanding complexity
is the only way to know the real threats

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:51.952
that are around the corner.

00:07:51.976 --> 00:07:54.681
It's our responsibility
to translate those threats

00:07:54.705 --> 00:07:56.890
and to help you understand what's real,

00:07:56.914 --> 00:08:00.147
so you can be prepared and know
what it takes to be ready

00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:01.588
for what comes next.

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:04.382
I am an industrious optimist.

00:08:04.406 --> 00:08:06.966
I do believe we can fix what's broken.

00:08:07.498 --> 00:08:08.681
We all want to.

00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:11.489
There are great journalists
out there doing great work --

00:08:11.513 --> 00:08:13.026
we just need new formats.

00:08:13.862 --> 00:08:17.583
I honestly believe
this is a time of reawakening,

00:08:17.607 --> 00:08:19.296
reimagining what we can do.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.865
I believe we can fix what's broken.

00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:24.368
I know we can fix the news.

00:08:24.392 --> 00:08:26.218
I know it's worth trying,

00:08:26.242 --> 00:08:28.385
and I truly believe that in the end,

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:30.027
we're going to get this right.

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.219
Thank you.

00:08:31.243 --> 00:08:35.978
(Applause)
