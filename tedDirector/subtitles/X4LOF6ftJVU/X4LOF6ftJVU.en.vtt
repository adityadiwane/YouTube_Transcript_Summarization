00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.544
I came here to show you

00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:15.829
the Fotokite.

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.931
It's a tethered, flying camera.

00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:20.170
But before I do that, I want to tell you a bit about

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.344
where it came from, what motivated it.

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:23.839
So I was born in Russia,

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.948
and three years ago, in 2011,

00:00:26.948 --> 00:00:29.734
there were the Russian federal elections.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:31.819
There were massive irregularities reported,

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:33.476
and people came out to protest,

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:37.170
which was very unlikely for Russia.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.755
And no one really knew

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:40.839
how significant these protests were,

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:42.253
because, for whatever reason,

00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:44.237
the world media largely ignored it.

00:00:44.237 --> 00:00:46.319
Now, there was a group of photographers

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.637
who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby —

00:00:49.637 --> 00:00:52.550
usually photographing things like the Sphinx,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.318
the Pyramids — who happened to be

00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:57.973
right around the corner, and they flew a camera

00:00:57.973 --> 00:00:59.749
and they took some snapshots,

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.326
some panoramas of this demonstration.

00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:04.159
Just completely independent entity,

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.218
completely random occurrence,

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:09.886
and the image, when I saw it, it really struck me.

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:11.460
Here's one of the panoramas.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.975
So in a single image,

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:16.770
you can really see the scale of this event —

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.838
just the number of people,

00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:22.525
the colors, the banners.

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:26.366
You just can't consider this insignificant.

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:29.368
All in a single image, which was really cool to me.

00:01:29.368 --> 00:01:31.427
And I think, in the future,

00:01:31.427 --> 00:01:33.913
journalism and many other professions,

00:01:33.913 --> 00:01:36.432
there are flying cameras already
quite commonly out there,

00:01:36.432 --> 00:01:39.873
but I think, you wait a few months, a few years,

00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:41.910
and for many professions, it's really going to be

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.755
a requirement.

00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:45.994
And it make sense. It's 
such a unique perspective.

00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:49.483
Nothing really communicates 
this scale, for example,

00:01:49.483 --> 00:01:52.507
in context, in a way that this does.

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:54.925
But there are a few hurdles, 
and they are quite basic

00:01:54.925 --> 00:01:56.962
and quite fundamental.

00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:58.211
One is piloting.

00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:02.136
So for this image, they flew a camera,

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:06.962
a five kilogram device with an SLR under it.

00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:11.438
It's quite heavy, lots of 
spinning, sharp things.

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:13.868
It's a bit uncomfortable to fly,

00:02:13.868 --> 00:02:15.345
probably also for the operator.

00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:18.907
In fact, you can see that on the 
back of the pilot's shirt, it says,

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:20.966
"No questions until landing"

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:22.850
in Russian and in English,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.224
because people are curious, and they'll go tap you,

00:02:25.224 --> 00:02:27.732
and then you lose your focus and things happen.

00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:29.947
And these guys are great. They're professionals;

00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:32.940
they're really careful in what they do.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.549
So in the protests, maybe you noticed,

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.407
they flew over the river so it was quite safe.

00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:41.411
But this doesn't necessarily apply to

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.120
all people and all conditions,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.517
so we really have to make piloting easier.

00:02:45.517 --> 00:02:47.799
The other problem is regulations,

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.825
or rather, the lack of good regulation.

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:52.738
For many good reasons, it's just difficult

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:54.860
to come up with common sense laws

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.911
to regulate flying cameras.

00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:59.239
So we already have cameras.

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.815
Everyone here, I'm sure, has a
smartphone with a camera, right?

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:03.447
There are more and more of them.

00:03:03.447 --> 00:03:05.621
You hear about people with
Google Glass being attacked.

00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.321
You hear about, actually, a drone pilot,

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.222
a hobbyist, was attacked two weeks ago

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:12.348
because he was flying near a beach.

00:03:12.348 --> 00:03:14.575
Here's some personal input I didn't expect.

00:03:14.575 --> 00:03:17.267
Just yesterday, I was attacked by a guy

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:19.818
who claimed that I was filming him.

00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:22.517
I was checking my email right here —

00:03:22.517 --> 00:03:26.160
easy way to get input for your talk.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.939
But I think there are better solutions.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.908
I think we have to defuse the situation.

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:33.249
We have to come up with responsible solutions

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:34.926
that address the privacy issues

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:37.726
and the safety, accountability issues

00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:41.539
but still give us that perspective.

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.722
And this is one potential solution.

00:03:44.722 --> 00:03:47.643
So this is the Fotokite.

00:03:47.643 --> 00:03:49.526
Well, let me see, it's a quadrocopter,

00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:53.834
but what's kind of special 
about it is there's a leash.

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:56.928
It's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient.

00:03:56.928 --> 00:03:59.155
And the neat thing about it is,

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.539
to fly it, there's no joysticks, nothing like this.

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.877
You just turn it on

00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:06.511
and you point in the direction that you want to fly.

00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:07.850
You give it a little twist.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.592
That's kind of the way you communicate.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:15.969
And there it goes.

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.935
(Applause)

00:04:25.396 --> 00:04:27.377
So the interaction is super simple.

00:04:27.377 --> 00:04:29.333
It's like a personal flying pet.

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:31.594
It just always maintains a certain angle to you,

00:04:31.594 --> 00:04:33.670
and if I move around with it,

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.316
it'll actually follow me naturally.

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:38.455
And of course, we can build on top of this.

00:04:38.455 --> 00:04:41.025
So this leash has some additional electronics.

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:42.859
You can turn it on.

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:48.080
And now, it's like telling your dog to fly lower,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.638
if you have such a dog. So, I can press a button

00:04:50.638 --> 00:04:53.281
and manipulate it rather easily.

00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:55.970
So I just shifted its position.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.747
And it's really safe.

00:04:57.747 --> 00:05:00.430
I don't know about you guys in the front row —

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.674
(Laughter) — but at least in principle,

00:05:02.674 --> 00:05:04.789
you have to agree that you feel safer

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.837
because there is a physical connection.

00:05:06.837 --> 00:05:08.355
Live demos are hard, right?

00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:09.907
Things go wrong all the time.

00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:11.347
But no matter what,

00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:13.216
this thing will actually prevent this thing

00:05:13.216 --> 00:05:14.882
from going into you.

00:05:14.882 --> 00:05:16.970
What's more, it tells you immediately that

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.998
I am the one responsible for this device.

00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:21.518
You don't have to look for someone controlling it.

00:05:21.518 --> 00:05:24.285
Now, I can tell you that it's easy a lot,

00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:27.300
but I think a really good way to prove that

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.359
is to grab a second one

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:34.364
and launch it.

00:05:34.364 --> 00:05:37.647
And if I can do this on stage live,

00:05:37.647 --> 00:05:39.910
then I can show each and every one of you

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.965
in five minutes how to 
operate one of these devices.

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.666
So now we have two eyes in the sky. (Applause)

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:59.746
And now the trick is getting them back.

00:05:59.746 --> 00:06:02.668
(Laughter)

00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:06.255
So my question now to you is,

00:06:06.255 --> 00:06:08.000
well, it's a nice solution,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.130
it's very accessible, it's safe.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.671
What would you use it for?

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:15.420
What would you use such a camera for in your life?

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.734
Thank you.

00:06:17.734 --> 00:06:21.734
(Applause)
