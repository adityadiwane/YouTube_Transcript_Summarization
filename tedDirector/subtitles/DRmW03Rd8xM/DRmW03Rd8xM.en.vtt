00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
I don't speak English.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.160
I start speaking English, learning English, about a year ago.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.160
I speak French and I grew up with French, so my English is Franglais.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.160
I'm born in the Western Congo, in an area around here,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.160
and then went to university in Kisangani.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
And after I finished, I went to this area, the Ituri Forest.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
But what I've been doing --

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.160
when I was about 14, I grew in my uncle's house.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
And my father was a soldier,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.160
and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.160
What I've been doing from 14 to 17 was,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.160
I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk, meat

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
and whatever they were killing, poaching, hunting in the forest,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.160
bring it in the main city to get access to the market.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.160
But finally, I got myself involved.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.160
Around 17 to 20 years, I became, myself, a poacher.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160
And I wanted to do it, because -- I believed -- to continue my studies.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.160
I wanted to go to university, but my father was poor, my uncle even.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
So, I did it.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.160
And for three to four years, I went to university.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.160
For three times, I applied to biomedical science, to be a doctor.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
I didn't succeed.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.160
I was having my inscriptions, my admission to biology.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
And I said, "No way, I'm not doing it.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
My family's poor, my area don't have better health care.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
I want to be a doctor to serve them."

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.160
Three times, that means three years, and I start getting old.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
I say, "Oh, no, I continue."

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.160
So, I did tropical ecology and plant botany.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.160
When I finished, I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.160
It's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.160
right up to now -- I'm standing in front of you --

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
doing botany and wildlife conservation.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.160
That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.160
with some animals and also plants.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
And the training center there was built

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.160
around the scientific Congolese staff

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
and some American scientists also.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
So, the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number --

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
I think that is the largest number of elephants

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
we have right now in protected areas in Congo.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
It has also chimpanzees.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
because of this beautiful creature.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
That is a forest giraffe.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
I think you guys know it quite well.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
Here we have savanna giraffes,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.160
but through evolution we have this forest giraffe

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
that lives only in Congo.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
It has also some beautiful primates.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.160
Thirteen species -- highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
And it has the Ituri Forest itself --

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.160
about 1,300 species of plants, so far known.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.160
I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society, working there, in 1995,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
but I started working with them as a student in 1991.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.160
I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.160
because I accomplished with honor.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.160
But I didn't like the way -- the instruction I got was very poor.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.160
With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.160
that most of you know, life became very, very difficult.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
And the work we have been doing

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160
was completely difficult to do and to achieve it.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.160
When Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160
so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.160
So they started fleeing from the east to the west.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
And the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.160
so there was a road from Goma, somewhere here,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
and coming like this.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.160
So they might go through, pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.160
Congo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.160
On their way, they looted everything.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
Torture, wars -- oh, my God, you can't believe.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.160
Every person was looking his way -- where to go, we don't know.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
And it was for us, the young, the first time really

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.160
we hear the language of war, of guns.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.160
And even people who faced the rebellion of 1963,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.160
after our independence, they didn't believe what was happening.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
They were killing people. They were doing whatever they want

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
because they have power.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
Who have been doing that?

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
Young children. Child soldiers.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.160
You can't ask him how old he is because he has guns.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
But I was from the west, working in the east.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
I even [at] that time was not speaking Swahili.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
And when they came, they looted everything.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.160
You can't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
And I was from the same area to him.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
All my friends said, we are leaving because we are a target.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.160
But I'm not going to the east, because I don't know Swahili.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
I stay. If I go, I will be killed.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.160
I can't go back to my area -- it's more than 1,000 kilometers [away].

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
I stayed after they looted everything.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
We have been doing research on botany,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.160
and we have a small herbarium of 4,500 sheets of plants.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160
We cut, we dry and we packed them,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
we mounted them on a folder.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.160
Purpose: so that we start them for agriculture,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
for medicine, for whatever, and for science,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.160
for the study of the flora and the change of the forest.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
That is people moving around, that's even Pygmies.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:59.160
And this is a bright guy, hard-working person, and Pygmy.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
I've been working with him about 10 years.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.160
And with soldiers, they went to the forest for poaching elephants.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.160
Because he's Pygmy, he knows how to track elephants in the forest.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.160
He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
They came to told me, I have to save him.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
And what I did, I gave him just antibiotics

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.160
that we care for tuberculosis.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
And fortunately, I saved his life.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.160
And that was the language of the war.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.160
Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.160
killing animals, the logging timbers and so on.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
And what of important things --

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
I think all of you here have a cell phone.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
That mineral has killed a lot:

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.160
five millions of Congolese have gone because of this

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
Colombo-Tantalite -- they call it Coltan --

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
that they use it to make cell phones

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.160
and it has been in that area, all over in Congo. Extraction,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
and good, big business of the war.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:14.160
And what I did for the first war, after we have lost everything,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.160
I have to save something, even myself, my life and life of the staff.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.160
I buried some of our new vehicle engines, I buried it to save it.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160
And some of equipment went with them,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
on the top of the canopy, to save it.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
He's not collecting plants, he's going to save our equipment

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
on the canopy.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
And with the material that's left --

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
because they wanted to destroy it, to burn it,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
they didn't understand it, they didn't go to school --

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160
I packed it.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.160
And that is me, going to, hurrying to Uganda,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.160
to try to save that 4,000 material,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.160
with people carrying them on the bikes, bicycles.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
And after that, we succeeded.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.160
I housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.160
And after the war, I have been able to bring it back home,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
so that we continue our studies.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
The second war came while we didn't expect it.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.160
With friends, we had been sitting and watching match football,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.160
and having some good music with WorldSpace radio,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
when it started, I think.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
So, it was so bad.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
We heard that now from the east again the war started,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
and it's going fast.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.160
This time I think Kabila will go in place of, as he did with Mobutu.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.160
And the reserve was a target to the rebels.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.160
Three different movements and two militia acting in the same area

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
and competing for natural resources.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
And there was no way to work.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160
They destroy everything.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
Poaching -- oh, no way.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:59.160
And that's the powerful men. We have to meet and to talk to them.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
What's the regulation of the reserve

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
and what is the regulation of the parks?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
And they can't do what they are doing.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
So we went to meet them.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.160
That is Coltan extraction, gold mining.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
So, we started talking with them,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
convincing them that we are in a protected area.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
There are regulations

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.160
that it's prohibited to do logging, mining and poaching, specifically.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160
But they said, "You guys,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.160
you think that soldiers who are dying are not important,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.160
and your animals you are protecting are most important.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
We don't think so.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.160
We have to do it, because to let our movement advance."

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
I say, "No way, you are not going to do it here."

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
We started talking with them and I was negotiating.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.160
Tried to protect our equipment, tried to protect our staff

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.160
and the villages of about 1,500 people.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
And we continued.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
But I was doing that, negotiating with them.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
Sometimes we are having meeting

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
and they are talking with Jean-Pierre Bemba,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.160
with Mbusa Nyamwisi, with Kabila, and I'm there.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160
Sometimes, they talk to my own language, that is, Lingala.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.160
I hear it and what strategy they are doing, what they are planning.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160
Sometimes, they are having a helicopter

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160
to supply them with ammunition and so on.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.160
They used me to carry that, and I was doing counting,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.160
what comes from where, and where, and where.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:33.160
I had only this equipment -- my satellite phone, my computer

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:39.160
and a plastic solar panel -- that I hide it in the forest.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.160
And every time, daily, after we have meeting,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.160
what compromise we have, whatever,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
I go, I write a short email, send it.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160
I don't know how many people I had on my address.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.160
I sent the message: what is going about the progress of the war

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
and what they are planning to do.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.160
They started suspecting that what we do on the morning,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
and the afternoon, it's on the news, BBC, RFI.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160
(Laughter)

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
Something might be going on.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
And one day, we went for a meeting.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160
(Applause)

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.160
Sorry.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
One day, we went to meet the Chief Commander.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
He had the same iridium cell phone like me.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
And he asked me, "Do you know how to use this?"

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
I said, "I have never seen it.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160
(Laughter)

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
I don't know."

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
And I had mine on my pocket.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
So, it was a chance that they trusted me a lot.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
They didn't -- they was not looking on me.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
So I was scared.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.160
And when we finished the meeting, I went to return it in the forest.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.160
And I was sending news, doing whatever,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.160
reporting daily to the U.N., to UNESCO, to our institution in New York,

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
what have been going.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.160
And for that, they have been having big pressure to leave, to free the area.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
Because there was no way --

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
whatever they do, it's known the same time.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.160
During the first two rebellions, they killed all animals in the zoo.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.160
We have a zoo of 14 Okapis, and one of them was pregnant.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:17.160
And during the war, after a week of heavy war, fighting in the area,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
we succeeded: we had the first Okapi.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.160
This is not local population, this is rebels.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
They are now happy sending the news

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
that they have protected the Okapi with the war,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
because we sent the news that they are killing

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.160
and poaching everywhere.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.160
After a week, we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.160
they killed an elephant, just 50 meters to the area

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
where the zoo, where Okapi was born.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.160
And I was mad.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
I oppose it -- that they are now going to dissect it,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:54.160
until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
And I succeeded.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.160
The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.160
What we are doing after that -- that was the situation of the war --

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
we have to rebuild.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
I had some money. I was paid 150 dollars.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:17.160
I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.160
Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160
I started this with 70 dollars,

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160
and start fundraising money to where I've been going.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160
I had opportunity to go all over,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
where herbarium for my African material is.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.160
And they supported me a bit, and I built this.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:46.160
Now, it's doing work to train young Congolese.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
And also, what one of the speciality we are doing,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.160
my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.160
and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
This is one of the studies we are doing on a 40-hectare plot,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.160
where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
and we are tracking them.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.160
We have now data of about 15 years,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:21.160
to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.160
And that is -- I think it's difficult for me.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
This is a very embarrassing talk, I know.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
I don't know where to start, where to finish it.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
When I was thinking to come here,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.160
what best title I wanted to say to my talk, I didn't find this.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.160
But now I think that I would have titled it, "The Language of Guns."

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.160
Where are you people?

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.160
Now we are talking about reconstitution, rebuild Africa.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:59.160
But is gun industries a tool to rebuild, or is it a game?

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:04.160
I think we see the war like a game --

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
like soccer, football.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.160
Everybody is happy, but see what it's doing,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
see what is going in Darfur.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.160
Now we say, oh, my God.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160
See what the wars in Rwanda.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.160
That's because of the language of guns.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.160
I don't think that someone may blame Google,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.160
because it's doing the right things,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160
even if people like Al-Qaeda are using Google

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160
to connect between them.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.160
But it's serving millions for the best.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.160
But what is doing with gun industries?

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.160
Thank you.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.160
(Applause)

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
Chris Anderson: Thank you, thank you.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.160
Just wait over there.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.160
It's an amazing story.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.160
I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:02.160
How can we help you?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.160
Corneille Ewango: That's really embarrassing questions.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.160
I think that now I feel nervous.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.160
And I think, helping us, people are acting sometimes by ignorance.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
I did it myself.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
If I know when I was young,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.160
that [by] killing an elephant, I'm destroying biodiversity,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.160
I would not have done it.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.160
Many, many of you have seen the talents of Africans,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.160
but there are few who are going to school.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.160
Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics,

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.160
HIV, malaria, poverty, not going to school.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.160
What you can assist us, it's by building capacities.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.160
How many have got opportunity like me

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.160
to go to U.S., do a master's?

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.160
And go -- now, I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.160
But many of them are just here, because they don't have money.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.160
And they can't go even to university.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.160
They can't even attain the bachelor's degree.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.160
Building capacities for the young generation

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.160
is going to make a better generation

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
and a better future tomorrow for Africa.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.160
CA: Thank you, thank you.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.160
(Applause)
