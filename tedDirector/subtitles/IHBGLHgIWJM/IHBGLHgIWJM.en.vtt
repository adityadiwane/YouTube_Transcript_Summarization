00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm speaking to you about what I call the "mesh."

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
It's essentially a fundamental shift

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
in our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And it's starting to look at --

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
not always and not for everything --

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
but in certain moments of time,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
access to certain kinds of goods and service

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
will trump ownership of them.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And so it's the pursuit of better things,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
easily shared.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
And we come from a long tradition of sharing.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
We've shared transportation.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
We've shared wine and food

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and other sorts of fabulous experiences

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
in coffee bars in Amsterdam.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
We've also shared other sorts of entertainment --

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
sports arenas, public parks,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
concert halls, libraries,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
universities.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
All these things are share-platforms,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
but sharing ultimately starts and ends

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
with what I refer to

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
as the "mother of all share-platforms."

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And as I think about the mesh

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and I think about, well, what's driving it,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
how come it's happening now,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
I think there's a number of vectors

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
that I want to give you as background.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
One is the recession --

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
that the recession has caused us

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
to rethink our relationship

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
with the things in our lives relative to the value --

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
so starting to align the value

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
with the true cost.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
Secondly, population growth

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and density into cities.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
More people, smaller spaces,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
less stuff.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Climate change:

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
we're trying to reduce the stress

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
in our personal lives and in our communities

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and on the planet.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Also, there's been this recent distrust

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
of big brands, global big brands,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
in a bunch of different industries,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and that's created an opening.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Research is showing here, in the States,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and in Canada and Western Europe,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
that most of us are much more open

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
to local companies,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
or brands that maybe we haven't heard of.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Whereas before, we went with the big brands

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
that we were sure we trusted.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And last is that

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
we're more connected now to more people on the planet

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
than ever before --

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
except for if you're sitting next to someone.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
(Laughter)

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
The other thing that's worth considering

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
is that we've made a huge investment

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
over decades and decades,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and tens of billions of dollars

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
have gone into this investment

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
that now is our inheritance.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
It's a physical infrastructure

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
that allows us to get from point A to point B

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
and move things that way.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
It's also -- Web and mobile

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
allow us to be connected

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and create all kinds of platforms and systems,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and the investment of those technologies

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and that infrastructure

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
is really our inheritance.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
It allows us to engage

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
in really new and interesting ways.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And so for me, a mesh company, the "classic" mesh company,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
brings together these three things:

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
our ability to connect to each other --

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
most of us are walking around with these mobile devices

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
that are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled --

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
allows us to find each other

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and find things in time and space.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And third is that physical things

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
are readable on a map --

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
so restaurants, a variety of venues,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
but also with GPS and other technology

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
like RFID

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and it continues to expand beyond that,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
we can also track things that are moving,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
like a car, a taxicab, a transit system,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
a box that's moving through time and space.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
And so that sets up

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
for making access to get goods and services

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
more convenient and less costly in many cases

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
than owning them.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
For example, I want to use Zipcar.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
How many people here have experienced

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
car-sharing or bike-sharing?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Wow, that's great. Okay, thank you.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Basically Zipcar

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
is the largest car-sharing company in the world.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
They did not invent car-sharing.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
One of the founders went to Switzerland,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
saw it implemented someplace,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
said, "Wow, that looks really cool.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
I think we can do that in Cambridge,"

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
brought it to Cambridge

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
and they started -- two women --

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Robin Chase being the other person who started it.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Zipcar got some really important things right.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
First, they really understood

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And so they were very clever

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
about the way that they packaged car-sharing.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
They made it sexy. They made it fresh.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
They made it aspirational.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
If you were a member of the club,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
when you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
The cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
that were hollowed out or something.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
They picked these sexy cars.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
They targeted to universities.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
They made sure that the demographic

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
for who they were targeting and the car was all matching.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
It was a very nice experience,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
But they understood fundamentally

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
that they are not a car company.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
They understand that they are an information company.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Because when we buy a car

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
we go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow --

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
usually as quickly as possible.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
But when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
you might use an E.V. to commute,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
you get a truck because you're doing a home project.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
When you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And you're going to the mountains to ski,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
you get different accessories put on the car

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
for doing that sort of thing.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Meanwhile, these guys are sitting back,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
collecting all sorts of data

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
about our behavior and how we interact with the service.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And so it's not only an option for them,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
but I believe it's an imperative

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
for Zipcar and other mesh companies

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
to actually just wow us,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
to be like a concierge service.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Because we give them so much information,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and they are entitled to really see

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
how it is that we're moving.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
They're in really good shape to anticipate

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
what we're going to want next.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And so what percent of the day

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
do you think the average person uses a car?

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
What percentage of the time?

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Any guesses?

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Those are really very good.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
I was imagining it was like

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
20 percent when I first started.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
The number across the U.S. and Western Europe

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
is eight percent.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.260
And so basically even if you think it's 10 percent,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
90 percent of the time,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
something that costs us a lot of money --

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
personally, and also we organize our cities around it

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and all sorts of things --

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
90 percent of the time it's sitting around.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
So for this reason,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
I think one of the other themes with the mesh

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
is essentially that, if we squeeze hard

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
on things that we've thrown away,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
there's a lot of value in those things.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
What set up with Zipcar -- Zipcar started in 2000.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
In the last year, 2010,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
two car companies started,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
because the two things that really work for car-sharing

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
is, one, the car has to be available,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and two, it's within one or two blocks

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
of where you stand.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
is probably your neighbor's car,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
and it's probably also available.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
So people have created this business.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
Zipcar started a decade earlier,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
in 2000.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
It took them six years

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
to get 1,000 cars in service.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
WhipCar, which started April of last year,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
it took them six months

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
to get 1,000 cars in the service.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
So, really interesting.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
People are making anywhere between

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
200 and 700 dollars a month

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
So it's like vacation rentals for cars.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Since I'm here --

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
and I hope some people in the audience

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
are in the car business --

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
(Laughter)

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
-- I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things --

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
we saw cable-ready TVs

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and WiFi-ready Notebooks --

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
it would be really great if, any minute now,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Because it just creates more flexibility.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
It allows us as owners to have other options.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
And I think we're going there anyway.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses --

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
that are full mesh businesses,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
car manufacturers,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
who are beginning to offer

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
their own car-share services

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
as well as a second flanker brand,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
or as really a test, I think --

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
is to make sharing irresistible.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
We have experiences in our lives, certainly,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
when sharing has been irresistible.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
It's just, how do we make that recurrent

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and scale it?

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
We know also, because we're connected in social networks,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
that it's easy to create delight

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
in one little place.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
It's contagious because we're all connected to each other.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
So if I have a terrific experience

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.260
and I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
The opposite, as we know, is also true,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
often more true.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A.,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
doing the things that gourmet food trucks do,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and they've gathered quite a following.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
In general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
I look at things as platforms.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Platforms are invitations.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
So creating Craigslist

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
or iTunes and the iPhone developer network,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
there are all these networks -- Facebook as well.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
These platforms invite all sorts of developers

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and all sorts of people

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
to come with their ideas and their opportunity

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
to create and target an application

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
for a particular audience.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
And honestly, it's full of surprises.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Because I don't think any of us in this room

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
could have predicted the sorts of applications

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
that have happened at Facebook, around Facebook,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
for example, two years ago,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
when Mark announced

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
that they were going to go with a platform.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
So in this way, I think that cities are platforms,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
and certainly Detroit is a platform.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
The invitation of bringing

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
makers and artists and entrepreneurs --

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
and helps a city to thrive.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
It's inviting participation,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
and cities have, historically,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
invited all sorts of participation.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
Now we're saying that there's other options as well.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
So, for example, city departments

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
can open up transit data.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
Google has made available transit data API.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
that have provided the transit data,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
and different developers are building applications.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
So I was having a coffee in Portland,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and half-of-a-latte in

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
and the little board in the cafe

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
all of a sudden starts showing me

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
that the next bus is coming in three minutes

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
and the train is coming in 16 minutes.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
And so it's reliable, real data

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
that's right in my face, where I am,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
so I can finish the latte.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now:

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
about 21 percent

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
of vacant commercial and industrial space.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
That space is not vital.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
The areas around it lack vitality

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and vibrancy and engagement.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
There's this thing -- how many people here

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
have heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
Oh, great. So I'm a big fan of this.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
And this is a very mesh-y thing.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
Essentially, there are all sorts

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
of restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
There's a pop-up general store every three weeks,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and they do a fantastic job

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
of making a very social event

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
happening for foodies.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.260
Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
Subsequent to that,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
after it's been going for about a year now,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
they actually started to lease and create and extend.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
An area that was edgy-artsy

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
is now starting to become much cooler

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
and engage a lot more people.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
So this is an example.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
But these sorts of things are happening

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
in many different environments.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
From my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
is create perishability and urgency.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson:

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
sold out.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
is a wonderful thing.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
So a lot of what we see in the mesh,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
allows us to define, refine and scale.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
to go to market,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
to be in conversation with people,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
listen, refine something and go back.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
It's very cost-effective,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
and it's very mesh-y.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
The infrastructure enables that.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
In closing, and as we're moving towards the end,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
I just also want to encourage --

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
and I'm willing to share my failures as well,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
though not from the stage.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
(Laughter)

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
I would just like to say that one of the big things,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
when we look at waste

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
and when we look at ways that we can really be generous

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
and contribute to each other,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
but also move to create a better economic situation

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
and a better environmental situation,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
is by sharing failures.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
And one quick example

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
is Velib, in 2007,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
came forward in Paris

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
with a very bold proposition,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
a very big bike-sharing service.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
They made a lot of mistakes.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
They had some number of big successes.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
But they were very transparent, or they had to be,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
in the way that they exposed

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
what worked and didn't work.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
And so B.C. in Barcelona

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
and B-cycle

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
and Boris Bikes in London --

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
no one has had to repeat

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
the version 1.0 screw-ups

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
and expensive learning exercises

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
that happened in Paris.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
So the opportunity when we're connected

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
is also to share failures and successes.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
We're at the very beginning of something

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
that, what we're seeing

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
and the way that mesh companies are coming forward,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
is inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
I have a website -- it's a directory --

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
and it started with about 1,200 companies,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
and in the last two-and-a-half months

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
it's up to about 3,300 companies.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.260
And it grows on a very regular daily basis.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
But it's very much at the beginning.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
And thank you very much.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
(Applause)
