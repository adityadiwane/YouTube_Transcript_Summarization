00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.391
I work with children with autism.

00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:17.305
Specifically, I make technologies

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:19.476
to help them communicate.

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:21.015
Now, many of the problems that children

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:24.778
with autism face, they have a common source,

00:00:24.778 --> 00:00:26.872
and that source is that they find it difficult

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:32.132
to understand abstraction, symbolism.

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:36.784
And because of this, they have 
a lot of difficulty with language.

00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:39.799
Let me tell you a little bit about why this is.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:43.733
You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup.

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.218
All of us can see it. All of us understand this.

00:00:46.218 --> 00:00:48.530
These are two other pictures of soup,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.597
but you can see that these are more abstract

00:00:50.597 --> 00:00:52.453
These are not quite as concrete.

00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:54.627
And when you get to language,

00:00:54.627 --> 00:00:56.495
you see that it becomes a word

00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:59.756
whose look, the way it looks and the way it sounds,

00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:02.668
has absolutely nothing to do 
with what it started with,

00:01:02.668 --> 00:01:05.498
or what it represents, which is the bowl of soup.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:08.398
So it's essentially a completely abstract,

00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:10.974
a completely arbitrary representation of something

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:12.137
which is in the real world,

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:13.928
and this is something that children with autism

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:17.092
have an incredible amount of difficulty with.

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:19.843
Now that's why most of the people 
that work with children with autism --

00:01:19.843 --> 00:01:21.721
speech therapists, educators --

00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:24.354
what they do is, they try to help children with autism

00:01:24.354 --> 00:01:27.583
communicate not with words, but with pictures.

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:29.513
So if a child with autism wanted to say,

00:01:29.513 --> 00:01:31.971
"I want soup," that child would pick

00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:34.231
three different pictures, "I," "want," and "soup,"

00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:35.840
and they would put these together,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.707
and then the therapist or the parent would

00:01:37.707 --> 00:01:39.594
understand that this is what the kid wants to say.

00:01:39.594 --> 00:01:41.372
And this has been incredibly effective;

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:43.513
for the last 30, 40 years

00:01:43.513 --> 00:01:45.126
people have been doing this.

00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:46.475
In fact, a few years back,

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:49.150
I developed an app for the iPad

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.405
which does exactly this. It's called Avaz,

00:01:51.405 --> 00:01:53.684
and the way it works is that kids select

00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:55.005
different pictures.

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.575
These pictures are sequenced
together to form sentences,

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:59.294
and these sentences are spoken out.

00:01:59.294 --> 00:02:02.319
So Avaz is essentially converting pictures,

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.279
it's a translator, it converts pictures into speech.

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:07.997
Now, this was very effective.

00:02:07.997 --> 00:02:09.381
There are thousands of children using this,

00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:10.811
you know, all over the world,

00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:12.986
and I started thinking about

00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:15.640
what it does and what it doesn't do.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.324
And I realized something interesting:

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:21.527
Avaz helps children with autism learn words.

00:02:21.527 --> 00:02:23.932
What it doesn't help them do is to learn

00:02:23.932 --> 00:02:26.680
word patterns.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.152
Let me explain this in a little more detail.

00:02:29.152 --> 00:02:32.209
Take this sentence: "I want soup tonight."

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.289
Now it's not just the words
here that convey the meaning.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.429
It's also the way in which these words are arranged,

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.944
the way these words are modified and arranged.

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.265
And that's why a sentence like "I want soup tonight"

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:46.249
is different from a sentence like

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.561
"Soup want I tonight," which 
is completely meaningless.

00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:52.180
So there is another hidden abstraction here

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.737
which children with autism find
a lot of difficulty coping with,

00:02:55.737 --> 00:02:58.577
and that's the fact that you can modify words

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:00.678
and you can arrange them to have

00:03:00.678 --> 00:03:03.573
different meanings, to convey different ideas.

00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:07.032
Now, this is what we call grammar.

00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:09.068
And grammar is incredibly powerful,

00:03:09.068 --> 00:03:12.225
because grammar is this one component of language

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:15.714
which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have

00:03:15.714 --> 00:03:20.245
and allows us to convey an
infinite amount of information,

00:03:20.245 --> 00:03:22.379
an infinite amount of ideas.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.381
It's the way in which you can put things together

00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:26.549
in order to convey anything you want to.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.676
And so after I developed Avaz,

00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:30.244
I worried for a very long time

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:34.154
about how I could give grammar 
to children with autism.

00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:36.429
The solution came to me from
a very interesting perspective.

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.878
I happened to chance upon a child with autism

00:03:39.878 --> 00:03:41.987
conversing with her mom,

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:44.081
and this is what happened.

00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:46.267
Completely out of the blue, very spontaneously,

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:48.730
the child got up and said, "Eat."

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.500
Now what was interesting was

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.744
the way in which the mom was trying to tease out

00:03:54.744 --> 00:03:56.957
the meaning of what the child wanted to say

00:03:56.957 --> 00:03:59.217
by talking to her in questions.

00:03:59.217 --> 00:04:01.810
So she asked, "Eat what? Do 
you want to eat ice cream?

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.922
You want to eat? Somebody else wants to eat?

00:04:03.922 --> 00:04:07.235
You want to eat cream now? You
want to eat ice cream in the evening?"

00:04:07.235 --> 00:04:08.749
And then it struck me that

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.777
what the mother had done was something incredible.

00:04:10.777 --> 00:04:12.771
She had been able to get that child to communicate

00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:16.909
an idea to her without grammar.

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.605
And it struck me that maybe this is what

00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:20.990
I was looking for.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.132
Instead of arranging words in an order, in sequence,

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:27.304
as a sentence, you arrange them

00:04:27.304 --> 00:04:31.115
in this map, where they're all linked together

00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:33.258
not by placing them one after the other

00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:36.542
but in questions, in question-answer pairs.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.900
And so if you do this, then what you're conveying

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.886
is not a sentence in English,

00:04:40.886 --> 00:04:43.852
but what you're conveying is really a meaning,

00:04:43.852 --> 00:04:45.363
the meaning of a sentence in English.

00:04:45.363 --> 00:04:48.295
Now, meaning is really the underbelly,
in some sense, of language.

00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:52.116
It's what comes after thought but before language.

00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:54.619
And the idea was that this particular representation

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:57.880
might convey meaning in its raw form.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.651
So I was very excited by this, you know,

00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:01.144
hopping around all over the place,

00:05:01.144 --> 00:05:02.915
trying to figure out if I can convert

00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:05.439
all possible sentences that I hear into this.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.212
And I found that this is not enough.

00:05:07.212 --> 00:05:08.597
Why is this not enough?

00:05:08.597 --> 00:05:10.308
This is not enough because if you wanted to convey

00:05:10.308 --> 00:05:12.558
something like negation,

00:05:12.558 --> 00:05:14.294
you want to say, "I don't want soup,"

00:05:14.294 --> 00:05:16.514
then you can't do that by asking a question.

00:05:16.514 --> 00:05:18.799
You do that by changing the word "want."

00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:20.436
Again, if you wanted to say,

00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:22.416
"I wanted soup yesterday,"

00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:25.153
you do that by converting
the word "want" into "wanted."

00:05:25.153 --> 00:05:26.819
It's a past tense.

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.922
So this is a flourish which I added

00:05:28.922 --> 00:05:30.498
to make the system complete.

00:05:30.498 --> 00:05:32.475
This is a map of words joined together

00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:34.131
as questions and answers,

00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:36.395
and with these filters applied on top of them

00:05:36.395 --> 00:05:38.212
in order to modify them to represent

00:05:38.212 --> 00:05:39.921
certain nuances.

00:05:39.921 --> 00:05:41.872
Let me show you this with a different example.

00:05:41.872 --> 00:05:43.126
Let's take this sentence:

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:45.106
"I told the carpenter I could not pay him."

00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:46.898
It's a fairly complicated sentence.

00:05:46.898 --> 00:05:48.791
The way that this particular system works,

00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:51.369
you can start with any part of this sentence.

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:53.067
I'm going to start with the word "tell."

00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:54.529
So this is the word "tell."

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:56.129
Now this happened in the past,

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:58.352
so I'm going to make that "told."

00:05:58.352 --> 00:06:00.060
Now, what I'm going to do is,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.816
I'm going to ask questions.

00:06:01.816 --> 00:06:04.180
So, who told? I told.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.107
I told whom? I told the carpenter.

00:06:06.107 --> 00:06:07.858
Now we start with a different part of the sentence.

00:06:07.858 --> 00:06:09.725
We start with the word "pay,"

00:06:09.725 --> 00:06:14.302
and we add the ability filter to it to make it "can pay."

00:06:14.302 --> 00:06:16.403
Then we make it "can't pay,"

00:06:16.403 --> 00:06:18.002
and we can make it "couldn't pay"

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:19.665
by making it the past tense.

00:06:19.665 --> 00:06:21.588
So who couldn't pay? I couldn't pay.

00:06:21.588 --> 00:06:24.264
Couldn't pay whom? I couldn't pay the carpenter.

00:06:24.264 --> 00:06:25.995
And then you join these two together

00:06:25.995 --> 00:06:27.345
by asking this question:

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.082
What did I tell the carpenter?

00:06:29.082 --> 00:06:33.131
I told the carpenter I could not pay him.

00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:35.068
Now think about this. This is

00:06:35.068 --> 00:06:38.610
—(Applause)—

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.282
this is a representation of this sentence

00:06:42.282 --> 00:06:44.717
without language.

00:06:44.717 --> 00:06:46.909
And there are two or three
interesting things about this.

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:50.040
First of all, I could have started anywhere.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.283
I didn't have to start with the word "tell."

00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:53.699
I could have started anywhere in the sentence,

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:55.206
and I could have made this entire thing.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.982
The second thing is, if I wasn't an English speaker,

00:06:57.982 --> 00:07:00.157
if I was speaking in some other language,

00:07:00.157 --> 00:07:03.313
this map would actually hold true in any language.

00:07:03.313 --> 00:07:05.303
So long as the questions are standardized,

00:07:05.303 --> 00:07:09.590
the map is actually independent of language.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.705
So I call this FreeSpeech,

00:07:11.705 --> 00:07:14.640
and I was playing with this for many, many months.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.366
I was trying out so many
different combinations of this.

00:07:17.366 --> 00:07:19.655
And then I noticed something very
interesting about FreeSpeech.

00:07:19.655 --> 00:07:22.898
I was trying to convert language,

00:07:22.898 --> 00:07:25.282
convert sentences in English
into sentences in FreeSpeech,

00:07:25.282 --> 00:07:27.034
and vice versa, and back and forth.

00:07:27.034 --> 00:07:29.289
And I realized that this particular configuration,

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:31.315
this particular way of representing language,

00:07:31.315 --> 00:07:35.710
it allowed me to actually create very concise rules

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.444
that go between FreeSpeech on one side

00:07:38.444 --> 00:07:39.932
and English on the other.

00:07:39.932 --> 00:07:42.112
So I could actually write this set of rules

00:07:42.112 --> 00:07:45.507
that translates from this particular
representation into English.

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.338
And so I developed this thing.

00:07:47.338 --> 00:07:49.570
I developed this thing called 
the FreeSpeech Engine

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.131
which takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input

00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:56.061
and gives out perfectly grammatical English text.

00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:57.666
And by putting these two pieces together,

00:07:57.666 --> 00:07:59.547
the representation and the engine,

00:07:59.547 --> 00:08:03.343
I was able to create an app, a
technology for children with autism,

00:08:03.343 --> 00:08:05.842
that not only gives them words

00:08:05.842 --> 00:08:09.783
but also gives them grammar.

00:08:09.783 --> 00:08:12.143
So I tried this out with kids with autism,

00:08:12.143 --> 00:08:17.156
and I found that there was an 
incredible amount of identification.

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:19.876
They were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech

00:08:19.876 --> 00:08:22.434
which were much more complicated
but much more effective

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:25.333
than equivalent sentences in English,

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:27.015
and I started thinking about

00:08:27.015 --> 00:08:28.984
why that might be the case.

00:08:28.984 --> 00:08:33.271
And I had an idea, and I want to 
talk to you about this idea next.

00:08:33.271 --> 00:08:36.413
In about 1997, about 15 years back,

00:08:36.413 --> 00:08:38.424
there were a group of scientists that were trying

00:08:38.424 --> 00:08:40.813
to understand how the brain processes language,

00:08:40.813 --> 00:08:42.592
and they found something very interesting.

00:08:42.592 --> 00:08:44.464
They found that when you learn a language

00:08:44.464 --> 00:08:47.376
as a child, as a two-year-old,

00:08:47.376 --> 00:08:49.742
you learn it with a certain part of your brain,

00:08:49.742 --> 00:08:51.342
and when you learn a language as an adult --

00:08:51.342 --> 00:08:55.253
for example, if I wanted to
learn Japanese right now —

00:08:55.253 --> 00:08:57.960
a completely different part of my brain is used.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.791
Now I don't know why that's the case,

00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:01.782
but my guess is that that's because

00:09:01.782 --> 00:09:04.219
when you learn a language as an adult,

00:09:04.219 --> 00:09:05.835
you almost invariably learn it

00:09:05.835 --> 00:09:10.101
through your native language, or
through your first language.

00:09:10.101 --> 00:09:13.353
So what's interesting about FreeSpeech

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:15.155
is that when you create a sentence

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:16.850
or when you create language,

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.920
a child with autism creates
language with FreeSpeech,

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.753
they're not using this support language,

00:09:21.753 --> 00:09:23.964
they're not using this bridge language.

00:09:23.964 --> 00:09:26.621
They're directly constructing the sentence.

00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:28.814
And so this gave me this idea.

00:09:28.814 --> 00:09:30.838
Is it possible to use FreeSpeech

00:09:30.838 --> 00:09:33.348
not for children with autism

00:09:33.348 --> 00:09:39.610
but to teach language to people without disabilities?

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.588
And so I tried a number of experiments.

00:09:41.588 --> 00:09:44.536
The first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle

00:09:44.536 --> 00:09:46.506
in which these questions and answers

00:09:46.506 --> 00:09:48.341
are coded in the form of shapes,

00:09:48.341 --> 00:09:49.479
in the form of colors,

00:09:49.479 --> 00:09:51.328
and you have people putting these together

00:09:51.328 --> 00:09:53.101
and trying to understand how this works.

00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:55.477
And I built an app out of it, a game out of it,

00:09:55.477 --> 00:09:58.138
in which children can play with words

00:09:58.138 --> 00:09:59.842
and with a reinforcement,

00:09:59.842 --> 00:10:02.427
a sound reinforcement of visual structures,

00:10:02.427 --> 00:10:04.440
they're able to learn language.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.176
And this, this has a lot of potential, a lot of promise,

00:10:07.176 --> 00:10:09.151
and the government of India recently

00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:10.555
licensed this technology from us,

00:10:10.555 --> 00:10:12.629
and they're going to try it out
with millions of different children

00:10:12.629 --> 00:10:15.234
trying to teach them English.

00:10:15.234 --> 00:10:17.848
And the dream, the hope, the vision, really,

00:10:17.848 --> 00:10:20.930
is that when they learn English this way,

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.573
they learn it with the same proficiency

00:10:23.573 --> 00:10:27.291
as their mother tongue.

00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:31.107
All right, let's talk about something else.

00:10:31.107 --> 00:10:33.104
Let's talk about speech.

00:10:33.104 --> 00:10:34.375
This is speech.

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:36.337
So speech is the primary mode of communication

00:10:36.337 --> 00:10:37.950
delivered between all of us.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.805
Now what's interesting about speech is that

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:41.050
speech is one-dimensional.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.409
Why is it one-dimensional?

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:43.977
It's one-dimensional because it's sound.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.516
It's also one-dimensional because

00:10:45.516 --> 00:10:46.721
our mouths are built that way.

00:10:46.721 --> 00:10:50.233
Our mouths are built to create
one-dimensional sound.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:53.099
But if you think about the brain,

00:10:53.099 --> 00:10:54.863
the thoughts that we have in our heads

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:56.965
are not one-dimensional.

00:10:56.965 --> 00:10:58.424
I mean, we have these rich,

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:01.452
complicated, multi-dimensional ideas.

00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:03.142
Now, it seems to me that language

00:11:03.142 --> 00:11:05.474
is really the brain's invention

00:11:05.474 --> 00:11:08.570
to convert this rich, multi-dimensional thought

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.157
on one hand

00:11:10.157 --> 00:11:12.080
into speech on the other hand.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.842
Now what's interesting is that

00:11:13.842 --> 00:11:16.410
we do a lot of work in information nowadays,

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.489
and almost all of that is done
in the language domain.

00:11:19.489 --> 00:11:21.428
Take Google, for example.

00:11:21.428 --> 00:11:24.105
Google trawls all these
countless billions of websites,

00:11:24.105 --> 00:11:26.830
all of which are in English,
and when you want to use Google,

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.280
you go into Google search, and you type in English,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.443
and it matches the English with the English.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:37.026
What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead?

00:11:37.026 --> 00:11:39.327
I have a suspicion that if we did this,

00:11:39.327 --> 00:11:41.395
we'd find that algorithms like searching,

00:11:41.395 --> 00:11:43.720
like retrieval, all of these things,

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.795
are much simpler and also more effective,

00:11:46.795 --> 00:11:51.212
because they don't process
the data structure of speech.

00:11:51.212 --> 00:11:57.188
Instead they're processing
the data structure of thought.

00:11:57.188 --> 00:11:59.996
The data structure of thought.

00:11:59.996 --> 00:12:02.072
That's a provocative idea.

00:12:02.072 --> 00:12:04.214
But let's look at this in a little more detail.

00:12:04.214 --> 00:12:06.580
So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.464
We have the Free Speech
representation on one side,

00:12:09.464 --> 00:12:11.692
and we have the FreeSpeech 
Engine, which generates English.

00:12:11.694 --> 00:12:13.419
Now if you think about it,

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:15.963
FreeSpeech, I told you, is completely 
language-independent.

00:12:15.963 --> 00:12:18.050
It doesn't have any specific information in it

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.278
which is about English.

00:12:19.278 --> 00:12:22.078
So everything that this system knows about English

00:12:22.078 --> 00:12:26.698
is actually encoded into the engine.

00:12:26.698 --> 00:12:28.935
That's a pretty interesting concept in itself.

00:12:28.935 --> 00:12:32.539
You've encoded an entire human language

00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:35.184
into a software program.

00:12:35.184 --> 00:12:37.715
But if you look at what's inside the engine,

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:40.073
it's actually not very complicated.

00:12:40.073 --> 00:12:42.178
It's not very complicated code.

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.850
And what's more interesting is the fact that

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.053
the vast majority of the code in that engine

00:12:47.053 --> 00:12:49.465
is not really English-specific.

00:12:49.465 --> 00:12:51.360
And that gives this interesting idea.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.398
It might be very easy for us to actually

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:57.224
create these engines in many,
many different languages,

00:12:57.224 --> 00:13:03.578
in Hindi, in French, in German, in Swahili.

00:13:03.578 --> 00:13:06.377
And that gives another interesting idea.

00:13:06.377 --> 00:13:09.031
For example, supposing I was a writer,

00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:11.153
say, for a newspaper or for a magazine.

00:13:11.153 --> 00:13:16.164
I could create content in one language, FreeSpeech,

00:13:16.164 --> 00:13:18.220
and the person who's consuming that content,

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.281
the person who's reading that particular information

00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:23.776
could choose any engine,

00:13:23.776 --> 00:13:26.512
and they could read it in their own mother tongue,

00:13:26.512 --> 00:13:30.451
in their native language.

00:13:30.451 --> 00:13:33.173
I mean, this is an incredibly attractive idea,

00:13:33.173 --> 00:13:35.172
especially for India.

00:13:35.172 --> 00:13:36.862
We have so many different languages.

00:13:36.862 --> 00:13:39.004
There's a song about India, and there's a description

00:13:39.004 --> 00:13:41.348
of the country as, it says,

00:13:41.348 --> 00:13:43.708
(in Sanskrit).

00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:46.481
That means "ever-smiling speaker

00:13:46.481 --> 00:13:51.000
of beautiful languages."

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.964
Language is beautiful.

00:13:52.964 --> 00:13:55.418
I think it's the most beautiful of human creations.

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:59.396
I think it's the loveliest thing
that our brains have invented.

00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:02.980
It entertains, it educates, it enlightens,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.024
but what I like the most about language

00:14:05.024 --> 00:14:06.524
is that it empowers.

00:14:06.524 --> 00:14:08.362
I want to leave you with this.

00:14:08.362 --> 00:14:10.747
This is a photograph of my collaborators,

00:14:10.747 --> 00:14:11.744
my earliest collaborators

00:14:11.744 --> 00:14:13.206
when I started working on language

00:14:13.206 --> 00:14:14.708
and autism and various other things.

00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:16.125
The girl's name is Pavna,

00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:18.027
and that's her mother, Kalpana.

00:14:18.027 --> 00:14:20.165
And Pavna's an entrepreneur,

00:14:20.165 --> 00:14:22.536
but her story is much more remarkable than mine,

00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:24.936
because Pavna is about 23.

00:14:24.936 --> 00:14:27.488
She has quadriplegic cerebral palsy,

00:14:27.488 --> 00:14:29.128
so ever since she was born,

00:14:29.128 --> 00:14:32.728
she could neither move nor talk.

00:14:32.728 --> 00:14:35.131
And everything that she's accomplished so far,

00:14:35.131 --> 00:14:37.358
finishing school, going to college,

00:14:37.358 --> 00:14:38.774
starting a company,

00:14:38.774 --> 00:14:40.914
collaborating with me to develop Avaz,

00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:42.806
all of these things she's done

00:14:42.806 --> 00:14:48.329
with nothing more than moving her eyes.

00:14:48.329 --> 00:14:51.018
Daniel Webster said this:

00:14:51.018 --> 00:14:53.958
He said, "If all of my possessions were taken

00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.946
from me with one exception,

00:14:56.946 --> 00:14:59.927
I would choose to keep the power of communication,

00:14:59.927 --> 00:15:03.830
for with it, I would regain all the rest."

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:08.946
And that's why, of all of these incredible 
applications of FreeSpeech,

00:15:08.946 --> 00:15:11.026
the one that's closest to my heart

00:15:11.026 --> 00:15:13.094
still remains the ability for this

00:15:13.094 --> 00:15:15.474
to empower children with disabilities

00:15:15.474 --> 00:15:17.247
to be able to communicate,

00:15:17.247 --> 00:15:19.036
the power of communication,

00:15:19.036 --> 00:15:21.276
to get back all the rest.

00:15:21.276 --> 00:15:22.673
Thank you.

00:15:22.673 --> 00:15:24.005
(Applause)

00:15:24.005 --> 00:15:28.204
Thank you. (Applause)

00:15:28.204 --> 00:15:33.527
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

00:15:33.527 --> 00:15:37.527
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
