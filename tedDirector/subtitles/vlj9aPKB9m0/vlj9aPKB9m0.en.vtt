00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I love theater.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
and look at life with a completely new perspective.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.330
I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
The idea that in that room at that moment,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:44.330
everyone, regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
comes together.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
At that moment, we transcend space and time together.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.330
Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.330
Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.330
I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
and began developing "Upwake."

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
"Upwake" tells the story of Zero,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.330
a modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.330
stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.330
I wanted "Upwake" to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
And I wanted to let my imagination run wild.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.330
If Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of "The Little Prince," were here,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
he would have drawn three holes inside that box

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
and told you your sheep was inside.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
Because, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
This is not a box; these are the renderings of my imagination

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330
from head to paper to screen to life.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.330
In "Upwake" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.330
clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.330
sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.330
I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
Go from one world to another in a second.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.330
I wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
and use metaphors to suggest ideas.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.330
At the beginning of the show, for example, Zero deejays dream and reality.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.330
Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
in high definition, live, on stage.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.330
So today, I would like to talk to you about the relationship

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
between theater and technology.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
Let's start with technology.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
(Fuse blowing)

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
All right. Let's start with theater.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
(Laughter)

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:29.330
(Buzzing)

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
(Click, click, bang)

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:12.330
(Laughter)

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.330
(Applause)

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
Thank you.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.330
"Upwake" lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.330
I project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
which I interact with.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.330
I didn't use it as a special effect, but as a partner on stage.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
There are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.330
It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.330
Three hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.330
what started as a one person show became a collaborative work

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
of nineteen most talented artists.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
And here are some excerpts.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:27.330
(Applause)

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
Thank you.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.330
So this is, relatively, a new show that we're now beginning to tour.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
And in Austin, Texas,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.330
I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.330
When I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this:

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
Six hundred kids, packed in a gymnasium, waiting.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.330
I was a little nervous performing without animation, costume -- really -- and make-up.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.330
But the teachers came to me afterward and told me

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
they hadn't seen the kids that attentive.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.330
And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.330
in order to transport them into another.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
Something happened along the way.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
Zero became a person and not just a character in a play.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.330
Zero does not speak, is neither man nor woman.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.330
Zero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st Century,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.330
and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.330
It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:30.330
as it is about taking theater out of its box.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.330
As a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.330
And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.330
then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
It's as though you made something resonate within them.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.330
It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
allows them to be themselves just a bit more.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
Because through your mask, they let theirs go.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.330
Being human is an art form.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
and I know theater can heal.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
I know theater unites us.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.330
Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.330
tell various stories through different mediums.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
Comic books. Quantum physics video games.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
And Zero wants to go to the moon.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.330
suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.330
The idea is simple, basic. It's not original,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.330
but it's important, and it's important to participate.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
There is a revolution.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
It's a human and technological revolution.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
It's motion and emotion.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.330
It's information.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.330
It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
It's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
It's happening.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
The natural progression of science and art

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.330
finding each other to better touch and define the human experience.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
There is a revolution in the way that we think,

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:02.330
in the way that we share, and the way that we express our stories,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.330
our evolution.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:10.330
This is a time of communication, connection and creative collaboration.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.330
Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:23.330
and told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:28.330
He was social, and his character, The Tramp, spoke to millions.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:34.330
He gave entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
when they needed it the most.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:42.330
We are not here to question the possible; we are here to challenge the impossible.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
In the science of today, we become artists.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.330
In the art of today, we become scientists.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.330
We design our world. We invent possibilities.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.330
We teach, touch and move.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:09.330
to create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
(Ringing)

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
Thank you.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:32.330
(Applause)
