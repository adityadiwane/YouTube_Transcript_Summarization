00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.696
Here's my thing.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.920
Hold on. There I go. Hey.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.446
I want to start today --
talk about the structure of a polypeptide.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.816
(Laughter)

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.016
I get a lot of people asking me,
in terms of "Lost," you know,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.496
"What the hell's that island?"

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.456
You know, it's usually followed by,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.656
"No, seriously,
what the hell is that island?"

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.936
Why so many mysteries?

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.320
What is it about mystery
that I seem to be drawn to?

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.616
And I was thinking about this,
what to talk about at TED.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.816
When I talked to the kind rep from TED,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.536
and I said, "Listen, you know,
what should I talk about?"

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.936
He said, "Don't worry about it.
Just be profound."

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.256
(Laughter)

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.016
And I took enormous comfort in that.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.656
So thank you, if you're here.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.496
I was trying to think,
what do I talk about? Good question.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.776
Why do I do so much
stuff that involves mystery?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.656
And I started trying to figure it out.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.416
And I started thinking
about why do I do any of what I do,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.536
and I started thinking
about my grandfather.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.336
I loved my grandfather.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.456
Harry Kelvin was his name,
my mother's father.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.216
He died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.095
And one of the reasons he was amazing:

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.548
After World War II,
he began an electronics company.

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:24.136
He started selling surplus parts,
kits, to schools and stuff.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.936
So he had this incredible curiosity.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.856
As a kid, I saw him come over to me

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.296
with radios and telephones
and all sorts of things.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.776
And he'd open them up, he'd unscrew them
and reveal the inner workings --

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.936
which many of us,
I'm sure, take for granted.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.536
But it's an amazing gift to give a kid.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.136
To open up this thing
and show how it works

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.776
and why it works and what it is.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.776
He was the ultimate
deconstructor, in many ways.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.056
And my grandfather was a kind of guy
who would not only take things apart,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.336
but he got me interested
in all sorts of different odd crafts,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.496
like, you know, printing,
like the letter press.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.896
I'm obsessed with printing.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.376
I'm obsessed with silk-screening
and bookbinding and box making.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.656
When I was a kid, I was always,
like, taking apart boxes and stuff.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.416
And last night in the hotel,
I took apart the Kleenex box.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.776
I was just looking at it.
And I'm telling you --

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.216
(Laughter)

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.136
It's a beautiful thing. I swear to God.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.296
I mean, when you look at the box
and you sort of see how it works.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.895
Rives is here, and I met him
years ago at a book fair;

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.136
he does pop-up books.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.216
And I'm obsessed
with engineering of paper.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.096
The scoring of it, the printing of it,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.096
where the thing gets glued,
the registration marks for the ink.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.336
I just love boxes.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.616
My grandfather was the guy

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.416
who kind of got me
into all sorts of these things.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.136
He would also supply me with tools.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.736
He was this amazing encourager --
this patron, sort of, to make stuff.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.296
And he got me a Super 8 camera
when I was 10 years old.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.816
And in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.816
to be a 10-year-old kid
that had access to a camera.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.456
And you know, he was so generous;
I couldn't believe it.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.936
He wasn't doing it
entirely without some manipulation.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.976
I mean, I would call him, and I'd be like,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.536
"Listen, Grandpa,
I really need this camera.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.336
You don't understand.
This is, like, I want to make movies.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.736
I'll get invited to TED one day --"

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.776
(Laughter)

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.016
And, you know, my grandmother
was the greatest.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.776
Because she'd be like, you know --
she'd get on the phone.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.496
She'd be like, "Harry,
it's better than the drugs.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.484
She was fantastic.

00:03:20.508 --> 00:03:23.736
So I found myself getting this stuff,
thanks to her assist,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.016
and suddenly, you know,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.136
I had a synthesizer
when I was 14 years old --

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.376
this kind of stuff.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.456
And it let me make things,
which, to me, was sort of the dream.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.016
He sort of humored my obsession
to other things too, like magic.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.776
The thing is, we'd go
to this magic store in New York City

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.176
called Lou Tannen's Magic.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.656
It was this great magic store.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.696
It was a crappy
little building in Midtown,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.376
but you'd be in the elevator,
the elevator would open --

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.456
there'd be this little, small magic store.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.136
You'd be in the magic store.
And it was a magical place.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.656
So I got all these magic tricks.
Here. I'll show you.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.536
This is the kind of thing.
So it would be like, you know.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.376
Which is good, but now I can't move.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.816
Now, I have to do
the rest of the thing like this.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.296
I'm like, "Oh, wow.
Look at my computer over there!"

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.536
(Laughter)

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.936
So one of the things
that I bought at the magic store was this:

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.736
Tannen's Mystery Magic Box.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.536
The premise behind the Mystery
Magic Box was the following:

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.320
15 dollars buys you
50 dollars worth of magic.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.456
Which is a savings.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.336
(Laughter)

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.776
Now, I bought this decades ago
and I'm not kidding.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.416
If you look at this,
you'll see it's never been opened.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.576
But I've had this forever.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.936
Now, I was looking at this,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.376
it was in my office,
as it always is, on the shelf,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.776
and I was thinking,
why have I not opened this?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.040
And why have I kept it?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.136
Because I'm not a pack rat.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.376
I don't keep everything,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.576
but for some reason
I haven't opened this box.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.936
And I felt like there was
a key to this, somehow,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.336
in talking about something at TED
that I haven't discussed before,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.576
and bored people elsewhere.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.856
So I thought, maybe
there's something with this.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.776
And there was this giant question mark.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.336
I love the design,
for what it's worth, of this thing.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.616
And I started thinking,
why haven't I opened it?

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.536
And I realized that I haven't opened it

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.136
because it represents
something important -- to me.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.560
It represents my grandfather.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.896
Am I allowed to cry at TED?

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.635
Because -- no, I'm not going to cry.

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:11.816
(Laughter)

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.991
But --

00:05:13.015 --> 00:05:16.736
(Laughter)

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.160
The thing is that it represents
infinite possibility.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.056
It represents hope.
It represents potential.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.120
And what I love about this box,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.520
and what I realize I sort of do
in whatever it is that I do,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.616
is I find myself
drawn to infinite possibility,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.856
that sense of potential.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.656
And I realize that mystery
is the catalyst for imagination.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.776
Now, it's not the most
ground-breaking idea,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.376
but when I started to think
that maybe there are times

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.576
when mystery is more important
than knowledge.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.416
I started getting interested in this.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.456
And so I started thinking about "Lost"
and the stuff that we do,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.976
and I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes
are everywhere in what I do!

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.416
In the creation of "Lost,"
Damon Lindelof and I,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.856
who created the show with me,

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.016
we were basically tasked
with creating this series

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.736
that we had very little time to do.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.256
We had 11 and a half weeks

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.056
to write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it,
cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.456
So it was not a lot of time.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.256
And that sense of possibility --
what could this thing be?

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.856
There was no time to develop it.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.816
I'm sure you're all familiar with people

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.576
who tell you what you can't do
and what you should change.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.096
There was no time for that,
which is kind of amazing.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.376
And so we did this show,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.176
and for those of you
who haven't seen it, or don't know it,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.536
I can show you one
little clip from the pilot,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.776
just to show you some stuff that we did.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.520
(Engine roaring)

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.760
(Video) Claire: Help!

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.696
Please help me!

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.800
Help me! Please, help me!

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.536
Jack: Get him out of here!
Get him away from the engine!

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.824
Get him out of here!

00:06:52.848 --> 00:06:58.936
(Engine roaring)

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.296
C: Help me, please!
I'm having contractions!

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.056
J: How many months pregnant are you?

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.536
C: I'm only eight months.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.376
J: And how far apart are they coming?

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.440
C: I don't know. I think it just happened.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.880
Man: Hey! Hey! Hey, get away from --

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.896
JJ Abrams: 10 years ago,
if we wanted to do that,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.336
we'd have to kill a stuntman.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.416
(Laughter)

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.376
It would be harder.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.736
Take two would be a bitch.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.016
(Laughter)

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.136
So the amazing thing was,
we were able to do this thing.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.016
And part of that was
the amazing availability of technology,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.456
knowing we could do anything.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.336
I mean, we could never have done that.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.096
We might have been able to write it;

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.576
we wouldn't have been able
to depict it like we did.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.576
So part of the amazing thing for me
is in the creative process,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.736
technology is mind-blowingly
inspiring to me.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.016
I realize that that blank page
is a magic box, you know?

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.256
It needs to be filled
with something fantastic.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.416
I used to have the "Ordinary People"
script that I'd flip through.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.856
The romance was amazing to me;
it would inspire me.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.336
I wanted to try and fill pages

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.136
with the same kind of spirit
and thought and emotion

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.376
that that script did.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.856
So, you know, I love Apple computers.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.096
I'm obsessed.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.816
So the Apple computer --
the PowerBook -- this computer,

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.056
it challenges me.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.936
It basically says, what are you
going to write worthy of me?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.656
I feel this -- I'm compelled.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.976
(Laughter)

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.416
And I often am like,
you know, dude, today I'm out.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.576
I got nothing. You know? So there's that.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.056
In terms of the content of it,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.256
you look at stories, you think,
what are stories but mystery boxes?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.896
There's a fundamental question --
in TV, the first act is called the teaser.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.256
It's literally the teaser.
It's the big question.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.896
So you're drawn into it.
Then there's another question.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.656
And it goes on. Look at "Star Wars."

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.496
The droids meet the mysterious woman.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.776
Who's that? We don't know. Mystery box!
Then you meet Luke Skywalker.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.136
He gets the droid,
you see the holographic image.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.976
You learn it's a message.
She wants to find Obi Wan Kenobi.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.136
He's her only hope.
But who's Obi Wan Kenobi?

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.113
Mystery box! So then he meets Ben Kenobi.

00:09:01.137 --> 00:09:03.856
Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi.
Holy shit! So it keeps us --

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.896
(Laughter)

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.296
Have you guys not seen that?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.336
(Laughter)

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.576
It's huge! Anyway --

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.176
So there's this thing with mystery boxes
that I started feeling compelled.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.776
Then there's the thing of mystery
in terms of imagination --

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.296
the withholding of information.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.336
You know, doing that intentionally
is much more engaging.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.296
Whether it's like the shark in "Jaws" --

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.816
if Spielberg's mechanical shark,
Bruce, had worked,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.016
it would not be remotely as scary;
you would have seen it too much.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.856
In "Alien", they never
really showed the alien: terrifying!

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.016
Even in a movie like
a romantic comedy, "The Graduate,"

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.376
they're having that date,
and they're in the car,

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.656
and it's loud, and so they put the top up.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.576
You don't hear anything they're saying!

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.456
You can't hear a word!
But it's the most romantic date ever.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.536
And you love it because you don't hear it.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.136
So to me, there's that.
And then, finally, there's this idea --

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.416
stretching the paradigm a little bit --

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.696
but the idea of the mystery box.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.136
Meaning, what you think you're getting,
then what you're really getting.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.256
And it's true in so many
movies and stories.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.736
Look at "E.T.," for example --

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.896
"E.T." is this unbelievable
movie about what?

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.936
It's about an alien
who meets a kid, right?

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.896
Well, it's not. "E.T." is about divorce.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.536
"E.T." is about a heartbroken,
divorce-crippled family,

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.816
and ultimately,
this kid who can't find his way.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.376
"Die Hard," right? Crazy, great, fun,
action-adventure movie in a building.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.616
It's about a guy
who's on the verge of divorce.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.856
He's showing up to L.A.,
tail between his legs.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.096
There are great scenes --

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.256
maybe not the most amazing
dramatic scenes in the history of time,

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.496
but pretty great scenes.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.856
There's a half an hour
of investment in character

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.256
before you get to the stuff
that you're expecting.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.096
When you look at a movie like "Jaws,"

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.376
the scene that you expect --
we have the screen?

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.776
These are the kind of scenes

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.256
that you remember and expect from "Jaws."

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.376
And she's being eaten;

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.696
there's a shark.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.936
(Woman screaming)

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.336
The thing about "Jaws" is,
it's really about a guy

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.896
who is sort of dealing with his place
in the world -- with his masculinity,

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.496
with his family, how he's going to,
you know, make it work in this new town.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.416
This is one of my favorite scenes ever,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.176
and this is a scene
that you wouldn't necessarily think of

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.640
when you think of "Jaws."
But it's an amazing scene.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.000
(Video) Father: C'mere.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.800
Give us a kiss.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.760
Son: Why?

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.040
Father: 'Cause I need it.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.690
JJA: Come on. "Why? 'Cause I need it"?

00:12:12.714 --> 00:12:13.956
Best scene ever, right?

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.996
(Laughter)

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.816
Come on! So you think of "Jaws" --

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.456
so that's the kind of stuff that,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.416
like, you know --
the investment of character,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.216
which is the stuff that really
is inside the box, you know?

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.696
It's why when people do sequels,
or rip off movies, you know, of a genre,

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.456
they're ripping off the wrong thing.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.136
You're not supposed
to rip off the shark or the monster.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.016
You know, if you rip something off --
rip off the character.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.576
Rip off the stuff that matters.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.576
I mean, look inside yourself
and figure out what is inside you.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.056
Because ultimately,
the mystery box is all of us.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.938
So there's that. Then the distribution.

00:12:43.962 --> 00:12:46.776
What's a bigger mystery box
than a movie theater? You know?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.736
You go to the theater,
you're just so excited to see anything.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.256
The moment the lights go down
is often the best part.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.736
And you're full of that amazing --
that feeling of excited anticipation.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.856
And often, the movie's there
and it's going,

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.056
and then something happens
and you go, "Oh --", and then, "Mmm ..."

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.456
When it's a great movie,
you're along for the ride

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.623
because you're willing
to give yourself to it.

00:13:06.647 --> 00:13:10.456
So to me, whether it's a TV,
an iPod, computer, cell phone --

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.816
It's funny, I'm an --
as I said, Apple fanatic --

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.576
and one day, about a year or so ago,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.296
I was signing on online in the morning
to watch Steve Jobs' keynote,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.536
because I always do.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.696
And he came on,
he was presenting the video iPod,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.496
and what was on
the enormous iPod behind him?

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.816
"Lost"! I had no idea!

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.176
And I realized, holy shit,
it'd come full circle.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.153
The inspiration I get from the technology

00:13:32.177 --> 00:13:35.136
is now using the stuff that I do
to sell technology. It's nuts!

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.376
(Laughter)

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.656
I was going to show you a couple
of other things I'm going to skip.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.856
I'll show you one other thing
that has nothing to do with anything.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.516
This is something online;
six years ago, they did this.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.116
This is an online thing done by guys
who had some visual effects experience.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.316
But the point was,
that they were doing things

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.636
that were using these mystery boxes
that they had -- everyone has now.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.996
What I've realized is what my grandfather
did for me when I was a kid,

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.816
everyone has access to now.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.816
You don't need to have my grandfather,
though you wish you had.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.096
But I have to tell you --

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.616
this is a guy doing stuff
on a Quadra 950 computer --

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.376
the resolution's a little bit low --

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.096
using Infinity software
they stopped making 15 years ago.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.976
He's doing stuff that looks as amazing

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.176
as stuff I've seen
released from Hollywood.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.176
The most incredible
sort of mystery, I think,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.936
is now the question of what comes next.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.976
Because it is now democratized.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.496
So now, the creation of media --
it's everywhere.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.336
The stuff that I was lucky
and begging for to get when I was a kid

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.576
is now ubiquitous.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.416
And so, there's an amazing sense
of opportunity out there.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.536
And when I think of the filmmakers
who exist out there now

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.536
who would have been silenced, you know --

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.976
who have been silenced in the past --

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.336
it's a very exciting thing.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.496
I used to say in classes
and lectures and stuff,

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.256
to someone who wants to write,
"Go! Write! Do your thing."

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.056
It's free, you don't need permission.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.336
But now I can say, "Go make your movie!"
There's nothing stopping you

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.616
from going out there
and getting the technology.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.056
You can lease, rent,
buy stuff off the shelf

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.856
that is either as good, or just as good,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.416
as the stuff that's being used
by the, you know, "legit people."

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.576
No community is best served
when only the elite have control.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.776
And I feel like
this is an amazing opportunity

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.256
to see what else is out there.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.496
When I did "Mission: Impossible III,"
we had amazing visual effects.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.416
ILM did the effects; it was incredible.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.176
And sort of my dream to be involved.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.536
And there are a couple
of sequences in the movie,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.600
like these couple of moments
I'll show you.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.880
There's that.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.974
(Video) Luther: Ethan, move!

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.760
(Explosion)

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.536
Obviously, I have an obsession
with big crazy explosions.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.136
So my favorite visual effect in the movie
is the one I'm about to show you.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.376
It's a scene in which
Tom's character wakes up.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.656
He's drowsy. He's crazy.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.336
And the guy wakes up,
and he shoves this gun in his nose

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.496
and shoots this little capsule
into his brain

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.200
that he's going to use later
to kill him, as bad guys do.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.920
(Video) Brownway: Good morning.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.096
JJA: OK, now.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.336
When we shot that scene,

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.416
the actor who had the gun,
an English actor, Eddie Marsan --

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.656
sweetheart, great guy --

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.256
he kept taking the gun
and putting it into Tom's nose,

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.776
and it was hurting Tom's nose.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.976
And I learned this
very early on in my career:

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.256
Don't hurt Tom's nose.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.176
(Laughter)

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.296
There are three things
you don't want to do.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.136
Number two is: Don't hurt Tom's nose.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.856
So Eddie has this gun --
and he's this sweet English guy.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.016
He's like, "Sorry,
I don't want to hurt you."

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.056
I'm like, "We have to
make this look good."

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.319
And I realized that we had to do something
because it wasn't working.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.576
And I thought back
to what I would have done

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.016
using the Super 8 camera
that my grandfather got me

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.256
sitting in that room,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.016
and I realized that hand
didn't have to be Eddie Marsan's.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.256
It could be Tom's.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.616
And Tom would know
just how hard to push the gun.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.856
He wouldn't hurt himself.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.536
So we took his hand and we painted it
to look a little bit more like Eddie's.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.416
We put it in Eddie's sleeve,

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.936
and so the hand that you see --

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.136
that's not Eddie's hand, that's Tom's.
So Tom is playing two roles.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.576
(Laughter)

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.416
And he didn't ask for any more money.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.999
So here, here. Watch it again.

00:17:19.999 --> 00:17:21.495
There he is. He's waking up.

00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:23.640
He's drowsy, been through a lot.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.136
(Video) Brownway: Good morning.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.296
JJA: Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.536
Anyway.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.776
So ...

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.176
(Applause)

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.416
Thanks.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.495
(Applause)

00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:45.136
So you don't need the greatest technology
to do things that can work in movies.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.496
And the mystery box,
in honor of my grandfather, stays closed.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.736
Thank you.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.360
(Applause)
