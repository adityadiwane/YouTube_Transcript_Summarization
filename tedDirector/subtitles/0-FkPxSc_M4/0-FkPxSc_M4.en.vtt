00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.656
I'm often asked

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.976
why I do art,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.936
what do I want to say
with my art photography,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.440
and what is the use of it?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.016
Once in a while I start to worry

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.696
how to actually measure
the impact from the art

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.016
like we do with medicine or technology,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.160
where we can see the results
and calculate it.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.616
Then I would finally be able
to explain to my mother my art

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.055
with real numbers.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.416
But my art is so far from metrics,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.120
and moreover, my photography
is widely exposing the theme of escapism.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.776
My theory is that all of us

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.656
struggle sometimes to escape

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.456
in order to analyze our reality,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.720
appreciate it or change.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.896
I don't work with daily life as it is,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.256
and I'm not a documentary photographer

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.640
in the common sense.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.616
But I am a documentary photographer

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.336
in a different sense.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.600
I document dreams.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.136
I work with daily life as it could be,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.640
as I imagine it.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.336
I am a daydreamer, but at the same time
I love things that are authentic

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.776
and deal with our innermost nature,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.200
which I would never want to escape from.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.536
I adore complicated personalities,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.456
and real life inspires me
to create my images.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.176
Real life inspires our escape,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.800
and sometimes that escape is very needed.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.096
I believe heroes are not created easily,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.696
and I choose to work with individuals

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.656
who are survivors

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.136
and facing everyday routines

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.016
that are not always full of color,

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.416
people who are on their way
to a better life,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.960
fighting against life circumstances.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.895
Why do I choose people
like that for my models?

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.576
Because I've been in that position myself,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.200
when I had to learn
how to survive in real life.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.976
I was a student living abroad in London.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.800
I was working at two places
at the same time as a waitress.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.496
Obviously that wasn't my dream job,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.336
but I decided to play a game

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.976
where I imagined
that I am taking a role in a film,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.096
and in the film I am a waitress,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.496
and I need to act great.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.696
I used to dye my hair
and brows to gingerette,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.256
I changed my hair to curly perm,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.616
I lost weight

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.136
and made myself believe

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.256
I am just a character acting in a film.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.536
That isn't forever,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.376
that is all just temporary.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.816
That helped me a lot.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.496
It motivated me to change my life

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.120
and take a hard time as a game.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.936
Now, as an artist,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.856
I am creating different
lives for my models

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.336
in order to give them the experience
of being someone else in reality.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.616
Through the photographic process,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.936
all of my models
become like silent movie actors.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.856
They are captured at the moment

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.256
when they believe
in being someone else entirely.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.816
In order to create
a new reality in its entirety,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.736
I physically create
every single thing in my work,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.736
sometimes from outfits to the stage.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.576
Because I work with analogues,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.696
and I don't make any digital
manipulations to my photographs,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.080
I need everything
to take place in reality,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.016
in spite of the fact that nowadays,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.320
digitally, you can create
pretty much everything.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.256
I don't like this path.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.536
Even if that reaches perfection,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.336
I see the beauty
in authenticity of making,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.840
and that's impossible without flaws.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.296
A digitally manipulated photograph

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.976
is not true for me.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.696
It doesn't capture anything real.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.839
It's not experienced, not motivating.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.816
It's like, instead of going traveling,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.240
you look at someone else's
travel photographs.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.216
What I find so exciting

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.696
is the ability to make people's dreams
of being someone else a reality.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.296
That's like a drug

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.496
which pushes me to keep working,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.480
even without metrics.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.016
One of my models

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.296
had always dreamed
of being seen as a warrior,

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.360
but she wasn't able to do sports
because of her health problems.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.296
Half a year ago, she passed away

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.480
from heart disease at the age of 22.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.256
But two days before her death,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.576
the images we spent months
working on together

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.736
of her as a warrior
she dreamed of becoming

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.680
were published at a large exhibition
in Milan by Vogue Magazine.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.560
All her life was about overcoming.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.816
Before she died, she had known

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.976
that thousands of people
saw her image from the land of escapism

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.360
and believed in her
as a brave and fearless warrior.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.176
For my work, I invite people
to play a game

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.856
like we all used to as children

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.936
when we pretend to be someone else

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.496
and that process made us really happy.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.120
To my mind it is important for grown-ups.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.776
We need these transformations

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.856
to enact this in the name of art.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.336
It gives us the very real feeling
of being important and powerful

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.160
in order to influence our reality.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.360
I know this from
my own personal experience.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.616
I have had so many versions of myself

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.736
through my self-portraits

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.760
that I've been many different characters.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.896
Being someone else in the land of escapism

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.976
doesn't exactly give us numbers
that we can gauge,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.656
but it's like a real lost form of magic

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.776
which exists but can't be measured.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.336
There is a unique power in art

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.976
to transform and lift our limits.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.616
Art creates what I call a conjured life,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.216
which helps our existence

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.776
and pushes, motivates
and inspires us to dwell

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.336
and express ourselves

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.456
without metrics or calculations.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.696
Thank you.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.960
(Applause)
