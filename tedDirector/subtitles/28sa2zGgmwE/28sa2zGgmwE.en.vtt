00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:18.534
Some months back,
I was visiting this East African city,

00:00:18.558 --> 00:00:21.547
and we were stuck in traffic.

00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:24.613
And this vendor suddenly
approaches my window

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:27.180
with a half-opened alphabet sheet.

00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:31.324
I took a quick look at the alphabet sheet,

00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:32.783
and I thought of my daughter,

00:00:32.807 --> 00:00:35.369
how it would be nice
to spread it on the floor

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:37.233
and just play all over it with her

00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:39.446
while getting her to learn the alphabet.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.765
So the traffic moved a bit,
and I quickly grabbed a copy,

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.788
and we moved on.

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:49.266
When I had time to fully open
the alphabet sheet

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.619
and take a more detailed look at it,

00:00:51.643 --> 00:00:54.666
I knew I was not going to use that
to teach my daughter.

00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:56.784
I regretted my purchase.

00:00:58.331 --> 00:00:59.673
Why so?

00:01:00.338 --> 00:01:03.124
Looking at the alphabet sheet
reminded me of the fact

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:05.524
that not much has changed

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:07.971
in the education curricula in Africa.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.449
Some decades back, I was taught
out of a similar alphabet sheet.

00:01:13.312 --> 00:01:15.569
And because of that,
I struggled for years.

00:01:16.464 --> 00:01:20.960
I struggled to reconcile my reality
with the formal education I received

00:01:20.984 --> 00:01:23.131
in school, in the schools I attended.

00:01:24.592 --> 00:01:26.602
I had identity crises.

00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:29.535
I looked down on my reality.

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:33.805
I looked at my ancestry,
I looked at my lineage with disrespect.

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:39.258
I had very little patience
for what my life had to offer around me.

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:42.444
Why?

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:44.915
"A is for apple."

00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:47.845
"A is for apple."

00:01:49.528 --> 00:01:54.216
"A is for apple" is for that child
in that part of the world

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.972
where apples grow out;

00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:58.727
who has an apple in her lunch bag;

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:03.637
who goes to the grocery store
with her mom and sees red,

00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:07.314
green, yellow -- apples
of all shapes and colors and sizes.

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.938
And so, introducing
education to this child

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:13.084
with an alphabet sheet like this

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.131
fulfills one of the major
functions of education,

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:20.317
which is to introduce the learner

00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:23.714
to an appreciation
of the learner's environment

00:02:23.738 --> 00:02:28.380
and a curiosity to explore more
in order to add value.

00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:30.992
In my own case,

00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:34.326
when and where I grew up in Africa,

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:37.443
apple was an exotic fruit.

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.104
Two or three times a year,

00:02:40.128 --> 00:02:45.495
I could get some yellowish apples
with brown dots, you know,

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.416
signifying thousands of miles traveled --
warehouses storing --

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.614
to get to me.

00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:53.486
I grew up in the city

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.510
to very financially comfortable parents,

00:02:56.534 --> 00:02:58.476
so it was my dignified reality,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.811
exactly the same way

00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:04.997
cassava fufu or ugali
would not regularly feature

00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.922
in an American, Chinese or Indian diet,

00:03:08.851 --> 00:03:11.280
apples didn't count as part of my reality.

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:15.256
So what this did to me,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.964
introducing education to me
with "A is for apple,"

00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:21.447
made education an abstraction.

00:03:21.914 --> 00:03:23.783
It made it something out of my reach --

00:03:24.665 --> 00:03:26.571
a foreign concept,

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:30.401
a phenomenon for which I would have
to constantly and perpetually seek

00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:32.236
the validation of those it belonged to

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.200
for me to make progress
within it and with it.

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.015
That was tough for a child;
it would be tough for anyone.

00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:42.765
As I grew up and I advanced academically,

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:47.853
my reality was further separated
from my education.

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.485
In history, I was taught

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.760
that the Scottish explorer Mungo Park
discovered the Niger River.

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:57.424
And so it bothered me.

00:03:57.448 --> 00:03:59.463
My great-great-grandparents grew up

00:03:59.487 --> 00:04:01.490
quite close to the edge
of the Niger River.

00:04:01.514 --> 00:04:03.933
(Laughter)

00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:10.434
And it took someone to travel
thousands of miles from Europe

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.905
to discover a river
right under their nose?

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.370
(Laughter)

00:04:15.394 --> 00:04:16.551
No!

00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:21.994
(Applause and cheers)

00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:23.947
What did they do with their time?

00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:25.868
(Laughter)

00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:28.723
Playing board games, roasting fresh yams,

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:30.127
fighting tribal wars?

00:04:30.557 --> 00:04:35.417
I mean, I just knew my education
was preparing me to go somewhere else

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:39.208
and practice and give to another
environment that it belonged to.

00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:42.415
It was not for my environment,
where and when I grew up.

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:44.188
And this continued.

00:04:44.212 --> 00:04:46.105
This philosophy undergirded my studies

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.594
all through the time I studied in Africa.

00:04:48.618 --> 00:04:52.452
It took a lot of experiences
and some studies

00:04:52.476 --> 00:04:55.628
for me to begin to have
a change of mindset.

00:04:55.652 --> 00:04:58.616
I will share a couple
of the remarkable ones with us.

00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:02.090
I was in the United States
in Washington, DC

00:05:02.114 --> 00:05:04.156
studying towards my doctorate,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.057
and I got this consultancy position
with the World Bank Africa Region.

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:11.491
And so I remember one day,

00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:16.163
my boss -- we were having
a conversation on some project,

00:05:16.187 --> 00:05:19.228
and he mentioned a particular
World Bank project,

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:24.224
a large-scale irrigation project
that cost millions of dollars

00:05:24.248 --> 00:05:25.579
in Niger Republic

00:05:25.603 --> 00:05:28.877
that was faltering sustainably.

00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:31.244
He said this project
wasn't so sustainable,

00:05:31.268 --> 00:05:35.491
and it bothered those
that instituted the whole package.

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:38.824
But then he mentioned
a particular project,

00:05:39.517 --> 00:05:44.434
a particular traditional irrigation method
that was hugely successful

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:48.155
in the same Niger Republic
where the World Bank project was failing.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.426
And that got me thinking.

00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:53.024
So I did further research,

00:05:53.984 --> 00:05:56.369
and I found out about Tassa.

00:05:57.775 --> 00:06:01.545
Tassa is a traditional irrigation method

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:07.762
where 20- to 30-centimeter-wide
and 20- to 30-centimeter-deep holes

00:06:07.786 --> 00:06:10.660
are dug across a field to be cultivated.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.333
Then, a small dam is constructed
around the field,

00:06:16.296 --> 00:06:19.922
and then crops are planted
across the surface area.

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:23.250
What happens is that when rain falls,

00:06:23.274 --> 00:06:26.258
the holes are able to store the water

00:06:26.282 --> 00:06:30.100
and appropriate it to the extent
that the plant needs the water.

00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:33.390
The plant can only assimilate
as much water as needed

00:06:33.414 --> 00:06:34.984
until harvest time.

00:06:36.582 --> 00:06:40.275
Niger is 75 percent scorched desert,

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:42.992
so this is something
that is a life-or-death situation,

00:06:43.016 --> 00:06:44.824
and it has been used for centuries.

00:06:45.384 --> 00:06:47.486
In an experiment that was conducted,

00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:53.646
two similar plots of land
were used in the experiment,

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.301
and one plot of land

00:06:56.325 --> 00:06:58.267
did not have the Tassa technique on it.

00:06:58.291 --> 00:06:59.458
Similar plots.

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:02.640
The other one had Tassa technique
constructed on it.

00:07:03.332 --> 00:07:07.087
Then similar grains of millet
also were planted on both plots.

00:07:08.045 --> 00:07:10.252
During harvest time,

00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:13.428
the plot of land without Tassa technique

00:07:13.452 --> 00:07:17.623
yielded 11 kilograms
of millet per hectare.

00:07:18.737 --> 00:07:21.032
The plot of land with Tassa technique

00:07:21.056 --> 00:07:26.909
yielded 553 kilograms
of millet per hectare.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.245
(Applause)

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:34.182
I looked at the research,
and I looked at myself.

00:07:34.206 --> 00:07:37.458
I said, "I studied
agriculture for 12 years,

00:07:37.482 --> 00:07:40.892
from primary to Senior Six,
as we say in East Africa,

00:07:40.916 --> 00:07:43.262
SS3 in West Africa or 12th grade.

00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:44.943
No one ever taught me

00:07:44.967 --> 00:07:48.773
of any form of traditional
African knowledge of cultivation --

00:07:48.797 --> 00:07:50.591
of harvesting, of anything --

00:07:50.615 --> 00:07:54.443
that will work in modern times
and actually succeed,

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:59.068
where something imported from the West
would struggle to succeed.

00:07:59.775 --> 00:08:02.888
That was when I knew the challenge,

00:08:02.912 --> 00:08:05.491
the challenge of Africa's curricula,

00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:10.447
And I thus began my quest
to dedicate my life, concern my life work,

00:08:10.471 --> 00:08:14.763
to studying, conducting research
on Africa's own knowledge system

00:08:14.787 --> 00:08:17.787
and being able to advocate
for its mainstreaming

00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:20.658
in education, in research, policy

00:08:20.682 --> 00:08:22.737
across sectors and industries.

00:08:23.445 --> 00:08:27.289
Another conversation
and experience I had at the bank

00:08:27.313 --> 00:08:32.063
I guess made me take that final decision
of where I was going to go,

00:08:32.087 --> 00:08:36.111
even though it wasn't the most lucrative
research to go into,

00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:38.452
but it was just about what I believed in.

00:08:38.937 --> 00:08:43.563
And so one day, my boss said
that he likes to go to Africa

00:08:43.587 --> 00:08:48.123
to negotiate World Bank loans
and to work on World Bank projects.

00:08:48.614 --> 00:08:50.563
And I was intrigued. I asked him why.

00:08:50.587 --> 00:08:53.033
He said, "Oh, when I go to Africa,

00:08:53.057 --> 00:08:54.766
it's so easy.

00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:59.913
I just write up my loan documents
and my project proposal in Washington, DC,

00:08:59.937 --> 00:09:02.890
I go to Africa, and they all
just get signed.

00:09:02.914 --> 00:09:06.302
I get the best deal, and I'm back to base.

00:09:06.326 --> 00:09:08.533
My bosses are happy with me."

00:09:08.933 --> 00:09:12.620
But then he said,
"I hate going to Asia or ..."

00:09:12.644 --> 00:09:16.087
and he mentioned a particular country,
Asia and some of these countries.

00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:20.134
"They keep me for this, trying
to get the best deal for their countries.

00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:21.334
They get the best deal.

00:09:21.358 --> 00:09:24.266
They tell me, 'Oh,
that clause will not work for us

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.897
in our environment.

00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:28.894
It's not our reality.
It's just so Western.'

00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:32.029
And they tell me, 'Oh,
we have enough experts

00:09:32.053 --> 00:09:33.256
to take care of this.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.901
You don't have enough experts.

00:09:34.925 --> 00:09:36.078
We know our aim.'

00:09:36.102 --> 00:09:38.547
And they just keep going
through all these things.

00:09:38.571 --> 00:09:41.091
By the time they finish,
yes, they get the best deal,

00:09:41.115 --> 00:09:44.280
but I'm so exhausted and I don't get
the best deal for the bank,

00:09:44.304 --> 00:09:45.483
and we're in business."

00:09:45.507 --> 00:09:47.302
"Really?" I thought in my head, "OK."

00:09:47.326 --> 00:09:51.606
I was privileged to sit in on
a loan negotiating session

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.295
in an African country.

00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:56.139
So I would do these consultancy
positions during summer,

00:09:56.163 --> 00:09:58.847
you know, since I was a doctoral student.

00:09:58.871 --> 00:10:03.203
And then I traveled with the team,
with the World Bank team,

00:10:03.227 --> 00:10:07.543
as more like someone to help out
with organizational matters.

00:10:07.567 --> 00:10:10.834
But I sat in during
the negotiating session.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.662
I had mostly Euro-Americans, you know,
with me from Washington, DC.

00:10:16.686 --> 00:10:21.536
And I looked across the table
at my African brothers and sisters.

00:10:21.993 --> 00:10:24.327
I could see intimidation on their faces.

00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:27.034
They didn't believe
they had anything to offer

00:10:27.058 --> 00:10:29.346
the great-great-grandchildren
of Mungo Park --

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.987
the owners of "apple" in "A is for apple."

00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:34.787
They just sat and watched:
"Oh, just give us, let us sign.

00:10:34.811 --> 00:10:36.724
You own the knowledge. You know it all.

00:10:36.748 --> 00:10:38.957
Just, where do we sign?
Show us, let us sign."

00:10:38.981 --> 00:10:42.017
They had no voice.
They didn't believe in themselves.

00:10:46.544 --> 00:10:47.727
Excuse me.

00:10:48.587 --> 00:10:49.759
And so,

00:10:51.212 --> 00:10:53.538
I have been doing this for a decade.

00:10:53.562 --> 00:10:57.006
I have been conducting research
on Africa's knowledge system,

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.274
original, authentic,
traditional knowledge.

00:10:59.298 --> 00:11:02.495
In the few cases where this
has been implemented in Africa,

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:05.003
there has been remarkable
successes recorded.

00:11:05.027 --> 00:11:06.564
I think of Gacaca.

00:11:07.256 --> 00:11:11.988
Gacaca is Rwanda's traditional
judicial system

00:11:12.012 --> 00:11:14.106
that was used after the genocide.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.561
In 1994, when the genocide ended,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.662
Rwanda's national court system
was in shambles:

00:11:20.686 --> 00:11:26.212
no judges, no lawyers to try
hundreds of thousands of genocide cases.

00:11:26.236 --> 00:11:29.744
So the government of Rwanda
came up with this idea

00:11:29.768 --> 00:11:33.163
to resuscitate a traditional
judicial system known as Gacaca.

00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:37.072
Gacaca is a community-based
judicial system,

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:40.033
where community members come together

00:11:40.057 --> 00:11:43.806
to elect men and women of proven integrity

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.340
to try cases of crimes committed
within these communities.

00:11:49.255 --> 00:11:54.732
So by the time Gacaca concluded
its trial of genocide cases in 2012,

00:11:55.619 --> 00:12:02.594
12,000 community-based courts
had tried approximately 1.2 million cases.

00:12:03.334 --> 00:12:04.686
That's a record.

00:12:05.169 --> 00:12:10.150
(Applause)

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:16.038
Most importantly is that Gacaca emphasized
Rwanda's traditional philosophy

00:12:16.062 --> 00:12:19.155
of reconciliation and reintegration,

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:23.057
as against the whole
punitive and banishment idea

00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:26.803
that undergirds present-day Western style.

00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:31.376
And not to compare, but just to say
that it really emphasized

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.754
Rwanda's traditional method of philosophy.

00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:37.866
And so it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere,

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.631
former president of Tanzania --

00:12:39.655 --> 00:12:41.131
(Applause)

00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:44.331
who said that you cannot develop people.

00:12:44.916 --> 00:12:47.974
People will have to develop themselves.

00:12:48.563 --> 00:12:49.948
I agree with Mwalimu.

00:12:50.487 --> 00:12:51.875
I am convinced

00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:55.522
that Africa's further transformation,
Africa's advancement,

00:12:55.546 --> 00:13:00.325
rests simply in the acknowledgment,
validation and mainstreaming

00:13:00.349 --> 00:13:05.338
of Africa's own traditional, authentic,
original, indigenous knowledge

00:13:05.362 --> 00:13:10.233
in education, in research,
in policy making and across sectors.

00:13:10.816 --> 00:13:13.333
This is not going to be easy for Africa.

00:13:13.357 --> 00:13:16.821
It is not going to be easy for a people
used to being told how to think,

00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:19.210
what to do, how to go about it,

00:13:19.234 --> 00:13:22.388
a people long subjected
to the intellectual guidance

00:13:22.412 --> 00:13:24.154
and direction of others,

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:25.845
be they the colonial masters,

00:13:25.869 --> 00:13:28.841
aid industry or international news media.

00:13:28.865 --> 00:13:32.099
But it is a task that we have to do
to make progress.

00:13:32.123 --> 00:13:35.023
I am strengthened by the words
of Joseph Shabalala,

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:38.521
founder of the South African choral group
Ladysmith Black Mambazo.

00:13:38.545 --> 00:13:44.232
He said that the task ahead of us
can never, ever be greater

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:46.409
than the power within us.

00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:47.591
We can do it.

00:13:47.615 --> 00:13:50.175
We can unlearn looking down on ourselves.

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:54.394
We can learn to place value
on our reality and our knowledge.

00:13:54.418 --> 00:13:55.573
Thank you.

00:13:55.597 --> 00:13:57.068
(Swahili) Thank you very much.

00:13:57.092 --> 00:13:58.615
(Applause)

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:00.841
Thank you. Thank you.

00:14:00.865 --> 00:14:05.564
(Applause)
