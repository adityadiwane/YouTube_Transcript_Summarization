00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:15.689
Have you ever been asked
by your Chinese friend,

00:00:15.713 --> 00:00:17.368
"What is your zodiac sign?"

00:00:17.947 --> 00:00:20.432
Don't think they are making small talk.

00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:22.383
If you say, "I'm a Monkey,"

00:00:22.407 --> 00:00:23.766
they immediately know

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.186
you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.216
(Laughter)

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.798
Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way
of asking your age.

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:36.505
By revealing your zodiac sign,
you are also being evaluated.

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:40.569
Judgments are being made
about your fortune or misfortune,

00:00:40.593 --> 00:00:42.971
your personality, career prospects

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:44.963
and how you will do in a given year.

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:48.218
If you share you and your
partner's animal signs,

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:52.061
they will paint a picture in their mind
about your private life.

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:55.348
Maybe you don't believe
in the Chinese zodiac.

00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:59.203
As a quarter of the world population
is influenced by it,

00:00:59.227 --> 00:01:01.626
you'd be wise to do something about that.

00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:05.404
So what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly?

00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:09.187
Most Westerners think
of Greco-Roman zodiac,

00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:11.434
the signs divided into 12 months.

00:01:11.973 --> 00:01:13.924
The Chinese zodiac is different.

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:17.126
It's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.726
starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.092
and has no association
with constellations.

00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:28.512
For example, if you were born
in 1975, you are a Rabbit.

00:01:29.273 --> 00:01:31.174
Can you see your zodiac sign there?

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:37.424
Our Chinese ancestors constructed
a very complicated theoretical framework

00:01:37.448 --> 00:01:42.089
based on yin and yang, the five elements
and the 12 zodiac animals.

00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:44.281
Over thousands of years,

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:48.777
this popular culture has affected
people's major decisions,

00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:54.001
such as naming, marriage, giving birth
and attitude towards each other.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.279
And some of the implications
are quite amazing.

00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:02.578
The Chinese believe certain animals
get on better than the others.

00:02:03.147 --> 00:02:07.841
So parents choose specific years
to give birth to babies,

00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:12.787
because they believe the team effort
by the right combination of animals

00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:15.108
can give prosperity to families.

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:20.179
We even refer to the zodiac
when entering into romantic relations.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.036
I'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance
with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits.

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:31.005
Chinese people believe some animals
are natural enemies.

00:02:31.536 --> 00:02:34.537
As a Pig, I need
to be careful with a Snake.

00:02:35.102 --> 00:02:36.910
Raise your hand if you are a Snake.

00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:39.259
Let's have a chat later.

00:02:39.283 --> 00:02:40.678
(Laughter)

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:43.945
We believe some animals
are luckier than the others,

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.664
such as the Dragon.

00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:47.546
Unlike the Western tradition,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.154
the Chinese Dragon is a symbol
for power, strength and wealth.

00:02:52.178 --> 00:02:54.861
It's everyone's dream
to have a Dragon baby.

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.475
Jack Ma's parents
must have been very proud.

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:00.061
And they are not the only ones.

00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:02.982
In 2012, the Year of the Dragon,

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:05.305
the birthrate in China,
Hong Kong and Taiwan

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.016
increased by five percent.

00:03:07.596 --> 00:03:10.961
That means another
one million more babies.

00:03:12.497 --> 00:03:15.410
With a traditional
preference to baby boys,

00:03:15.434 --> 00:03:19.762
the boy-girl ratio that year
was 120 to 100.

00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:22.195
When those Dragon boys grow up,

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.625
they will face much more severe
competition in love and job markets.

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.583
According to the BBC and the Chinese
government's press release,

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:36.811
January 2015 saw a peak
of Cesarean sections.

00:03:36.835 --> 00:03:38.004
Why?

00:03:38.726 --> 00:03:42.137
That was the last month
for the Year of the Horse.

00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:44.763
It's not because they like horses so much,

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:48.256
it's because they try to avoid
having unlucky Goat babies.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.358
(Laughter)

00:03:49.382 --> 00:03:52.161
If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad.

00:03:52.185 --> 00:03:53.915
Those are Goat babies.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.049
They don't look like losers to me.

00:03:56.073 --> 00:03:57.238
(Laughter)

00:03:57.262 --> 00:04:00.024
Tiger is another undesirable animal,

00:04:00.048 --> 00:04:01.856
due to its volatile temperament.

00:04:02.337 --> 00:04:06.190
Many Chinese regions
saw a sharp decline of birthrate

00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:07.411
during those years.

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:11.792
Perhaps one should consider
zodiac in reverse,

00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:16.020
as those Tiger and Goat babies
will face much less competition.

00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:17.766
Maybe they are the lucky ones.

00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:24.515
I went through the Forbes
top 300 richest people in the world,

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.572
and it's interesting to see

00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:30.174
the most undesirable two animals,
the Goat and Tiger,

00:04:30.198 --> 00:04:31.880
are at the top of the chart,

00:04:32.544 --> 00:04:34.327
even higher than the Dragon.

00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:36.471
So maybe we should consider,

00:04:36.495 --> 00:04:39.648
maybe it's much better
to have less competition.

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:42.405
One last but interesting point:

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:45.262
many Chinese people make
their investment decisions

00:04:45.286 --> 00:04:47.603
based on the zodiac sign index.

00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.276
Although the belief and tradition
of the zodiac sign

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.138
has been over thousands of years,

00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:58.345
the trend of using it
in making major decisions

00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:01.550
did not really happen
until the past few decades.

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:06.330
Our ancestors were very busy
surviving poverty, drought,

00:05:06.354 --> 00:05:10.004
famine, riot, disease and civil war.

00:05:10.028 --> 00:05:15.790
And finally, Chinese people
have the time, wealth and technology

00:05:15.814 --> 00:05:18.763
to create an ideal life
they've always wanted.

00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:23.251
The collective decision
made by 1.3 billion people

00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:27.826
has caused the fluctuation in economics
and demand on everything,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.425
from health care and education
to property and consumer goods.

00:05:33.092 --> 00:05:38.066
As China plays such an important role
in the global economy and geopolitics,

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.199
the decisions made based on the zodiac
and other Chinese traditions

00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:45.693
end up impacting everyone
around the world.

00:05:47.203 --> 00:05:48.663
Are there any Monkeys here?

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.610
2016 is the Year of the Monkey.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.929
Monkeys are clever, curious,
creative and mischievous.

00:05:58.953 --> 00:06:00.111
Thank you.

00:06:00.135 --> 00:06:03.271
(Applause)
