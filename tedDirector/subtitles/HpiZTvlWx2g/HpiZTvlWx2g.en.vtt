00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Thank you.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
It's a real pleasure to be here.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I last did a TED Talk

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
I think about seven years ago or so.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I talked about spaghetti sauce.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And so many people,
I guess, watch those videos.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
People have been
coming up to me ever since

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
which is a wonderful thing
in the short term --

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
(Laughter)

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
but it's proven to be less than ideal

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
over seven years.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And so I though I would come

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
(Laughter)

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
The theme of this morning's
session is Things We Make.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
And so I thought I would tell a story

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
about someone

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
who made one of the most precious objects

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
of his era.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And the man's name is Carl Norden.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Carl Norden was born in 1880.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And he was Swiss.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And of course, the Swiss can be divided

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
into two general categories:

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
those who make small, exquisite,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
expensive objects

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and those who handle the money

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
of those who buy small, exquisite,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
expensive objects.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And Carl Norden is very
firmly in the former camp.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
He's an engineer.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
In fact, one of his classmates
is a young man named Lenin

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
who would go on

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
to break small, expensive,
exquisite objects.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And he's a Swiss engineer, Carl.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
And I mean that in its
fullest sense of the word.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
He wears three-piece suits;

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and he has a very, very small,
important mustache;

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and he is domineering

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and narcissistic

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and driven

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and has an extraordinary ego;

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and he works 16-hour days;

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and he has very strong feelings
about alternating current;

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and he feels like a suntan
is a sign of moral weakness;

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and he drinks lots of coffee;

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and he does his best work

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
sitting in his mother's kitchen
in Zurich for hours

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
in complete silence

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
with nothing but a slide rule.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
In any case,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Carl Norden emigrates
to the United States

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
just before the First World War

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and sets up shop on Lafayette Street

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
in downtown Manhattan.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And he becomes obsessed with the question

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
of how to drop bombs from an airplane.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Now if you think about it,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
in the age before GPS and radar,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
that was obviously
a really difficult problem.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
It's a complicated physics problem.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
You've got a plane that's
thousands of feet up in the air,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
going at hundreds of miles an hour,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and you're trying to drop
an object, a bomb,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
towards some stationary target

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
in the face of all kinds
of winds and cloud cover

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
and all kinds of other impediments.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And all sorts of people,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
moving up to the First World War
and between the wars,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
tried to solve this problem,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and nearly everybody came up short.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
The bombsights that were available

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
were incredibly crude.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
But Carl Norden is really
the one who cracks the code.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And he comes up with this
incredibly complicated device.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
It weighs about 50 lbs.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
It's called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And it has all kinds of levers
and ball-bearings

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
and gadgets and gauges.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And he makes this complicated thing.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And what he allows people to do

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.260
is he makes the bombardier
take this particular object,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
visually sight the target,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.260
because they're in the Plexiglas
cone of the bomber,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and then they plug in
the altitude of the plane,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
the speed of the plane,
the speed of the wind

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and the coordinates

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
of the target.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And the bombsight will tell him
when to drop the bomb.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And as Norden famously says,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
"Before that bombsight came along,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
bombs would routinely miss their target

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
by a mile or more."

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
But he said, with the
Mark 15 Norden bombsight,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
at 20,000 ft.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Now I cannot tell you

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
how incredibly excited

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
the U.S. military was

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
by the news of the Norden bombsight.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
It was like manna from heaven.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Here was an army

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
that had just had experience
in the First World War,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
where millions of men

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
fought each other in the trenches,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
getting nowhere, making no progress,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and here someone had come up with a device

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
that allowed them to fly up in the skies

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
high above enemy territory

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and destroy whatever they wanted

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
with pinpoint accuracy.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And the U.S. military

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
spends 1.5 billion dollars --

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
billion dollars in 1940 dollars --

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
developing the Norden bombsight.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And to put that in perspective,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
the total cost of the Manhattan project

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
was three billion dollars.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Half as much money was spent
on this Norden bombsight

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.260
as was spent on the most famous
military-industrial project

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
of the modern era.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
And there were people, strategists,
within the U.S. military

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
who genuinely thought
that this single device

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
was going to spell the difference

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
between defeat and victory

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
when it came to the
battle against the Nazis

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and against the Japanese.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
And for Norden as well,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
this device had incredible
moral importance,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
because Norden was a committed Christian.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
In fact, he would always get upset

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
when people referred to the
bombsight as his invention,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
because in his eyes,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
only God could invent things.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
He was simply
the instrument of God's will.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
And what was God's will?

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Well God's will was that
the amount of suffering in any kind of war

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
be reduced to as small
an amount as possible.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And what did the Norden bombsight do?

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Well it allowed you to do that.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
It allowed you to bomb only those things

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.260
that you absolutely needed
and wanted to bomb.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
So in the years leading up to
the Second World War,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
the U.S. military buys 90,000

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
of these Norden bombsights

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
at a cost of $14,000 each --

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
again, in 1940 dollars,
that's a lot of money.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And they trained 50,000 bombardiers
on how to use them --

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.260
long extensive, months-long
training sessions --

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
because these things are
essentially analog computers;

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
they're not easy to use.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
And they make every one
of those bombardiers take an oath,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
to swear that if they're ever captured,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
they will not divulge a single detail

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
of this particular device to the enemy,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
because it's imperative
the enemy not get their hands

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
on this absolutely essential
piece of technology.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And whenever the Norden bombsight
is taken onto a plane,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
it's escorted there by
a series of armed guards.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
And it's carried in a box
with a canvas shroud over it.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And the box is handcuffed
to one of the guards.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
It's never allowed to be photographed.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
And there's a little
incendiary device inside of it,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
so that, if the plane ever crashes,
it will be destroyed

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
and there's no way the enemy
can ever get their hands on it.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
The Norden bombsight

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
is the Holy Grail.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
So what happens during
the Second World War?

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Well, it turns out
it's not the Holy Grail.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
In practice, the Norden bombsight

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
can drop a bomb into
a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
but that's under perfect conditions.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And of course, in wartime,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
conditions aren't perfect.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
First of all, it's really hard to use --
really hard to use.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And not all of the people

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
who are of those 50,000 men
who are bombardiers

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.260
have the ability to properly
program an analog computer.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Secondly, it breaks down a lot.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
It's full of all kinds
of gyroscopes and pulleys

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
and gadgets and ball-bearings,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
and they don't work as well
as they ought to

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
in the heat of battle.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Thirdly, when Norden
was making his calculations,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
he assumed that a plane would be flying

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
at a relatively slow speed
at low altitudes.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
Well in a real war, you can't do that;

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
you'll get shot down.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
So they started flying them
at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
And the Norden bombsight
doesn't work as well

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
under those conditions.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
But most of all,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
the Norden bombsight
required the bombardier

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
to make visual contact with the target.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
But of course, what happens in real life?

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
There are clouds, right.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
It needs cloudless sky
to be really accurate.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
Well how many cloudless skies

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
do you think there
were above Central Europe

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
between 1940 and 1945?

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Not a lot.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And then to give you a sense

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
of just how inaccurate
the Norden bombsight was,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
there was a famous case in 1944

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.260
where the Allies bombed
a chemical plant in Leuna, Germany.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And the chemical plant comprised

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
757 acres.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And over the course
of 22 bombing missions,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.260
the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.260
on this 757 acre chemical plant,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
using the Norden bombsight.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Well what percentage of those bombs

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
do you think actually landed

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
inside the 700-acre
perimeter of the plant?

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
10 percent. 10 percent.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
And of those 10 percent that landed,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
16 percent didn't even go off;
they were duds.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
The Leuna chemical plant,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
after one of the most extensive
bombings in the history of the war,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
was up and running within weeks.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
And by the way, all those precautions

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
to keep the Norden bombsight
out of the hands of the Nazis?

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
Well it turns out

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
that Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
was very enamored of German engineers.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
So in the 1930s,
he hired a whole bunch of them,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
including a man named Hermann Long

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
who, in 1938,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
gave a complete set of the plans
for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So they had their own Norden bombsight
throughout the entire war --

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
which also, by the way,
didn't work very well.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
(Laughter)

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
So why do we talk about
the Norden bombsight?

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Well because we live in an age

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
where there are lots and lots

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
of Norden bombsights.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
We live in a time
where there are all kinds

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
of really, really smart people

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
running around, saying
that they've invented gadgets

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
that will forever change our world.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
They've invented websites
that will allow people to be free.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.260
They've invented some kind of this thing,
or this thing, or this thing

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
that will make our world forever better.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
If you go into the military,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
you'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
If you go to the Pentagon, they will say,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
"You know what, now we really can

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
put a bomb inside a pickle barrel

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
at 20,000 ft."

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
And you know what, it's true;
they actually can do that now.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
But we need to be very clear

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
about how little that means.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
In the Iraq War, at the beginning
of the first Iraq War,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
the U.S. military, the air force,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
sent two squadrons
of F-15E Fighter Eagles

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
to the Iraqi desert

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
equipped with these
five million dollar cameras

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
that allowed them to see
the entire desert floor.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
And their mission was
to find and to destroy --

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
remember the Scud missile launchers,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
those surface-to-air missiles

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
that the Iraqis were launching
at the Israelis?

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
The mission of the two squadrons

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
was to get rid of all the
Scud missile launchers.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
And so they flew missions day and night,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and they dropped thousands of bombs,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
and they fired thousands of missiles

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
in an attempt to get rid
of this particular scourge.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
And after the war was over,
there was an audit done --

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
as the army always does,
the air force always does --

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
and they asked the question:

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
how many Scuds did we actually destroy?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
You know what the answer was?

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
Zero, not a single one.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
Now why is that?

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
Is it because their weapons
weren't accurate?

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
Oh no, they were brilliantly accurate.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
They could have destroyed
this little thing right here

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
from 25,000 ft.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.260
The issue was they didn't know
where the Scud launchers were.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
The problem with bombs and pickle barrels

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
is not getting the bomb
inside the pickle barrel,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
it's knowing how to
find the pickle barrel.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
That's always been the harder problem

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
when it comes to fighting wars.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
Or take the battle in Afghanistan.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
What is the signature weapon

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
of the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan?

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
It's the drone. What is the drone?

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.260
Well it is the grandson
of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.260
It is this weapon of devastating
accuracy and precision.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
And over the course of the last six years

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
in Northwest Pakistan,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
the CIA has flown hundreds
of drone missiles,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
and it's used those drones

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
to kill 2,000 suspected

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Pakistani and Taliban militants.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
Now what is the accuracy of those drones?

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
Well it's extraordinary.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
We think we're now at 95 percent accuracy

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
when it comes to drone strikes.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
95 percent of the people
we kill need to be killed, right?

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
That is one of the most
extraordinary records

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
in the history of modern warfare.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
But do you know what the crucial thing is?

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
In that exact same period

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
that we've been using these drones

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
with devastating accuracy,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
the number of attacks, of suicide attacks
and terrorist attacks,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
against American forces in Afghanistan

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
has increased tenfold.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
As we have gotten more and more efficient

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
in killing them,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
they have become angrier and angrier

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
and more and more motivated to kill us.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
I have not described
to you a success story.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
I've described to you

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
the opposite of a success story.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
And this is the problem

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
with our infatuation
with the things we make.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
We think the things
we make can solve our problems,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
but our problems are much
more complex than that.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
The issue isn't the accuracy
of the bombs you have,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
it's how you use the bombs you have,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
and more importantly,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
whether you ought to use bombs at all.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
There's a postscript

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
to the Norden story

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
And that is, on August 6, 1945,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
flew over Japan

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
and, using a Norden bombsight,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
dropped a very large thermonuclear device

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
on the city of Hiroshima.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
And as was typical
with the Norden bombsight,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
the bomb actually
missed its target by 800 ft.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
But of course, it didn't matter.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
And that's the greatest irony of all

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
when it comes to the Norden bombsight.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.260
the air force's 1.5 billion
dollar bombsight

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.260
was used to drop
its three billion dollar bomb,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
which didn't need a bombsight at all.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
Meanwhile, back in New York,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
no one told Carl Norden

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
that his bombsight was used
over Hiroshima.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
He was a committed Christian.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
He thought he had designed something

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
that would reduce the toll
of suffering in war.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
It would have broken his heart.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:54.260
(Applause)
