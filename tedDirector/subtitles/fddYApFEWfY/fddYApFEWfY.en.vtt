00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm a visual artist,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I've been working with plastic bags,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
for the last 20 years.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and sculptures and installations.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
some of my work started to fissure

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And I thought, "Great.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
It's ephemeral just like us."

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
I actually realized this was a bad thing.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
because it's always still plastic.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And what we're finding

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
I then, in the last few years,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And my initial reaction --

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
to learning about it --

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
is, "Oh my God!

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up."

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
So I actually developed a proposal

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
to go out with a cargo ship

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
and two decommissioned fishing trawlers,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
a crane, a chipping machine

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and a cold-molding machine.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And my intention was to go out to the gyre,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
raise awareness about this issue

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and begin to pick up the plastic,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
that could potentially be used as building materials

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
in underdeveloped communities.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
I began talking with people

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
who actually had been out to the gyre

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and upon doing so,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
I realized actually that cleaning it up

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
would be a very small drop in the bucket

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
relative to how much is being generated

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
every day around the world,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And the bigger picture is:

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
We need to cut the spigot

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
of single-use and disposable plastics,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
which are entering the marine environment every day

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
on a global scale.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
I wasn't just concerned about plastic

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean --

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
of which I have learned there are now

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
11 gyres, potentially, of plastic

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
in five major oceans in the world.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about --

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
even at the health food market.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
into us and into our bodies.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
So I came together with a group of other people

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
who were all looking at this issue,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
We have many initiatives that we're working on,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
but some of them are very basic.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
One is: if 80 to 90 percent

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
of what we're finding in the ocean --

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
then why don't we call it what it is.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
It's plastic pollution.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
What is the reality of that?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And if you really look into it,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
particularly when it comes to plastic bottles,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
most of it is only down-cycled,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
or incinerated, or shipped to China.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
or can be used again --

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
So this is a big issue for us.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
is we've added a fourth R

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
onto the front

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
and that is refuse.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Alternatives exist;

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
some of them are very old-school.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
to store food in.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
And I know that I am doing a service

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
to myself and my family.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
or a glass bottle,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and fill that up with water or filtered water,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
versus purchasing plastic bottled water.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
I guess what I want to say to everybody here --

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue --

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
is that this is a huge problem in the oceans,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
but this is a problem that we've created as consumers

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
and we can solve.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
and teaching people to choose alternatives.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
So whenever possible, to choose alternatives

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
to single-use plastics.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
into our oceans

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
and in doing so,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Thank you. (Applause)
