00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.296
I come from one of the most liberal,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.536
tolerant, progressive places
in the United States,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.760
Seattle, Washington.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.376
And I grew up with a family
of great Seattlites.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.216
My mother was an artist,
my father was a college professor,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.776
and I am truly grateful for my upbringing,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.296
because I always felt completely
comfortable designing my life

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.280
exactly as I saw fit.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.336
And in point of fact,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.456
I took a route that was not exactly
what my parents had in mind.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.400
When I was 19, I dropped out of college --

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.176
dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.560
(Laughter)

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.936
And I went on the road
as a professional French horn player,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.656
which was my lifelong dream.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.576
I played chamber music
all over the United States and Europe,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.376
and I toured for a couple of years

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.376
with a great jazz guitar player
named Charlie Bird.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.976
And by the end of my 20s,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.176
I wound up as a member of the Barcelona
Symphony Orchestra in Spain.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.416
What a great life.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.016
And you know, my parents never complained.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.016
They supported me all the way through it.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.936
It wasn't their dream.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.103
They used to tell
their neighbors and friends,

00:01:23.127 --> 00:01:26.176
"Our son, he's taking a gap decade."

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.040
(Laughter)

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.776
And --

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.696
There was, however, one awkward
conversation about my lifestyle

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.176
that I want to tell you about.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.976
I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.696
and I was visiting
my parents for Christmas,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.400
and I was cooking dinner with my mother,
and we were alone in the kitchen.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.056
And she was quiet, too quiet.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.536
Something was wrong.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.080
And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.016
And she said, "Your dad and I
are really worried about you."

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.936
And I said, "What?"
I mean, what could it be, at this point?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.760
And she said, "I want you to be
completely honest with me:

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.616
have you been voting for Republicans?"

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.840
(Laughter)

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.056
Now, the truth is,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.456
I wasn't really political,
I was just a French horn player.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.015
But I had a bit of an epiphany,

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.896
and they had detected it,
and it was causing some confusion.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.600
You see, I had become
an enthusiast for capitalism,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.816
and I want to tell you why that is.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.976
It stems from a lifelong interest of mine

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.960
in, believe it or not, poverty.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.256
See, when I was a kid
growing up in Seattle,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.896
I remember the first time
I saw real poverty.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.296
We were a lower middle class family,
but that's of course not real poverty.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.056
That's not even close.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.496
The first time I saw poverty,
and poverty's face,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.336
was when I was six
or seven years old, early 1970s.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.896
And it was like a lot of you,
kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.296
It was a picture in the National
Geographic Magazine

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.616
of a kid who was my age in East Africa,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.216
and there were flies on his face
and a distended belly.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.160
And he wasn't going to make it,
and I knew that, and I was helpless.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.696
Some of you remember that picture,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.736
not exactly that picture,
one just like it.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.560
It introduced the West
to grinding poverty around the world.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.016
Well, that vision kind of haunted me
as I grew up and I went to school

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.816
and I dropped out and dropped in

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.800
and started my family.

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:39.496
And I wondered, what happened to that kid?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.200
Or to people just like him
all over the world?

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.976
And so I started to study,
even though I wasn't in college,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.416
I was looking for the answer:

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.536
what happened to the world's
poorest people?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.816
Has it gotten worse?
Has it gotten better? What?

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.616
And I found the answer,
and it changed my life,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.200
and I want to share it with you.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.240
See --

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.016
most Americans believe
that poverty has gotten worse

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.176
since we were children,
since they saw that vision.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.856
If you ask Americans, "Has poverty
gotten worse or better around the world?",

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.216
70 percent will say that hunger
has gotten worse since the early 1970s.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.736
But here's the truth.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.456
Here's the epiphany that I had
that changed my thinking.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.240
From 1970 until today,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.736
the percentage of the world's population

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.776
living in starvation levels,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.456
living on a dollar a day or less,
obviously adjusted for inflation,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.696
that percentage has declined

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.400
by 80 percent.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.056
There's been an 80 percent decline
in the world's worst poverty

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.296
since I was a kid.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.896
And I didn't even know about it.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.800
This, my friends, that's a miracle.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.616
That's something we ought to celebrate.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.896
It's the greatest antipoverty achievement
in the history of mankind,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.456
and it happened in our lifetimes.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.016
(Applause)

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.896
So when I learned this, I asked,
what did that? What made it possible?

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.736
Because if you don't know why,
you can't do it again.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.096
If you want to replicate it

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.656
and get the next two billion
people out of poverty,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.456
because that's what we're talking about:
since I was a kid,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.296
two billion of the least of these,
our brothers and sisters,

00:05:15.316 --> 00:05:16.856
have been pulled out of poverty.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.366
I want the next two billion,
so I've got to know why.

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:21.016
And I went in search of an answer.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.696
And it wasn't a political answer,
because I didn't care.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.376
You know what, I still don't care.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.216
I wanted the best answer
from mainstream economists

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.360
left, right and center.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.080
And here it is.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.816
Here are the reasons.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.576
There are five reasons that two billion
of our brothers and sisters

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.976
have been pulled out of poverty
since I was a kid.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.520
Number one: globalization.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.176
Number two: free trade.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.536
Number three: property rights.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.096
Number four: rule of law.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.096
Number five: entrepreneurship.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.376
It was the free enterprise system
spreading around the world

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.176
after 1970 that did that.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.616
Now, I'm not naive.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.096
I know that free enterprise isn't perfect,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.256
and I know that free enterprise
isn't everything we need

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.496
to build a better world.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.056
But that is great.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.416
And that's beyond politics.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.536
Here's what I learned.
This is the epiphany.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.576
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.136
At its best, it's about aspiration,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.856
which is what so many people
on this stage talk about,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.096
is the aspiration that comes from dreams

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.376
that are embedded
in the free enterprise system.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.576
And we've got to share it
with more people.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.816
Now, I want to tell you
about a second epiphany

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.336
that's related to that first one

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.416
that I think can bring us progress,
not just around the world,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.680
but right here at home.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.856
The best quote I've ever heard

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.456
to summarize the thoughts
that I've just given you

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.536
about pulling people out of poverty

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.656
is as follows:

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.536
"Free markets have created more wealth
than any system in history.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.360
They have lifted billions out of poverty."

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.656
Who said it?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.080
It sounds like Milton Friedman
or Ronald Reagan.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.000
Wrong.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.720
President Barack Obama said that.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.040
Why do I know it by heart?

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.400
Because he said it to me.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.136
Crazy.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.840
And I said, "Hallelujah."

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.296
But more than that, I said,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.016
"What an opportunity."

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.536
You know what I was thinking?

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.016
It was at an event
that we were doing on the subject

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.976
at Georgetown University in May of 2015.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.776
And I thought, this is the solution

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.296
to the biggest problem
facing America today. What?

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.096
It's coming together around these ideas,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.856
liberals and conservatives,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.960
to help people who need us the most.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.776
Now, I don't have to tell anybody
in this room that we're in a crisis,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.376
in America and many countries around
the world with political polarization.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.296
It's risen to critical, crisis levels.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.720
It's unpleasant. It's not right.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.976
There was an article last year

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.616
in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.120
which is one of the most
prestigious scientific journals

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.336
published in the West.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.816
And it was an article in 2014

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.256
on political motive asymmetry.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.995
What's that? That's what psychologists
call the phenomenon

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:20.939
of assuming that your ideology
is based in love

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.320
but your opponents' ideology
is based in hate.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.736
It's common in world conflict.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.800
You expect to see this between
Palestinians and Israelis, for example.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.816
What the authors of this article found

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.456
was that in America today,
a majority of Republicans and Democrats

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.056
suffer from political motive asymmetry.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.936
A majority of people in our country today
who are politically active believe

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.376
that they are motivated by love
but the other side is motivated by hate.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.936
Think about it. Think about it.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.135
Most people are walking around saying,

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:56.336
"You know, my ideology
is based on basic benevolence,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.576
I want to help people,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.400
but the other guys,
they're evil and out to get me."

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.496
You can't progress as a society
when you have this kind of asymmetry.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.720
It's impossible.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.816
How do we solve it?

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.496
Well, first, let's be honest:
there are differences.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.216
Let's not minimize the differences.
That would be really naïve.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.296
There's a lot of good research on this.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.456
A veteran of the TED stage
is my friend Jonathan Haidt.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.536
He's a psychology professor
at New York University.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.496
He does work on the ideology
and values and morals of different people

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.760
to see how they differ.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.170
And he's shown, for example,
that conservatives and liberals

00:09:35.194 --> 00:09:38.210
have a very different emphasis
on what they think is important.

00:09:38.234 --> 00:09:41.536
For example, Jon Haidt has shown

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.536
that liberals care about poverty

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.440
59 percent more than they care
about economic liberty.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.776
And conservatives
care about economic liberty

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.960
28 percent more
than they care about poverty.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.976
Irreconcilable differences, right?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
We'll never come together. Wrong.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.896
That is diversity
in which lies our strength.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.056
Remember what pulled up the poor.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.136
It was the obsession with poverty,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.376
accompanied by the method
of economic freedom

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.016
spreading around the world.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.576
We need each other, in other words,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.220
if we want to help people and get the next
two billion people out of poverty.

00:10:22.244 --> 00:10:23.524
There's no other way.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.896
Hmm.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.400
How are we going to get that?

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.016
It's a tricky thing, isn't it.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.256
We need innovative thinking.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.936
A lot of it's on this stage.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.120
Social entrepreneurship.
Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.616
We need investment overseas

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.016
in a sustainable, responsible,
ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.856
But you know what we really need?

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.496
We need a new day in flexible ideology.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.080
We need to be less predictable.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.896
Don't we?

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.496
Do you ever feel like your own ideology
is starting to get predictable?

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.256
Kinda conventional?

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.416
Do you ever feel like you're always
listening to people who agree with you?

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.176
Why is that dangerous?

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.776
Because when we talk
in this country about economics,

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.456
on the right, conservatives,

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.120
you're always talking about taxes
and regulations and big government.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.616
And on the left, liberals,
you're talking about economics,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.896
it's always about income inequality.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.336
Right? Now those are important things,

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.616
really important to me,
really important to you.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.176
But when it comes to lifting people up

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.656
who are starving and need us today,
those are distractions.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.096
We need to come together
around the best ways

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.456
to mitigate poverty
using the best tools at our disposal,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.976
and that comes only when conservatives
recognize that they need liberals

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.616
and their obsession with poverty,

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.760
and liberals need conservatives
and their obsession with free markets.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.736
That's the diversity in which lies
the future strength of this country,

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.720
if we choose to take it.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.816
So how are we going to do it?
How are we going to do it together?

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.000
I've got to have some action items,
not just for you but for me.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.296
Number one. Action item number one:

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.536
remember, it's not good enough
just to tolerate people who disagree.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.256
It's not good enough.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.176
We have to remember that we need
people who disagree with us,

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.536
because there are people
who need all of us

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.000
who are still waiting for these tools.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.976
Now, what are you going to do?
How are you going to express that?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.936
Where does this start? It starts here.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.216
You know, all of us
in this room, we're blessed.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.296
We're blessed with people
who listen to us.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.216
We're blessed with prosperity.
We're blessed with leadership.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.640
When people hear us,
with the kind of unpredictable ideology,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.616
then maybe people will listen.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.816
Maybe progress will start at that point.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.600
That's number one. Number two.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.960
Number two: I'm asking you
and I'm asking me

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.056
to be the person specifically
who blurs the lines,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.360
who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.416
If you're a conservative,

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.976
be the conservative
who is always going on about poverty

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.816
and the moral obligation
to be a warrior for the poor.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.536
And if you're a liberal,
be a liberal who is always talking

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.136
about the beauty of free markets
to solve our problems

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.760
when we use them responsibly.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.056
If we do that, we get two things.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.656
Number one: we get to start
to work on the next two billion

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.216
and be the solution
that we've seen so much of in the past

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.136
and we need to see more of in the future.
That's what we get.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.136
And the second is
that we might just be able

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.816
to take the ghastly holy war of ideology
that we're suffering under in this country

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.096
and turn it into a competition of ideas

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.096
based on solidarity and mutual respect.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.976
And then maybe, just maybe,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.680
we'll all realize that our big differences

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.480
aren't really that big after all.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.616
Thank you.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:13.468
(Applause)
