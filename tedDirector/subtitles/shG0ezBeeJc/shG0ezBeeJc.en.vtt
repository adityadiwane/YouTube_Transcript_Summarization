00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:17.186
What are you doing on this stage

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.328
in front of all these people?

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:21.726
(Laughter)

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.901
Run!

00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:23.928
(Laughter)

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:25.130
Run now.

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:29.521
That's the voice of my anxiety talking.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.295
Even when there's absolutely
nothing wrong,

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:37.278
I sometimes get
this overwhelming sense of doom,

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:40.264
like danger is lurking
just around the corner.

00:00:40.877 --> 00:00:42.993
You see, a few years ago,

00:00:43.017 --> 00:00:45.514
I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety

00:00:45.538 --> 00:00:46.688
and depression --

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.529
two conditions that often go hand in hand.

00:00:49.893 --> 00:00:54.158
Now, there was a time
I wouldn't have told anybody,

00:00:54.182 --> 00:00:56.642
especially not in front of a big audience.

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.193
As a black woman,

00:00:58.217 --> 00:01:01.857
I've had to develop
extraordinary resilience to succeed.

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:03.860
And like most people in my community,

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:07.692
I had the misconception that depression
was a sign of weakness,

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:09.252
a character flaw.

00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:10.850
But I wasn't weak;

00:01:10.874 --> 00:01:12.344
I was a high achiever.

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:14.948
I'd earned a Master's degree
in Media Studies

00:01:14.972 --> 00:01:19.081
and had a string of high-profile jobs
in the film and television industries.

00:01:19.554 --> 00:01:22.604
I'd even won two Emmy Awards
for my hard work.

00:01:23.256 --> 00:01:26.272
Sure, I was totally spent,

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:28.966
I lacked interest in things
I used to enjoy,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.288
barely ate,

00:01:30.312 --> 00:01:32.215
struggled with insomnia

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:34.863
and felt isolated and depleted.

00:01:35.382 --> 00:01:36.734
But depressed?

00:01:36.758 --> 00:01:38.282
No, not me.

00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:41.947
It took weeks before I could admit it,

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:43.400
but the doctor was right:

00:01:43.424 --> 00:01:44.702
I was depressed.

00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:48.779
Still, I didn't tell anybody
about my diagnosis.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:50.955
I was too ashamed.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.496
I didn't think I had the right
to be depressed.

00:01:54.238 --> 00:01:55.868
I had a privileged life

00:01:55.892 --> 00:01:58.992
with a loving family
and a successful career.

00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:02.120
And when I thought about
the unspeakable horrors

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:04.632
that my ancestors
had been through in this country

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:06.624
so that I could have it better,

00:02:06.648 --> 00:02:08.326
my shame grew even deeper.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.893
I was standing on their shoulders.

00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:12.519
How could I let them down?

00:02:13.202 --> 00:02:15.255
I would hold my head up,

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.639
put a smile on my face

00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:19.371
and never tell a soul.

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:25.563
On July 4, 2013,

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.487
my world came crashing in on me.

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.120
That was the day I got
a phone call from my mom

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:36.334
telling me that my 22-year-old nephew,
Paul, had ended his life,

00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:38.999
after years of battling
depression and anxiety.

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:43.643
There are no words that can describe
the devastation I felt.

00:02:44.487 --> 00:02:45.781
Paul and I were very close,

00:02:45.805 --> 00:02:47.859
but I had no idea he was in so much pain.

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:52.074
Neither one of us had ever talked
to the other about our struggles.

00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:54.262
The shame and stigma kept us both silent.

00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:59.984
Now, my way of dealing with adversity
is to face it head on,

00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:03.166
so I spent the next two years
researching depression and anxiety,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.957
and what I found was mind-blowing.

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:08.558
The World Health Organization reports

00:03:08.582 --> 00:03:13.806
that depression is the leading cause
of sickness and disability

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.169
in the world.

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.850
While the exact cause
of depression isn't clear,

00:03:18.874 --> 00:03:21.972
research suggests
that most mental disorders develop,

00:03:21.996 --> 00:03:23.723
at least in part,

00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:26.402
because of a chemical
imbalance in the brain,

00:03:26.426 --> 00:03:30.328
and/or an underlying
genetic predisposition.

00:03:30.861 --> 00:03:33.022
So you can't just shake it off.

00:03:34.727 --> 00:03:36.458
For black Americans,

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:40.538
stressors like racism
and socioeconomic disparities

00:03:40.562 --> 00:03:45.602
put them at a 20 percent greater risk
of developing a mental disorder,

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:48.038
yet they seek mental health services

00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:50.801
at about half the rate of white Americans.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.214
One reason is the stigma,

00:03:54.238 --> 00:04:00.455
with 63 percent of black Americans
mistaking depression for a weakness.

00:04:01.423 --> 00:04:05.681
Sadly, the suicide rate
among black children

00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:08.392
has doubled in the past 20 years.

00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:11.868
Now, here's the good news:

00:04:12.423 --> 00:04:16.705
seventy percent of people
struggling with depression will improve

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.086
with therapy, treatment and medication.

00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:22.940
Armed with this information,

00:04:22.964 --> 00:04:24.671
I made a decision:

00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:27.663
I wasn't going to be silent anymore.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.363
With my family's blessing,

00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:32.280
I would share our story

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:35.118
in hopes of sparking
a national conversation.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.731
A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said,

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:41.246
"Being strong is killing us."

00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:43.982
She's right.

00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:48.028
We have got to retire
those tired, old narratives

00:04:48.052 --> 00:04:49.607
of the strong black woman

00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:51.841
and the super-masculine black man,

00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:54.785
who, no matter how many times
they get knocked down,

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:57.044
just shake it off and soldier on.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.305
Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness.

00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:04.224
Feelings mean we're human.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.689
And when we deny our humanity,

00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:08.829
it leaves us feeling empty inside,

00:05:08.853 --> 00:05:11.857
searching for ways to self-medicate
in order to fill the void.

00:05:12.405 --> 00:05:15.150
My drug was high achievement.

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:19.492
These days, I share my story openly,

00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:21.726
and I ask others to share theirs, too.

00:05:22.226 --> 00:05:23.674
I believe that's what it takes

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.293
to help people who may
be suffering in silence

00:05:26.317 --> 00:05:28.526
to know that they are not alone

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.235
and to know that with help,

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.600
they can heal.

00:05:31.624 --> 00:05:33.789
Now, I still have my struggles,

00:05:33.813 --> 00:05:36.101
particularly with the anxiety,

00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:37.728
but I'm able to manage it

00:05:37.752 --> 00:05:42.626
through daily mediation,
yoga and a relatively healthy diet.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.718
(Laughter)

00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:45.964
If I feel like things
are starting to spiral,

00:05:45.988 --> 00:05:48.032
I make an appointment to see my therapist,

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:51.119
a dynamic black woman
named Dawn Armstrong,

00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:53.116
who has a great sense of humor

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.377
and a familiarity that I find comforting.

00:05:56.946 --> 00:05:58.584
I will always regret

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.276
that I couldn't be there for my nephew.

00:06:02.046 --> 00:06:03.833
But my sincerest hope

00:06:04.515 --> 00:06:07.586
is that I can inspire others
with the lesson that I've learned.

00:06:11.002 --> 00:06:13.472
Life is beautiful.

00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:16.028
Sometimes it's messy,

00:06:16.052 --> 00:06:17.986
and it's always unpredictable.

00:06:18.854 --> 00:06:20.057
But it will all be OK

00:06:20.081 --> 00:06:22.866
when you have your support system
to help you through it.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:25.754
I hope that if your burden gets too heavy,

00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:27.484
you'll ask for a hand, too.

00:06:27.508 --> 00:06:28.675
Thank you.

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.581
(Applause)
