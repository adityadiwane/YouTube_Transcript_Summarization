00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.762
I coined my own definition
of success in 1934,

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:19.723
when I was teaching at a high school
in South Bend, Indiana,

00:00:19.747 --> 00:00:24.507
being a little bit disappointed,
and [disillusioned] perhaps,

00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:28.578
by the way parents of the youngsters
in my English classes

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:32.451
expected their youngsters
to get an A or a B.

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:35.372
They thought a C was all right
for the neighbors' children,

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:37.363
because they were all average.

00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:39.522
But they weren't satisfied
when their own --

00:00:39.546 --> 00:00:43.514
it would make the teacher feel that they
had failed, or the youngster had failed.

00:00:43.538 --> 00:00:44.721
And that's not right.

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.738
The good Lord in his infinite
wisdom didn't create us all equal

00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:49.499
as far as intelligence is concerned,

00:00:49.523 --> 00:00:51.998
any more than we're equal
for size, appearance.

00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:55.707
Not everybody could earn an A or a B,
and I didn't like that way of judging,

00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:59.840
and I did know how
the alumni of various schools

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:03.499
back in the '30s judged
coaches and athletic teams.

00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:08.549
If you won them all, you were considered
to be reasonably successful --

00:01:08.573 --> 00:01:09.727
not completely.

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:11.124
Because I found out --

00:01:11.148 --> 00:01:14.511
we had a number of years at UCLA
where we didn't lose a game.

00:01:14.535 --> 00:01:17.034
But it seemed that we didn't win
each individual game

00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:21.024
by the margin that some
of our alumni had predicted --

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:24.136
(Laughter)

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.732
And quite frequently I really felt
that they had backed up their predictions

00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:30.311
in a more materialistic manner.

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:31.493
(Laughter)

00:01:31.517 --> 00:01:34.739
But that was true back
in the 30s, so I understood that.

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:36.923
But I didn't like it,
I didn't agree with it.

00:01:36.947 --> 00:01:40.486
I wanted to come up with something
I hoped could make me a better teacher,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.630
and give the youngsters
under my supervision,

00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:44.772
be it in athletics
or the English classroom,

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:46.262
something to which to aspire,

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:49.829
other than just a higher
mark in the classroom,

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:52.483
or more points in some athletic contest.

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:54.870
I thought about that for quite a spell,

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:57.115
and I wanted to come
up with my own definition.

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.684
I thought that might help.

00:01:58.708 --> 00:02:01.136
And I knew how Mr. Webster defined it,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.208
as the accumulation
of material possessions

00:02:03.232 --> 00:02:07.589
or the attainment of a position of power
or prestige, or something of that sort,

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:09.525
worthy accomplishments perhaps,

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.035
but in my opinion, not necessarily
indicative of success.

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.446
So I wanted to come up
with something of my own.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.333
And I recalled --

00:02:17.357 --> 00:02:19.684
I was raised on a small farm
in Southern Indiana,

00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:21.693
and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers

00:02:21.717 --> 00:02:25.016
that you should never try to be
better than someone else.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.485
I'm sure at the time he did
that, I didn't -- it didn't --

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.659
well, somewhere, I guess
in the hidden recesses of the mind,

00:02:31.683 --> 00:02:33.136
it popped out years later.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.136
Never try to be better than someone else,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.613
always learn from others.

00:02:36.637 --> 00:02:39.010
Never cease trying to be
the best you can be --

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:40.651
that's under your control.

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:43.136
If you get too engrossed
and involved and concerned

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.780
in regard to the things
over which you have no control,

00:02:45.804 --> 00:02:49.519
it will adversely affect the things
over which you have control.

00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:52.020
Then I ran across
this simple verse that said,

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:54.037
"At God's footstool to confess,

00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:56.384
a poor soul knelt, and bowed his head.

00:02:56.408 --> 00:02:58.042
'I failed!' he cried.

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:02.136
The Master said, 'Thou didst
thy best, that is success.'"

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.136
From those things, and one other perhaps,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.913
I coined my own definition
of success, which is:

00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:10.223
Peace of mind attained only
through self-satisfaction

00:03:10.247 --> 00:03:13.986
in knowing you made the effort to do
the best of which you're capable.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.294
I believe that's true.

00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:18.245
If you make the effort to do
the best of which you're capable,

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.902
trying to improve the situation
that exists for you,

00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:22.079
I think that's success,

00:03:22.103 --> 00:03:24.088
and I don't think others can judge that;

00:03:24.112 --> 00:03:25.887
it's like character and reputation --

00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:28.762
your reputation
is what you're perceived to be;

00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:30.644
your character is what you really are.

00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:33.842
And I think that character
is much more important

00:03:33.866 --> 00:03:35.636
than what you are perceived to be.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.414
You'd hope they'd both be good,

00:03:37.438 --> 00:03:40.135
but they won't necessarily be the same.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.136
Well, that was my idea that I was going
to try to get across to the youngsters.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.612
I ran across other things.

00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:50.746
I love to teach, and it was
mentioned by the previous speaker

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.921
that I enjoy poetry,
and I dabble in it a bit, and love it.

00:03:53.945 --> 00:03:56.136
There are some things
that helped me, I think,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.936
be better than I would have been.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.530
I know I'm not what I ought
to be, what I should be,

00:04:00.554 --> 00:04:02.687
but I think I'm better
than I would have been

00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:04.621
if I hadn't run across certain things.

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:08.471
One was just a little verse that said,

00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:12.547
"No written word, no spoken plea

00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:15.136
can teach our youth what they should be;

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.542
nor all the books on all the shelves --

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:19.794
it's what the teachers are themselves."

00:04:19.818 --> 00:04:23.611
That made an impression
on me in the 1930s.

00:04:23.635 --> 00:04:27.910
And I tried to use that
more or less in my teaching,

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:32.506
whether it be in sports, or whether
it be in the English classroom.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.334
I love poetry and always had
an interest in that somehow.

00:04:38.358 --> 00:04:42.136
Maybe it's because Dad
used to read to us at night,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.318
by coal oil lamp --

00:04:43.342 --> 00:04:46.694
we didn't have electricity
in our farm home.

00:04:47.035 --> 00:04:49.598
And Dad would read poetry to us.
So I always liked it.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.136
And about the same time
I ran across this one verse,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.827
I ran across another one.

00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:57.667
Someone asked a lady teacher
why she taught,

00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:00.731
and after some time, she said
she wanted to think about that.

00:05:00.755 --> 00:05:02.635
Then she came up and said,

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.548
"They ask me why I teach, and I reply,

00:05:05.572 --> 00:05:08.072
'Where could I find
such splendid company?'

00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:11.136
There sits a statesman,
strong, unbiased, wise;

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.858
another Daniel Webster, silver-tongued.

00:05:13.882 --> 00:05:17.136
A doctor sits beside him, whose quick,
steady hand may mend a bone,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.136
or stem the life-blood's flow.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.208
And there a builder; upward rise
the arch of a church he builds,

00:05:23.232 --> 00:05:25.668
wherein that minister
may speak the word of God,

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:28.136
and lead a stumbling soul
to touch the Christ.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.135
And all about, a gathering of teachers,

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.477
farmers, merchants, laborers --

00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:34.153
those who work and vote and build

00:05:34.177 --> 00:05:36.548
and plan and pray into a great tomorrow.

00:05:36.572 --> 00:05:39.890
And I may say, I may not see the church,

00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:42.732
or hear the word, or eat
the food their hands may grow,

00:05:42.756 --> 00:05:43.993
but yet again I may;

00:05:44.017 --> 00:05:45.168
And later I may say,

00:05:45.192 --> 00:05:49.247
I knew him once, and he was weak,
or strong, or bold or proud or gay.

00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:51.616
I knew him once, but then he was a boy.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.910
They ask me why I teach and I reply,

00:05:53.934 --> 00:05:56.584
'Where could I find such
splendid company?'"

00:05:56.608 --> 00:05:58.536
And I believe the teaching profession --

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.622
it's true, you have so many youngsters,

00:06:00.646 --> 00:06:03.035
and I've got to think
of my youngsters at UCLA --

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:07.871
30-some attorneys,
11 dentists and doctors,

00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:11.136
many, many teachers and other professions.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.958
And that gives you
a great deal of pleasure,

00:06:14.982 --> 00:06:16.586
to see them go on.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.674
I always tried to make the youngsters feel
that they're there to get an education,

00:06:20.698 --> 00:06:23.902
number one; basketball was second,
because it was paying their way,

00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:26.433
and they do need a little time
for social activities,

00:06:26.457 --> 00:06:30.044
but you let social activities take
a little precedence over the other two,

00:06:30.068 --> 00:06:32.397
and you're not going
to have any very long.

00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:37.136
So that was the idea
that I tried to get across

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.587
to the youngsters under my supervision.

00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:41.417
I had three rules, pretty much,

00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:43.762
that I stuck with
practically all the time.

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:47.714
I'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA,
and I decided they were very important.

00:06:47.738 --> 00:06:51.638
One was "Never be late."

00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:55.907
Later on I said certain things --

00:06:55.931 --> 00:07:00.136
the players, if we were leaving
for somewhere, had to be neat and clean.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:06.136
There was a time when I made them
wear jackets and shirts and ties.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.945
Then I saw our chancellor coming
to school in denims and turtlenecks,

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:15.936
and thought, it's not right for me to keep
this other [rule] so I let them just --

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.540
they had to be neat and clean.

00:07:17.564 --> 00:07:22.193
I had one of my greatest players
that you probably heard of, Bill Walton.

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:25.910
He came to catch the bus; we were
leaving for somewhere to play.

00:07:25.934 --> 00:07:29.264
And he wasn't clean and neat,
so I wouldn't let him go.

00:07:29.288 --> 00:07:30.672
He couldn't get on the bus,

00:07:30.696 --> 00:07:32.606
he had to go home and get cleaned up

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.757
to get to the airport.

00:07:34.781 --> 00:07:37.136
So I was a stickler for that.
I believed in that.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.044
I believe in time; very important.

00:07:39.068 --> 00:07:42.716
I believe you should be on time,
but I felt at practice, for example --

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.756
we start on time, we close on time.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.177
The youngsters didn't have to feel
that we were going to keep them over.

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:51.193
When I speak at coaching clinics,
I often tell young coaches --

00:07:51.217 --> 00:07:53.357
and at coaching clinics, more or less,

00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:56.365
they'll be the younger coaches
getting in the profession.

00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:59.873
Most of them are young, you know,
and probably newly-married.

00:07:59.897 --> 00:08:02.912
And I tell them,
"Don't run practices late,

00:08:02.936 --> 00:08:04.965
because you'll go home in a bad mood,

00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:08.337
and that's not good, for a young
married man to go home in a bad mood.

00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:11.328
When you get older, it doesn't
make any difference, but --"

00:08:11.352 --> 00:08:15.136
(Laughter)

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.427
So I did believe: on time.

00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:19.576
I believe starting on time,
and I believe closing on time.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.136
And another one I had was,
not one word of profanity.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.136
One word of profanity,
and you are out of here for the day.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.446
If I see it in a game, you're going
to come out and sit on the bench.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.136
And the third one was,
never criticize a teammate.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.136
I didn't want that. I used to tell
them I was paid to do that.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.136
That's my job. I'm paid to do it.
Pitifully poor, but I am paid to do it.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.136
Not like the coaches today,
for gracious sakes, no.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.548
It's a little different
than it was in my day.

00:08:46.572 --> 00:08:51.253
Those were three things that I stuck
with pretty closely all the time.

00:08:51.277 --> 00:08:53.895
And those actually came from my dad.

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:58.816
That's what he tried to teach
me and my brothers at one time.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.714
I came up with a pyramid eventually,

00:09:01.738 --> 00:09:04.444
that I don't have the time to go on that.

00:09:04.468 --> 00:09:07.698
But that helped me, I think,
become a better teacher.

00:09:07.722 --> 00:09:09.643
It's something like this:

00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:11.865
And I had blocks in the pyramid,

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:15.136
and the cornerstones being
industriousness and enthusiasm,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.256
working hard and enjoying
what you're doing,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.136
coming up to the apex,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.136
according to my definition of success.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.493
And right at the top, faith and patience.

00:09:24.517 --> 00:09:26.922
And I say to you,
in whatever you're doing,

00:09:26.946 --> 00:09:28.106
you must be patient.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.880
You have to have patience to --
we want things to happen.

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:35.975
We talk about our youth
being impatient a lot, and they are.

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:39.141
They want to change everything.
They think all change is progress.

00:09:39.165 --> 00:09:41.736
And we get a little older --
we sort of let things go.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.371
And we forget there is
no progress without change.

00:09:44.395 --> 00:09:45.785
So you must have patience,

00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:47.795
and I believe that we must have faith.

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:50.454
I believe that we must
believe, truly believe.

00:09:50.478 --> 00:09:52.438
Not just give it word service,

00:09:52.462 --> 00:09:55.136
believe that things
will work out as they should,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.474
providing we do what we should.

00:09:57.498 --> 00:10:02.167
I think our tendency is to hope things
will turn out the way we want them to

00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:03.454
much of the time,

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:06.817
but we don't do the things
that are necessary

00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:10.136
to make those things become reality.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.136
I worked on this for some 14 years,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.136
and I think it helped me
become a better teacher.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.314
But it all revolved around that
original definition of success.

00:10:19.338 --> 00:10:21.383
You know, a number of years ago,

00:10:21.407 --> 00:10:25.136
there was a Major League Baseball
umpire by the name of George Moriarty.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.747
He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'.

00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:30.682
I'd never seen that before, but he did.

00:10:30.706 --> 00:10:32.523
Big league baseball players --

00:10:32.547 --> 00:10:34.618
they're very perceptive
about those things,

00:10:34.642 --> 00:10:37.136
and they noticed he had
only one 'i' in his name.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.784
You'd be surprised how many also told him

00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:43.136
that that was one more
than he had in his head

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.317
at various times.

00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:46.089
(Laughter)

00:10:46.113 --> 00:10:48.159
But he wrote something
where I think he did

00:10:48.183 --> 00:10:49.899
what I tried to do in this pyramid.

00:10:49.923 --> 00:10:52.326
He called it "The Road
Ahead, or the Road Behind."

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.136
He said, "Sometimes I think the Fates
must grin as we denounce them and insist

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.349
the only reason we can't win,
is the Fates themselves have missed.

00:11:00.373 --> 00:11:02.136
Yet there lives on the ancient claim:

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.889
we win or lose within ourselves.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:07.136
The shining trophies on our shelves
can never win tomorrow's game.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.446
You and I know deeper down, there's
always a chance to win the crown.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.136
But when we fail to give our best,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.239
we simply haven't met the test,
of giving all and saving none

00:11:15.263 --> 00:11:16.986
until the game is really won;

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.404
of showing what is meant by grit;

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:21.508
of playing through when others quit;

00:11:21.532 --> 00:11:23.236
of playing through, not letting up.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.999
It's bearing down that wins the cup.

00:11:25.023 --> 00:11:28.380
Of dreaming there's a goal ahead;
of hoping when our dreams are dead;

00:11:28.404 --> 00:11:32.136
of praying when our hopes have fled;
yet losing, not afraid to fall,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.971
if, bravely, we have given all.

00:11:33.995 --> 00:11:37.850
For who can ask more of a man
than giving all within his span.

00:11:37.874 --> 00:11:42.136
Giving all, it seems to me,
is not so far from victory.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.446
And so the Fates are seldom wrong,
no matter how they twist and wind.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.136
It's you and I who make our fates --

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.136
we open up or close the gates
on the road ahead or the road behind."

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.685
Reminds me of another set of threes
that my dad tried to get across to us:

00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:58.802
Don't whine. Don't complain.
Don't make excuses.

00:11:58.826 --> 00:12:00.064
Just get out there,

00:12:00.088 --> 00:12:02.968
and whatever you're doing,
do it to the best of your ability.

00:12:02.992 --> 00:12:05.136
And no one can do more than that.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.041
I tried to get across, too, that --

00:12:08.065 --> 00:12:11.145
my opponents will tell you --
you never heard me mention winning.

00:12:11.169 --> 00:12:12.698
Never mention winning.

00:12:12.722 --> 00:12:18.300
My idea is that you can lose
when you outscore somebody in a game,

00:12:18.324 --> 00:12:20.490
and you can win when you're outscored.

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:24.136
I've felt that way on certain
occasions, at various times.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.446
And I just wanted them to be able
to hold their head up after a game.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.136
I used to say that when a game is over,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.541
and you see somebody
that didn't know the outcome,

00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:37.597
I hope they couldn't tell by your actions

00:12:37.621 --> 00:12:43.136
whether you outscored an opponent
or the opponent outscored you.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.707
That's what really matters:

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:48.491
if you make an effort
to do the best you can regularly,

00:12:48.515 --> 00:12:51.202
the results will be
about what they should be.

00:12:51.226 --> 00:12:55.106
Not necessarily what you'd want them to be
but they'll be about what they should;

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.136
only you will know
whether you can do that.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.808
And that's what I wanted
from them more than anything else.

00:13:00.832 --> 00:13:03.610
And as time went by,
and I learned more about other things,

00:13:03.634 --> 00:13:05.491
I think it worked a little better,

00:13:05.515 --> 00:13:07.158
as far as the results.

00:13:07.182 --> 00:13:12.136
But I wanted the score of a game
to be the byproduct of these other things,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.136
and not the end itself.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:20.136
I believe it was one great
philosopher who said --

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.098
no, no -- Cervantes.

00:13:22.122 --> 00:13:27.374
Cervantes said, "The journey
is better than the end."

00:13:27.398 --> 00:13:29.207
And I like that.

00:13:29.231 --> 00:13:31.462
I think that it is --
it's getting there.

00:13:31.486 --> 00:13:34.177
Sometimes when you get there,
there's almost a let down.

00:13:34.201 --> 00:13:36.225
But it's the getting there that's the fun.

00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:41.003
As a basketball coach at UCLA,
I liked our practices to be the journey,

00:13:41.027 --> 00:13:44.317
and the game would be
the end, the end result.

00:13:44.341 --> 00:13:47.499
I liked to go up and sit in the stands
and watch the players play,

00:13:47.523 --> 00:13:52.136
and see whether I'd done
a decent job during the week.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.743
There again, it's getting the players
to get that self-satisfaction,

00:13:55.767 --> 00:14:02.322
in knowing that they'd made the effort
to do the best of which they are capable.

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:09.493
Sometimes I'm asked who was
the best player I had, or the best teams.

00:14:09.517 --> 00:14:12.136
I can never answer that.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.136
As far as the individuals are concerned --

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.136
I was asked one time about that,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.328
and they said,

00:14:19.352 --> 00:14:24.167
"Suppose that you, in some way,
could make the perfect player.

00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:25.351
What would you want?"

00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:28.351
And I said, "Well, I'd want
one that knew why he was at UCLA:

00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:31.136
to get an education,
he was a good student,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.660
really knew why he was there
in the first place.

00:14:33.684 --> 00:14:35.550
But I'd want one that could play, too.

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:39.739
I'd want one to realize that defense
usually wins championships,

00:14:39.763 --> 00:14:41.834
and who would work hard on defense.

00:14:41.858 --> 00:14:44.136
But I'd want one
who would play offense, too.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.437
I'd want him to be unselfish,

00:14:46.461 --> 00:14:49.604
and look for the pass first
and not shoot all the time.

00:14:49.628 --> 00:14:52.740
And I'd want one
that could pass and would pass.

00:14:52.764 --> 00:14:53.961
(Laughter)

00:14:53.985 --> 00:14:55.905
I've had some that could and wouldn't,

00:14:55.929 --> 00:14:58.031
and I've had some that would and could.

00:14:58.055 --> 00:14:59.690
(Laughter)

00:14:59.714 --> 00:15:01.136
So, yeah, I'd want that.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.937
And I wanted them to be able
to shoot from the outside.

00:15:04.961 --> 00:15:07.318
I wanted them to be good inside too.

00:15:07.342 --> 00:15:09.136
(Laughter)

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.136
I'd want them to be able
to rebound well at both ends, too.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.136
Why not just take someone like
Keith Wilkes and let it go at that.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.032
He had the qualifications.

00:15:19.056 --> 00:15:23.763
Not the only one, but he was one
that I used in that particular category,

00:15:23.787 --> 00:15:26.771
because I think he made the effort
to become the best.

00:15:26.795 --> 00:15:27.961
There was a couple.

00:15:27.985 --> 00:15:30.931
I mention in my book,
"They Call Me Coach,"

00:15:30.955 --> 00:15:33.256
two players that gave
me great satisfaction,

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.002
that came as close as I think anyone
I ever had to reach their full potential:

00:15:37.026 --> 00:15:39.421
one was Conrad Burke,
and one was Doug McIntosh.

00:15:39.445 --> 00:15:42.939
When I saw them as freshmen,
on our freshmen team --

00:15:42.963 --> 00:15:45.813
freshmen couldn't play
varsity when I taught.

00:15:45.837 --> 00:15:49.137
I thought, "Oh gracious, if these
two players, either one of them" --

00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:53.113
they were different years, but I thought
about each one at the time he was there --

00:15:53.137 --> 00:15:55.136
"Oh, if he ever makes the varsity,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.916
our varsity must be pretty miserable,
if he's good enough to make it."

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:04.871
And you know, one of them was
a starting player for a season and a half.

00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:10.136
The other one, his next year, played 32
minutes in a national championship game,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.865
Did a tremendous job for us.

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:15.764
The next year, he was a starting player
on the national championship team,

00:16:15.788 --> 00:16:18.970
and here I thought he'd never
play a minute, when he was --

00:16:18.994 --> 00:16:23.671
so those are the things
that give you great joy,

00:16:23.695 --> 00:16:25.136
and great satisfaction to see.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.136
Neither one of those youngsters
could shoot very well.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.351
But they had outstanding
shooting percentages,

00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:32.612
because they didn't force it.

00:16:32.636 --> 00:16:35.318
And neither one could jump very well,

00:16:35.342 --> 00:16:38.762
but they kept good position,
and so they did well rebounding.

00:16:38.786 --> 00:16:42.470
They remembered that every shot that's
taken, they assumed would be missed.

00:16:42.494 --> 00:16:45.428
I've had too many stand around
and wait to see if it's missed,

00:16:45.452 --> 00:16:50.089
then they go and it's too late,
somebody else is in there ahead of them.

00:16:50.113 --> 00:16:52.727
They weren't very quick,
but they played good position,

00:16:52.751 --> 00:16:54.136
kept in good balance.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.691
And so they played
pretty good defense for us.

00:16:56.715 --> 00:16:59.868
So they had qualities that --
they came close to --

00:16:59.892 --> 00:17:03.309
as close to reaching
possibly their full potential

00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:05.602
as any players I ever had.

00:17:05.626 --> 00:17:12.103
So I consider them to be as successful
as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton,

00:17:12.127 --> 00:17:13.856
or many of the others that we had;

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.619
there were some outstanding players.

00:17:18.777 --> 00:17:20.842
Have I rambled enough?

00:17:20.866 --> 00:17:24.993
I was told that when he makes
his appearance, I was supposed to shut up.

00:17:25.017 --> 00:17:26.287
(Laughter)

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:30.160
(Applause)
