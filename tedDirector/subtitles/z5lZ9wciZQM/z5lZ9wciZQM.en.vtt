00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
in some unconventional ways.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.160
You might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
Anyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
in collecting imaginary stories.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
So this is a picture of me

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
from reality -- so, real stories.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160
And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
stories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.160
which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
So I'll be talking about each of those today.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
So, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
I have many of these books,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
They accompany me wherever I go in my life,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
and I fill them with all sorts of things,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
records of my lived experience:

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.160
so watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.160
dead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
business cards, writings.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.160
And in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
of moments and experiences and people that I meet.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
And, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
I started to become very interested in collecting

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
not only my own personal artifacts,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
but also the artifacts of other people.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
So, I started collecting found objects.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
about 10 years ago.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
On the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.160
and on the back it says, "To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
Have fun in whatever you do."

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
As opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
and then letting your own mind fill in the rest.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
And that idea of a partial glimpse is something

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
So, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
and I noticed that it was suddenly possible

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
to collect these sorts of personal artifacts,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
not just from street corners, but also from the Internet.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.160
of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Blog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
all of these things were being expressed by people online,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
and leaving behind trails.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
So, I started to write computer programs

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
that study very, very large sets of these online footprints.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
One such project is about a year and a half old.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
It's called "We Feel Fine."

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
every two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
"I feel" and "I am feeling." And when it finds one of those phrases,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
it grabs the full sentence up to the period

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
and also tries to identify demographic information about the author.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
So, their gender, their age, their geographic location

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
It collects about 20,000 such sentences a day

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
and it's been running for about a year and a half,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
This is, then, how they're presented.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
These dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
feelings from the last few hours,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
so the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
And the diameter of each dot corresponds

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
to the length of the sentence inside.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
So the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.160
for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,"

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
"I got this on some trading locally,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap."

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
Also, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.160
And when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
which consist of the sentence and images being combined.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.160
And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.160
"I feel good."

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.160
but it was worth it."

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
that makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.160
man-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python."

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
So the next movement is called mobs.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
This provides a slightly more statistical look at things.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.160
This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
dominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
the cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
and the snowy ones flutter to the ground.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.160
You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
on a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from "We Feel Fine."

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
These are the images that are automatically constructed.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe."

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
(Laughter)

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
the kisses felt messy and wrong,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.160
but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual."

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
"I can feel my cancer grow."

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
"I feel pretty."

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
"I feel skinny, but I'm not."

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive."

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
because I feel the need for speed."

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
(Laughter)

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.160
"I feel sassy."

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
"I feel so sexy in this new wig."

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
As you can see, "We Feel Fine" collects

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
very, very small-scale personal stories.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
Sometimes, stories as short as two or three words.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
So, really even challenging the notion

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
of what can be considered a story.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.160
And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.160
not with the Internet,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.160
and only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160
So these are some newer projects that

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
actually aren't even launched publicly yet.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
The first such one is called "The Whale Hunt."

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
the northernmost settlement in the United States,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
with a family of Inupiat Eskimos,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
documenting their annual spring whale hunt.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
camping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
And that water that you see there is the open lead,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.160
and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
it throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
under the ice, and cuts it up.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
So I went up there, and I lived with these guys

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
out in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.160
beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
and ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
So every five minutes, I took a photograph.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
When I was awake, with the camera around my neck.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
When I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
And then in moments of high adrenaline,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
like when something exciting was happening,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
I would up that photographic frequency to as many as

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
37 photographs in five minutes.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
So what this created was a photographic heartbeat

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
that sped up and slowed down, more or less matching

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
the changing pace of my own heartbeat.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
That was the first concept here.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
The second concept was to use this experience to think about

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
the fundamental components of any story.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
What are the things that make up a story?

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
So, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
They have colors. What do they look like?

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
They have time. When did it take place? Dates -- when did it occur?

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
And in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
The thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
that we're accustomed to -- things like novels, radio,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
photographs, movies, even lectures like this one --

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.160
we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
some kind of omniscient, external body

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
through whose eyes you see the story.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
We're very used to this.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
But if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
I mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
and there's all of these overlapping stories

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
intersecting and touching each other.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.160
to surface those types of stories. So, in the case of "The Whale Hunt,"

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.160
involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
dominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
with an excitement level of high?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.160
So, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.160
I built a web interface for viewing "The Whale Hunt" that attempts to do just this.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.160
So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.160
This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
and the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
You can start to see some of the story here, told by color.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
in the basement apartment where I was staying.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.160
And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.160
Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
You can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
These are organized chronologically.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
And any of these can be clicked,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
and then the narrative is entered at that position.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160
So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
That's "Moby Dick."

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
This is the food we ate.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
This is in the Patkotak's family living room

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
in their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
Cigarette break outside -- I don't smoke.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.160
This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.160
This is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.160
showing the exciting moments of adrenaline.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.160
So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in "The Whale Hunt"

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
and the two whales that were killed down here.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
And we could do something as arbitrary as, say,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:07.160
extract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.160
and whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160
at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
And now we've whittled down that whole story

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
to just 29 matching photographs,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
and then we can enter the narrative at that position.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160
These whales are about 40 feet long,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
and weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.160
for the community for much of the year.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.160
Skipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
They use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
and an incredibly efficient process.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
This is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.160
This is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
It's baleen. Moving on.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
So what I'm going to tell you about next

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160
is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.160
I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
nestled between Tibet and India.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
And I was doing a project there about happiness,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
interviewing a lot of local people.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.160
So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160
most of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.160
of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
and they've been doing this since the '70s.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
And it leads to just a completely different value system.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
It's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
where people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160
So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
So, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
and took a number of set photographs,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
and interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
I would start by asking people to rate their happiness

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
between one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
And then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
and give them that number of balloons to hold.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
So, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.160
and some really sad soul holding one balloon.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
But you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
(Laughter)

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
And then I would ask them a number of questions like

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
what was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
And then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160
And when they made a wish, I would write their wish

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.160
onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160
So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
This is an 11-year-old student.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.160
He was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
and they all had plastic toy guns.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
His wish was to become a police officer.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
He was getting started early. Those were his hands.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
I took pictures of everybody's hands,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160
because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
and asked everybody to make a funny face.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.160
A 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.160
and it's a lot easier if you're a boy.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
If you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understand

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.160
how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
He wanted to help poor people.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
A 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
and that pile of wheat behind her

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
had taken her about a week to make.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.160
She wanted to keep farming until she dies.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
She was wearing this silver ring that had the word "love" engraved on it,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
and she'd found it in the road somewhere.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
A 16-year-old quarry worker.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.160
This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.160
A 21-year-old monk. He was very happy.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
He wanted to live a long life at the monastery.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.160
He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
which I'm told is very good luck.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160
He was kind of too shy to make a funny face.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.160
A 16-year-old student.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
She wanted to become an independent woman.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160
I asked her about that, and she said she meant

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
that she doesn't want to be married,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
because, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.160
your chances to live an independent life kind of end,

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
and so she had no interest in that.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
A 24-year-old truck driver.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.160
that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road,

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
and he was driving one of these trucks.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.160
But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.160
A 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
She'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.160
Her wish was to marry someone with a car.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.160
She wanted a change in her life.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.160
She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.160
and she wanted a different lot on things.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160
An 81-year-old itinerant farmer.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
I saw this guy on the side of the road,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
and he actually doesn't have a home.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.160
and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
So his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.160
and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
It was all good-natured.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.160
A 10-year-old.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
He wanted to join a school and learn to read,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.160
but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160
He was eating this orange, sugary candy

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160
that he kept dipping his fingers into,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
and since there was so much saliva on his hands,

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.160
this orange paste started to form on his palms.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.160
(Laughter)

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
A 37-year-old road worker.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.160
One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.160
is the use of Indian cheap labor

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.160
that they import from India to build the roads,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160
and then they send these people home once the roads are built.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
So these guys were in a worker's gang

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
His wish was to make some money and open a store.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.160
A 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.160
I asked her about her wish, and she said,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160
"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish."

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.160
She was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.160
over the years to turn very red.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:25.160
Finally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.160
Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.160
I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160
"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.160
but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage."

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.160
And I said, "You mean, like a cave?" And she said, "Yeah, like a cave."

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.160
And I said, "Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?"

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.160
And she said, "Well, you know,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.160
I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave."

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.160
I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way --

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.160
with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter --

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.160
that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.160
on the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160
But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.160
I asked her a little bit more about the cave

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.160
and what she planned would happen once she went there, you know.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.160
What if she saw the truth after just one year,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.160
what would she do for the next 35 years in her life?

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.160
And this is what she said.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.160
Woman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe -- maybe I'll die.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.160
Jonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.160
JH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.160
Woman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.160
within one year, or something like that.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
JH: Are you hoping to?

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.160
Woman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:41.160
JH: Yeah, but -- yeah, OK. Do you hope --

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.160
would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.160
or to live for one year?

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.160
Woman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.160
JH: 40 to 50? Yeah.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.160
Woman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:59.160
JH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.160
Woman: Thank you.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.160
JH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.160
So thank you again, so much.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.160
Woman: You're most welcome.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.160
JH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.160
when she was around 40. That was enough life for her.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.160
So, the last thing we did, very quickly,

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.160
is I took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.160
117 wishes -- and I brought them up to a place called Dochula,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.160
which is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.160
one of the more sacred places in Bhutan.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.160
And up there, there are thousands of prayer flags

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.160
that people have spread out over the years.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.160
And we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.160
and hung them up there among the prayer flags.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.160
And they're actually still flying up there today.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.160
So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.160
you can go check these out. Here are some images from that.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.160
We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.160
You can start to see some familiar balloons here.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.160
"To make some money and to open a store" was the Indian road worker.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.160
Thanks very much.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.160
(Applause)
