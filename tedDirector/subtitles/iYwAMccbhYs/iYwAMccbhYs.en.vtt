00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm a filmmaker.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
For the last 8 years,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I have dedicated my life

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
to documenting the work

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
of Israelis and Palestinians

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
who are trying to end the conflict

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
using peaceful means.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
When I travel with my work

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
across Europe and the United States,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
one question always comes up:

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Why aren't Palestinians

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
using nonviolent resistance?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
The challenge I face when I hear this question

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
is that often I have just returned from the Middle East

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
where I spent my time

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
filming dozens of Palestinians

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
who are using nonviolence

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
to defend their lands

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and water resources

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
from Israeli soldiers and settlers.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
These leaders are trying to forge

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
a massive national nonviolent movement

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
to end the occupation

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and build peace in the region.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Yet, most of you

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
have probably never heard about them.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
This divide between what's happening on the ground

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and perceptions abroad

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
is one of the key reasons

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
why we don't have yet

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
that has been successful.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
So I'm here today

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
to talk about the power of attention,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
the power of your attention,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and the emergence and development

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
of nonviolent movements

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere --

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
I believe that what's mostly missing

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
for nonviolence to grow

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
is not for Palestinians

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
to start adopting nonviolence,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
but for us to start paying attention

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
to those who already are.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Allow me to illustrate this point

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
by taking you to this village

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
called Budrus.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
About seven years ago,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
they faced extinction,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and part of this barrier

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
would be built on top of the village.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
They would lose 40 percent of their land

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and be surrounded,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
so they would lose free access

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
to the rest of the West Bank.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Through inspired local leadership,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
they launched a peaceful resistance campaign

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
to stop that from happening.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Let me show you some brief clips,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
so you have a sense

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
for what that actually looked like on the ground.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.260
(Music)

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Palestinian Woman: We were told the wall

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
would separate Palestine from Israel.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Here in Budrus,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
we realized the wall would steal our land.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Israeli Man: The fence has, in fact,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
created a solution to terror.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Man: Today you're invited

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.260
to a peaceful march.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
You are joined

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
more than nonviolent opposition.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Woman: We saw the men

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
trying to push the soldiers,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
but none of them could do that.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
But I think the girls could do it.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
of traditional thinking.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Chanting: One united nation.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
They were allowed to use any force necessary.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
(Gunshots)

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Man: These are live bullets.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.260
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
is not going to stop the [unclear].

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Protester: This is a peaceful march.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
There is no need to use violence.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
We can do it!

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Julia Bacha: When I first heard

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
about the story of Budrus,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
I was surprised

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
that the international media had failed to cover

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
the extraordinary set of events

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
that happened seven years ago,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
in 2003.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
What was even more surprising

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
was the fact that Budrus was successful.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
convinced the Israeli government

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
to move the route of the barrier off their lands

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and to the green line,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
which is the internationally recognized boundary

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
The resistance in Budrus

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
has since spread

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
to villages across the West Bank

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Yet the media remains mostly silent

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
on these stories.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
This silence carries profound consequences

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
for the likelihood

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
that nonviolence can grow,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
or even survive,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
in Palestine.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Violent resistance

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and nonviolent resistance

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.260
share one very important thing in common;

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
they are both a form of theater

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
seeking an audience to their cause.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
If violent actors

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and attracting international attention

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
to the Palestinian issue,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
it becomes very hard

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
for nonviolent leaders

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
to make the case to their communities

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
that civil disobedience

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
is a viable option

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
in addressing their plight.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
The power of attention

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
is probably going to come as no surprise

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
to the parents in the room.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
The surest way

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
is by giving him attention

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
the first time he throws a fit.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
The tantrum will become

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
what childhood psychologists call

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
a functional behavior,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
since the child has learned

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
that he can get parental attention out of it.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
simply by giving or withdrawing

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
attention to their children.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
But that's true for adults too.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
In fact, the behavior

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
of entire communities and countries

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
can be influenced,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
depending on where

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
the international community chooses

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
to focus its attention.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.260
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and bringing peace

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
is for us

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
to transform nonviolence

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
into a functional behavior

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
by giving a lot more attention

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
In the course of taking my film to villages

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
I have seen the impact

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
that even one documentary film can have

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.260
in influencing the transformation.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
In a village called Wallajeh,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
which sits very close to Jerusalem,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
the community was facing

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
a very similar plight to Budrus.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
and not have freedom of access,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
They had been using nonviolence for about two years

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
but had grown disenchanted

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
since nobody was paying attention.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
So we organized a screening.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
A week later,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
they held the most well-attended

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
and disciplined

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
demonstration to date.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
The organizers say

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
documented in a film,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
felt that there were indeed people

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
following what they were doing,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
that people cared.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
So they kept on going.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
On the Israeli side,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
there is a new peace movement called Solidariot,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
which means solidarity in Hebrew.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
as one of their primary recruiting tools.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
They report

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
that Israelis who had never been active before,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
upon seeing the film,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
understand the power of nonviolence

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and start joining their activities.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
The examples of Wallajeh

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
and the Solidariot movement

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.260
show that even a small-budget independent film

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
can play a role

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
in transforming nonviolence

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
into a functional behavior.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
Now imagine the power

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
that big media players could have

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
if they started covering

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
the weekly nonviolent demonstrations

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
happening in villages

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
like Bil'in, Ni'lin,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Wallajeh,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
in Jerusalem neighborhoods

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan --

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
the nonviolent leaders

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
would become more visible,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
valued and effective

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
in their work.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
I believe

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
that the most important thing

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
is to understand

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
that if we don't pay attention to these efforts,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
they are invisible,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
and it's as if they never happened.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
But I have seen first hand

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
that if we do,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
they will multiply.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
If they multiply,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
their influence will grow

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
And theirs is the kind of influence

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
that can finally

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
unblock the situation.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
in places like Budrus.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Let's give them attention

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
so they can prove it works everywhere.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
Thank you.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:45.260
(Applause)
