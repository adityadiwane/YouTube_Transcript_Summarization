00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
This is a representation of your brain,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and your brain can be broken into two parts.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
There's the left half, which is the logical side,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and then the right half,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
which is the intuitive.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
then we can plot our brain.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
This would be someone who's entirely intuitive.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
So where would you put your brain on this scale?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
but I think for most people in the audience,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
your brain is something like this --

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
You can be logical and intuitive.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And so I consider myself one of these people,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
who need a good deal of logic

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
to string together these complex ideas.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
to actually make the experiments work.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and then we develop our intuition from there.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And really you do the same thing.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
So some intuition

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
that you may have developed over the years

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
is that one thing is only in one place at a time.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
I mean, it can sound weird to think about

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.260
one thing being in two different places at the same time,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.260
and that's that large things don't let you get right past them,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and that they stay in one place.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
unless you're a particle physicist.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
because they don't play with car stops,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
they play with these little weird particles.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And when they play with their particles,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
they find they do all sorts of really weird things --

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
like they can fly right through walls,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.260
or they can be in two different places at the same time.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And so they wrote down all these observations,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And so that's where physics was at a few years ago;

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
you needed quantum mechanics

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
to describe little, tiny particles.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
But you didn't need it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.260
to describe the large, everyday objects around us.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
This didn't really sit well with my intuition,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Well, I play with them sometimes,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
but not very often.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And I've never seen them.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Because if everything is made up of little particles

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
and all the little particles

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
follow quantum mechanics,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
if we could somehow show

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
that an everyday object

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
also follows quantum mechanics.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
So I made one.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
This is the first object

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
that you can see

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
So what we're looking at here

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
is a tiny computer chip.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
This is a photograph of the object.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And so I made this thing

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine --

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
to make this swimming pool-shaped hole

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
underneath the device.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
This device has the ability

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
to be in a quantum superposition,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
but it needs a little help to do it.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Here, let me give you an analogy.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
but then other people get on board

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and I stop doing those things

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
because I don't want to bother them,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
or, frankly, scare them.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
So quantum mechanics says

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
that inanimate objects feel the same way.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
The fellow passengers for inanimate objects

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
are not just people,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
but it's also the light shining on it

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And so we knew, if we wanted to see

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And so that's what we did.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
We turned off the lights,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and then we cooled it down

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Now, all alone in the elevator,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And so we measured its motion.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
We found it was moving in really weird ways.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this --

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
like expanding and contracting bellows.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
And by giving it a gentle nudge,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
we were able to make it both vibrate

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and not vibrate

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
at the same time --

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
What does it mean for one thing

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
to be both vibrating and not vibrating

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
at the same time?

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
So let's think about the atoms.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
So in one case:

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
are sitting still

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and at the same time those same atoms

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
are moving up and down.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Now it's only at precise times when they align.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
The rest of the time they're delocalized.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
That means that every atom

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
is in two different places at the same time,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
which in turn means the entire chunk of metal

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
is in two different places.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
I think this is really cool.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
(Laughter)

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Really.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
(Applause)

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.260
It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
because, check this out,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
the difference in scale

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
between a single atom and that chunk of metal

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
is about the same as the difference

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
between that chunk of metal and you.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
that chunk of metal can be in two different places,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
then why not you?

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
I mean, this is just my logical side talking.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.260
So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
what would that be like?

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
How would your consciousness

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.260
handle your body being delocalized in space?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
There's one more part to the story.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
It's when we warmed it up,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.260
we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
And so I had to develop this new intuition,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
that it seems like all the objects in the elevator

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
are really just quantum objects

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
just crammed into a tiny space.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
You hear a lot of talk

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
Well, that's not quite right.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
It's more than that; it's deeper.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
It's that those connections,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
your connections to all the things around you,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
literally define who you are,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
Thank you.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
(Applause)
