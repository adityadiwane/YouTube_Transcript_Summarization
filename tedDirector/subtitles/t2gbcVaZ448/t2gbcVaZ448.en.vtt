00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:17.704
When I was young,
I prided myself as a nonconformist

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:22.429
in the conservative
U.S. state I live in, Kansas.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.742
I didn't follow along with the crowd.

00:00:24.742 --> 00:00:28.173
I wasn't afraid to try
weird clothing trends or hairstyles.

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.762
I was outspoken and extremely social.

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:38.093
Even these pictures and postcards 
of my London semester abroad 16 years ago

00:00:38.093 --> 00:00:44.097
show that I obviously didn't care
if I was perceived as weird or different.

00:00:44.097 --> 00:00:45.581
(Laughter)

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:51.287
But that same year 
I was in London, 16 years ago,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.699
I realized something about myself
that actually was somewhat unique,

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.059
and that changed everything.

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:05.079
I became the opposite
of who I thought I once was.

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.005
I stayed in my room
instead of socializing.

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:12.385
I stopped engaging in clubs
and leadership activities.

00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:16.260
I didn't want to stand out
in the crowd anymore.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.325
I told myself it was because
I was growing up and maturing,

00:01:20.325 --> 00:01:23.559
not that I was suddenly
looking for acceptance.

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:26.580
I had always assumed I was immune
to needing acceptance.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.944
After all, I was a bit unconventional.

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:31.351
But I realize now

00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:35.516
that the moment I realized
something was different about me

00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:41.119
was the exact same moment
that I began conforming and hiding.

00:01:41.728 --> 00:01:44.200
Hiding is a progressive habit,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.948
and once you start hiding,

00:01:45.948 --> 00:01:50.953
it becomes harder and harder
to step forward and speak out.

00:01:51.888 --> 00:01:53.822
In fact, even now,

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:57.697
when I was talking to people
about what this talk was about,

00:01:57.697 --> 00:01:59.533
I made up a cover story

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:03.348
and I even hid the truth
about my TED Talk.

00:02:04.388 --> 00:02:09.329
So it is fitting and scary

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.519
that I have returned 
to this city 16 years later

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.811
and I have chosen this stage
to finally stop hiding.

00:02:20.093 --> 00:02:24.325
What have I been hiding
for 16 years?

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:29.602
I am a lesbian.

00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:34.835
(Applause)

00:02:45.513 --> 00:02:48.038
Thank you.

00:02:48.038 --> 00:02:50.397
I've struggled to say those words,

00:02:50.397 --> 00:02:53.573
because I didn't want
to be defined by them.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:56.202
Every time I would think
about coming out in the past,

00:02:56.202 --> 00:03:01.266
I would think to myself,
but I just want to be known as Morgana,

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:03.430
uniquely Morgana,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.439
but not "my lesbian friend Morgana,"
or "my gay coworker Morgana."

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.893
Just Morgana.

00:03:10.893 --> 00:03:14.302
For those of you from large
metropolitan areas,

00:03:14.302 --> 00:03:16.895
this may not seem like a big deal to you.

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:19.839
It may seem strange 
that I have suppressed the truth

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:23.035
and hidden this for so long.

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:27.726
But I was paralyzed by my fear
of not being accepted.

00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:31.459
And I'm not alone, of course.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.308
A 2013 Deloitte study found
that a surprisingly large number of people

00:03:36.308 --> 00:03:39.078
hide aspects of their identity.

00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:41.949
Of all the employees they surveyed,

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:47.568
61 percent reported changing an aspect
of their behavior or their appearance

00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:49.841
in order to fit in at work.

00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:54.470
Of all the gay, lesbian
and bisexual employees,

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.260
83 percent admitted to changing
some aspects of themselves

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.758
so they would not 
appear at work "too gay."

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:07.340
The study found that even in companies

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.253
with diversity policies
and inclusion programs,

00:04:11.253 --> 00:04:14.006
employees struggle
to be themselves at work

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:16.989
because they believe 
conformity is critical

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.496
to their long-term career advancement.

00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:25.438
And while I was surprised
that so many people just like me

00:04:25.438 --> 00:04:29.231
waste so much energy
trying to hide themselves,

00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:33.122
I was scared when I discovered
that my silence

00:04:33.122 --> 00:04:39.432
has life-or-death consequences
and long-term social repercussions.

00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:43.308
Twelve years:

00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:46.979
the length by which 
life expectancy is shortened

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.017
for gay, lesbian and bisexual people
in highly anti-gay communities

00:04:53.017 --> 00:04:55.673
compared to accepting communities.

00:04:56.603 --> 00:05:00.731
Twelve years reduced life expectancy.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.429
When I read that in The Advocate 
magazine this year,

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:08.234
I realized I could no longer
afford to keep silent.

00:05:08.904 --> 00:05:14.896
The effects of personal stress and
social stigmas are a deadly combination.

00:05:16.692 --> 00:05:19.963
The study found that gays
in anti-gay communities

00:05:19.963 --> 00:05:25.710
had higher rates of heart disease,
violence and suicide.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.040
What I once thought
was simply a personal matter

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.226
I realized had a ripple effect

00:05:31.226 --> 00:05:33.820
that went into the workplace
and out into the community

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.185
for every story just like mine.

00:05:37.185 --> 00:05:41.005
My choice to hide
and not share who I really am

00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:45.048
may have inadvertently contributed
to this exact same environment

00:05:45.048 --> 00:05:47.492
and atmosphere of discrimination.

00:05:48.192 --> 00:05:53.590
I'd always told myself
there's no reason to share that I was gay,

00:05:53.592 --> 00:05:57.809
but the idea that my silence
has social consequences

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:02.669
was really driven home this year
when I missed an opportunity

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:08.421
to change the atmosphere of discrimination
in my own home state of Kansas.

00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:13.623
In February, the Kansas House of 
Representatives brought up a bill for vote

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.147
that would have essentially
allowed businesses

00:06:16.147 --> 00:06:22.745
to use religious freedom as a reason
to deny gays services.

00:06:25.063 --> 00:06:28.245
A former coworker and friend of mine

00:06:28.245 --> 00:06:33.068
has a father who serves
in the Kansas House of Representatives.

00:06:33.068 --> 00:06:38.246
He voted in favor of the bill,

00:06:38.253 --> 00:06:45.007
in favor of a law that would allow 
businesses to not serve me.

00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:48.436
How does my friend feel

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:53.922
about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
queer and questioning people?

00:06:53.922 --> 00:06:56.611
How does her father feel?

00:06:56.611 --> 00:07:02.499
I don't know, because I was never honest 
with them about who I am.

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:05.773
And that shakes me to the core.

00:07:05.773 --> 00:07:09.204
What if I had told her my story years ago?

00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:11.853
Could she have told 
her father my experience?

00:07:11.853 --> 00:07:16.885
Could I have ultimately
helped change his vote?

00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:19.348
I will never know,

00:07:19.348 --> 00:07:23.480
and that made me realize
I had done nothing

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.723
to try to make a difference.

00:07:27.053 --> 00:07:31.074
How ironic that I work
in human resources,

00:07:31.074 --> 00:07:33.512
a profession that works to welcome,

00:07:33.512 --> 00:07:37.097
connect and encourage
the development of employees,

00:07:37.097 --> 00:07:40.339
a profession that advocates
that the diversity of society

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:43.004
should be reflected in the workplace,

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:48.779
and yet I have done nothing
to advocate for diversity.

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:51.649
When I came to this company one year ago,

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:56.724
I thought to myself, this company 
has anti-discrimination policies

00:07:56.724 --> 00:08:00.777
that protect gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender people.

00:08:00.777 --> 00:08:06.483
Their commitment to diversity is evident
through their global inclusion programs.

00:08:06.483 --> 00:08:11.645
When I walk through the doors
of this company, I will finally come out.

00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:14.540
But I didn't.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.250
Instead of taking advantage
of the opportunity,

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.529
I did nothing.

00:08:31.838 --> 00:08:38.038
(Applause)

00:08:39.737 --> 00:08:43.652
When I was looking through
my London journal and scrapbook

00:08:43.652 --> 00:08:46.902
from my London semester
abroad 16 years ago,

00:08:46.902 --> 00:08:52.396
I came across this modified quote
from Toni Morrison's book, "Paradise."

00:08:53.547 --> 00:08:57.841
"There are more scary things
inside than outside."

00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:01.099
And then I wrote a note
to myself at the bottom:

00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:02.983
"Remember this."

00:09:03.983 --> 00:09:08.685
I'm sure I was trying to encourage myself
to get out and explore London,

00:09:08.685 --> 00:09:15.758
but the message I missed was the need 
to start exploring and embracing myself.

00:09:15.762 --> 00:09:19.465
What I didn't realize
until all these years later

00:09:19.465 --> 00:09:24.371
is that the biggest obstacles
I will ever have to overcome

00:09:24.371 --> 00:09:28.438
are my own fears and insecurities.

00:09:28.438 --> 00:09:35.876
I believe that by facing my fears inside,
I will be able to change reality outside.

00:09:37.498 --> 00:09:39.791
I made a choice today

00:09:39.791 --> 00:09:46.333
to reveal a part of myself
that I have hidden for too long.

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:50.644
I hope that this means
I will never hide again,

00:09:50.644 --> 00:09:57.486
and I hope that by coming out today,
I can do something to change the data

00:09:57.492 --> 00:10:03.903
and also to help others who feel different
be more themselves and more fulfilled

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:08.394
in both their professional
and personal lives.

00:10:08.394 --> 00:10:11.147
Thank you.

00:10:11.147 --> 00:10:17.482
(Applause)
