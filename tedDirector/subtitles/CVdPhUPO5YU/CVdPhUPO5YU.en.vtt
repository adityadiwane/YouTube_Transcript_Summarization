00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.956
Hi, I'm an engineer

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.956
and I make robots.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.476
Now, of course you all know
what a robot is, right?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.676
If you don't, you'd probably go to Google,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.556
and you'd ask Google what a robot is.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.820
So let's do that.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.196
We'll go to Google
and this is what we get.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.396
Now, you can see here there are
lots of different types of robots,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.156
but they're predominantly
humanoid in structure.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.836
And they look pretty conventional

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.316
because they've got plastic,
they've got metal,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.636
they've got motors and gears and so on.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.276
Some of them look quite friendly,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.356
and you could go up
and you could hug them.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.796
Some of them not so friendly,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.276
they look like they're
straight out of "Terminator,"

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.836
in fact they may well be
straight out of "Terminator."

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.596
You can do lots of really cool
things with these robots --

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.236
you can do really exciting stuff.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.196
But I'd like to look
at different kinds of robots --

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.196
I want to make different kinds of robots.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.636
And I take inspiration
from the things that don't look like us,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.060
but look like these.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.076
So these are natural biological organisms

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.676
and they do some
really cool things that we can't,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.196
and current robots can't either.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.396
They do all sorts of great things
like moving around on the floor;

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.676
they go into our gardens
and they eat our crops;

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.956
they climb trees;

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.196
they go in water, they come out of water;

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.796
they trap insects and digest them.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.636
So they do really interesting things.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.036
They live, they breathe, they die,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.876
they eat things from the environment.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.476
Our current robots don't really do that.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.716
Now, wouldn't it be great

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.396
if you could use some of those
characteristics in future robots

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.116
so that you could solve
some really interesting problems?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.196
I'm going to look at a couple of problems
now in the environment

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.956
where we can use
the skills and the technologies

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.996
derived from these animals

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.556
and from the plants,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.676
and we can use them
to solve those problems.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.060
Let's have a look
at two environmental problems.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.196
They're both of our making --

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.676
this is man interacting
with the environment

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.076
and doing some rather unpleasant things.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.740
The first one is to do
with the pressure of population.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.676
Such is the pressure
of population around the world

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.836
that agriculture and farming is required
to produce more and more crops.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.076
Now, to do that,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.476
farmers put more and more
chemicals onto the land.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.636
They put on fertilizers,
nitrates, pesticides --

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.036
all sorts of things
that encourage the growth of the crops,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.196
but there are some negative impacts.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.676
One of the negative impacts is
if you put lots of fertilizer on the land,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.116
not all of it goes into the crops.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.716
Lots of it stays in the soil,

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.196
and then when it rains,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.716
these chemicals go into the water table.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.996
And in the water table,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.516
then they go into streams,
into lakes, into rivers

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.740
and into the sea.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.836
Now, if you put all
of these chemicals, these nitrates,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.476
into those kinds of environments,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.276
there are organisms in those environments
that will be affected by that --

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.916
algae, for example.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.476
Algae loves nitrates, it loves fertilizer,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.596
so it will take in all these chemicals,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.556
and if the conditions are right,
it will mass produce.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.836
It will produce masses
and masses of new algae.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.396
That's called a bloom.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.596
The trouble is that
when algae reproduces like this,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.860
it starves the water of oxygen.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.556
As soon as you do that,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.500
the other organisms
in the water can't survive.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.916
So, what do we do?

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.956
We try to produce a robot
that will eat the algae,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.836
consume it and make it safe.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.220
So that's the first problem.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.276
The second problem is also of our making,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.180
and it's to do with oil pollution.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.356
Now, oil comes out
of the engines that we use,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.716
the boats that we use.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.796
Sometimes tankers
flush their oil tanks into the sea,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.076
so oil is released into the sea that way.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.676
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could treat that in some way

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.420
using robots that could eat the pollution
the oil fields have produced?

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.596
So that's what we do.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.220
We make robots that will eat pollution.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.036
To actually make the robot,

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.260
we take inspiration from two organisms.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.236
On the right there
you see the basking shark.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.796
The basking shark is a massive shark.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.396
It's noncarnivorous,
so you can swim with it,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.876
as you can see.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.756
And the basking shark opens its mouth,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.620
and it swims through the water,
collecting plankton.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.916
As it does that, it digests the food,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.460
and then it uses that energy
in its body to keep moving.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.076
So, could we make a robot like that --

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.636
like the basking shark
that chugs through the water

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.020
and eats up pollution?

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.716
Well, let's see if we can do that.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.796
But also, we take the inspiration
from other organisms.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.876
I've got a picture here
of a water boatman,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.716
and the water boatman is really cute.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.316
When it's swimming in the water,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.820
it uses its paddle-like legs
to push itself forward.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.436
So we take those two organisms

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.460
and we combine them together
to make a new kind of robot.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.316
In fact, because we're using
the water boatman as inspiration,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.116
and our robot sits on top of the water,

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.396
and it rows,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.636
we call it the "Row-bot."

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.516
So a Row-bot is a robot that rows.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.236
OK. So what does it look like?

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.996
Here's some pictures of the Row-bot,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.236
and you'll see,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.596
it doesn't look anything like the robots
we saw right at the beginning.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.756
Google is wrong;
robots don't look like that,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.996
they look like this.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.796
So I've got the Row-bot here.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.236
I'll just hold it up for you.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.916
It gives you a sense of the scale,

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.076
and it doesn't look
anything like the others.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.716
OK, so it's made out of plastic,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.796
and we'll have a look now
at the components

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.136
that make up the Row-bot --

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.541
what makes it really special.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.396
The Row-bot is made up of three parts,

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.716
and those three parts are really
like the parts of any organism.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.396
It's got a brain,

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.796
it's got a body

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.116
and it's got a stomach.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.556
It needs the stomach to create the energy.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.796
Any Row-bot will have
those three components,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.196
and any organism
will have those three components,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.116
so let's go through them one at a time.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.396
It has a body,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.196
and its body is made out of plastic,

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.436
and it sits on top of the water.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.396
And it's got flippers on the side here --

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.916
paddles that help it move,

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.300
just like the water boatman.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.356
It's got a plastic body,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.236
but it's got a soft rubber mouth here,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.156
and a mouth here --
it's got two mouths.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.596
Why does it have two mouths?

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.436
One is to let the food go in

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.396
and the other is to let the food go out.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.916
So you can see really
it's got a mouth and a derriere,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.156
or a --

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.196
(Laughter)

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.956
something where the stuff comes out,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.676
which is just like a real organism.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.516
So it's starting to look
like that basking shark.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.916
So that's the body.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.076
The second component might be the stomach.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.996
We need to get the energy into the robot
and we need to treat the pollution,

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.556
so the pollution goes in,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.076
and it will do something.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.676
It's got a cell in the middle here
called a microbial fuel cell.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.460
I'll put this down,
and I'll lift up the fuel cell.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.876
Here. So instead of having batteries,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.076
instead of having
a conventional power system,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.356
it's got one of these.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.636
This is its stomach.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.916
And it really is a stomach

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.356
because you can put energy in this side
in the form of pollution,

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.036
and it creates electricity.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.276
So what is it?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.956
It's called a microbial fuel cell.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.076
It's a little bit
like a chemical fuel cell,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.116
which you might have
come across in school,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.756
or you might've seen in the news.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.916
Chemical fuel cells
take hydrogen and oxygen,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.756
and they can combine them together
and you get electricity.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.196
That's well-established technology;
it was in the Apollo space missions.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.700
That's from 40, 50 years ago.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.516
This is slightly newer.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.996
This is a microbial fuel cell.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.276
It's the same principle:

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.716
it's got oxygen on one side,

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.836
but instead of having
hydrogen on the other,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.156
it's got some soup,

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.996
and inside that soup
there are living microbes.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.716
Now, if you take some organic material --

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.076
could be some waste products, some food,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.596
maybe a bit of your sandwich --

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.436
you put it in there,
the microbes will eat that food,

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.340
and they will turn it into electricity.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.716
Not only that, but if you select
the right kind of microbes,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.500
you can use the microbial fuel cell
to treat some of the pollution.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.836
If you choose the right microbes,

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.476
the microbes will eat the algae.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.836
If you use other kinds of microbes,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.380
they will eat petroleum
spirits and crude oil.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.476
So you can see
how this stomach could be used

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.756
to not only treat the pollution

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.580
but also to generate electricity
from the pollution.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.996
So the robot will move
through the environment,

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.116
taking food into its stomach,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.636
digest the food, create electricity,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.156
use that electricity
to move through the environment

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.396
and keep doing this.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.956
OK, so let's see what happens
when we run the Row-bot --

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.356
when it does some rowing.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.036
Here we've got a couple of videos,

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.716
the first thing you'll see --
hopefully you can see here

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.036
is the mouth open.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.076
The front mouth and the bottom mouth open,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.636
and it will stay opened enough,

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.676
then the robot will start to row forward.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.956
It moves through the water

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.076
so that food goes in
as the waste products go out.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.356
Once it's moved enough,

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.316
it stops and then it closes the mouth --

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.756
slowly closes the mouths --

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.436
and then it will sit there,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.100
and it will digest the food.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.516
Of course these microbial fuel cells,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.796
they contain microbes.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.676
What you really want is lots of energy

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.316
coming out of those microbes
as quickly as possible.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.916
But we can't force the microbes

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.956
and they generate a small amount
of electricity per second.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.236
They generate milliwatts, or microwatts.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.116
Let's put that into context.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.676
Your mobile phone for example,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.076
one of these modern ones,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.316
if you use it, it takes about one watt.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.156
So that's a thousand or a million times
as much energy that that uses

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.140
compared to the microbial fuel cell.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.396
How can we cope with that?

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.276
Well, when the Row-bot
has done its digestion,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.756
when it's taken the food in,

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.316
it will sit there and it will wait
until it has consumed all that food.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.556
That could take some hours,
it could take some days.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.276
A typical cycle for the Row-bot
looks like this:

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.556
you open your mouth,

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.836
you move,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.116
you close your mouth

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.996
and you sit there for a while waiting.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.396
Once you digest your food,

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.236
then you can go about
doing the same thing again.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.236
But you know what, that looks
like a real organism, doesn't it?

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.116
It looks like the kind of thing we do.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.196
Saturday night,
we go out, open our mouths,

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.756
fill our stomachs,

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.716
sit in front of the telly and digest.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.116
When we've had enough,
we do the same thing again.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.996
OK, if we're lucky with this cycle,

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.556
at the end of the cycle
we'll have enough energy left over

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.716
for us to be able to do something else.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.756
We could send a message, for example.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.276
We could send a message saying,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.636
"This is how much pollution
I've eaten recently,"

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.236
or, "This is the kind of stuff
that I've encountered,"

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.940
or, "This is where I am."

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.876
That ability to send a message
saying, "This is where I am,"

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.836
is really, really important.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.356
If you think about the oil slicks
that we saw before,

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.836
or those massive algal blooms,

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.556
what you really want to do
is put your Row-bot out there,

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.556
and it eats up all of those pollutions,

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.756
and then you have to go collect them.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.996
Why?

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.836
Because these Row-bots at the moment,

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.196
this Row-bot I've got here,

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.076
it contains motors, it contains wires,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.556
it contains components
which themselves are not biodegradable.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.316
Current Row-bots contain
things like toxic batteries.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.316
You can't leave those in the environment,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.836
so you need to track them,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.196
and then when they've finished
their job of work,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.476
you need to collect them.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.836
That limits the number
of Row-bots you can use.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.116
If, on the other hand,

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.276
you have robot a little bit
like a biological organism,

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.396
when it comes to the end of its life,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.876
it dies and it degrades to nothing.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.236
So wouldn't it be nice if these robots,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.499
instead of being like this,
made out of plastic,

00:11:11.523 --> 00:11:13.116
were made out of other materials,

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.876
which when you throw them out there,

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.236
they biodegrade to nothing?

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.356
That changes the way
in which we use robots.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.756
Instead of putting 10 or 100
out into the environment,

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.036
having to track them,

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.396
and then when they die,

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.636
collect them,

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.356
you could put a thousand,

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.116
a million, a billion robots
into the environment.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.956
Just spread them around.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.596
You know that at the end of their lives,
they're going to degrade to nothing.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.316
You don't need to worry about them.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.956
So that changes the way
in which you think about robots

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.356
and the way you deploy them.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.236
Then the question is: Can you do this?

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.436
Well, yes, we have shown
that you can do this.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.556
You can make robots
which are biodegradable.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.436
What's really interesting
is you can use household materials

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.156
to make these biodegradable robots.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.756
I'll show you some;
you might be surprised.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.676
You can make a robot out of jelly.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.476
Instead of having a motor,
which we have at the moment,

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.956
you can make things
called artificial muscles.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.276
Artificial muscles are smart materials,

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.756
you apply electricity to them,

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.956
and they contract,
or they bend or they twist.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.196
They look like real muscles.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.220
So instead of having a motor,
you have these artificial muscles.

00:12:14.244 --> 00:12:17.076
And you can make
artificial muscles out of jelly.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.036
If you take some jelly and some salts,

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.636
and do a bit of jiggery-pokery,

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.436
you can make an artificial muscle.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.036
We've also shown you can make
the microbial fuel cell's stomach

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.476
out of paper.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.980
So you could make the whole
robot out of biodegradable materials.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.180
You throw them out there,
and they degrade to nothing.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.276
Well, this is really, really exciting.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.491
It's going to totally change the way
in which we think about robots,

00:12:40.515 --> 00:12:42.756
but also it allows you
to be really creative

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.116
in the way in which you think
about what you can do with these robots.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.396
I'll give you an example.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.996
If you can use jelly to make a robot --

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.916
now, we eat jelly, right?

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.436
So, why not make something like this?

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.860
A robot gummy bear.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.716
Here, I've got some I prepared earlier.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.340
There we go. I've got a packet --

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.260
and I've got a lemon-flavored one.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.156
I'll take this gummy bear --
he's not robotic, OK?

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.396
We have to pretend.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.436
And what you do with one of these
is you put it in your mouth --

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.700
the lemon's quite nice.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.445
Try not to chew it too much,
it's a robot, it may not like it.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.876
And then you swallow it.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.596
And then it goes into your stomach.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.436
And when it's inside your stomach,
it moves, it thinks, it twists, it bends,

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.676
it does something.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.876
It could go further down
into your intestines,

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.236
find out whether you've got
some ulcer or cancer,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.356
maybe do an injection,
something like that.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.236
You know that once
it's done its job of work,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.476
it could be consumed by your stomach,

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.196
or if you don't want that,

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.836
it could go straight through you,

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.076
into the toilet,

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.316
and be degraded safely in the environment.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.580
So this changes the way, again,
in which we think about robots.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.836
So, we started off looking
at robots that would eat pollution,

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.516
and then we're looking
at robots which we can eat.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.196
I hope this gives you some idea

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.660
of the kinds of things
we can do with future robots.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.276
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.783
(Applause)
