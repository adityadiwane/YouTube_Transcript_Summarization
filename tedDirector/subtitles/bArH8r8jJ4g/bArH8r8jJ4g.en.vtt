00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:14.323
I suspect that

00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:16.080
every aid worker in Africa

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.673
comes to a time in her career

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:20.989
when she wants to take all 
the money for her project —

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.091
maybe it's a school or a training program —

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.980
pack it in a suitcase,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.964
get on a plane flying over the
poorest villages in the country,

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:33.148
and start throwing that money out the window.

00:00:33.148 --> 00:00:35.464
Because to a veteran aid worker,

00:00:35.464 --> 00:00:38.171
the idea of putting cold, hard cash

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.210
into the hands of the poorest people on Earth

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.865
doesn't sound crazy,

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:46.941
it sounds really satisfying.

00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:49.843
I had that moment right about the 10-year mark,

00:00:49.843 --> 00:00:52.310
and luckily, that's also when I learned

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.974
that this idea actually exists,

00:00:55.974 --> 00:00:59.817
and it might be just what the aid system needs.

00:00:59.817 --> 00:01:02.520
Economists call it an unconditional cash transfer,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.680
and it's exactly that: It's cash given

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.952
with no strings attached.

00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:08.516
Governments in developing countries

00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:10.192
have been doing this for decades,

00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:12.724
and it's only now, with more evidence

00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:15.915
and new technology that it's possible

00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:20.234
to make this a model for delivering aid.

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:23.148
It's a pretty simple idea, right?

00:01:23.148 --> 00:01:27.254
Well, why did I spend a decade doing other stuff

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.392
for the poor?

00:01:29.392 --> 00:01:32.935
Honestly, I believed that I could do more good

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:34.881
with money for the poor

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.491
than the poor could do for themselves.

00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:38.524
I held two assumptions:

00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:41.113
One, that poor people are poor in part

00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:43.115
because they're uneducated and

00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:45.275
don't make good choices;

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:47.986
two is that we then need people like me

00:01:47.986 --> 00:01:51.724
to figure out what they need and get it to them.

00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:55.946
It turns out, the evidence says otherwise.

00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:58.795
In recent years, researchers have been studying

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:02.200
what happens when we give poor people cash.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.871
Dozens of studies show across the board

00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:07.627
that people use cash transfers

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.795
to improve their own lives.

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:12.643
Pregnant women in Uruguay buy better food

00:02:12.643 --> 00:02:14.877
and give birth to healthier babies.

00:02:14.877 --> 00:02:17.971
Sri Lankan men invest in their businesses.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.669
Researchers who studied our work in Kenya

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.586
found that people invested in a range of assets,

00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:27.936
from livestock to equipment 
to home improvements,

00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:30.058
and they saw increases in income

00:02:30.058 --> 00:02:32.441
from business and farming

00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:36.131
one year after the cash was sent.

00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:38.695
None of these studies found that people

00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:41.104
spend more on drinking or smoking

00:02:41.104 --> 00:02:43.609
or that people work less.

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.717
In fact, they work more.

00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:50.980
Now, these are all material needs.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.151
In Vietnam, elderly recipients used

00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:58.662
their cash transfers to pay for coffins.

00:02:58.662 --> 00:03:02.673
As someone who wonders if Maslow got it wrong,

00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:07.400
I find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.667
deeply humbling.

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:11.880
I don't know if I would have chosen to give food

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.491
or equipment or coffins,

00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:17.781
which begs the question:

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.777
How good are we at allocating resources

00:03:20.777 --> 00:03:22.622
on behalf of the poor?

00:03:22.622 --> 00:03:25.517
Are we worth the cost?

00:03:25.517 --> 00:03:27.460
Again, we can look at empirical evidence

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.250
on what happens when we give people stuff

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.926
of our choosing.

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:35.795
One very telling study looked at a program in India

00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:39.102
that gives livestock to the so-called ultra-poor,

00:03:39.102 --> 00:03:43.023
and they found that 30 percent of recipients

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:47.176
had turned around and sold the
livestock they had been given

00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:50.529
for cash.

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:52.087
The real irony is,

00:03:52.087 --> 00:03:54.668
for every 100 dollars worth of assets

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:56.820
this program gave someone,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.506
they spent another 99 dollars to do it.

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:05.152
What if, instead, we use technology to put cash,

00:04:05.152 --> 00:04:09.739
whether from aid agencies or from any one of us

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.509
directly into a poor person's hands.

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:16.379
Today, three in four Kenyans use mobile money,

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:19.202
which is basically a bank account that can run

00:04:19.202 --> 00:04:20.700
on any cell phone.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.166
A sender can pay a 1.6 percent fee

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:26.204
and with the click of a button

00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:29.155
send money directly to a recipient's account

00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:31.885
with no intermediaries.

00:04:31.885 --> 00:04:34.748
Like the technologies that are disrupting industries

00:04:34.748 --> 00:04:36.547
in our own lives,

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:39.110
payments technology in poor countries

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.217
could disrupt aid.

00:04:42.217 --> 00:04:44.529
It's spreading so quickly that it's possible

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.061
to imagine reaching billions

00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:49.860
of the world's poor this way.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.481
That's what we've started to do at GiveDirectly.

00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:54.146
We're the first organization

00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:57.319
dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.987
We've sent cash to 35,000 
people across rural Kenya

00:05:01.987 --> 00:05:03.154
and Uganda

00:05:03.154 --> 00:05:06.332
in one-time payments of 1,000 dollars

00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:08.917
per family.

00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:11.177
So far, we've looked for the poorest people

00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:14.480
in the poorest villages, and in this part of the world,

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.924
they're the ones living in homes

00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:17.102
made of mud and thatch,

00:05:17.102 --> 00:05:19.562
not cement and iron.

00:05:19.562 --> 00:05:21.784
So let's say that's your family.

00:05:21.784 --> 00:05:24.236
We show up at your door with an Android phone.

00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:26.563
We'll get your name, take your photo

00:05:26.563 --> 00:05:27.979
and a photo of your hut

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.454
and grab the GPS coordinates.

00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:32.554
That night, we send all the data to the cloud,

00:05:32.554 --> 00:05:34.834
and each piece gets checked

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.712
by an independent team

00:05:36.712 --> 00:05:40.103
using, for one example, satellite images.

00:05:40.103 --> 00:05:42.099
Then, we'll come back,

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.490
we'll sell you a basic cell phone

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.757
if you don't have one already,

00:05:46.757 --> 00:05:49.078
and a few weeks later,

00:05:49.078 --> 00:05:51.369
we send money to it.

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:52.930
Something that five years ago

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.458
would have seemed impossible

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:57.343
we can now do efficiently

00:05:57.343 --> 00:05:59.481
and free of corruption.

00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:01.797
The more cash we give to the poor,

00:06:01.797 --> 00:06:05.453
and the more evidence we have that it works,

00:06:05.453 --> 00:06:07.861
the more we have to reconsider

00:06:07.861 --> 00:06:10.350
everything else we give.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.938
Today, the logic behind aid is too often,

00:06:13.938 --> 00:06:17.050
well, we do at least some good.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.466
When we're complacent

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:20.836
with that as our bar,

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:23.428
when we tell ourselves that giving aid

00:06:23.428 --> 00:06:26.342
is better than no aid at all,

00:06:26.342 --> 00:06:28.614
we tend to invest inefficiently,

00:06:28.614 --> 00:06:32.596
in our own ideas that strike us as innovative,

00:06:32.596 --> 00:06:34.750
on writing reports,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.596
on plane tickets and SUVs.

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:40.920
What if the logic was,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.191
will we do better than cash given directly?

00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:47.701
Organizations would have to prove

00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:49.930
that they're doing more good for the poor

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.686
than the poor can do for themselves.

00:06:52.686 --> 00:06:55.634
Of course, giving cash won't create public goods

00:06:55.634 --> 00:07:00.952
like eradicating disease or 
building strong institutions,

00:07:00.952 --> 00:07:03.178
but it could set a higher bar

00:07:03.178 --> 00:07:06.140
for how we help individual families

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.166
improve their lives.

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:10.729
I believe in aid.

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:13.828
I believe most aid is better than just

00:07:13.828 --> 00:07:15.740
throwing money out of a plane.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.288
I am also absolutely certain

00:07:18.288 --> 00:07:20.521
that a lot of aid today

00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:24.046
isn't better than giving directly to the poor.

00:07:24.046 --> 00:07:27.922
I hope that one day, it will be.

00:07:27.922 --> 00:07:29.978
Thank you.

00:07:29.978 --> 00:07:33.945
(Applause)
