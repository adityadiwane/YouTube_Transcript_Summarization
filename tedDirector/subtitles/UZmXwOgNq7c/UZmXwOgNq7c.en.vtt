00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm not at all a cook.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
So don't fear, this is not going to be a cooking demonstration.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
But I do want to talk to you about something

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
that I think is dear to all of us.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
And that is bread -- something which is as simple

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.160
as our basic, most fundamental human staple.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
And I think few of us spend the day

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
without eating bread in some form.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
Unless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
bread is standard.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
Bread is not only standard in the Western diet.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
As I will show to you, it is actually

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
the mainstay of modern life.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
So I'm going to bake bread for you.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
In the meantime I'm also talking to you,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
so my life is going to be complicated. Bear with me.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.160
First of all, a little bit of audience participation.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
I have two loaves of bread here.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
One is a supermarket standard:

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
white bread, pre-packaged,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
which I'm told is called a Wonderbread.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.160
(Laughter)

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
I didn't know this word until I arrived.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
And this is more or less,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
a whole-meal, handmade,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
small-bakery loaf of bread.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
Here we go. I want to see a show of hands.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Who prefers the whole-meal bread?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.160
Okay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all?

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.160
(Laughter)

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
I have two tentative male hands.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
(Laughter)

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
Okay, now the question is really,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
why is this so?

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
And I think it is because

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
we feel that this kind of bread

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
really is about authenticity.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
It's about a traditional way of living.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
A way that is perhaps more real, more honest.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
This is an image from Tuscany, where we feel

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
agriculture is still about beauty.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
And life is really, too.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
And this is about good taste, good traditions.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
Why do we have this image?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.160
Why do we feel that this is more true than this?

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
Well I think it has a lot to do with our history.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
In the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.160
most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
or they were closely related to food production.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
And we have this mythical image

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.160
of how life was in rural areas in the past.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
It was a mythical past.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
Of course, the reality is quite different.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
These poor farmers

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
working the land by hand or with their animals,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
had yield levels that are comparable

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
to the poorest farmers today in West Africa.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
But we have, somehow,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.160
in the course of the last few centuries, or even decades,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
started to cultivate an image of

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.160
a mythical, rural agricultural past.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
It was only 200 years ago

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
it's very important to understand

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
what that revolution did to us.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.160
It brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
And it actually drove up our yields.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
And even sort of horrible things, like picking beans by hand,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
can now be done automatically.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.160
All that is a real, great improvement, as we shall see.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.160
Of course we also, particularly in the last decade,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
managed to envelop the world

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
in a dense chain of supermarkets,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
in a chain of global trade.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
And it means that you now eat products,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
which can come from all around the world.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
That is the reality of our modern life.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Now you may prefer this loaf of bread.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
Excuse my hands but this is how it is.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
But actually the real relevant bread,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160
historically, is this white Wonder loaf.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
And don't despise the white bread

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
because it really, I think,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
symbolizes the fact that bread and food

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.160
have become plentiful and affordable to all.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
And that is a feat that we

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
are not really conscious of that much.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
But it has changed the world.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
This tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
and has a lot of problems

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
has changed the world.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
So what is happening?

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.160
Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
With the advent of the Industrial Revolution

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
with modernization of agriculture

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160
in the last few decades, since the 1960s,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
food availability, per head, in this world,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
has increased by 25 percent.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.160
And the world population in the meantime has doubled.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
That means that we have now more food available

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
than ever before in human history.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
And that is the result, directly,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
of being so successful

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.160
at increasing the scale and volume of our production.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
And this is true, as you can see, for all countries,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
including the so-called developing countries.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
What happened to our bread in the meantime?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
As food became plentiful here,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
it also meant that we were able to decrease

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.160
the number of people working in agriculture

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.160
to something like, on average, in the high income countries,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.160
five percent or less of the population.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.160
In the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
And it frees us all up to do other things --

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.160
That is, historically, a really unique situation.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.160
Never before has the responsibility to feed the world

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
been in the hands of so few people.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160
And never before have so many people

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
been oblivious of that fact.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.160
So as food became more plentiful, bread became cheaper.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.160
And as it became cheaper, bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
We added in more sugar.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.160
We add in raisins and oil and milk

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
and all kinds of things to make bread,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.160
from a simple food into kind of a support for calories.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.160
And today, bread now is associated with obesity,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
which is very strange.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
It is the basic, most fundamental food

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
that we've had in the last ten thousand years.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.160
Wheat is the most important crop -- the first crop we domesticated

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
and the most important crop we still grow today.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
But this is now this strange concoction

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
of high calories.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
And that's not only true in this country,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
it is true all over the world.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
Bread has migrated to tropical countries,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.160
where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
and where the commuters

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
find bread much more handy to use

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
than rice or cassava.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
So bread has become from a main staple,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
a source of calories

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
associated with obesity

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
and also a source of modernity,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
of modern life.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
And the whiter the bread, in many countries, the better it is.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
So this is the story of bread as we know it now.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
But of course the price of mass production

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
has been that we moved large-scale.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.160
And large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
destruction of biodiversity --

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
still a lonely emu here

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
in the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
The costs have been tremendous --

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.160
water pollution, all the things you know about, destruction of our habitats.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.160
What we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
And this is where I have to query all of you.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.160
How many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
How many of you actually can make a bread

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
in this way, without starting with a bread machine

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160
or just some kind of packaged flavor?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.160
Can you actually bake bread? Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs?

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
We have become very removed

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
from what our bread really is,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
which, again, evolutionarily speaking,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
is very strange.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
In fact not many of you know that

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
our bread, of course, was not a European invention.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
It was invented by farmers in Iraq

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
and Syria in particular.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
The tiny spike on the left to the center

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
is actually the forefather of wheat.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
This is where it all comes from,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160
and where these farmers who actually, ten thousand years ago,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
put us on the road of bread.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
Now it is not surprising

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
that with this massification and large-scale production,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
there is a counter-movement that emerged --

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
very much also here in California.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.160
The counter-movement says, "Let's go back to this.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
Let's go back to traditional farming.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.160
Let's go back to small-scale, to farmers' markets,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
small bakeries and all that." Wonderful.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
Don't we all agree? I certainly agree.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
I would love to go back to Tuscany

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
to this kind of traditional setting,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
gastronomy, good food.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
But this is a fallacy.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
And the fallacy comes from idealizing

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
a past that we have forgotten about.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.160
If we do this, if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
we are going, actually, to relegate

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
these poor farmers and their husbands --

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
among whom I have lived for many years,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160
working without electricity and water, to try to improve their food production --

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
we relegate them to poverty.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
What they want are implements

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
to increase their production:

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
something to fertilize the soil,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
We cannot just think that small-scale

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
is the solution to the world food problem.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160
It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
if you want to afford it.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
In fact we do not want this poor woman

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
to work the land like this.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
If we say just small-scale production,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
as is the tendency here,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
to go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
cannot even eat oranges anymore

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
because in Scandinavia we don't have oranges.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
So local food production is out.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
But also we do not want

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
to relegate to poverty in the rural areas.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
And we do not want to relegate

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
the urban poor to starvation.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
So we must find other solutions.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
One of our problems is that world food production

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
needs to increase very rapidly --

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
doubling by about 2030.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
The main driver of that is actually meat.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
And meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.160
is what drives the prices of cereals.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.160
That need for animal protein is going to continue.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
We can discuss alternatives in another talk, perhaps one day,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
but this is our driving force.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
So what can we do?

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.160
Can we find a solution to produce more?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160
Yes. But we need mechanization.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
And I'm making a real plea here.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.160
I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
150,000 times, just to plant a crop and weed it.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
You cannot ask people to work under these conditions.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
We need clever low-key mechanization

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.160
that avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we've had.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
So what can we do?

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
We must feed three billion people in cities.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
We will not do that through small farmers' markets

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.160
because these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
They have low incomes. And they benefit

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
from cheap, affordable, safe and diverse food.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160
That's what we must aim for in the next 20 to 30 years.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
But yes there are some solutions.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.160
And let me just do one simple conceptual thing:

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160
if I plot science as a proxy

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
for control of the production process and scale.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
What you see is that we've started

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.160
which was sort of small-scale and low-control.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.160
We've moved towards large-scale and very high control.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.160
What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
but go to a kind of regional scale --

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
not just in terms of the scale of the fields,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
but in terms of the entire food network.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
That's where we should move.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
And the ultimate may be, but it doesn't apply to cereals,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
that we have entirely closed ecosystems --

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.160
the horticultural systems right at the top left-hand corner.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160
So we need to think differently about agriculture science.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
Agriculture science for most people -- and there are not many farmers

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
among you here --

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.160
has this name of being bad,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
of being about pollution, about large-scale,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
about the destruction of the environment.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
That is not necessary.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
We need more science and not less. And we need good science.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
So what kind of science can we have?

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
Well first of all I think

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
we can do much better on the existing technologies.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160
Use biotechnology where useful,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
particularly in pest and disease resistance.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
There are also robots, for example,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
who can recognize weeds

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.160
with a resolution of half an inch.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
We have much cleverer irrigation.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.160
We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
And we need to think very dispassionately

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.160
about the comparative advantages

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
of small-scale and large-scale.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
We need to think that land is multi-functional.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
It has different functions.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
There are different ways in which we must use it --

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
for residential, for nature, for agriculture purposes.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
And we also need to re-examine livestock.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
Go regional and go to urban food systems.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.160
I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
I want to have horticulture

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.160
and greenhouses on top of residential areas.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.160
And I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
and from the fermentation of crops

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
to heat our residential areas.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
There are all kinds of ways we can do it.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
We cannot solve the world food problem

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.160
by using biological agriculture.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
But we can do a lot more.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
And the main thing that I would really ask all of you

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160
as you go back to your countries, or as you stay here:

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.160
ask your government for an integrated food policy.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
Food is as important as energy,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160
as security, as the environment.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.160
Everything is linked together.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.160
So we can do that. In fact in a densely populated country

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.160
like the River Delta, where I live in the Netherlands,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
we have combined these functions.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
So this is not science fiction. We can combine things

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
even in a social sense of making

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.160
the rural areas more accessible to people --

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.160
to house, for example, the chronically sick.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
There is all kinds of things we can do.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
But there is something you must do. It's not enough for me to say,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
"Let's get more bold science into agriculture."

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
You must go back

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
and think about your own food chain.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
Talk to farmers. When was the last time

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
you went to a farm and talked to a farmer?

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
Talk to people in restaurants.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
Understand where you are in the food chain,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
where your food comes from.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
Understand that you are part

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.160
of this enormous chain of events.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.160
And that frees you up to do other things.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.160
And above all, to me, food is about respect.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
It's about understanding, when you eat,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.160
that there are also many people who are still in this situation,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.160
who are still struggling for their daily food.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
to think that doing everything by hand

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
is going to be the solution,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
is really not morally justified.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
We need to help to lift them out of poverty.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.160
We need to make them proud of being a farmer

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160
because they allow us to survive.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
Never before, as I said,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.160
has the responsibility for food

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.160
been in the hands of so few.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
And never before have we had the luxury

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
of taking it for granted

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
because it is now so cheap.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
And I think there is nobody else who has expressed

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.160
better, to me, the idea that food, in the end,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160
in our own tradition, is something holy.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
It's not about nutrients and calories.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.160
It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.160
Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi,

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.160
75 years ago, when he spoke about bread.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.160
He did not speak about rice, in India. He said,

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.160
"To those who have to go without two meals a day,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160
God can only appear as bread."

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.160
And so as I'm finishing my bread here --

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.160
and I've been baking it, and I'll try not to burn my hands.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.160
Let me share

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.160
with those of you here in the first row.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.160
Let me share some of the food with you.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.160
Take some of my bread.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.160
And as you eat it, and as you try it --

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.160
please come and stand up.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
Have some of it.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.160
I want you to think that every bite connects you

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160
to the past and the future:

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
to these anonymous farmers,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.160
that first bred the first wheat varieties;

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
and to the farmers of today,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.160
who've been making this. And you don't even know who they are.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
Every meal you eat

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.160
contains ingredients from all across the world.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.160
Everything makes us so privileged,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.160
that we can eat this food, that we don't struggle every day.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160
And that, I think,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.160
evolutionarily-speaking is unique.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.160
We've never had that before.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.160
So enjoy your bread.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.160
Eat it, and feel privileged.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.160
Thank you very much.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:54.160
(Applause)
