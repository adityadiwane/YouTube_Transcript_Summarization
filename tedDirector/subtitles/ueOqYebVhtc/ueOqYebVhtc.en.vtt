00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.212
You know, my favorite part of being a dad

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:21.471
is the movies I get to watch.

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:23.352
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:25.948
and when my daughter was four,

00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:28.838
we got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.

00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:32.237
It totally dominated her imagination for months.

00:00:32.237 --> 00:00:35.455
Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:37.515
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:39.169
and carry a wand.

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:41.578
But you watch that movie enough times,

00:00:41.578 --> 00:00:43.011
and you start to realize how unusual it is.

00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:45.863
Now we live today, and are raising our children,

00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:52.213
in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.

00:00:52.213 --> 00:00:53.958
But "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.145
It did not start that trend.

00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:59.567
Forty years later was when the trend really caught on,

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:01.916
with, interestingly, another movie

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:04.051
that featured a metal guy

00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:05.435
and a furry guy

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:10.646
rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards.

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:13.087
Do you know what I'm talking about? (Laughter)

00:01:13.087 --> 00:01:14.562
Yeah.

00:01:14.562 --> 00:01:18.285
Now, there's a big difference between these two movies,

00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:20.322
a couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz"

00:01:20.322 --> 00:01:21.255
and all the movies we watch today.

00:01:21.255 --> 00:01:24.560
One is there's very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz."

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.805
The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.

00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:33.412
But I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today,

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:37.838
the wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz

00:01:37.838 --> 00:01:39.600
that the prophecy foretold.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.674
Use your magic slippers to defeat

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:45.287
the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."

00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:46.939
But that's not how it happens.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.341
Another thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz"

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:52.644
to me is that all of the most heroic

00:01:52.644 --> 00:01:55.974
and wise and even villainous characters

00:01:55.974 --> 00:01:59.486
are female.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.600
Now I started to notice this

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.745
when I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter,

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:07.281
which was years later, and the situation was different.

00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:10.420
At that point I also had a son.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.147
He was only three at the time.

00:02:12.147 --> 00:02:16.293
He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.

00:02:16.293 --> 00:02:17.614
But he was the second child,

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:21.387
and the level of supervision had plummeted. (Laughter)

00:02:21.387 --> 00:02:25.001
So he wandered in,

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:29.030
and it imprinted on him

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.672
like a mommy duck does to its duckling,

00:02:34.672 --> 00:02:38.451
and I don't think he understands what's going on,

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:41.978
but he is sure soaking in it.

00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:43.347
And I wonder what he's soaking in.

00:02:43.347 --> 00:02:45.825
Is he picking up on the themes of courage

00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:47.942
and perseverance and loyalty?

00:02:47.942 --> 00:02:50.922
Is he picking up on the fact that Luke

00:02:50.922 --> 00:02:55.816
joins an army to overthrow the government?

00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:57.472
Is he picking up on the fact that

00:02:57.472 --> 00:03:00.575
there are only boys in the universe

00:03:00.575 --> 00:03:03.764
except for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess,

00:03:03.764 --> 00:03:08.214
who's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie

00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:11.443
so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink

00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:13.996
to thank him for saving the universe, which he does

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:17.222
by the magic that he was born with?

00:03:17.222 --> 00:03:20.188
Compare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz."

00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:22.817
How does Dorothy win her movie?

00:03:22.817 --> 00:03:25.767
By making friends with everybody

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:27.544
and being a leader.

00:03:27.544 --> 00:03:30.850
That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in --

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.740
Oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.643
which is where we kind of have to be.

00:03:36.643 --> 00:03:40.423
Why is there so much Force -- capital F, Force --

00:03:40.423 --> 00:03:42.110
in the movies we have for our kids,

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.555
and so little yellow brick road?

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:47.972
There is a lot of great writing about the impact

00:03:47.972 --> 00:03:52.219
that the boy-violent movie has on girls,

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.837
and you should do that reading. It's very good.

00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:59.711
I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.

00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:02.261
I know from my own experience that

00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:07.886
Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context

00:04:07.886 --> 00:04:12.015
that I could have used in navigating the adult world

00:04:12.015 --> 00:04:16.616
that is co-ed. (Laughter)

00:04:16.616 --> 00:04:19.806
I think there was a first-kiss moment

00:04:19.806 --> 00:04:23.137
when I really expected the credits to start rolling

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:25.940
because that's the end of the movie, right?

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.237
I finished my quest, I got the girl.

00:04:28.237 --> 00:04:31.368
Why are you still standing there?

00:04:31.368 --> 00:04:32.813
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

00:04:32.813 --> 00:04:36.001
The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain

00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:38.589
and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:41.480
for other relationships and other journeys.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.719
It's almost as though if you're a boy,

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:45.800
you are a dopey animal,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.274
and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.

00:04:50.274 --> 00:04:52.462
There are plenty of exceptions,

00:04:52.462 --> 00:04:57.759
and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.811
But they do send a message to boys,

00:05:00.811 --> 00:05:03.317
that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.

00:05:03.317 --> 00:05:05.759
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.131
how to defend against the patriarchy,

00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:11.096
but they are not necessarily showing boys

00:05:11.096 --> 00:05:13.930
how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.070
There's no models for them.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.343
And we also have some terrific women

00:05:19.343 --> 00:05:21.480
who are writing new stories for our kids,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.222
and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are,

00:05:26.222 --> 00:05:28.348
these are still war movies.

00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:32.456
And, of course, the most successful studio of all time

00:05:32.456 --> 00:05:36.586
continues to crank out classic after classic,

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.330
every single one of them about

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.100
the journey of a boy, or a man,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.744
or two men who are friends, or a man and his son,

00:05:46.744 --> 00:05:50.339
or two men who are raising a little girl.

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:54.079
Until, as many of you are thinking, this year,

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:55.805
when they finally came out with "Brave."

00:05:55.805 --> 00:05:59.812
I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.

00:05:59.812 --> 00:06:03.706
Do you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out?

00:06:03.706 --> 00:06:08.114
"Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie."

00:06:08.114 --> 00:06:10.235
It's very good. Don't let that stop you.

00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:14.127
Now, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.

00:06:14.127 --> 00:06:15.313
I don't know if you've heard of this.

00:06:15.313 --> 00:06:18.135
It has not yet caught on and caught fire,

00:06:18.135 --> 00:06:20.216
but maybe today we will start a movement.

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:22.998
Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist,

00:06:22.998 --> 00:06:28.104
and back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation

00:06:28.104 --> 00:06:31.678
she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.

00:06:31.678 --> 00:06:34.664
And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask:

00:06:34.664 --> 00:06:37.174
Is there more than one character in the movie

00:06:37.174 --> 00:06:40.775
that is female who has lines?

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:43.355
So try to meet that bar.

00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:49.015
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?

00:06:49.015 --> 00:06:52.468
And is their conversation about something other than

00:06:52.468 --> 00:06:55.784
the guy that they both like? (Laughter)

00:06:55.784 --> 00:07:00.116
Right? Thank you. (Applause)

00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:01.941
Thank you very much.

00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:09.544
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.

00:07:09.544 --> 00:07:14.674
It does happen. I've seen it,

00:07:14.674 --> 00:07:17.622
and yet I very rarely see it in the movies

00:07:17.622 --> 00:07:18.789
that we know and love.

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.949
In fact, this week I went to see

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:24.563
a very high-quality movie, "Argo."

00:07:24.563 --> 00:07:28.222
Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office,

00:07:28.222 --> 00:07:32.506
a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.

00:07:32.506 --> 00:07:35.190
It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.997
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie,

00:07:38.997 --> 00:07:40.578
I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie

00:07:40.578 --> 00:07:44.036
takes place in this embassy where men and women

00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:46.713
are hiding out during the hostage crisis.

00:07:46.713 --> 00:07:48.602
We've got quite a few scenes of the men

00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:52.763
having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout,

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:56.779
and the great moment for one of the actresses is

00:07:56.779 --> 00:08:01.901
to peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?"

00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:03.902
That's Hollywood for you.

00:08:03.902 --> 00:08:06.347
So let's look at the numbers.

00:08:06.347 --> 00:08:09.909
2011, of the 100 most popular movies,

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:14.154
how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?

00:08:14.154 --> 00:08:17.448
Eleven. It's not bad.

00:08:17.448 --> 00:08:21.143
It's not as many percent as the number of women

00:08:21.143 --> 00:08:24.269
we've just elected to Congress, so that's good.

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:27.273
But there is a number that is greater than this

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:29.930
that's going to bring this room down.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.592
Last year, The New York Times published a study

00:08:33.592 --> 00:08:35.251
that the government had done.

00:08:35.251 --> 00:08:36.639
Here's what it said.

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:40.855
One out of five women in America

00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:47.108
say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life.

00:08:47.108 --> 00:08:50.892
Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.

00:08:50.892 --> 00:08:55.175
I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that.

00:08:55.175 --> 00:08:56.953
I don't even think that

00:08:56.953 --> 00:09:00.508
music videos or pornography are really directly related to that,

00:09:00.508 --> 00:09:03.273
but something is going wrong,

00:09:03.273 --> 00:09:06.324
and when I hear that statistic,

00:09:06.324 --> 00:09:08.829
one of the things I think of is

00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:12.954
that's a lot of sexual assailants.

00:09:12.954 --> 00:09:16.314
Who are these guys? What are they learning?

00:09:16.314 --> 00:09:18.030
What are they failing to learn?

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.180
Are they absorbing the story that

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.707
a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence

00:09:24.707 --> 00:09:27.240
and then collect the reward, which is a woman

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.288
who has no friends and doesn't speak?

00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:37.493
Are we soaking up that story?

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:39.839
You know,

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:42.606
as a parent with the privilege

00:09:42.606 --> 00:09:45.250
of raising a daughter

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.119
like all of you who are doing the same thing,

00:09:48.119 --> 00:09:51.899
we find this world and this statistic very alarming

00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:53.036
and we want to prepare them.

00:09:53.036 --> 00:09:57.322
We have tools at our disposal like "girl power,"

00:09:57.322 --> 00:10:00.056
and we hope that that will help,

00:10:00.056 --> 00:10:03.665
but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:06.263
if, at the same time, actively or passively,

00:10:06.263 --> 00:10:11.216
we are training our sons to maintain their boy power?

00:10:11.216 --> 00:10:14.614
I mean, I think the Netflix queue

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.870
is one way that we can do something very important,

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.925
and I'm talking mainly to the dads here.

00:10:20.925 --> 00:10:23.775
I think we have got to show our sons

00:10:23.775 --> 00:10:25.631
a new definition of manhood.

00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:30.151
The definition of manhood is already turning upside down.

00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:32.282
You've read about how the new economy

00:10:32.282 --> 00:10:35.683
is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.

00:10:35.683 --> 00:10:37.337
They're throwing it up in the air.

00:10:37.337 --> 00:10:39.955
So our sons are going to have to find some way

00:10:39.955 --> 00:10:42.930
of adapting to this, some new relationship with each other,

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.777
and I think we really have to show them, and model for them,

00:10:46.777 --> 00:10:50.478
how a real man

00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:54.247
is someone who trusts his sisters

00:10:54.247 --> 00:10:57.420
and respects them, and wants to be on their team,

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.043
and stands up against the real bad guys,

00:11:01.043 --> 00:11:04.899
who are the men who want to abuse the women.

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:07.950
And I think our job in the Netflix queue

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.719
is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test,

00:11:11.719 --> 00:11:16.000
if we can find them, and to seek out the heroines

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.586
who are there,

00:11:17.586 --> 00:11:21.375
who show real courage, who bring people together,

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:24.963
and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines

00:11:24.963 --> 00:11:28.448
and to say, "I want to be on their team,"

00:11:28.448 --> 00:11:33.030
because they're going to be on their team.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.724
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars,"

00:11:36.724 --> 00:11:38.753
do you know what she said?

00:11:38.753 --> 00:11:41.256
Obi-Wan.

00:11:41.256 --> 00:11:45.153
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.

00:11:45.153 --> 00:11:48.620
What do these two have in common?

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.544
Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress.

00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:54.171
I think these people are experts.

00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:55.697
I think these are the two people in the movie

00:11:55.697 --> 00:11:57.265
who know more than anybody else,

00:11:57.265 --> 00:12:00.592
and they love sharing their knowledge with other people

00:12:00.592 --> 00:12:03.696
to help them reach their potential.

00:12:03.696 --> 00:12:05.704
Now, they are leaders.

00:12:05.704 --> 00:12:07.922
I like that kind of quest for my daughter,

00:12:07.922 --> 00:12:10.109
and I like that kind of quest for my son.

00:12:10.109 --> 00:12:12.020
I want more quests like that.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.620
I want fewer quests where my son is told,

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.831
"Go out and fight it alone,"

00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:22.036
and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team,

00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:26.136
maybe a team led by women,

00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:31.756
to help other people become better

00:12:31.756 --> 00:12:34.148
and be better people,

00:12:34.148 --> 00:12:36.430
like the Wizard of Oz.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:49.739
Thank you.
