00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:55.379
(Hammer)

00:00:58.444 --> 00:01:02.478
(Laughter)

00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:25.260
(Microwave beeps) (Laughter)

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.981
You probably all agree with me

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:35.756
that this is a very nice road.

00:01:35.756 --> 00:01:37.915
It's made of asphalt,

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:41.149
and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on,

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.283
but not always, especially not on these days as today,

00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:47.134
when it's raining a lot.

00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:50.082
Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt.

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:52.376
And especially if you then ride with your bicycle,

00:01:52.376 --> 00:01:56.321
and pass these cars, then that's not very nice.

00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:59.431
Also, asphalt can create a lot of noise.

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:01.045
It's a noisy material,

00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:03.489
and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands,

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.621
very close to cities, then we would like a silent road.

00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:10.890
The solution for that is to make roads

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.067
out of porous asphalt.

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:15.058
Porous asphalt, a material that we use now

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:18.017
in most of the highways in the Netherlands,

00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:21.461
it has pores and water can just rain through it,

00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:24.362
so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides,

00:02:24.362 --> 00:02:26.451
and you have a road that's easy to drive on,

00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:28.381
so no splash water anymore.

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.543
Also the noise will disappear in these pores.

00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:34.566
Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear,

00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:37.154
so it's a very silent road.

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:40.699
It also has disadvantages, of course,

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.861
and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur.

00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:47.786
What is raveling? You see that in this road

00:02:47.786 --> 00:02:50.407
that the stones at the surface come off.

00:02:50.407 --> 00:02:55.685
First you get one stone, then several more,

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:57.427
and more and more and more and more,

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.994
and then they -- well, I will not do that. (Laughter)

00:03:00.994 --> 00:03:03.908
But they can damage your windshield,

00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:05.698
so you're not happy with that.

00:03:05.698 --> 00:03:09.688
And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage.

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:12.304
Sometimes you can create potholes with that.

00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:16.365
Ha. He's ready.

00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:19.550
Potholes, of course, that can become a problem,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.093
but we have a solution.

00:03:21.093 --> 00:03:24.351
Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material.

00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:26.351
It's a porous asphalt, like I said, so you have only

00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:29.123
a small amount of binder between the stones.

00:03:29.123 --> 00:03:32.442
Due to weathering, due to U.V. light, due to oxidation,

00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:35.170
this binder, this bitumen,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.843
the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink,

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.788
and if it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks,

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:41.510
and it delaminates from the aggregates.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.070
Then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates --

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.066
what we just saw here.

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:50.880
To solve this problem, we thought of self-healing materials.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.541
If we can make this material self-healing,

00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:56.734
then probably we have a solution.

00:03:56.734 --> 00:04:01.328
So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans,

00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:04.813
and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces,

00:04:04.813 --> 00:04:08.717
and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen.

00:04:08.717 --> 00:04:10.462
So then you have asphalt

00:04:10.462 --> 00:04:13.529
with very small pieces of steel wool in it.

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.320
Then you need a machine, like you see here,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.459
that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.508
Induction can heat, especially steel; it's very good at that.

00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:26.190
Then what you do is you heat up the steel,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.681
you melt the bitumen,

00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:30.247
and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks,

00:04:30.247 --> 00:04:33.454
and the stones are again fixed to the surface.

00:04:33.454 --> 00:04:37.416
Today I use a microwave because I cannot take

00:04:37.416 --> 00:04:39.653
the big induction machine here onstage.

00:04:39.653 --> 00:04:42.533
So a microwave is a similar system.

00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:46.178
So I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out

00:04:46.178 --> 00:04:49.430
to see what happened.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.923
So this is the specimen coming out now.

00:04:51.923 --> 00:04:56.316
So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:58.588
to heat up the specimens.

00:04:58.588 --> 00:05:00.678
We tested a lot of specimens there,

00:05:00.678 --> 00:05:03.853
and then the government, they actually saw our results,

00:05:03.853 --> 00:05:07.803
and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that."

00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:10.119
So they donated to us a piece of highway,

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:13.606
400 meters of the A58, where we had to make

00:05:13.606 --> 00:05:16.116
a test track to test this material.

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:19.648
So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road,

00:05:19.648 --> 00:05:24.146
and then of course this road will last several years

00:05:24.146 --> 00:05:27.434
without any damage. That's what we know from practice.

00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:30.213
So we took a lot of samples from this road

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:32.482
and we tested them in the lab.

00:05:32.482 --> 00:05:35.399
So we did aging on the samples,

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:39.011
did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine,

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:41.837
and healed them and tested them again.

00:05:41.837 --> 00:05:43.741
Several times we can repeat that.

00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:45.966
So actually, the conclusion from this research is that

00:05:45.966 --> 00:05:49.284
if we go on the road every four years

00:05:49.284 --> 00:05:52.164
with our healing machine -- this is the big version

00:05:52.164 --> 00:05:54.069
we have made to go on the real road --

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.939
if we go on the road every four years

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:59.689
we can double the surface life of this road,

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:01.866
which of course saves a lot of money.

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:04.043
Well, to conclude, I can say

00:06:04.043 --> 00:06:06.799
that we made a material

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:10.579
using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers,

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.088
using induction energy to really

00:06:13.088 --> 00:06:15.755
increase the surface life of the road,

00:06:15.755 --> 00:06:17.505
double the surface life you can even do,

00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:21.169
so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.642
And now you're of course curious if it also worked.

00:06:24.642 --> 00:06:27.745
So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm.

00:06:27.745 --> 00:06:30.324
Actually, it still has to cool down first

00:06:30.324 --> 00:06:32.664
before I can show you that the healing works.

00:06:32.664 --> 00:06:35.532
But I will do a trial.

00:06:35.532 --> 00:06:38.291
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.

00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:39.641
Thank you.

00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:45.057
(Applause)
