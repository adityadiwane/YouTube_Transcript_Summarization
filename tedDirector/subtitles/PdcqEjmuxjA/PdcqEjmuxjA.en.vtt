00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.254
I'm going to take you
on a journey very quickly.

00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:30.127
To explain the wish, I'm going
to have to take you somewhere

00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:32.980
where many people haven't been,
and that's around the world.

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:37.113
When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr
and myself started an organization

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:40.777
to get architects and designers
involved in humanitarian work,

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.444
not only about responding
to natural disasters,

00:00:43.468 --> 00:00:45.222
but involved in systemic issues.

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:51.015
We believe that where the resources
and expertise are scarce,

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.785
innovative, sustainable design can really
make a difference in people's lives.

00:00:57.118 --> 00:01:02.019
So I started my life as an architect,
or training as an architect,

00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:05.460
and I was always interested
in socially responsible design,

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:07.376
and how you can really make an impact.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.346
But when I went to architecture school,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.321
it seemed that I was
a black sheep in the family.

00:01:12.345 --> 00:01:15.012
Many architects seemed to think
that when you design,

00:01:15.036 --> 00:01:18.817
you design a jewel, and it's a jewel
that you try and crave for;

00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:20.778
whereas I felt that when you design,

00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:23.457
you either improve
or you create a detriment

00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:25.544
to the community
in which you're designing.

00:01:25.568 --> 00:01:28.076
So you're not just doing
a building for the residents

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.679
or for the people who are going to use it,
but for the community as a whole.

00:01:31.703 --> 00:01:38.129
And in 1999, we started by responding
to the issue of the housing crisis

00:01:38.153 --> 00:01:40.164
for returning refugees in Kosovo.

00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:43.800
And I didn't know what I was doing --
like I said, mid-20s --

00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:48.373
and I'm the Internet generation,
so we started a website.

00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:51.886
We put a call out there,
and to my surprise, in a couple of months,

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.244
we had hundreds of entries
from around the world.

00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:57.305
That led to a number
of prototypes being built

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.576
and really experimenting with some ideas.

00:02:00.272 --> 00:02:02.403
Two years later we started doing a project

00:02:02.427 --> 00:02:06.061
on developing mobile health clinics
in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:08.636
responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

00:02:10.418 --> 00:02:16.802
That led to 550 entries from 53 countries.

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:21.576
We also have designers
from around the world that participate.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.246
And we had an exhibit
of work that followed that.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.684
2004 was the tipping point for us.

00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:29.729
We started responding to natural disasters

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:32.374
and getting involved in Iran, in Bam,

00:02:32.398 --> 00:02:35.098
also following up on our work in Africa.

00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:36.970
Working within the United States --

00:02:36.994 --> 00:02:40.065
most people look at poverty
and they see the face of a foreigner.

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.163
But I live in Bozeman, Montana --

00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:44.405
go up to the north plains
on the reservations,

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.854
or go down to Alabama
or Mississippi, pre-Katrina,

00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:50.910
and I could have shown you
places that have far worse conditions

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:53.240
than many developing countries
that I've been to.

00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:56.752
So we got involved in and worked
in inner cities and elsewhere;

00:02:56.776 --> 00:03:00.193
and also, I will go into
some more projects.

00:03:00.217 --> 00:03:03.111
2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass.

00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:07.888
I think we can pretty much assume
that 2005 was a horrific year

00:03:07.912 --> 00:03:09.579
when it comes to natural disasters.

00:03:09.603 --> 00:03:11.093
And because of the Internet,

00:03:11.117 --> 00:03:14.506
and because of connections
to blogs and so forth,

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.982
within literally hours of the tsunami,
we were already raising funds,

00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:22.065
getting involved, working
with people on the ground.

00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:25.788
We run from a couple of laptops,
and in the first couple of days,

00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:28.575
I had 4,000 emails
from people needing help.

00:03:28.915 --> 00:03:31.788
So we began to get involved
in projects there,

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:33.426
and I'll talk about some others.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.421
And then of course, this year
we've been responding to Katrina,

00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:38.889
as well as following up
on our reconstruction work.

00:03:38.913 --> 00:03:40.624
So this is a brief overview.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.017
In 2004, I really couldn't manage
the number of people who wanted to help,

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.146
or the number of requests
that I was getting.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.701
It was all coming
into my laptop and cell phone.

00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:56.098
So we decided to embrace
an open-source model of business --

00:03:56.122 --> 00:03:59.289
so that anyone, anywhere in the world,
could start a local chapter,

00:03:59.313 --> 00:04:01.379
and they can get involved
in local problems.

00:04:01.403 --> 00:04:03.814
Because I believe there
is no such thing as Utopia.

00:04:03.838 --> 00:04:06.410
All problems are local.
All solutions are local.

00:04:06.434 --> 00:04:11.068
So that means, you know,
somebody who's based in Mississippi

00:04:11.092 --> 00:04:13.445
knows more about Mississippi than I do.

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:19.576
So what happened is, we used Meetup
and all these other Internet tools,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.891
and we ended up having
40 chapters starting up,

00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:26.706
thousands of architects in 104 countries.

00:04:28.008 --> 00:04:31.449
So the bullet point --
sorry, I never do a suit,

00:04:31.473 --> 00:04:33.868
so I knew that I was going
to take this off.

00:04:33.892 --> 00:04:36.195
OK, because I'm going to do it very quick.

00:04:38.203 --> 00:04:40.226
This isn't just about nonprofit.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.424
What it showed me is that
there's a grassroots movement going on,

00:04:43.448 --> 00:04:46.022
of socially responsible designers
who really believe

00:04:46.046 --> 00:04:49.958
that this world has got a lot smaller,
and that we have the opportunity --

00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:52.138
not the responsibility,
but the opportunity --

00:04:52.162 --> 00:04:54.475
to really get involved in making change.

00:04:56.665 --> 00:04:59.747
(Laughter)

00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:05.965
(Laughter)

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:07.788
I'm adding that to my time.

00:05:07.812 --> 00:05:10.613
(Laughter)

00:05:10.637 --> 00:05:12.576
So what you don't know is,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.624
we've got these thousands of designers
working around the world,

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:18.679
connected basically by a website,
and we have a staff of three.

00:05:19.504 --> 00:05:23.918
The fact that nobody told us
we couldn't do it, we did it.

00:05:23.942 --> 00:05:26.290
And so there's something
to be said about naïveté.

00:05:26.314 --> 00:05:28.211
So seven years later, we've developed

00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:31.649
so that we've got advocacy,
instigation and implementation.

00:05:31.673 --> 00:05:35.318
We advocate for good design,
not only through student workshops

00:05:35.342 --> 00:05:37.664
and lectures and public forums, op-eds;

00:05:37.688 --> 00:05:39.909
we have a book on humanitarian work;

00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:43.116
but also disaster mitigation
and dealing with public policy.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.354
We can talk about FEMA,
but that's another talk.

00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:50.396
Instigation, developing ideas
with communities and NGOs,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.248
doing open-source design competitions.

00:05:53.272 --> 00:05:55.780
Referring, matchmaking with communities.

00:05:55.804 --> 00:05:59.111
And then implementing -- actually
going out there and doing the work,

00:05:59.135 --> 00:06:04.869
because when you invent,
it's never a reality until it's built.

00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:08.079
So it's really important
that if we're designing

00:06:08.103 --> 00:06:10.777
and trying to create change,
we build that change.

00:06:10.801 --> 00:06:12.861
So here's a select number of projects.

00:06:14.464 --> 00:06:15.686
Kosovo.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.342
This is Kosovo in '99.

00:06:18.707 --> 00:06:21.557
We did an open design
competition, like I said.

00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:23.975
It led to a whole variety of ideas.

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:25.917
And this wasn't about emergency shelter,

00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:29.463
but transitional shelter
that would last five to 10 years,

00:06:29.487 --> 00:06:33.496
that would be placed next to the land
the resident lived in,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.647
and that they would rebuild
their own home.

00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:38.349
This wasn't imposing
an architecture on a community;

00:06:38.373 --> 00:06:41.495
this was giving them
the tools and the space

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:45.208
to allow them to rebuild and regrow
the way they want to.

00:06:46.287 --> 00:06:49.207
We had from the sublime
to the ridiculous, but they worked.

00:06:49.231 --> 00:06:53.831
This is an inflatable hemp house.
It was built; it works.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.515
This is a shipping container.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.340
Built and works.

00:06:59.364 --> 00:07:00.714
And a whole variety of ideas

00:07:00.738 --> 00:07:04.245
that not only dealt with
architectural building,

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:05.943
but also the issues of governance,

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:09.378
and the idea of creating communities
through complex networks.

00:07:09.402 --> 00:07:11.224
So we've engaged not just designers,

00:07:11.248 --> 00:07:16.773
but also a whole variety
of technology-based professionals.

00:07:16.797 --> 00:07:20.404
Using rubble from destroyed homes
to create new homes.

00:07:20.428 --> 00:07:26.282
Using straw bale construction,
creating heat walls.

00:07:26.734 --> 00:07:28.902
And then something remarkable
happened in '99.

00:07:28.926 --> 00:07:32.699
We went to Africa originally
to look at the housing issue.

00:07:33.048 --> 00:07:35.835
Within three days, we realized
the problem was not housing;

00:07:35.859 --> 00:07:38.565
it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.823
And it wasn't doctors telling us this;

00:07:40.847 --> 00:07:43.514
it was actual villagers
that we were staying with.

00:07:43.871 --> 00:07:46.483
And so we came up with the bright idea

00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:50.702
that instead of getting people to walk
10, 15 kilometers to see doctors,

00:07:50.726 --> 00:07:52.565
you get the doctors to the people.

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:55.457
And we started engaging
the medical community,

00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:58.584
and you know, we thought
we were real bright sparks --

00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:00.354
"We've come up with this great idea:

00:08:00.378 --> 00:08:04.960
mobile health clinics, widely distributed
throughout sub-Saharan Africa."

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:07.793
And the medical community there said,

00:08:07.817 --> 00:08:10.283
"We've said this for the last decade.

00:08:10.307 --> 00:08:13.385
We know this. We just don't know
how to show this."

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:18.653
So in a way, we had taken pre-existing
needs and shown solutions.

00:08:19.177 --> 00:08:23.134
And so again, we had a whole variety
of ideas that came in.

00:08:24.173 --> 00:08:26.016
This one I personally love,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.341
because the idea is that architecture
is not just about solutions,

00:08:29.365 --> 00:08:31.044
but about raising awareness.

00:08:31.068 --> 00:08:33.482
This is a kenaf clinic.

00:08:33.506 --> 00:08:36.576
You get seed and you grow it
in a plot of land,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.269
and it grows 14 feet in a month.

00:08:40.293 --> 00:08:43.445
And on the fourth week, the doctors
come and they mow out an area,

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:45.548
put a tensile structure on the top,

00:08:45.572 --> 00:08:48.244
and when the doctors
have finished treating

00:08:48.268 --> 00:08:51.989
and seeing patients and villagers,

00:08:52.013 --> 00:08:53.885
you cut down the clinic and you eat it.

00:08:53.909 --> 00:08:55.576
It's an eat-your-own-clinic.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.954
So it's dealing with the fact
that if you have AIDS,

00:08:58.978 --> 00:09:00.922
you also need to have nutrition rates,

00:09:00.946 --> 00:09:03.802
and the idea of nutrition is as important

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:05.660
as getting antiretrovirals out there.

00:09:05.684 --> 00:09:08.172
So you know, this is a serious solution.

00:09:09.043 --> 00:09:10.199
This one I love.

00:09:10.223 --> 00:09:13.048
The idea is it's not just a clinic,
it's a community center.

00:09:13.072 --> 00:09:15.095
This looked at setting up trade routes

00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:17.184
and economic engines within the community,

00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:19.422
so it can be a self-sustaining project.

00:09:19.446 --> 00:09:21.763
Every one of these projects
is sustainable.

00:09:22.176 --> 00:09:25.480
That's not because
I'm a tree-hugging green person.

00:09:25.504 --> 00:09:27.828
It's because when you live
on four dollars a day,

00:09:27.852 --> 00:09:30.875
you're living on survival
and you have to be sustainable.

00:09:31.227 --> 00:09:33.577
You have to know where
your energy is coming from,

00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:36.053
you have to know where
your resource is coming from,

00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:38.091
and you have to keep the maintenance down.

00:09:38.115 --> 00:09:40.203
So this is about getting
an economic engine,

00:09:40.227 --> 00:09:42.520
and then at night,
it turns into a movie theater.

00:09:42.544 --> 00:09:47.671
So it's not an AIDS clinic.
It's a community center.

00:09:47.695 --> 00:09:49.195
So you can see ideas.

00:09:49.909 --> 00:09:52.576
And these ideas developed into prototypes,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.391
and they were eventually built.

00:09:54.415 --> 00:09:55.922
And currently, as of this year,

00:09:55.946 --> 00:10:00.207
there are clinics rolling out
in Nigeria and Kenya.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:05.539
From that, we also developed Siyathemba.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.224
The community came to us and said,

00:10:07.248 --> 00:10:10.271
"The problem is that the girls
don't have education."

00:10:10.295 --> 00:10:11.645
And we're working in an area

00:10:11.669 --> 00:10:13.898
where young women
between the ages of 16 and 24

00:10:13.922 --> 00:10:16.198
have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate.

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:20.079
And that's not
because they're promiscuous,

00:10:20.103 --> 00:10:21.753
it's because there's no knowledge.

00:10:21.777 --> 00:10:24.776
And so we decided to look
at the idea of sports,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.642
and create a youth sports center

00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:29.464
that doubled as an HIV/AIDS
outreach center,

00:10:29.488 --> 00:10:33.321
and the coaches of the girls' team
were also trained doctors.

00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:40.156
So that there would be a very slow way
of developing confidence in health care.

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:42.959
And we picked nine finalists,

00:10:42.983 --> 00:10:46.792
and then those nine finalists were
distributed throughout the entire region,

00:10:46.816 --> 00:10:48.943
and then the community
picked their design.

00:10:48.967 --> 00:10:50.895
They said, this is our design,

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:53.219
because it's not only
about engaging a community;

00:10:53.243 --> 00:10:54.937
it's about empowering a community,

00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:58.183
and about getting them to be
a part of the rebuilding process.

00:10:59.738 --> 00:11:02.020
So, the winning design is here.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.663
And then, of course,
we actually go and work

00:11:05.687 --> 00:11:07.370
with the community and the clients.

00:11:07.394 --> 00:11:08.592
So this is the designer.

00:11:08.616 --> 00:11:11.569
He's out there working
with the first ever women's soccer team

00:11:11.593 --> 00:11:14.490
in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.

00:11:14.871 --> 00:11:17.245
And they can tell it better.

00:11:18.014 --> 00:11:20.779
(A cappella singing
in a South African language)

00:11:39.505 --> 00:11:41.490
Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza.

00:11:41.514 --> 00:11:44.460
I work at the Africa Centre,
I'm an IT user consultant.

00:11:44.484 --> 00:11:48.968
I'm also the national football player
for South Africa, Banyana Banyana.

00:11:48.992 --> 00:11:55.727
And I also play in the Vodacom League,
for the team called Tembisa,

00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:57.898
which has now changed to Siyathemba.

00:11:59.061 --> 00:12:01.358
This is our home ground.

00:12:01.712 --> 00:12:05.451
Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that
later because I'm running out of time.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.796
I can see Chris looking at me slyly.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.757
This was a connection,
just a meeting with somebody

00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:15.529
who wanted to develop Africa's first
telemedicine center, in Tanzania.

00:12:15.553 --> 00:12:17.791
And we met, literally,
a couple of months ago.

00:12:17.815 --> 00:12:19.402
We've already developed a design.

00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:21.633
The team is over there,
working in partnership.

00:12:21.657 --> 00:12:24.941
This was a matchmaking,
thanks to a couple of TEDsters --

00:12:24.965 --> 00:12:28.515
Sun [Microsystems],
Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli,

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:30.898
who connected me
with this amazing African woman.

00:12:30.922 --> 00:12:34.442
And we start construction in June,
and it will be opened by TEDGlobal.

00:12:34.466 --> 00:12:36.918
So when you come to TEDGlobal,
you can check it out.

00:12:37.537 --> 00:12:41.563
But what we're known probably most for
is dealing with disasters and development,

00:12:41.587 --> 00:12:43.626
and we've been involved
in a lot of issues,

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:49.837
such as the tsunami
and also things like Hurricane Katrina.

00:12:49.861 --> 00:12:53.477
This is a 370-dollar shelter
that can be easily assembled.

00:12:57.904 --> 00:13:02.880
This is a community-designed
community center.

00:13:02.904 --> 00:13:06.800
And what that means is we actually
live and work with the community,

00:13:06.824 --> 00:13:08.947
and they're part of the design process.

00:13:11.296 --> 00:13:13.834
The kids actually get
involved in mapping out

00:13:13.858 --> 00:13:16.524
where the community center should be.

00:13:16.932 --> 00:13:20.399
And then eventually, the community,
through skills training,

00:13:20.423 --> 00:13:22.540
end up building the building with us.

00:13:22.984 --> 00:13:24.707
Here is another school.

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:29.711
This is what the UN gave these guys
for six months -- 12 plastic tarps.

00:13:30.136 --> 00:13:31.391
This was in August.

00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:34.439
This was the replacement;
that's supposed to last for two years.

00:13:34.463 --> 00:13:36.765
When the rain comes down,
you can't hear a thing,

00:13:36.789 --> 00:13:39.103
and in the summer,
it's about 140 degrees inside.

00:13:39.127 --> 00:13:42.576
So we said, if the rain's coming
down, let's get fresh water.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.630
So every one of our schools
has a rainwater collection system.

00:13:45.654 --> 00:13:52.156
Very low cost: three classrooms
and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.422
This was raised by hot chocolate
sales in Atlanta.

00:13:57.311 --> 00:13:59.236
It's built by the parents of the kids.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.887
The kids are out there on-site,
building the buildings.

00:14:01.911 --> 00:14:03.672
And it opened a couple of weeks ago,

00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:06.275
and there's 600 kids
that are now using the schools.

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:13.103
(Applause)

00:14:13.127 --> 00:14:15.169
So, disaster hits home.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.819
We see the bad stories
on CNN and Fox and all that,

00:14:20.843 --> 00:14:22.627
but we don't see the good stories.

00:14:22.651 --> 00:14:26.770
Here is a community that got together,
and they said "no" to waiting.

00:14:26.794 --> 00:14:30.040
They formed a partnership,
a diverse partnership of players,

00:14:30.064 --> 00:14:32.175
to actually map out East Biloxi,

00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:34.063
to figure out who's getting involved.

00:14:34.087 --> 00:14:38.008
We've had over 1,500 volunteers
rebuilding, rehabbing homes.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.785
Figuring out what FEMA regulations are,

00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:44.634
not waiting for them to dictate
to us how you should rebuild.

00:14:44.658 --> 00:14:45.897
Working with residents,

00:14:45.921 --> 00:14:49.336
getting them out of their homes,
so they don't get ill.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.504
This is what they're
cleaning up on their own.

00:14:52.983 --> 00:14:54.136
Designing housing.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.277
This house is going in
in a couple of weeks.

00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:58.322
This is a rehabbed home,
done in four days.

00:14:59.433 --> 00:15:03.576
This is a utility room
for a woman who is on a walker.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.812
She's 70 years old.
This is what FEMA gave her.

00:15:07.026 --> 00:15:09.639
600 bucks, happened two days ago.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.856
We put together, very quickly, a washroom.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.873
It's built, it's running and she just
started a business today,

00:15:15.897 --> 00:15:17.920
where she's washing
other people's clothes.

00:15:17.944 --> 00:15:21.576
These are the Calhouns.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.592
They're photographers who had documented
the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.

00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:28.866
That was their home,
and these are the photographs they took.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.953
And we're helping, working with them
to create a new building.

00:15:32.533 --> 00:15:33.731
Projects we've done.

00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:36.433
Projects we've been a part of, support.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.983
Why don't aid agencies do this?

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:42.049
This is the UN tent.

00:15:43.406 --> 00:15:46.327
This is the new UN tent,
just introduced this year.

00:15:46.351 --> 00:15:47.830
Quick to assemble.

00:15:47.854 --> 00:15:50.130
It's got a flap -- that's the invention.

00:15:51.426 --> 00:15:55.820
It took 20 years to design this
and get it implemented in the field.

00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:57.602
I was 12 years old.

00:15:58.768 --> 00:16:00.276
There's a problem here.

00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:03.085
Luckily, we're not alone.

00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:06.576
There are hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.576
and hundreds of architects
and designers and inventors

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.060
around the world that are getting
involved in humanitarian work.

00:16:16.234 --> 00:16:19.274
More hemp houses -- it's a theme
in Japan, apparently.

00:16:19.298 --> 00:16:20.933
I'm not sure what they're smoking.

00:16:20.957 --> 00:16:22.567
(Laughter)

00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:27.378
This is a Grip Clip,
designed by somebody who said,

00:16:27.402 --> 00:16:30.409
"All you need is some way
to attach membrane structures

00:16:30.433 --> 00:16:33.729
to physical support beams."

00:16:35.942 --> 00:16:40.718
This guy designed for NASA,
is now doing housing.

00:16:41.314 --> 00:16:43.219
I'm going to whip through this quickly,

00:16:43.243 --> 00:16:45.670
because I know I've got
only a couple of minutes.

00:16:47.165 --> 00:16:49.310
So this is all done in the last two years.

00:16:49.334 --> 00:16:51.961
I showed you something
that took 20 years to do.

00:16:51.985 --> 00:16:54.070
And this is just a selection of things

00:16:54.094 --> 00:16:56.749
that were built
in the last couple of years.

00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:58.999
From Brazil to India,

00:17:00.167 --> 00:17:01.318
Mexico,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.573
Alabama,

00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:07.485
China,

00:17:08.825 --> 00:17:09.979
Israel,

00:17:10.003 --> 00:17:11.153
Palestine,

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:12.973
Vietnam.

00:17:13.306 --> 00:17:17.457
The average age of a designer
who gets involved in this project is 32 --

00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:18.752
that's how old I am.

00:17:18.776 --> 00:17:19.976
So it's a young --

00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:24.597
I just have to stop here,
because Arup is in the room,

00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:26.978
and this is the best-designed
toilet in the world.

00:17:27.002 --> 00:17:30.049
If you're ever, ever in India,
go use this toilet.

00:17:30.073 --> 00:17:31.143
(Laughter)

00:17:31.167 --> 00:17:33.135
Chris Luebkeman will tell you why.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.152
I'm sure that's how he wanted
to spend the party.

00:17:41.548 --> 00:17:44.858
But the future is not going to be
the sky-scraping cities of New York,

00:17:44.882 --> 00:17:46.033
but this.

00:17:46.057 --> 00:17:48.143
And when you look at this, you see crisis.

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:50.834
What I see is many, many inventors.

00:17:51.469 --> 00:17:53.604
One billion people live in abject poverty.

00:17:53.628 --> 00:17:55.272
We hear about them all the time.

00:17:55.296 --> 00:17:58.481
Four billion live in growing
but fragile economies.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.438
One in seven live
in unplanned settlements.

00:18:02.462 --> 00:18:05.612
If we do nothing about the housing crisis
that's about to happen,

00:18:05.636 --> 00:18:09.191
in 20 years, one in three people
will live in an unplanned settlement

00:18:09.215 --> 00:18:10.478
or a refugee camp.

00:18:10.502 --> 00:18:13.215
Look left, look right:
one of you will be there.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.438
How do we improve the living standards
of five billion people?

00:18:17.866 --> 00:18:19.707
With 10 million solutions.

00:18:20.176 --> 00:18:21.879
So I wish to develop a community

00:18:21.903 --> 00:18:25.476
that actively embraces
innovative and sustainable design

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.473
to improve the living
conditions for everyone.

00:18:28.497 --> 00:18:30.815
Chris Anderson: Wait a sec --
that's your wish?

00:18:30.839 --> 00:18:31.990
CS: That's my wish.

00:18:32.014 --> 00:18:33.165
CA: That's his wish!

00:18:33.189 --> 00:18:39.712
(Applause)

00:18:46.303 --> 00:18:50.152
CS: We started Architecture for Humanity
with 700 dollars and a website.

00:18:50.707 --> 00:18:54.426
So Chris somehow decided
to give me 100,000.

00:18:54.783 --> 00:18:56.608
So why not this many people?

00:18:57.983 --> 00:19:00.428
Open-source architecture is the way to go.

00:19:00.452 --> 00:19:03.539
You have a diverse community
of participants --

00:19:03.563 --> 00:19:06.436
and we're not just talking
about inventors and designers,

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.579
but we're talking about the funding model.

00:19:08.603 --> 00:19:10.381
My role is not as a designer;

00:19:10.405 --> 00:19:13.890
it's as a conduit between the design world
and the humanitarian world.

00:19:13.914 --> 00:19:18.668
And what we need is something
that replicates me globally,

00:19:18.692 --> 00:19:21.036
because I haven't slept in seven years.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.576
(Laughter)

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.429
Secondly, what will this thing be?

00:19:26.453 --> 00:19:30.333
Designers want to respond
to issues of humanitarian crisis,

00:19:30.357 --> 00:19:33.308
but they don't want
some company in the West

00:19:33.332 --> 00:19:35.983
taking their idea
and basically profiting from it.

00:19:36.007 --> 00:19:40.156
So Creative Commons has developed
the Developing Nations license.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.570
And what that means
is that a designer can --

00:19:42.594 --> 00:19:44.427
The Siyathemba project I showed

00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:48.419
was the first ever building to have
a Creative Commons license on it.

00:19:48.443 --> 00:19:53.576
As soon as that is built, anyone
in Africa or any developing nation

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.793
can take the construction documents
and replicate it for free.

00:19:58.657 --> 00:20:03.209
(Applause)

00:20:03.233 --> 00:20:06.152
So why not allow designers
the opportunity to do this,

00:20:06.176 --> 00:20:08.454
but still protect their rights here?

00:20:08.478 --> 00:20:12.483
We want to have a community
where you can upload ideas,

00:20:12.507 --> 00:20:16.707
and those ideas can be tested
in an earthquake, in flood,

00:20:16.731 --> 00:20:19.051
in all sorts of austere environments.

00:20:19.075 --> 00:20:20.812
The reason that's important

00:20:20.836 --> 00:20:22.893
is I don't want to wait
for the next Katrina

00:20:22.917 --> 00:20:24.526
to find out if my house works.

00:20:25.672 --> 00:20:28.148
That's too late, we need to do it now.

00:20:28.172 --> 00:20:29.506
So doing that globally --

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:35.020
and I want this whole thing
to work multi-lingually.

00:20:35.044 --> 00:20:39.127
When you look at the face of an architect,
most people think a gray-haired white guy.

00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:41.518
I don't see that;
I see the face of the world.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.950
So I want everyone
from all over the planet

00:20:43.974 --> 00:20:47.576
to be able to be a part
of this design and development.

00:20:47.942 --> 00:20:49.991
The idea of needs-based competitions --

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:53.416
XPRIZE for the other 98 percent,
if you want to call it that.

00:20:54.749 --> 00:20:57.043
We also want to look
at ways of matchmaking

00:20:57.067 --> 00:20:59.184
and putting funding partners together,

00:20:59.208 --> 00:21:01.550
and the idea of integrating
manufacturers --

00:21:01.574 --> 00:21:03.169
fab labs in every country.

00:21:03.193 --> 00:21:07.008
When I hear about the $100 laptop
and it's going to educate every child --

00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:09.033
educate every designer in the world.

00:21:09.057 --> 00:21:13.567
Put one in every favela,
every slum settlement.

00:21:13.591 --> 00:21:15.829
Because you know what?
Innovation will happen.

00:21:15.853 --> 00:21:18.235
And I need to know that.
It's called the leap-back.

00:21:18.259 --> 00:21:20.389
We talk about leapfrog technologies.

00:21:20.413 --> 00:21:21.794
I write with Worldchanging,

00:21:21.818 --> 00:21:23.971
and the one thing
we've been talking about is,

00:21:23.995 --> 00:21:26.582
I learn more on the ground
than I've ever learned here.

00:21:26.606 --> 00:21:29.758
So let's take those ideas,
adapt them, and we can use them.

00:21:32.428 --> 00:21:35.849
These ideas are supposed to be adaptable;

00:21:35.873 --> 00:21:39.610
they should have
the potential for evolution;

00:21:39.634 --> 00:21:42.130
they should be developed
by every nation in the world

00:21:42.154 --> 00:21:44.250
and useful for every nation in the world.

00:21:44.837 --> 00:21:45.994
What will it take?

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.604
There should be a sheet.

00:21:47.628 --> 00:21:51.136
I don't have time to read this,
because I'm going to be yanked off.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.430
CA: Let's just leave it up for a sec.

00:21:53.454 --> 00:21:55.880
CS: Well, what will it take?
You guys are smart.

00:21:57.094 --> 00:21:59.958
So it's going to take a lot
of computing power,

00:21:59.982 --> 00:22:03.081
because I want the idea
that any laptop anywhere in the world

00:22:03.105 --> 00:22:04.476
can plug into the system

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.062
and be able to not only participate
in developing these designs,

00:22:08.086 --> 00:22:09.841
but utilize the designs.

00:22:09.865 --> 00:22:13.622
Also, a process of reviewing the designs.

00:22:13.646 --> 00:22:17.058
I want every Arup engineer
in the world to check and make sure

00:22:17.082 --> 00:22:18.951
that we're doing stuff that's standing,

00:22:18.975 --> 00:22:21.116
because those guys
are the best in the world.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.290
Plug.

00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:26.466
And so, you know, I want these --

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.244
I just should note: I have two laptops
and one of them is there,

00:22:30.268 --> 00:22:32.751
and that has 3000 designs on it.

00:22:32.775 --> 00:22:35.728
If I drop that laptop ...

00:22:35.752 --> 00:22:37.202
What happens?

00:22:37.226 --> 00:22:40.194
So it's important to have
these proven ideas put up there,

00:22:40.218 --> 00:22:42.067
easy to use, easy to get ahold of.

00:22:46.044 --> 00:22:49.819
My mom once said, "There's nothing worse
than being all mouth and no trousers."

00:22:49.843 --> 00:22:51.350
(Laughter)

00:22:51.374 --> 00:22:54.525
I'm fed up of talking about making change.

00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:56.398
You only make it by doing it.

00:22:56.843 --> 00:23:00.423
We've changed FEMA guidelines;
we've changed public policy;

00:23:00.447 --> 00:23:04.861
we've changed international response --
based on building things.

00:23:04.885 --> 00:23:09.234
So for me, it's important that we create
a real conduit for innovation,

00:23:09.258 --> 00:23:10.902
and that it's free innovation.

00:23:10.926 --> 00:23:13.549
Think of free culture --
this is free innovation.

00:23:15.858 --> 00:23:18.646
Somebody said this a couple of years back.

00:23:20.138 --> 00:23:22.275
I will give points for those who know it.

00:23:22.299 --> 00:23:28.560
But I think the man was maybe
25 years too early.

00:23:28.584 --> 00:23:30.809
So let's do it.

00:23:30.833 --> 00:23:31.986
Thank you.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.992
(Applause)
