00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.341
I always wanted to become
a walking laboratory of social engagement:

00:00:18.313 --> 00:00:23.683
to resonate other people's feelings,
thoughts, intentions, motivations,

00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:25.368
in the act of being with them.

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.528
As a scientist, I always wanted
to measure that resonance,

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:35.394
that sense of the other
that happens so quickly,

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:36.725
in the blink of an eye.

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:40.008
We intuit other people's feelings;

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:43.175
we know the meaning of their actions
even before they happen.

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:45.705
We're always in this stance

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.811
of being the object
of somebody else's subjectivity.

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:51.575
We do that all the time.
We just can't shake it off.

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:55.724
It's so important that the very tools
we use to understand ourselves,

00:00:55.748 --> 00:00:57.575
to understand the world around us,

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:59.205
are shaped by that stance.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.277
We are social to the core.

00:01:03.572 --> 00:01:06.023
So my journey in autism really started

00:01:06.047 --> 00:01:09.653
when I lived in a residential unit
for adults with autism.

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:13.159
Most of those individuals
had spent most of their lives

00:01:13.183 --> 00:01:14.668
in long-stay hospitals.

00:01:14.692 --> 00:01:16.157
This is a long time ago.

00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:20.548
And for them, autism was devastating.

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:24.038
They had profound
intellectual disabilities.

00:01:24.558 --> 00:01:25.792
They didn't talk.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.629
But most of all,

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:33.146
they were extraordinarily isolated
from the world around them,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.007
from their environment

00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:36.904
and from the people.

00:01:37.392 --> 00:01:40.219
In fact, at the time,
if you walked into a school

00:01:40.243 --> 00:01:42.031
for individuals with autism,

00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:44.368
you'd hear a lot of noise,

00:01:44.392 --> 00:01:48.465
plenty of commotion, actions,
people doing things.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.215
But they're always doing
things by themselves.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:56.886
So they may be looking
at a light in the ceiling,

00:01:57.527 --> 00:02:00.309
or they may be isolated in the corner,

00:02:00.936 --> 00:02:04.471
or they might be engaged
in these repetitive movements,

00:02:04.495 --> 00:02:07.914
in self-stimulatory movements
that led them nowhere.

00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:11.157
Extremely, extremely isolated.

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:18.205
Well, now we know that autism
is this disruption,

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.746
the disruption of this resonance
that I am telling you about.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.704
These are survival skills.

00:02:23.728 --> 00:02:25.855
These are survival skills
that we inherited

00:02:26.638 --> 00:02:30.019
over many, many hundreds
of thousands of years of evolution.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:35.513
You see, babies are born
in a state of utter fragility.

00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:38.161
Without the caregiver,
they wouldn't survive,

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:40.691
so it stands to reason
that nature would endow them

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:42.492
with these mechanisms of survival.

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:46.112
They orient to the caregiver.

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:49.377
From the first days and weeks of life,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.674
babies prefer to hear human sounds,

00:02:52.698 --> 00:02:54.822
rather than just sounds
in the environment.

00:02:54.846 --> 00:02:57.323
They prefer to look at people
rather than at things,

00:02:57.347 --> 00:03:00.688
and even as they're looking at people,
they look at people's eyes,

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:05.955
because the eye is the window
to the other person's experiences,

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.437
so much so that they even prefer
to look at people

00:03:08.461 --> 00:03:11.700
who are looking at them
rather than people who are looking away.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.107
Well, they orient to the caregiver.

00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:16.764
The caregiver seeks the baby.

00:03:17.272 --> 00:03:20.520
And it's out of this mutually
reinforcing choreography

00:03:21.085 --> 00:03:24.880
that a lot that is of importance
to the emergence of mind --

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:28.428
the social mind, the social
brain -- depends on.

00:03:29.587 --> 00:03:32.659
We always think about autism

00:03:32.683 --> 00:03:37.323
as something that happens
later on in life.

00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:40.752
It doesn't; it begins
with the beginning of life.

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:48.496
As babies engage with caregivers,
they soon realize that, well,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.642
there is something between the ears
that is very important --

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:56.081
it's invisible, you can't see it,
but it's really critical.

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.776
And that thing is called attention.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.133
And they learn soon enough,

00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:02.745
even before they can utter one word,

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.652
that they can take that attention
and move somewhere

00:04:06.273 --> 00:04:08.071
in order to get things they want.

00:04:09.555 --> 00:04:12.655
They also learn to follow
other people's gazes,

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:16.664
because whatever people are looking at
is what they are thinking about.

00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:22.350
And soon enough, they start to learn
about the meaning of things,

00:04:22.374 --> 00:04:24.747
because when somebody
is looking at something

00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:26.989
or somebody is pointing at something,

00:04:27.013 --> 00:04:29.186
they're not just getting
a directional cue.

00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:33.435
They are getting the other
person's meaning of that thing,

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:34.669
the attitude.

00:04:34.693 --> 00:04:39.464
And soon enough, they start
building this body of meanings,

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:43.340
but meanings that were acquired
within the realm of social interaction.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.025
Those are meanings that are acquired

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:48.681
as part of their shared
experiences with others.

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:55.902
Well, this is a 15-month-old little girl,

00:04:57.512 --> 00:04:59.159
and she has autism.

00:05:00.594 --> 00:05:06.382
And I am coming so close to her
that I am maybe two inches from her face,

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.241
and she's quite oblivious to me.

00:05:08.265 --> 00:05:11.693
Imagine if I did that to you,
came two inches from your face.

00:05:11.717 --> 00:05:13.922
You'd do probably
two things, wouldn't you?

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:16.544
You would recoil.
You would call the police.

00:05:16.568 --> 00:05:17.742
(Laughter)

00:05:17.766 --> 00:05:18.919
You would do something,

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:23.001
because it's literally impossible
to penetrate somebody's physical space

00:05:23.025 --> 00:05:24.428
and not get that reaction.

00:05:24.452 --> 00:05:27.907
We do so, remember,
intuitively, effortlessly.

00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:29.096
This is our body wisdom;

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.318
it's not something mediated
by our language.

00:05:31.342 --> 00:05:33.773
Our body just knows that.

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:36.637
And we've known that for a long time.

00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:39.576
And this is not something
that happens to humans only.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.800
It happens to some
of our phyletic cousins,

00:05:42.824 --> 00:05:46.890
because if you're a monkey,
and you look at another monkey,

00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:50.908
and that monkey has a higher
hierarchy position than you,

00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:54.461
and that is considered
to be a signal or threat,

00:05:54.485 --> 00:05:56.879
well, you are not going
to be alive for long.

00:05:57.365 --> 00:06:02.197
So something that in other species
are survival mechanisms,

00:06:02.221 --> 00:06:05.328
without which they
wouldn't basically live,

00:06:05.352 --> 00:06:07.883
we bring into the context of human beings,

00:06:07.907 --> 00:06:11.624
and this is what we need
to simply act, socially.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.949
Now, she is oblivious to me
and I'm so close to her,

00:06:14.973 --> 00:06:16.947
and you think, maybe she can see you,

00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:18.482
maybe she can hear you.

00:06:18.506 --> 00:06:20.128
Well, a few minutes later,

00:06:20.152 --> 00:06:22.093
she goes to the corner of the room,

00:06:22.117 --> 00:06:25.867
and she finds a tiny little piece
of candy, an M&amp;M.

00:06:26.859 --> 00:06:31.376
So I could not attract her attention,

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.271
but something -- a thing -- did.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.447
Now, most of us make a big dichotomy

00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:39.351
between the world of things
and the world of people.

00:06:40.882 --> 00:06:45.373
Now, for this girl,
that division line is not so clear,

00:06:45.397 --> 00:06:48.503
and the world of people
is not attracting her

00:06:48.527 --> 00:06:49.986
as much as we would like.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.697
Now, remember that we learn a great deal
by sharing experiences.

00:06:54.445 --> 00:07:00.306
What she is doing right now
is that her path of learning is diverging,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.071
moment by moment,

00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:05.315
as she is isolating herself
further and further.

00:07:05.913 --> 00:07:08.855
So we feel sometimes
that the brain is deterministic,

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:11.056
the brain determines
who we're going to be.

00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:14.217
But, in fact, the brain
also becomes who we are,

00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:18.230
and at the same time
that her behaviors are taking away

00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:20.416
from the realm of social interaction,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.465
this is what's happening with her mind,

00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:24.905
and this is what's happening
with her brain.

00:07:27.143 --> 00:07:32.343
Well, autism is the most strongly
genetic condition

00:07:32.367 --> 00:07:34.239
of all developmental disorders.

00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:38.119
And it's a brain disorder.

00:07:38.695 --> 00:07:41.924
It's a disorder that begins
much prior to the time

00:07:41.948 --> 00:07:43.263
that the child is born.

00:07:44.217 --> 00:07:48.198
We now know that there is a very
broad spectrum of autism.

00:07:48.222 --> 00:07:51.691
There are those individuals
who are profoundly intellectually disabled

00:07:51.715 --> 00:07:53.672
but there are those that are gifted.

00:07:53.696 --> 00:07:56.090
There are those individuals
who don't talk at all;

00:07:56.114 --> 00:07:58.502
there are those individuals
who talk too much.

00:07:58.526 --> 00:08:02.023
There are those individuals
that if you observe them in their school,

00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:05.717
you see them running the periphery fence
all the school day if you let them,

00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:08.102
to those individuals
who cannot stop coming to you

00:08:08.126 --> 00:08:10.979
and trying to engage you
repeatedly, relentlessly,

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:13.360
but often in an awkward fashion,

00:08:14.232 --> 00:08:16.889
without that immediate resonance.

00:08:17.812 --> 00:08:21.558
Well, this is much more prevalent
than we thought at the time.

00:08:21.582 --> 00:08:22.993
When I started in this field,

00:08:23.017 --> 00:08:26.105
we thought there were four individuals
with autism per 10,000 --

00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:27.400
a very rare condition.

00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:31.515
Well, now we know it's more
like one in 100.

00:08:31.957 --> 00:08:35.245
There are millions of individuals
with autism all around us.

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:40.469
The societal cost
of this condition is huge,

00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:43.533
in the US alone,
maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars.

00:08:43.557 --> 00:08:44.745
And you know what?

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:49.406
Most of those funds are associated
with adolescents and particularly adults

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.181
who are severely disabled,

00:08:51.205 --> 00:08:53.366
individuals who need
wraparound services --

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.646
services that are very, very intensive.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.756
And those services can cost in excess
of 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year.

00:09:00.536 --> 00:09:03.760
Those are individuals who did not
benefit from early treatment,

00:09:04.474 --> 00:09:08.612
because now we know
that autism creates itself

00:09:08.636 --> 00:09:12.788
as individuals diverge in that pathway
of learning that I mentioned to you.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.773
Were we to be able
to identify this condition

00:09:15.797 --> 00:09:18.547
at an earlier point,
and intervene and treat --

00:09:19.812 --> 00:09:23.866
I can tell you, this has been probably
something that has changed my life

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.186
in the past 10 years,

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.464
this notion that we can absolutely
attenuate this condition.

00:09:30.922 --> 00:09:33.277
Also, we have a window of opportunity,

00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:35.921
because the brain
is malleable for just so long,

00:09:36.437 --> 00:09:39.950
and that window of opportunity
happens in the first three years of life.

00:09:39.974 --> 00:09:42.685
It's not that that window
closes; it doesn't.

00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:46.134
But it diminishes considerably.

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:49.997
And yet, the median age
of diagnosis in this country

00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:51.933
is still about five years,

00:09:51.957 --> 00:09:54.052
and in disadvantaged populations,

00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:57.205
the populations that don't have
access to clinical services,

00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:59.642
rural populations, minorities,

00:10:00.338 --> 00:10:03.047
the age of diagnosis is later still,

00:10:03.071 --> 00:10:05.096
which is almost as if I were to tell you

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.887
that we are condemning those communities
to have individuals with autism

00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:11.234
whose condition is going
to be more severe.

00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:14.706
So I feel that we have
a bioethical imperative.

00:10:15.168 --> 00:10:16.897
The science is there.

00:10:18.025 --> 00:10:20.145
But no science is of relevance

00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:23.098
if it doesn't have an impact
on the community.

00:10:23.727 --> 00:10:26.681
And we just can't afford
that missed opportunity,

00:10:26.705 --> 00:10:29.650
because children with autism
become adults with autism.

00:10:30.412 --> 00:10:34.416
And we feel that those things we can do

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.818
for these children,
for those families, early on,

00:10:36.842 --> 00:10:39.019
will have lifetime consequences --

00:10:39.043 --> 00:10:43.051
for the child, for the family,
and for the community at large.

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:45.648
So this is our view of autism.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:49.467
There are over a hundred genes
that are associated with autism.

00:10:49.491 --> 00:10:51.450
In fact, we believe there are going to be

00:10:51.474 --> 00:10:55.279
something between 300 and 600
genes associated with autism,

00:10:55.303 --> 00:10:58.606
and genetic anomalies,
much more than just genes.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.779
And we actually have
a bit of a question here,

00:11:03.644 --> 00:11:06.929
because if there are so many
different causes of autism,

00:11:06.953 --> 00:11:11.221
how do you go from those liabilities
to the actual syndrome?

00:11:11.245 --> 00:11:12.796
Because people like myself,

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.767
when we walk into a playroom,

00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:18.149
we recognize a child as having autism.

00:11:18.835 --> 00:11:21.063
So how do you go from multiple causes

00:11:21.087 --> 00:11:23.415
to a syndrome that has some homogeneity?

00:11:24.491 --> 00:11:27.182
And the answer is what lies in between,

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:29.185
which is development.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.433
And in fact, we are very interested
in those first two years of life,

00:11:34.457 --> 00:11:38.245
because those liabilities
don't necessarily convert into autism.

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:40.027
Autism creates itself.

00:11:40.812 --> 00:11:44.657
Were we to be able to intervene
during those years of life,

00:11:45.569 --> 00:11:50.985
we might attenuate for some, and God
knows, maybe even prevent for others.

00:11:51.975 --> 00:11:53.213
So how do we do that?

00:11:53.837 --> 00:11:56.729
How do we enter that feeling of resonance,

00:11:56.753 --> 00:11:59.547
how do we enter another person's being?

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:04.252
I remember when I interacted
with that 15-month-old,

00:12:04.276 --> 00:12:06.414
the thing that came to my mind was,

00:12:06.438 --> 00:12:08.751
"How do you come into her world?

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.807
Is she thinking about me?
Is she thinking about others?"

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.760
Well, it's hard to do that,

00:12:16.784 --> 00:12:18.962
so we had to create the technologies.

00:12:18.986 --> 00:12:21.455
We had to basically step inside a body.

00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:24.073
We had to see the world through her eyes.

00:12:25.192 --> 00:12:27.504
And so in the past many years,

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:29.924
we've been building these new technologies

00:12:29.948 --> 00:12:31.529
that are based on eye tracking.

00:12:31.553 --> 00:12:36.469
We can see, moment by moment,
what children are engaging with.

00:12:38.046 --> 00:12:39.810
This is my colleague, Warren Jones,

00:12:39.834 --> 00:12:43.128
with whom we've been building
these methods, these studies,

00:12:43.152 --> 00:12:44.481
for the past 12 years.

00:12:44.879 --> 00:12:48.035
And you see there a happy five-month-old,

00:12:48.789 --> 00:12:53.856
a five-month little boy
who is going to watch things

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.792
that are brought from his world:

00:12:56.596 --> 00:12:58.829
his mom, the caregiver,

00:12:58.853 --> 00:13:03.083
but also experiences that he would have
were he to be in his daycare.

00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:07.724
What we want is to embrace that world
and bring it into our laboratory,

00:13:07.748 --> 00:13:09.782
but in order for us to do that,

00:13:09.806 --> 00:13:14.061
we had to create
these very sophisticated measures,

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:17.566
measures of how people, how little babies,

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:22.104
how newborns, engage
with the world, moment by moment.

00:13:22.128 --> 00:13:24.413
What is important and what is not.

00:13:25.163 --> 00:13:27.774
Well, we created those measures,

00:13:27.798 --> 00:13:31.159
and here, what you see
is what we call a funnel of attention.

00:13:31.826 --> 00:13:33.191
You're watching a video --

00:13:33.739 --> 00:13:36.470
those frames are separated
by about a second --

00:13:36.494 --> 00:13:40.366
through the eyes of 35 typically
developing two-year-olds.

00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:43.134
And we freeze one frame,

00:13:43.908 --> 00:13:46.996
and this is what the typical
children are doing.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.437
In this scan pass, in green here,
are two-year-olds with autism.

00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:56.824
So on that frame, the children
who are typical are watching this,

00:13:58.039 --> 00:14:00.564
the emotion of expression
of that little boy

00:14:00.588 --> 00:14:03.314
as he's fighting a little bit
with the little girl.

00:14:03.338 --> 00:14:05.375
What are the children with autism doing?

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:08.494
They are focusing on the revolving door,

00:14:09.304 --> 00:14:10.725
opening and shutting.

00:14:11.542 --> 00:14:14.891
Well, I can tell you that this divergence
that you're seeing here

00:14:14.915 --> 00:14:17.727
doesn't happen only
in our five-minute experiment.

00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:20.685
It happens moment by moment
in their real lives,

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.053
and their minds are being formed
and their brains are being specialized

00:14:26.077 --> 00:14:30.100
in something other than what is happening
with their typical peers.

00:14:30.807 --> 00:14:37.326
Well, we took a construct
from our pediatrician friends,

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.869
the concept of growth charts --

00:14:38.893 --> 00:14:41.370
you know, when you take
a child to the pediatrician,

00:14:41.394 --> 00:14:44.476
and you have physical height and weight.

00:14:45.066 --> 00:14:48.000
Well, we decided we were going
to create growth charts

00:14:48.024 --> 00:14:49.325
of social engagement.

00:14:50.354 --> 00:14:53.122
We sought children
from the time they're born.

00:14:53.574 --> 00:14:56.949
What you see here on the x-axis

00:14:56.973 --> 00:15:01.158
is two, three, four, five,
six months and nine,

00:15:01.182 --> 00:15:02.945
until about the age of 24 months.

00:15:02.969 --> 00:15:05.740
This is the percent of their viewing time

00:15:05.764 --> 00:15:07.675
that they're focusing on people's eyes,

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:09.628
and this is their growth chart.

00:15:10.144 --> 00:15:12.617
They start over here --
they love people's eyes --

00:15:12.641 --> 00:15:14.684
and it remains quite stable.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.613
It sort of goes up a little bit
in those initial months.

00:15:19.319 --> 00:15:23.056
Now, let's see what's happening
with babies who became autistic.

00:15:23.771 --> 00:15:25.263
It's something very different.

00:15:26.004 --> 00:15:28.934
It starts way up here,
but then it's a free fall.

00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:33.670
It's very much like they brought
into this world the reflex

00:15:33.694 --> 00:15:36.887
that orients them to people,
but it has no traction.

00:15:37.511 --> 00:15:39.945
It's almost as if that stimulus -- you --

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.530
you're not exerting
influence on what happens

00:15:43.554 --> 00:15:45.908
as they navigate their daily lives.

00:15:47.236 --> 00:15:53.996
Now, we thought those data
were so powerful, in a way,

00:15:54.686 --> 00:15:57.936
that we wanted to see what happened
in the first six months of life,

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.168
because if you interact
with a two- and a three-month-old,

00:16:01.192 --> 00:16:04.442
you'd be surprised
by how social those babies are.

00:16:05.513 --> 00:16:08.370
And what we see
in the first six months of life

00:16:08.394 --> 00:16:13.271
is that those two groups
can be segregated very easily.

00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:17.276
And using these kinds
of measures and many others,

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.953
what we found out
is that our science could, in fact,

00:16:20.977 --> 00:16:23.201
identify this condition early on.

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:26.910
We didn't have to wait
for the behaviors of autism

00:16:26.934 --> 00:16:29.013
to emerge in the second year of life.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:34.683
If we measured things that are,
evolutionarily, highly conserved,

00:16:34.707 --> 00:16:37.030
and developmentally very early-emerging --

00:16:37.054 --> 00:16:39.731
things that are online
from the first weeks of life --

00:16:39.755 --> 00:16:41.717
we could push the detection of autism

00:16:41.741 --> 00:16:44.269
all the way to those first months,

00:16:44.293 --> 00:16:46.277
and that's what we are doing now.

00:16:48.618 --> 00:16:51.775
Now, we can create
the very best technologies

00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:54.805
and the very best methods
to identify the children,

00:16:55.591 --> 00:16:58.505
but this would be for naught
if we didn't have an impact

00:16:58.529 --> 00:17:01.209
on what happens in their reality
in the community.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.962
Now we want those devices, of course,

00:17:03.986 --> 00:17:06.815
to be deployed by those
who are in the trenches --

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:11.377
our colleagues, the primary care
physicians, who see every child --

00:17:12.067 --> 00:17:14.430
and we need to transform
those technologies

00:17:14.454 --> 00:17:17.456
into something that is going
to add value to their practice,

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.666
because they have to see so many children.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:23.767
And we want to do that universally
so that we don't miss any child.

00:17:23.791 --> 00:17:25.402
But this would be immoral

00:17:26.529 --> 00:17:31.892
if we also did not have an infrastructure
for intervention, for treatment.

00:17:32.487 --> 00:17:36.379
We need to be able to work
with the families, support the families,

00:17:36.403 --> 00:17:39.416
to manage those first years with them.

00:17:40.384 --> 00:17:42.782
We need to be able to really go

00:17:42.806 --> 00:17:46.728
from universal screening
to universal access to treatment,

00:17:46.752 --> 00:17:49.741
because those treatments
are going to change

00:17:49.765 --> 00:17:52.630
these children's
and those families' lives.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:18:00.888
Now, when we think about what we [can]
do in those first years,

00:18:00.912 --> 00:18:05.482
I can tell you, having been
in this field for so long,

00:18:06.077 --> 00:18:08.453
one feels really rejuvenated.

00:18:08.832 --> 00:18:13.554
There is a sense that the science
that one worked on

00:18:13.578 --> 00:18:16.347
can actually have an impact on realities,

00:18:16.371 --> 00:18:19.351
preventing, in fact, those experiences

00:18:19.972 --> 00:18:22.716
that I really started
in my journey in this field.

00:18:23.343 --> 00:18:26.753
I thought at the time
that this was an intractable condition.

00:18:26.777 --> 00:18:30.056
No longer. We can do
a great deal of things.

00:18:30.707 --> 00:18:33.116
And the idea is not to cure autism.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.640
That's not the idea.

00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:37.865
What we want is to make sure

00:18:37.889 --> 00:18:40.441
that those individuals
with autism can be free

00:18:40.465 --> 00:18:44.080
from the devastating consequences
that come with it at times,

00:18:44.876 --> 00:18:47.937
the profound intellectual disabilities,
the lack of language,

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:50.448
the profound, profound isolation.

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:53.809
We feel that individuals
with autism, in fact,

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:56.299
have a very special
perspective on the world,

00:18:56.323 --> 00:18:57.669
and we need diversity.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.066
And they can work extremely well
in some areas of strength:

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.469
predictable situations,
situations that can be defined.

00:19:05.493 --> 00:19:08.451
Because after all,
they learn about the world

00:19:08.475 --> 00:19:10.357
almost, like, about it,

00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:13.178
rather than learning
how to function in it.

00:19:13.202 --> 00:19:17.201
But this is a strength if you're working,
for example, in technology.

00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:21.912
And there are those individuals
who have incredible artistic abilities.

00:19:21.936 --> 00:19:24.269
We want them to be free to do that.

00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:27.412
We want that the next generations
of individuals with autism

00:19:27.436 --> 00:19:30.514
will be able not only
to express their strengths,

00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:32.437
but to fulfill their promise.

00:19:32.952 --> 00:19:34.699
Well, thank you for listening to me.

00:19:34.723 --> 00:19:36.501
(Applause)
