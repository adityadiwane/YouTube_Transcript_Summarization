00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Cities are the crucible of civilization.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
They have been expanding,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
urbanization has been expanding,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
at an exponential rate in the last 200 years

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
so that by the second part of this century,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
the planet will be completely dominated

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
by cities.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Cities are the origins of global warming,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
impact on the environment,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
health, pollution, disease,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
finance,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
economies, energy --

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
they're all problems

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
that are confronted by having cities.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
That's where all these problems come from.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
in terms of sustainability questions

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
are actually a reflection

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
of the exponential increase

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
in urbanization across the planet.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Here's some numbers.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Two hundred years ago, the United States

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
was less than a few percent urbanized.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
It's now more than 82 percent.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
China's building 300 new cities

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
in the next 20 years.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Now listen to this:

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Every week for the foreseeable future,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
until 2050,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
every week more than a million people

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
are being added to our cities.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
This is going to affect everything.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Everybody in this room, if you stay alive,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
is going to be affected

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
by what's happening in cities

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
in this extraordinary phenomenon.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
However, cities,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
despite having this negative aspect to them,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
are also the solution.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
that have sucked up creative people,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
creating ideas, innovation,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
wealth and so on.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
So we have this kind of dual nature.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And so there's an urgent need

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.260
for a scientific theory of cities.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Now these are my comrades in arms.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and they've done all the work,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and I'm the great bullshitter

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
that tries to bring it all together.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
(Laughter)

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
So here's the problem: This is what we all want.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
The 10 billion people on the planet in 2050

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
want to live in places like this,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
having things like this,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
doing things like this,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
with economies that are growing like this,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
not realizing that entropy

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
produces things like this,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.260
this, this

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and this.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And the question is:

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Is that what Edinburgh and London and New York

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
are going to look like in 2050,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
or is it going to be this?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
That's the question.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
I must say, many of the indicators

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
look like this is what it's going to look like,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
but let's talk about it.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
So my provocative statement

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And scientific theory means quantifiable --

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
relying on underlying generic principles

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
that can be made into a predictive framework.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
That's the quest.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Is that conceivable?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Are there universal laws?

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
So here's two questions

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
that I have in my head when I think about this problem.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
The first is:

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Are cities part of biology?

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Is London a great big whale?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Is Edinburgh a horse?

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Is Microsoft a great big anthill?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
What do we learn from that?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
We use them metaphorically --

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on --

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
or is there serious substance to it?

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And if that is the case,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
how come that it's very hard to kill a city?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
You could drop an atom bomb on a city,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and 30 years later it's surviving.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
Very few cities fail.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
All companies die, all companies.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predict

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
when Google is going to go bust.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
So is that just another version

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
of this?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Well we understand this very well.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
That is, you ask any generic question about this --

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
how many trees of a given size,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
how many branches of a given size does a tree have,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
how many leaves,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
what is the energy flowing through each branch,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
what is the size of the canopy,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
what is its growth, what is its mortality?

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
We have a mathematical framework

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
based on generic universal principles

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
that can answer those questions.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.260
And the idea is can we do the same for this?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So the route in is recognizing

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
one of the most extraordinary things about life,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
is that it is scalable,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
it works over an extraordinary range.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
This is just a tiny range actually:

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
It's us mammals;

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
we're one of these.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
The same principles, the same dynamics,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
the same organization is at work

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
in all of these, including us,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
And that is one of the main reasons

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
life is so resilient and robust --

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
scalability.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
We're going to discuss that in a moment more.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
But you know, at a local level,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
you scale; everybody in this room is scaled.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
That's called growth.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Here's how you grew.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Rat, that's a rat -- could have been you.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
We're all pretty much the same.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
And you see, you're very familiar with this.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
You grow very quickly and then you stop.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
And that line there

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
is a prediction from the same theory,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
based on the same principles,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that describes that forest.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And here it is for the growth of a rat,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and those points on there are data points.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
This is just the weight versus the age.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
And you see, it stops growing.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
Very, very good for biology --

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
also one of the reasons for its great resilience.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Very, very bad

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
for economies and companies and cities

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
in our present paradigm.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
This is what we believe.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
This is what our whole economy

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
is thrusting upon us,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner:

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
hockey sticks.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
This is a bunch of software companies --

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
and what it is is their revenue versus their age --

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
all zooming away,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
and everybody making millions and billions of dollars.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Okay, so how do we understand this?

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
So let's first talk about biology.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
This is explicitly showing you

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
how things scale,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
and this is a truly remarkable graph.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
What is plotted here is metabolic rate --

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
how much energy you need per day to stay alive --

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
versus your weight, your mass,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
for all of us bunch of organisms.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And what you see if you plot it

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
in this slightly curious way

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
is that everybody lies on the same line.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
in the universe,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
there's an extraordinary simplicity

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
being expressed by this.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
It's particularly astonishing

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
because each one of these organisms,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
each subsystem, each cell type, each gene,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.260
has evolved in its own unique environmental niche

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
with its own unique history.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
And yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolution

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and natural selection,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
they've been constrained to lie on a line.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
Something else is going on.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
Before I talk about that,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
I've written down at the bottom there

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
the slope of this curve, this straight line.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
It's three-quarters, roughly,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
And here's the point of that.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
It says that, if it were linear,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
the steepest slope,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
then doubling the size

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
you would require double the amount of energy.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
But it's sublinear, and what that translates into

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
is that, if you double the size of the organism,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
you actually only need 75 percent more energy.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
So a wonderful thing about all of biology

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
The bigger you are systematically,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
according to very well-defined rules,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
less energy per capita.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Now any physiological variable you can think of,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
any life history event you can think of,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
if you plot it this way, looks like this.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
There is an extraordinary regularity.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
So you tell me the size of a mammal,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
I can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.260
in terms of its physiology, life history, etc.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And the reason for this is because of networks.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
All of life is controlled by networks --

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
from the intracellular through the multicellular

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
through the ecosystem level.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
And you're very familiar with these networks.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
That's a little thing that lives inside an elephant.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
And here's the summary of what I'm saying.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
If you take those networks,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
this idea of networks,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
and you apply universal principles,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
mathematizable, universal principles,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
all of these scalings

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
and all of these constraints follow,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
including the description of the forest,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
the description of your circulatory system,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
the description within cells.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
One of the things I did not stress in that introduction

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
was that, systematically, the pace of life

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
decreases as you get bigger.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
Heart rates are slower; you live longer;

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
diffusion of oxygen and resources

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
across membranes is slower, etc.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
The question is: Is any of this true

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
for cities and companies?

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
So is London a scaled up Birmingham,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
which is a scaled up Brighton, etc., etc.?

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
Is New York a scaled up San Francisco,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
which is a scaled up Santa Fe?

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Don't know. We will discuss that.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
But they are networks,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and the most important network of cities

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
is you.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
Cities are just a physical manifestation

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
of your interactions,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
our interactions,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
and the clustering and grouping of individuals.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Here's just a symbolic picture of that.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And here's scaling of cities.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
This shows that in this very simple example,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
which happens to be a mundane example

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
of number of petrol stations

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
as a function of size --

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
plotted in the same way as the biology --

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
you see exactly the same kind of thing.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
There is a scaling.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.260
That is that the number of petrol stations in the city

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
is now given to you

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
when you tell me its size.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
The slope of that is less than linear.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
There is an economy of scale.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
But here's what's surprising.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
It scales in the same way everywhere.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
This is just European countries,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
always the same

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
with the same kind of economy of scale

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
to the same degree.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
And any infrastructure you look at --

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
whether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines --

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
anything you look at

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
It's an integrated system

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
that has evolved despite all the planning and so on.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
But even more surprising

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
is if you look at socio-economic quantities,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
quantities that have no analog in biology,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
that have evolved when we started forming communities

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
eight to 10,000 years ago.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
The top one is wages as a function of size

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
plotted in the same way.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
And the bottom one is you lot --

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
super-creatives plotted in the same way.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
And what you see

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
is a scaling phenomenon.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
But most important in this,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
the exponent, the analog to that three-quarters

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
for the metabolic rate,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Here it is,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
which says that the bigger you are

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
the more you have per capita, unlike biology --

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.260
higher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
more patents per capita, more crime per capita.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
And we've looked at everything:

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
more AIDS cases, flu, etc.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
And here, they're all plotted together.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Just to show you what we plotted,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
here is income, GDP --

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
GDP of the city --

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
crime and patents all on one graph.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
And you can see, they all follow the same line.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And here's the statement.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
If you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
from a million to two million, 10 to 20 million,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
it doesn't matter,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
then systematically

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
you get a 15 percent increase

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
in wages, wealth, number of AIDS cases,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
number of police,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
anything you can think of.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
It goes up by 15 percent,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
and you have a 15 percent savings

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
on the infrastructure.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
This, no doubt, is the reason

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
why a million people a week are gathering in cities.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
Because they think that all those wonderful things --

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
like creative people, wealth, income --

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
is what attracts them,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
forgetting about the ugly and the bad.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
What is the reason for this?

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
but underlying this is the social networks,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
because this is a universal phenomenon.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
This 15 percent rule

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
is true

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
no matter where you are on the planet --

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
Japan, Chile,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Portugal, Scotland, doesn't matter.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Always, all the data shows it's the same,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
Something universal is going on.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
The universality, to repeat, is us --

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
that we are the city.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
So there it is, I've said it again.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
So if it is those networks and their mathematical structure,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
unlike biology, which had sublinear scaling,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
economies of scale,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
you had the slowing of the pace of life

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
as you get bigger.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
If it's social networks with super-linear scaling --

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
more per capita --

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
then the theory says

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
that you increase the pace of life.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
The bigger you are, life gets faster.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
On the left is the heart rate showing biology.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
On the right is the speed of walking

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
in a bunch of European cities,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
showing that increase.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
Lastly, I want to talk about growth.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
This is what we had in biology, just to repeat.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Economies of scale

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
You grow fast and then stop --

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
part of our resilience.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
That would be bad for economies and cities.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theory

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
is that if you have super-linear scaling

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
from wealth creation and innovation,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
then indeed you get, from the same theory,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
And in fact, if you compare it to data,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
it fits very well

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
with the development of cities and economies.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
But it has a terrible catch,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
and the catch

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
is that this system is destined to collapse.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
And it's destined to collapse for many reasons --

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
kind of Malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
And how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
What we do is,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
as we grow and we approach the collapse,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
a major innovation takes place

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
and we start over again,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
and we start over again as we approach the next one, and so on.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
So there's this continuous cycle of innovation

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
that is necessary

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
The catch, however, to this

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
is that you have to innovate

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
faster and faster and faster.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
So the image

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And the question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
avoid a heart attack?

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
So lastly, I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
asking about companies.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
See companies, they scale.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
The top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
It's the same plot.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
This happens to be income and assets

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
We could use sales, anything you like.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
There it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
when companies are innovating,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
they scale beautifully.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
And we've looked at 23,000 companies

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
in the United States, may I say.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
And I'm only showing you a little bit of this.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
What is astonishing about companies

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
is that they scale sublinearly

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
like biology,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
indicating that they're dominated,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
not by super-linear

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
innovation and ideas;

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
they become dominated

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
by economies of scale.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
In that interpretation,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
by bureaucracy and administration,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
and they do it beautifully, may I say.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
So if you tell me the size of some company, some small company,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
I could have predicted the size of Walmart.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
If it has this sublinear scaling,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
the theory says

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
we should have sigmoidal growth.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
That's what we like, hockey sticks.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
But you notice, I've cheated,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
because I've only gone up to '94.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
Let's go up to 2008.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
That red line is from the theory.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
So if I'd have done this in 1994,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
I could have predicted what Walmart would be now.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
And then this is repeated

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
across the entire spectrum of companies.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
There they are. That's 23,000 companies.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
They all start looking like hockey sticks,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
they all bend over,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
and they all die like you and me.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
Thank you.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:27.260
(Applause)
