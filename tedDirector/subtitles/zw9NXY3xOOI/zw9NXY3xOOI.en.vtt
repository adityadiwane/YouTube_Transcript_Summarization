00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
My name is Amit.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and I pitched this idea

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
of doing something with museums and art

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
to my boss who's actually here,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and she allowed me to do it.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And it took 18 months.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
But I'm going to focus on the demo.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and it's access.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And I grew up in India.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
I had a great education -- I'm not complaining --

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
I started learning a lot.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And while working at Google,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
I tried to put this desire

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
to make it more accessible with technology together.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
So we formed a team, a great team of people,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and we started doing this.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I'm going to probably get into the demo

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and then tell you a couple of the interesting things

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
we've had since launch.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.260
So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
You look around at all these museums here.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Two ways of going in -- very simple.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Click and, bang, you're in this museum.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
It doesn't matter where you are --

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
You move around, you have fun.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
You want to navigate around the museum?

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Open the plan up,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
and, in one click, jump.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Keep going. Have fun.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Explore.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.260
(Applause)

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Thanks. I haven't come to the best part.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
(Laughter)

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
"The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
I see this plus sign.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Now this is one of the images.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
So this is all of the meta-data information.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
For those of you who are truly interested in art,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
And this is one of these images that we captured

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
in what we call gigapixel technology.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
So this image, for example,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And I get a lot of people asking me:

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
"What do you get for 10 billion pixels?"

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
You can zoom around very simply.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
You see some fun stuff happening here.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
I love this guy; his expression is priceless.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
But then you really want to go deep.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And so I started playing around,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and I found something going on over here.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
And I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting."

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Went in, and I started noticing

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
that these kids were actually beating something.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
and actually found out that this is a game

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
called squall,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
which involves beating a goose with a stick

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
on Shrove Tuesday.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And apparently it was quite popular.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
I don't know why they did it,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
but I learned something about it.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Now just to give you some perspective,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Here is where we were,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and this is the painting.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:40.260
(Applause)

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
The best is yet to come -- so in a second.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
So now let's just quickly

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
jump into the MoMA, again in New York.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night."

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Now the example I showed you was all about finding details.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
But what if you want to see brush strokes?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And what if you want to see

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
You zoom in. You really go in.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and I'm really going to get to the cracks.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
This is "The Starry Night,"

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
I think, never seen like this before.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
This is the real cool part. It's called Collections.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Any one of you, anybody --

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
if you have a fancy house -- doesn't matter.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
You can go and create your own museum online --

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
create your own collection across all these images.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Very simply, you go in --

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom --

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
you can just zoom around.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
and really get a conversation going

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
about what you're feeling

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
when you go through these masterpieces.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
So I think, in conclusion,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
for me, the main thing

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
I probably shouldn't say that.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
It really comes from these artists.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And that's been my humbling experience in this.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
I mean, I hope in this digital medium

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
that we do justice to their artwork

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
and represent it properly online.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
is, "Did you do this

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
to replicate the experience of going to a museum?"

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
And the answer is no.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
It's to supplement the experience.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
And that's it. Thank you.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
(Applause)

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Thank you.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
(Applause)
