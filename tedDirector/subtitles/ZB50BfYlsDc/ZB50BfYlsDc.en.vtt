00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:17.263
So, we used to solve big problems.

00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:20.783
On July 21st, 1969,

00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:24.370
Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.927
and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.657
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone,

00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:32.943
but their presence on the moon's gray surface

00:00:32.943 --> 00:00:38.074
was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort.

00:00:38.074 --> 00:00:40.118
The Apollo program was the greatest

00:00:40.118 --> 00:00:41.855
peacetime mobilization

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:43.793
in the history of the United States.

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.289
To get to the moon, NASA spent

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.028
around 180 billion dollars in today's money,

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:51.564
or four percent of the federal budget.

00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:54.868
Apollo employed around 400,000 people

00:00:54.868 --> 00:00:57.706
and demanded the collaboration of 20,000

00:00:57.706 --> 00:01:01.402
companies, universities and government agencies.

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:05.346
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.

00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:08.947
But before the Apollo program ended,

00:01:08.947 --> 00:01:11.176
24 men flew to the moon.

00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:14.250
Twelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.603
following the death of Armstrong last year,

00:01:16.603 --> 00:01:18.689
is now the most senior.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.674
So why did they go?

00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:22.591
They didn't bring much back:

00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:25.250
841 pounds of old rocks,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.705
and something all 24 later emphasized --

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:32.567
a new sense of the smallness

00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:35.510
and the fragility of our common home.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.590
Why did they go? The cynical answer is they went

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.566
because President Kennedy wanted to show

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:44.673
the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.

00:01:44.673 --> 00:01:49.145
But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962

00:01:49.145 --> 00:01:51.043
provide a better clue.

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:53.566
(Video) John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon?

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:56.510
Why choose this as our goal?

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.433
And they may well ask,

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:01.012
why climb the highest mountain?

00:02:01.012 --> 00:02:05.028
Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?

00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:07.212
Why does Rice play Texas?

00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:09.823
We choose to go to the moon.

00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:12.400
We choose to go to the moon.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.670
(Applause)

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.584
We choose to go to the moon in this decade,

00:02:20.584 --> 00:02:22.231
and do the other things,

00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:26.560
not because they are easy, but because they are hard.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.730
Jason Pontin: To contemporaries,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.983
Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East

00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:33.198
in the Cold War.

00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:35.203
At the time, the strongest emotion

00:02:35.203 --> 00:02:36.928
was of wonder

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:40.527
at the transcendent powers of technology.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:45.946
They went because it was a big thing to do.

00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:48.466
Landing on the moon occurred in the context

00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:51.631
of a long series of technological triumphs.

00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:54.144
The first half of the 20th century produced

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:56.280
the assembly line and the airplane,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.554
penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:00.856
In the middle years of the century,

00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:04.548
polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.

00:03:04.548 --> 00:03:06.545
Technology itself seemed to possess

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:09.129
what Alvin Toffler in 1970

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.963
called "accelerative thrust."

00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:13.807
For most of human history,

00:03:13.807 --> 00:03:16.095
we could go no faster than a horse

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.196
or a boat with a sail,

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:20.597
but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10

00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:24.480
flew at 25,000 miles an hour.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.380
Since 1970, no human beings

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.262
have been back to the moon.

00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:31.481
No one has traveled faster than the crew

00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:33.087
of Apollo 10,

00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:36.859
and blithe optimism about technology's powers

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.761
has evaporated

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:42.332
as big problems we had imagined technology would solve,

00:03:42.332 --> 00:03:44.635
such as going to Mars,

00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:47.966
creating clean energy, curing cancer,

00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:50.775
or feeding the world have come to seem

00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:53.464
intractably hard.

00:03:53.464 --> 00:03:57.173
I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17.

00:03:57.173 --> 00:03:59.222
I was five years old,

00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:01.590
and my mother told me not to stare

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.725
at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket.

00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:07.166
I vaguely knew this was to be the last

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:08.704
of the moon missions,

00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:12.470
but I was absolutely certain there would be

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.780
Mars colonies in my lifetime.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.343
So "Something happened

00:04:18.343 --> 00:04:22.526
to our capacity to solve big problems with technology"

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:24.918
has become a commonplace.

00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:26.308
You hear it all the time.

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:29.720
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.688
It feels as if technologists have diverted us

00:04:33.688 --> 00:04:36.373
and enriched themselves with trivial toys,

00:04:36.373 --> 00:04:39.878
with things like iPhones and apps and social media,

00:04:39.878 --> 00:04:43.497
or algorithms that speed automated trading.

00:04:43.497 --> 00:04:45.891
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.

00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:48.972
They've expanded and enriched our lives.

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:53.673
But they don't solve humanity's big problems.

00:04:53.673 --> 00:04:54.886
What happened?

00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:59.800
So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.245
which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies

00:05:03.245 --> 00:05:05.547
than it did in the years when it financed

00:05:05.547 --> 00:05:08.705
Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.

00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:11.265
Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame,

00:05:11.265 --> 00:05:14.182
in particular the incentives that venture capitalists

00:05:14.182 --> 00:05:15.762
offer to entrepreneurs.

00:05:15.762 --> 00:05:17.878
Silicon Valley says that venture investing

00:05:17.878 --> 00:05:21.741
shifted away from funding transformational ideas

00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:24.680
and towards funding incremental problems

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.728
or even fake problems.

00:05:26.728 --> 00:05:29.479
But I don't think that explanation is good enough.

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.363
It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.

00:05:33.363 --> 00:05:36.013
Even when venture capitalists were at their most

00:05:36.013 --> 00:05:38.852
risk-happy, they preferred small investments,

00:05:38.852 --> 00:05:42.716
tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.

00:05:42.716 --> 00:05:45.035
V.C.s have always struggled

00:05:45.035 --> 00:05:48.110
to invest profitably in technologies such as energy

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.304
whose capital requirements are huge

00:05:50.304 --> 00:05:53.012
and whose development is long and lengthy,

00:05:53.012 --> 00:05:56.169
and V.C.s have never, never funded the development

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.167
of technologies meant to solve big problems

00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:01.861
that possess no immediate commercial value.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:04.073
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems

00:06:04.073 --> 00:06:08.155
are more complicated and more profound.

00:06:08.155 --> 00:06:11.142
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.

00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:13.560
We could go to Mars if we want.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.427
NASA even has the outline of a plan.

00:06:16.427 --> 00:06:19.916
But going to Mars would follow a political decision

00:06:19.916 --> 00:06:23.270
with popular appeal, and that will never happen.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.012
We won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks

00:06:26.012 --> 00:06:27.961
there are more important things

00:06:27.961 --> 00:06:30.248
to do here on Earth.

00:06:30.248 --> 00:06:33.292
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.796
because our political systems fail.

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:37.894
Today, less than two percent

00:06:37.894 --> 00:06:39.581
of the world's energy consumption

00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:41.747
derives from advanced, renewable sources

00:06:41.747 --> 00:06:44.625
such as solar, wind and biofuels,

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:46.207
less than two percent,

00:06:46.207 --> 00:06:48.311
and the reason is purely economic.

00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:50.504
Coal and natural gas are cheaper

00:06:50.504 --> 00:06:52.249
than solar and wind,

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:54.768
and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels.

00:06:54.768 --> 00:06:57.449
We want alternative energy sources

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:00.450
that can compete on price. None exist.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.155
Now, technologists, business leaders

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:05.651
and economists all basically agree

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:09.152
on what national policies and international treaties

00:07:09.152 --> 00:07:12.436
would spur the development of alternative energy:

00:07:12.436 --> 00:07:15.151
mostly, a significant increase in energy

00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:16.568
research and development,

00:07:16.568 --> 00:07:19.363
and some kind of price on carbon.

00:07:19.363 --> 00:07:22.567
But there's no hope in the present political climate

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.960
that we will see U.S. energy policy

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.727
or international treaties that reflect that consensus.

00:07:29.727 --> 00:07:34.211
Sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological

00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:36.110
turn out not to be so.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.328
Famines were long understood to be caused

00:07:39.328 --> 00:07:41.736
by failures in food supply.

00:07:41.736 --> 00:07:43.991
But 30 years of research have taught us

00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:46.659
that famines are political crises

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:50.173
that catastrophically affect food distribution.

00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:53.136
Technology can improve things like crop yields

00:07:53.136 --> 00:07:57.379
or systems for storing and transporting food,

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:02.624
but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments.

00:08:02.624 --> 00:08:06.139
Finally, big problems sometimes elude solution

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:09.605
because we don't really understand the problem.

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:14.549
President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971,

00:08:14.549 --> 00:08:15.962
but we soon discovered

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:18.495
there are many kinds of cancer,

00:08:18.495 --> 00:08:22.061
most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy,

00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:24.271
and it is only in the last 10 years

00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:26.818
that effective, viable therapies

00:08:26.818 --> 00:08:28.875
have come to seem real.

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:31.925
Hard problems are hard.

00:08:31.925 --> 00:08:36.407
It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.

00:08:36.407 --> 00:08:40.123
We can, we must, but these four elements

00:08:40.123 --> 00:08:41.878
must all be present:

00:08:41.878 --> 00:08:43.822
Political leaders and the public

00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:45.564
must care to solve a problem;

00:08:45.564 --> 00:08:48.735
institutions must support its solution;

00:08:48.735 --> 00:08:51.810
It must really be a technological problem;

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.661
and we must understand it.

00:08:55.661 --> 00:08:57.108
The Apollo mission,

00:08:57.108 --> 00:08:59.845
which has become a kind of metaphor

00:08:59.845 --> 00:09:03.029
for technology's capacity to solve big problems,

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:05.240
met these criteria.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.667
But it is an irreproducible model for the future.

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:10.491
It is not 1961.

00:09:10.491 --> 00:09:14.582
There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War,

00:09:14.582 --> 00:09:16.941
no politician like John Kennedy

00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:20.132
who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous,

00:09:20.132 --> 00:09:23.477
and no popular science fictional mythology

00:09:23.477 --> 00:09:26.583
such as exploring the solar system.

00:09:26.583 --> 00:09:28.985
Most of all, going to the moon

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.847
turned out to be easy.

00:09:30.847 --> 00:09:32.895
It was just three days away.

00:09:32.895 --> 00:09:35.780
And arguably it wasn't even solving

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.384
much of a problem.

00:09:38.384 --> 00:09:42.464
We are left alone with our day,

00:09:42.464 --> 00:09:47.941
and the solutions of the future will be harder won.

00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:50.726
God knows, we don't lack for the challenges.

00:09:50.726 --> 00:09:51.880
Thank you very much.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:57.880
(Applause)
