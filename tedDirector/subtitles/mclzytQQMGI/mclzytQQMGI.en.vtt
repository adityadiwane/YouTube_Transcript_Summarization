00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.711
Chris Anderson: Thank you
so much, Prime Minister,

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:30.926
that was both fascinating
and quite inspiring.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.632
So, you're calling for a global ethic.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.306
Would you describe that
as global citizenship?

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.521
Is that an idea that you believe in,
and how would you define that?

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:43.671
Gordon Brown: It is
about global citizenship

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:45.892
and recognizing
our responsibilities to others.

00:00:45.916 --> 00:00:49.306
There is so much to do
over the next few years

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.306
that is obvious to so many of us

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.966
to build a better world.

00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:58.872
And there is so much shared sense
of what we need to do,

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.902
that it is vital
that we all come together.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:03.628
But we don't necessarily have
the means to do so.

00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:05.446
So there are challenges to be met.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.306
I believe the concept
of global citizenship

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.306
will simply grow out of people talking
to each other across continents.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.764
But of course the task
is to create the institutions

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:16.724
that make that global society work.

00:01:16.748 --> 00:01:18.709
But I don't think we should underestimate

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.306
the extent to which
massive changes in technology

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.515
make possible the linking up
of people across the world.

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.306
CA: But people get excited
about this idea of global citizenship,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.306
but then they get confused a bit again

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
when they start thinking about patriotism,

00:01:32.354 --> 00:01:34.068
and how to combine these two.

00:01:34.092 --> 00:01:36.306
I mean, you're elected as Prime Minister

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.622
with a brief to bat for Britain.

00:01:39.646 --> 00:01:42.726
How do you reconcile the two things?

00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:46.228
GB: Well, of course national identity
remains important.

00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:49.968
But it's not at the expense of people
accepting their global responsibilities.

00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:53.046
And I think one
of the problems of recession

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.173
is that people become more protectionist,

00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:57.982
they look in on themselves,

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.306
they try to protect their own nation,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.578
perhaps at the expense of other nations.

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:06.306
When you actually look
at the motor of the world economy,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.067
it cannot move forward

00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:10.986
unless there is trade
between the different countries.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.525
And any nation that would become
protectionist over the next few years

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.306
would deprive itself of the chance
of getting the benefits

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.406
of growth in the world economy.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.668
So, you've got to have
a healthy sense of patriotism;

00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:24.072
that's absolutely important.

00:02:24.096 --> 00:02:27.382
But you've got to realize
that this world has changed fundamentally,

00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:31.306
and the problems we have cannot be solved
by one nation and one nation alone.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.467
CA: Well, indeed.

00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:35.806
But what do you do
when the two come into conflict

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.831
and you're forced to make a decision

00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:42.306
that either is in Britain's interest,
or the interest of Britons,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.689
or citizens elsewhere in the world?

00:02:44.713 --> 00:02:46.716
GB: Well I think we can persuade people

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.306
that what is necessary
for Britain's long-term interests,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.759
what is necessary
for America's long-term interests,

00:02:52.783 --> 00:02:55.069
is proper engagement
with the rest of the world,

00:02:55.093 --> 00:03:00.000
and taking the action that is necessary.

00:03:00.024 --> 00:03:04.797
There is a great story, again,
told about Richard Nixon.

00:03:04.821 --> 00:03:08.772
1958, Ghana becomes independent,

00:03:08.796 --> 00:03:10.584
so it is just over 50 years ago.

00:03:11.203 --> 00:03:15.194
Richard Nixon goes to represent
the United States government

00:03:15.218 --> 00:03:18.194
at the celebrations
for independence in Ghana.

00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:23.306
And it's one of his first outings
as Vice President to an African country.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.970
He doesn't quite know what to do,

00:03:24.994 --> 00:03:26.743
so he starts going around the crowd

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:28.306
and starts talking to people

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.616
and he says to people
in this rather unique way,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.857
"How does it feel to be free?"

00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:35.603
And he's going around,
"How does it feel to be free?"

00:03:35.627 --> 00:03:37.214
"How does it feel to be free?"

00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:38.340
And then someone says,

00:03:38.364 --> 00:03:40.511
"How should I know? I come from Alabama."

00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:43.306
(Laughter)

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.734
And that was the 1950s.

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:51.028
Now, what is remarkable

00:03:51.052 --> 00:03:54.773
is that civil rights in America
were achieved in the 1960s.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.306
But what is equally remarkable

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.306
is socioeconomic rights in Africa
have not moved forward very fast

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.671
even since the age of colonialism.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.195
And yet, America and Africa
have got a common interest.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.306
And we have got to realize
that if we don't link up

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.306
with those people who are sensible voices
and democratic voices in Africa,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.306
to work together for common causes,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.306
then the danger of Al Qaeda
and related groups

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.306
making progress in Africa is very big.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.306
So, I would say that what seems sometimes

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.148
to be altruism, in relation to Africa,
or in relation to developing countries,

00:04:30.172 --> 00:04:31.321
is more than that.

00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:34.639
It is enlightened self-interest
for us to work with other countries.

00:04:34.663 --> 00:04:36.513
And I would say that national interest

00:04:36.537 --> 00:04:38.646
and, if you like,
what is the global interest

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.750
to tackle poverty and climate change

00:04:40.774 --> 00:04:43.306
do, in the long run, come together.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.569
And whatever the short-run price
for taking action on climate change

00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:49.276
or on security, or taking action
to provide opportunities

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.565
for people for education,

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.791
these are prices that are worth paying

00:04:52.815 --> 00:04:55.306
so that you build
a stronger global society

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.715
where people feel able to feel
comfortable with each other

00:04:58.739 --> 00:05:01.421
and are able to communicate
with each other in such a way

00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:04.786
that you can actually build stronger
links between different countries.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.306
CA: I still just want to draw
out on this issue.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.727
So, you're on vacation at a nice beach,

00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:13.958
and word comes through
that there's been a massive earthquake

00:05:13.982 --> 00:05:16.402
and that there is a tsunami
advancing on the beach.

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:21.183
One end of the beach, there is a house
containing a family of five Nigerians.

00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:23.920
And at the other end of the beach
there is a single Brit.

00:05:24.487 --> 00:05:25.868
You have time to --

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:27.813
(Laughter)

00:05:27.837 --> 00:05:30.171
you have time to alert one house.

00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:31.196
What do you do?

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.306
(Laughter)

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.306
GB: Modern communications.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.306
(Applause)

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.306
Alert both.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.766
(Applause)

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.235
I do agree that my responsibility

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.426
is first of all to make sure
that people in our country are safe.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.760
And I wouldn't like anything
that is said today to suggest

00:05:53.784 --> 00:05:56.513
that I am diminishing the importance
of the responsibility

00:05:56.537 --> 00:05:58.552
that each leader
has for their own country.

00:05:58.957 --> 00:06:02.109
But I'm trying to suggest
that there is a huge opportunity

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:04.426
open to us that was never
open to us before.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.498
But the power to communicate
across borders

00:06:06.522 --> 00:06:09.751
allows us to organize
the world in a different way.

00:06:10.282 --> 00:06:13.854
And I think, look at the tsunami,
it's a classic example.

00:06:13.878 --> 00:06:15.854
Where was the early warning systems?

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.116
Where was the world acting together

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.375
to deal with the problems
that they knew arose

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:23.832
from the potential for earthquakes,

00:06:23.856 --> 00:06:25.953
as well as the potential
for climate change?

00:06:25.977 --> 00:06:28.026
And when the world
starts to work together,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.739
with better early-warning systems,

00:06:29.763 --> 00:06:32.445
you can deal with some
of these problems in a better way.

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:34.592
I just think we're not seeing,
at the moment,

00:06:34.616 --> 00:06:38.546
the huge opportunities open to us
by the ability of people to cooperate

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.547
in a world where either
there was isolationism before

00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:45.306
or there was limited alliances
based on convenience

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.796
which never actually took you to deal
with some of the central problems.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.798
CA: But I think this is the frustration

00:06:50.822 --> 00:06:54.042
that perhaps a lot of people have,
like people in the audience here,

00:06:54.066 --> 00:06:56.955
where we love the kind of language
that you're talking about.

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:57.988
It is inspiring.

00:06:58.012 --> 00:07:01.306
A lot of us believe
that that has to be the world's future.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.306
And yet, when the situation changes,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.112
you suddenly hear
politicians talking as if,

00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:10.306
you know, for example,
the life of one American soldier

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.986
is worth countless numbers
of Iraqi civilians.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.565
When the pedal hits the metal,

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:19.565
the idealism can get moved away.

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:25.426
I'm just wondering whether
you can see that changing over time,

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.306
whether you see in Britain

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.990
that there are changing attitudes,

00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:31.143
and that people are actually
more supportive

00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:34.166
of the kind of global ethic
that you talk about.

00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:37.610
GB: I think every religion, every faith,

00:07:37.634 --> 00:07:40.739
and I'm not just talking here
to people of faith or religion --

00:07:40.763 --> 00:07:44.390
it has this global ethic
at the center of its credo.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.113
And whether it's Jewish
or whether it's Muslim

00:07:48.137 --> 00:07:50.970
or whether it's Hindu,
or whether it's Sikh,

00:07:50.994 --> 00:07:55.989
the same global ethic is at the heart
of each of these religions.

00:07:56.013 --> 00:07:58.306
So, I think you're dealing with something

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:03.121
that people instinctively
see as part of their moral sense.

00:08:03.145 --> 00:08:06.907
So you're building on something
that is not pure self-interest.

00:08:06.931 --> 00:08:10.908
You're building
on people's ideas and values --

00:08:10.932 --> 00:08:16.599
that perhaps they're candles
that burn very dimly on certain occasions.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.208
But it is a set of values that cannot,
in my view, be extinguished.

00:08:21.232 --> 00:08:22.787
Then the question is,

00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:25.469
how do you make that change happen?

00:08:25.493 --> 00:08:29.381
How do you persuade people
that it is in their interest

00:08:29.405 --> 00:08:31.144
to build strong --

00:08:31.168 --> 00:08:32.672
After the Second World War,

00:08:32.696 --> 00:08:35.673
we built institutions, the United Nations,

00:08:35.697 --> 00:08:37.060
the IMF, the World Bank,

00:08:37.084 --> 00:08:39.918
the World Trade Organization,
the Marshall Plan.

00:08:39.942 --> 00:08:43.975
There was a period in which people
talked about an act of creation,

00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:45.976
because these institutions were so new.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.111
But they are now out of date.
They don't deal with the problems.

00:08:49.135 --> 00:08:51.270
You can't deal
with the environmental problem

00:08:51.294 --> 00:08:52.769
through existing institutions.

00:08:52.793 --> 00:08:56.306
You can't deal with the security problem
in the way that you need to.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.902
You can't deal with the economic
and financial problem.

00:08:58.926 --> 00:09:01.306
So we have got to rebuild
our global institutions,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.549
build them in a way that is suitable
to the challenges of this time.

00:09:04.573 --> 00:09:07.641
And I believe that if you look
at the biggest challenge we face,

00:09:07.665 --> 00:09:10.307
it is to persuade people
to have the confidence

00:09:10.331 --> 00:09:12.812
that we can build a truly global society

00:09:12.836 --> 00:09:15.916
with the institutions
that are founded on these rules.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.257
So, I come back to my initial point.

00:09:18.281 --> 00:09:20.282
Sometimes you think things are impossible.

00:09:20.306 --> 00:09:22.259
Nobody would have said 50 years ago

00:09:22.283 --> 00:09:24.306
that apartheid would have gone in 1990,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.729
or that the Berlin wall would have fallen
at the turn of the '80s and '90s,

00:09:28.753 --> 00:09:30.527
or that polio could be eradicated,

00:09:30.551 --> 00:09:31.992
or perhaps 60 years ago,

00:09:32.016 --> 00:09:34.484
nobody would have said
a man could gone to the Moon.

00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:36.306
All these things have happened.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.306
By tackling the impossible,
you make the impossible possible.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:43.306
CA: And we have had a speaker
who said that very thing,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.749
and swallowed a sword right
after that, which was quite dramatic.

00:09:46.773 --> 00:09:47.906
(Laughter)

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.306
GB: Followed my sword and swallow.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:55.306
CA: But, surely a true global ethic
is for someone to say,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.992
"I believe that the life
of every human on the planet

00:09:58.016 --> 00:10:00.993
is worth the same, equal consideration,

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:04.306
regardless of nationality and religion."

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.307
And you have politicians who have --

00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:08.384
you're elected.

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:09.823
In a way, you can't say that.

00:10:09.847 --> 00:10:11.933
Even if, as a human being,
you believe that,

00:10:11.957 --> 00:10:13.326
you can't say that.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.702
You're elected for Britain's interests.

00:10:15.726 --> 00:10:18.306
GB: We have a responsibility to protect.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.606
I mean look, 1918,
the Treaty of Versailles,

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.442
and all the treaties before that,

00:10:23.466 --> 00:10:25.593
the Treaty of Westphalia
and everything else,

00:10:25.617 --> 00:10:28.237
were about protecting
the sovereign right of countries

00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:29.580
to do what they want.

00:10:29.604 --> 00:10:31.856
Since then, the world has moved forward,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.857
partly as a result of what happened
with the Holocaust,

00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:37.728
and people's concern
about the rights of individuals

00:10:37.752 --> 00:10:41.306
within territories
where they need protection,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.131
partly because of what we saw in Rwanda,

00:10:44.155 --> 00:10:46.132
partly because of what we saw in Bosnia.

00:10:46.156 --> 00:10:48.306
The idea of the responsibility to protect

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.306
all individuals who are in situations
where they are at humanitarian risk

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.378
is now being established as a principle
which governs the world.

00:10:55.402 --> 00:10:59.021
So, while I can't automatically say

00:10:59.045 --> 00:11:05.306
that Britain will rush to the aid
of any citizen of any country, in danger,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.306
I can say that Britain is in a position

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.306
where we're working with other countries

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.616
so that this idea
that you have a responsibility

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.918
to protect people who are victims
of either genocide or humanitarian attack,

00:11:17.942 --> 00:11:20.267
is something that is accepted
by the whole world.

00:11:20.291 --> 00:11:22.292
Now, in the end, that can only be achieved

00:11:22.316 --> 00:11:25.894
if your international institutions
work well enough to be able to do so.

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:29.062
And that comes back to what the future
role of the United Nations,

00:11:29.086 --> 00:11:31.306
and what it can do, actually is.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.306
But, the responsibility to protect
is a new idea that is, in a sense,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.962
taken over from the idea
of self-determination

00:11:37.986 --> 00:11:40.733
as the principle governing
the international community.

00:11:40.757 --> 00:11:43.306
CA: Can you picture, in our lifetimes,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.750
a politician ever going out on a platform

00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:51.440
of the kind of full-form global ethic,
global citizenship?

00:11:51.948 --> 00:11:56.616
And basically saying, "I believe
that all people across the planet

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.091
have equal consideration,

00:11:58.115 --> 00:12:00.997
and if in power we will act in that way.

00:12:01.021 --> 00:12:03.298
And we believe that the people
of this country

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:06.299
are also now global citizens
and will support that ethic."

00:12:06.323 --> 00:12:10.208
GB: Is that not what we're doing
in the debate about climate change?

00:12:10.232 --> 00:12:12.978
We're saying that you cannot solve

00:12:13.002 --> 00:12:15.306
the problem of climate change
in one country;

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.153
you've got to involve all countries.

00:12:17.177 --> 00:12:21.748
You're saying that you must, and you have
a duty to help those countries

00:12:21.772 --> 00:12:25.444
that cannot afford to deal with
the problems of climate change themselves.

00:12:25.468 --> 00:12:27.405
You're saying you want a deal

00:12:27.429 --> 00:12:29.540
with all the different
countries of the world

00:12:29.564 --> 00:12:31.176
where we're all bound together

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.306
to cutting carbon emissions in a way
that is to the benefit of the whole world.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.306
We've never had this before
because Kyoto didn't work.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.191
If you could get a deal at Copenhagen,
where people agreed,

00:12:43.215 --> 00:12:46.426
A, that there was a long-term target
for carbon emission cuts,

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.306
B, that there was short-range
targets that had to be met

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.117
so this wasn't just abstract;

00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:53.378
it was people actually
making decisions now

00:12:53.402 --> 00:12:55.166
that would make a difference now,

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.569
and if you could then find
a financing mechanism

00:12:57.593 --> 00:13:00.306
that meant that the poorest countries
that had been hurt

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.426
by our inability to deal
with climate change

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.306
over many, many years and decades

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.212
are given special help

00:13:06.236 --> 00:13:09.306
so that they can move
to energy-efficient technologies,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.124
and they are in a position financially

00:13:12.148 --> 00:13:14.473
to be able to afford
the long-term investment

00:13:14.497 --> 00:13:16.910
that is associated
with cutting carbon emissions,

00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:20.549
then you are treating the world equally,

00:13:20.573 --> 00:13:24.025
by giving consideration
to every part of the planet

00:13:24.049 --> 00:13:25.676
and the needs they have.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.637
It doesn't mean that everybody
does exactly the same thing,

00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:30.969
because we've actually got
to do more financially

00:13:30.993 --> 00:13:32.437
to help the poorest countries,

00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:35.204
but it does mean
there is equal consideration

00:13:35.228 --> 00:13:38.687
for the needs of citizens
in a single planet.

00:13:38.711 --> 00:13:39.726
CA: Yes.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.215
And then of course the theory
is still that those talks get rent apart

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:46.473
by different countries fighting
over their own individual interests.

00:13:46.497 --> 00:13:49.182
GB: Yes, but I think
Europe has got a position,

00:13:49.206 --> 00:13:52.311
which is 27 countries have
already come together.

00:13:52.335 --> 00:13:54.306
I mean, the great difficulty in Europe

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.539
is if you're at a meeting
and 27 people speak,

00:13:56.563 --> 00:13:58.306
it takes a very, very long time.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.127
But we did get an agreement
on climate change.

00:14:02.151 --> 00:14:05.306
America has made
its first disposition on this

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.148
with the bill that President Obama
should be congratulated

00:14:09.172 --> 00:14:10.680
for getting through Congress.

00:14:10.704 --> 00:14:12.885
Japan has made an announcement.

00:14:12.909 --> 00:14:16.306
China and India have signed up
to the scientific evidence.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.174
And now we've got to move them to accept

00:14:19.198 --> 00:14:21.846
a long-term target,
and then short-term targets.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.929
But more progress has been made,
I think, in the last few weeks

00:14:24.953 --> 00:14:26.653
than had been made for some years.

00:14:26.677 --> 00:14:29.957
And I do believe
that there is a strong possibility

00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:33.473
that if we work together, we can get
that agreement to Copenhagen.

00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:35.736
I certainly have been
putting forward proposals

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.569
that would have allowed
the poorest parts of the world

00:14:38.593 --> 00:14:42.636
to feel that we have taken into account
their specific needs.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.637
And we would help them adapt.

00:14:44.661 --> 00:14:48.378
And we would help them make
the transition to a low-carbon economy.

00:14:48.402 --> 00:14:52.164
I do think a reform of the international
institutions is vital to this.

00:14:52.188 --> 00:14:54.489
When the IMF was created in the 1940s,

00:14:54.513 --> 00:14:58.181
it was created with resources that were
five percent or so of the world's GDP.

00:14:58.205 --> 00:15:00.515
The IMF now has limited
resources, one percent.

00:15:00.539 --> 00:15:02.238
It can't really make the difference

00:15:02.262 --> 00:15:04.411
that ought to be made
in a period of crisis.

00:15:04.435 --> 00:15:07.306
So, we've got to rebuild
the world institutions.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.898
And that's a big task:

00:15:08.922 --> 00:15:10.752
persuading all the different countries

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:13.821
with the different voting shares
in these institutions to do so.

00:15:13.845 --> 00:15:17.029
There is a story told
about the three world leaders

00:15:17.053 --> 00:15:21.183
of the day getting a chance
to get some advice from God.

00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:25.710
And the story is told
that Bill Clinton went to God

00:15:25.734 --> 00:15:30.900
and he asked when there will be
successful climate change

00:15:30.924 --> 00:15:32.473
and a low-carbon economy.

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:34.084
And God shook his head and said,

00:15:34.108 --> 00:15:38.227
"Not this year, not this decade,
perhaps not even in [your] lifetime."

00:15:38.251 --> 00:15:41.306
And Bill Clinton walked away in tears

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.426
because he had failed
to get what he wanted.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:47.075
And then the story is that Barroso,
the president of the European Commission,

00:15:47.099 --> 00:15:48.556
went to God and he asked,

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.925
"When will we get
a recovery of global growth?"

00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:55.284
And God said, "Not this year,
not in this decade,

00:15:55.308 --> 00:15:56.927
perhaps not in your lifetime."

00:15:56.951 --> 00:15:59.729
So Barroso walked away
crying and in tears.

00:16:00.707 --> 00:16:05.306
And then the Secretary-General
of the United Nations

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.794
came up to speak to God and said,

00:16:07.818 --> 00:16:10.378
"When will our international
institutions work?"

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.253
And God cried.

00:16:12.277 --> 00:16:16.035
(Laughter)

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:22.705
It is very important to recognize
that this reform of institutions

00:16:22.729 --> 00:16:26.729
is the next stage after
agreeing upon ourselves

00:16:26.753 --> 00:16:29.228
that there is a clear ethic
upon which we can build.

00:16:29.964 --> 00:16:32.695
CA: Prime Minister, I think
there are many in the audience

00:16:32.719 --> 00:16:35.081
who are truly appreciative
of the efforts you made

00:16:35.105 --> 00:16:37.606
in terms of the financial mess
we got ourselves into.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.259
And there are certainly
many people in the audience

00:16:40.283 --> 00:16:43.567
who will be cheering you on as you seek
to advance this global ethic.

00:16:43.591 --> 00:16:45.522
Thank you so much for coming to TED.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:46.855
GB: Well, thank you.

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:49.879
(Applause)
