00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.321
So, I'll start with this: a couple
years ago, an event planner called me

00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:22.394
because I was going
to do a speaking event.

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:24.108
And she called, and she said,

00:00:24.132 --> 00:00:27.704
"I'm really struggling with how
to write about you on the little flyer."

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.776
And I thought,
"Well, what's the struggle?"

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:32.392
And she said, "Well, I saw you speak,

00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:34.901
and I'm going to call you
a researcher, I think,

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:37.813
but I'm afraid if I call you
a researcher, no one will come,

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.296
because they'll think
you're boring and irrelevant."

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.321
(Laughter)

00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:42.921
And I was like, "Okay."

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:45.423
And she said, "But the thing
I liked about your talk

00:00:45.447 --> 00:00:46.663
is you're a storyteller.

00:00:46.687 --> 00:00:49.401
So I think what I'll do
is just call you a storyteller."

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.966
And of course, the academic,
insecure part of me

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.300
was like, "You're going
to call me a what?"

00:00:55.324 --> 00:00:57.872
And she said, "I'm going
to call you a storyteller."

00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:00.745
And I was like, "Why not 'magic pixie'?"

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.248
(Laughter)

00:01:03.648 --> 00:01:06.926
I was like, "Let me think
about this for a second."

00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:09.830
I tried to call deep on my courage.

00:01:09.854 --> 00:01:12.966
And I thought, you know,
I am a storyteller.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.394
I'm a qualitative researcher.

00:01:14.418 --> 00:01:16.139
I collect stories; that's what I do.

00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:19.561
And maybe stories
are just data with a soul.

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:21.966
And maybe I'm just a storyteller.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.649
And so I said, "You know what?

00:01:23.673 --> 00:01:26.314
Why don't you just say
I'm a researcher-storyteller."

00:01:26.338 --> 00:01:29.966
And she went, "Ha ha.
There's no such thing."

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.673
(Laughter)

00:01:31.697 --> 00:01:35.674
So I'm a researcher-storyteller,
and I'm going to talk to you today --

00:01:35.698 --> 00:01:37.747
we're talking about
expanding perception --

00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:40.153
and so I want to talk to you
and tell some stories

00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:45.336
about a piece of my research
that fundamentally expanded my perception

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.249
and really actually changed
the way that I live and love

00:01:48.273 --> 00:01:49.447
and work and parent.

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:52.225
And this is where my story starts.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.673
When I was a young researcher,
doctoral student,

00:01:55.697 --> 00:01:59.674
my first year, I had
a research professor who said to us,

00:01:59.698 --> 00:02:03.644
"Here's the thing, if you cannot
measure it, it does not exist."

00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:07.966
And I thought he was just
sweet-talking me.

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:10.776
I was like, "Really?"
and he was like, "Absolutely."

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.053
And so you have to understand

00:02:13.077 --> 00:02:15.657
that I have a bachelor's
and a master's in social work,

00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:19.055
and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,
so my entire academic career

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.696
was surrounded by people who kind of
believed in the "life's messy, love it."

00:02:25.474 --> 00:02:30.902
And I'm more of the, "life's messy,
clean it up, organize it

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:32.703
and put it into a bento box."

00:02:32.727 --> 00:02:34.703
(Laughter)

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.331
And so to think that I had found my way,
to found a career that takes me --

00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:43.688
really, one of the big sayings
in social work is,

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:45.807
"Lean into the discomfort of the work."

00:02:46.537 --> 00:02:49.069
And I'm like, knock discomfort
upside the head

00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:51.371
and move it over and get all A's.

00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:53.307
That was my mantra.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.966
So I was very excited about this.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.966
And so I thought, you know what,
this is the career for me,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.966
because I am interested
in some messy topics.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.361
But I want to be able
to make them not messy.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.707
I want to understand them.

00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:10.308
I want to hack into these things
that I know are important

00:03:10.332 --> 00:03:12.308
and lay the code out for everyone to see.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.649
So where I started was with connection.

00:03:15.673 --> 00:03:19.085
Because, by the time
you're a social worker for 10 years,

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.816
what you realize is that connection
is why we're here.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.220
It's what gives purpose
and meaning to our lives.

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:28.862
This is what it's all about.

00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:30.983
It doesn't matter whether
you talk to people

00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:34.099
who work in social justice,
mental health and abuse and neglect,

00:03:34.123 --> 00:03:39.464
what we know is that connection,
the ability to feel connected, is --

00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:41.966
neurobiologically
that's how we're wired --

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.369
it's why we're here.

00:03:43.393 --> 00:03:46.406
So I thought, you know what,
I'm going to start with connection.

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:48.964
Well, you know that situation

00:03:48.988 --> 00:03:51.496
where you get an evaluation
from your boss,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.306
and she tells you 37 things
that you do really awesome,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.704
and one "opportunity for growth?"

00:03:56.728 --> 00:03:58.537
(Laughter)

00:03:59.196 --> 00:04:02.664
And all you can think about
is that opportunity for growth, right?

00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:05.386
Well, apparently this is the way
my work went as well,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.387
because, when you ask people about love,
they tell you about heartbreak.

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:13.045
When you ask people about belonging,

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.021
they'll tell you their most excruciating
experiences of being excluded.

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:19.546
And when you ask people about connection,

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.108
the stories they told me
were about disconnection.

00:04:23.118 --> 00:04:26.143
So very quickly -- really about six weeks
into this research --

00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:32.189
I ran into this unnamed thing
that absolutely unraveled connection

00:04:32.213 --> 00:04:34.673
in a way that I didn't understand
or had never seen.

00:04:35.109 --> 00:04:37.086
And so I pulled back out of the research

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.340
and thought, I need
to figure out what this is.

00:04:39.364 --> 00:04:41.543
And it turned out to be shame.

00:04:43.212 --> 00:04:46.490
And shame is really easily understood
as the fear of disconnection:

00:04:47.213 --> 00:04:51.769
Is there something about me that,
if other people know it or see it,

00:04:51.793 --> 00:04:54.959
that I won't be worthy of connection?

00:04:55.593 --> 00:04:57.275
The things I can tell you about it:

00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:58.966
It's universal; we all have it.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.990
The only people who don't experience shame

00:05:01.014 --> 00:05:03.348
have no capacity for human
empathy or connection.

00:05:03.372 --> 00:05:04.966
No one wants to talk about it,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.561
and the less you talk about it,
the more you have it.

00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:14.171
What underpinned this shame,
this "I'm not good enough," --

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:15.799
which, we all know that feeling:

00:05:15.823 --> 00:05:17.872
"I'm not blank enough.
I'm not thin enough,

00:05:17.896 --> 00:05:21.150
rich enough, beautiful enough,
smart enough, promoted enough."

00:05:21.174 --> 00:05:26.150
The thing that underpinned this
was excruciating vulnerability.

00:05:26.862 --> 00:05:30.966
This idea of, in order
for connection to happen,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.736
we have to allow ourselves
to be seen, really seen.

00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:39.259
And you know how I feel
about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.

00:05:39.283 --> 00:05:43.781
And so I thought, this is my chance
to beat it back with my measuring stick.

00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:46.496
I'm going in, I'm going
to figure this stuff out,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.830
I'm going to spend a year,
I'm going to totally deconstruct shame,

00:05:49.854 --> 00:05:52.132
I'm going to understand
how vulnerability works,

00:05:52.156 --> 00:05:53.591
and I'm going to outsmart it.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.910
So I was ready, and I was really excited.

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:02.382
As you know,
it's not going to turn out well.

00:06:02.406 --> 00:06:04.919
(Laughter)

00:06:04.943 --> 00:06:06.537
You know this.

00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:08.450
So, I could tell you a lot about shame,

00:06:08.474 --> 00:06:10.571
but I'd have to borrow
everyone else's time.

00:06:10.595 --> 00:06:13.452
But here's what I can tell you
that it boils down to --

00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:16.858
and this may be one of the most important
things that I've ever learned

00:06:16.882 --> 00:06:18.746
in the decade of doing this research.

00:06:20.068 --> 00:06:24.260
My one year turned into six years:

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:28.966
Thousands of stories, hundreds
of long interviews, focus groups.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.371
At one point, people were
sending me journal pages

00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:33.232
and sending me their stories --

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:37.248
thousands of pieces of data in six years.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.966
And I kind of got a handle on it.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.089
I kind of understood, this is
what shame is, this is how it works.

00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:49.699
I wrote a book, I published a theory,
but something was not okay --

00:06:49.723 --> 00:06:53.879
and what it was is that, if I roughly
took the people I interviewed

00:06:53.903 --> 00:07:00.475
and divided them into people who really
have a sense of worthiness --

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:03.261
that's what this comes down to,
a sense of worthiness --

00:07:03.285 --> 00:07:06.507
they have a strong sense
of love and belonging --

00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:08.182
and folks who struggle for it,

00:07:08.206 --> 00:07:11.306
and folks who are always wondering
if they're good enough.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.569
There was only one variable that separated

00:07:13.593 --> 00:07:16.333
the people who have a strong sense
of love and belonging

00:07:16.357 --> 00:07:18.616
and the people who really struggle for it.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.358
And that was, the people who have
a strong sense of love and belonging

00:07:22.382 --> 00:07:24.786
believe they're worthy
of love and belonging.

00:07:25.704 --> 00:07:26.854
That's it.

00:07:27.505 --> 00:07:28.993
They believe they're worthy.

00:07:30.736 --> 00:07:36.554
And to me, the hard part of the one thing
that keeps us out of connection

00:07:36.578 --> 00:07:39.793
is our fear that we're not
worthy of connection,

00:07:39.817 --> 00:07:42.220
was something that,
personally and professionally,

00:07:42.244 --> 00:07:44.466
I felt like I needed to understand better.

00:07:44.807 --> 00:07:49.784
So what I did is I took
all of the interviews

00:07:49.808 --> 00:07:52.626
where I saw worthiness,
where I saw people living that way,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.538
and just looked at those.

00:07:55.314 --> 00:07:57.362
What do these people have in common?

00:07:57.386 --> 00:08:02.029
I have a slight office supply addiction,
but that's another talk.

00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:05.530
So I had a manila folder,
and I had a Sharpie,

00:08:05.554 --> 00:08:08.174
and I was like, what am I going
to call this research?

00:08:08.198 --> 00:08:11.188
And the first words that came
to my mind were "whole-hearted."

00:08:11.807 --> 00:08:15.323
These are whole-hearted people,
living from this deep sense of worthiness.

00:08:15.347 --> 00:08:18.203
So I wrote at the top
of the manila folder,

00:08:18.227 --> 00:08:20.156
and I started looking at the data.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:26.173
In fact, I did it first in a four-day,
very intensive data analysis,

00:08:26.197 --> 00:08:29.774
where I went back, pulled the interviews,
the stories, pulled the incidents.

00:08:29.798 --> 00:08:31.577
What's the theme? What's the pattern?

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.347
My husband left town with the kids

00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:38.348
because I always go into this
Jackson Pollock crazy thing,

00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:42.117
where I'm just writing
and in my researcher mode.

00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:45.172
And so here's what I found.

00:08:48.114 --> 00:08:50.966
What they had in common
was a sense of courage.

00:08:51.624 --> 00:08:54.721
And I want to separate courage
and bravery for you for a minute.

00:08:54.745 --> 00:08:57.186
Courage, the original
definition of courage,

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.449
when it first came
into the English language --

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:01.826
it's from the Latin word "cor,"
meaning "heart" --

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.861
and the original definition was to tell
the story of who you are

00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:06.299
with your whole heart.

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:11.233
And so these folks had, very simply,
the courage to be imperfect.

00:09:13.632 --> 00:09:18.609
They had the compassion to be kind
to themselves first and then to others,

00:09:18.633 --> 00:09:19.832
because, as it turns out,

00:09:19.856 --> 00:09:22.090
we can't practice compassion
with other people

00:09:22.114 --> 00:09:23.857
if we can't treat ourselves kindly.

00:09:24.259 --> 00:09:28.656
And the last was they had connection,
and -- this was the hard part --

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.657
as a result of authenticity,

00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:34.966
they were willing to let go
of who they thought they should be

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.594
in order to be who they were,
which you have to absolutely do that

00:09:39.618 --> 00:09:40.791
for connection.

00:09:43.323 --> 00:09:47.323
The other thing that they had
in common was this:

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.990
They fully embraced vulnerability.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:10:02.330
They believed that what made them
vulnerable made them beautiful.

00:10:06.141 --> 00:10:09.966
They didn't talk about vulnerability
being comfortable,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.816
nor did they really talk
about it being excruciating --

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.318
as I had heard it earlier
in the shame interviewing.

00:10:15.342 --> 00:10:17.572
They just talked about it being necessary.

00:10:18.633 --> 00:10:22.609
They talked about the willingness
to say, "I love you" first ...

00:10:24.378 --> 00:10:29.751
the willingness to do something
where there are no guarantees ...

00:10:31.283 --> 00:10:35.618
the willingness to breathe
through waiting for the doctor to call

00:10:35.642 --> 00:10:36.925
after your mammogram.

00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:41.896
They're willing to invest
in a relationship

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.370
that may or may not work out.

00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:46.335
They thought this was fundamental.

00:10:47.442 --> 00:10:50.061
I personally thought it was betrayal.

00:10:50.847 --> 00:10:55.443
I could not believe I had pledged
allegiance to research, where our job --

00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:59.531
you know, the definition of research
is to control and predict,

00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:04.198
to study phenomena for the explicit
reason to control and predict.

00:11:04.222 --> 00:11:08.588
And now my mission to control and predict

00:11:08.612 --> 00:11:12.181
had turned up the answer
that the way to live is with vulnerability

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:14.303
and to stop controlling and predicting.

00:11:14.327 --> 00:11:16.104
This led to a little breakdown --

00:11:16.902 --> 00:11:21.966
(Laughter)

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.966
-- which actually looked more like this.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.483
(Laughter)

00:11:26.507 --> 00:11:28.484
And it did.

00:11:28.508 --> 00:11:31.688
I call it a breakdown; my therapist
calls it a spiritual awakening.

00:11:31.712 --> 00:11:32.946
(Laughter)

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.387
A spiritual awakening
sounds better than breakdown,

00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:37.188
but I assure you, it was a breakdown.

00:11:37.212 --> 00:11:40.116
And I had to put my data away
and go find a therapist.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.371
Let me tell you something:
you know who you are

00:11:42.395 --> 00:11:45.635
when you call your friends and say,
"I think I need to see somebody.

00:11:45.659 --> 00:11:47.465
Do you have any recommendations?"

00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:49.538
Because about five
of my friends were like,

00:11:49.562 --> 00:11:51.706
"Wooo, I wouldn't want
to be your therapist."

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.468
(Laughter)

00:11:54.492 --> 00:11:56.469
I was like, "What does that mean?"

00:11:56.493 --> 00:11:59.700
And they're like,
"I'm just saying, you know.

00:11:59.724 --> 00:12:01.701
Don't bring your measuring stick."

00:12:01.725 --> 00:12:04.461
(Laughter)

00:12:04.485 --> 00:12:05.685
I was like, "Okay."

00:12:06.545 --> 00:12:08.379
So I found a therapist.

00:12:08.403 --> 00:12:10.306
My first meeting with her, Diana --

00:12:12.109 --> 00:12:16.403
I brought in my list of the way
the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.

00:12:16.427 --> 00:12:18.236
And she said, "How are you?"

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.855
And I said, "I'm great. I'm okay."

00:12:21.879 --> 00:12:23.403
She said, "What's going on?"

00:12:23.427 --> 00:12:26.046
And this is a therapist
who sees therapists,

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:31.283
because we have to go to those,
because their B.S. meters are good.

00:12:31.307 --> 00:12:33.283
(Laughter)

00:12:33.736 --> 00:12:37.569
And so I said, "Here's the thing,
I'm struggling."

00:12:37.593 --> 00:12:39.403
And she said, "What's the struggle?"

00:12:40.442 --> 00:12:42.703
And I said, "Well, I have
a vulnerability issue.

00:12:42.727 --> 00:12:48.082
And I know that vulnerability
is the core of shame and fear

00:12:48.106 --> 00:12:49.703
and our struggle for worthiness,

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:55.403
but it appears that it's also
the birthplace of joy, of creativity,

00:12:55.427 --> 00:12:57.403
of belonging, of love.

00:12:57.776 --> 00:13:03.212
And I think I have a problem,
and I need some help."

00:13:03.236 --> 00:13:08.403
And I said, "But here's the thing:
no family stuff, no childhood shit."

00:13:08.427 --> 00:13:10.403
(Laughter)

00:13:10.427 --> 00:13:13.403
"I just need some strategies."

00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:17.403
(Laughter)

00:13:17.427 --> 00:13:21.012
(Applause)

00:13:21.036 --> 00:13:22.598
Thank you.

00:13:24.283 --> 00:13:25.760
So she goes like this.

00:13:27.427 --> 00:13:29.783
(Laughter)

00:13:29.807 --> 00:13:32.403
And then I said, "It's bad, right?"

00:13:32.427 --> 00:13:35.403
And she said, "It's neither good nor bad."

00:13:35.427 --> 00:13:37.260
(Laughter)

00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:38.918
"It just is what it is."

00:13:39.664 --> 00:13:42.403
And I said, "Oh my God,
this is going to suck."

00:13:42.427 --> 00:13:44.379
(Laughter)

00:13:45.593 --> 00:13:47.847
And it did, and it didn't.

00:13:47.871 --> 00:13:49.934
And it took about a year.

00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.974
And you know how there are people

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:56.022
that, when they realize that vulnerability
and tenderness are important,

00:13:56.046 --> 00:13:58.077
that they surrender and walk into it.

00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:01.191
A: that's not me,

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:03.612
and B: I don't even hang out
with people like that.

00:14:03.636 --> 00:14:06.403
(Laughter)

00:14:06.427 --> 00:14:08.514
For me, it was a yearlong street fight.

00:14:09.752 --> 00:14:10.926
It was a slugfest.

00:14:11.339 --> 00:14:13.173
Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back.

00:14:13.593 --> 00:14:16.680
I lost the fight,

00:14:16.704 --> 00:14:18.403
but probably won my life back.

00:14:18.727 --> 00:14:20.703
And so then I went back into the research

00:14:20.727 --> 00:14:22.403
and spent the next couple of years

00:14:22.427 --> 00:14:25.403
really trying to understand
what they, the whole-hearted,

00:14:25.427 --> 00:14:31.403
what choices they were making,
and what we are doing with vulnerability.

00:14:31.427 --> 00:14:33.767
Why do we struggle with it so much?

00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:35.952
Am I alone in struggling
with vulnerability?

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.403
No.

00:14:38.427 --> 00:14:39.888
So this is what I learned.

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:43.626
We numb vulnerability --

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.267
when we're waiting for the call.

00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:49.180
It was funny, I sent something out
on Twitter and on Facebook

00:14:49.204 --> 00:14:51.478
that says, "How would you
define vulnerability?

00:14:51.502 --> 00:14:53.050
What makes you feel vulnerable?"

00:14:53.074 --> 00:14:55.798
And within an hour and a half,
I had 150 responses.

00:14:55.822 --> 00:14:58.795
Because I wanted to know what's out there.

00:15:01.204 --> 00:15:06.227
Having to ask my husband for help
because I'm sick, and we're newly married;

00:15:06.251 --> 00:15:08.258
initiating sex with my husband;

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:10.996
initiating sex with my wife;

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.998
being turned down; asking someone out;

00:15:14.022 --> 00:15:16.061
waiting for the doctor to call back;

00:15:16.085 --> 00:15:18.427
getting laid off; laying off people.

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:19.855
This is the world we live in.

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:23.930
We live in a vulnerable world.

00:15:23.954 --> 00:15:26.890
And one of the ways we deal
with it is we numb vulnerability.

00:15:27.688 --> 00:15:29.403
And I think there's evidence --

00:15:29.427 --> 00:15:31.808
and it's not the only reason
this evidence exists,

00:15:31.832 --> 00:15:33.941
but I think it's a huge cause --

00:15:33.965 --> 00:15:36.854
We are the most in-debt ...

00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:39.760
obese ...

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:45.069
addicted and medicated
adult cohort in U.S. history.

00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:51.585
The problem is -- and I learned this
from the research --

00:15:51.609 --> 00:15:54.752
that you cannot selectively numb emotion.

00:15:55.291 --> 00:15:57.624
You can't say, here's the bad stuff.

00:15:58.427 --> 00:16:00.803
Here's vulnerability,
here's grief, here's shame,

00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:02.503
here's fear, here's disappointment.

00:16:02.527 --> 00:16:04.403
I don't want to feel these.

00:16:04.427 --> 00:16:07.309
I'm going to have a couple of beers
and a banana nut muffin.

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:10.019
(Laughter)

00:16:10.043 --> 00:16:11.912
I don't want to feel these.

00:16:11.936 --> 00:16:13.912
And I know that's knowing laughter.

00:16:13.936 --> 00:16:16.403
I hack into your lives for a living.

00:16:16.427 --> 00:16:18.403
God.

00:16:18.427 --> 00:16:20.974
(Laughter)

00:16:20.998 --> 00:16:23.756
You can't numb those hard feelings

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.414
without numbing
the other affects, our emotions.

00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:27.890
You cannot selectively numb.

00:16:27.914 --> 00:16:30.521
So when we numb those,

00:16:30.545 --> 00:16:33.068
we numb joy,

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:34.403
we numb gratitude,

00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:35.727
we numb happiness.

00:16:37.148 --> 00:16:40.271
And then, we are miserable,

00:16:40.295 --> 00:16:42.304
and we are looking
for purpose and meaning,

00:16:42.328 --> 00:16:43.760
and then we feel vulnerable,

00:16:43.784 --> 00:16:46.592
so then we have a couple of beers
and a banana nut muffin.

00:16:46.616 --> 00:16:49.982
And it becomes this dangerous cycle.

00:16:51.087 --> 00:16:54.220
One of the things that I think
we need to think about

00:16:54.244 --> 00:16:56.220
is why and how we numb.

00:16:56.928 --> 00:16:59.008
And it doesn't just have to be addiction.

00:17:00.477 --> 00:17:03.850
The other thing we do is we make
everything that's uncertain certain.

00:17:05.427 --> 00:17:10.513
Religion has gone from a belief
in faith and mystery to certainty.

00:17:10.537 --> 00:17:12.219
"I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up."

00:17:14.187 --> 00:17:15.403
That's it.

00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:17.881
Just certain.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.756
The more afraid we are,
the more vulnerable we are,

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.165
the more afraid we are.

00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:24.196
This is what politics looks like today.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.895
There's no discourse anymore.

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:27.403
There's no conversation.

00:17:27.807 --> 00:17:29.031
There's just blame.

00:17:29.055 --> 00:17:31.372
You know how blame
is described in the research?

00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:35.052
A way to discharge pain and discomfort.

00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:38.806
We perfect.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.608
If there's anyone who wants their life
to look like this, it would be me,

00:17:42.632 --> 00:17:43.859
but it doesn't work.

00:17:43.883 --> 00:17:47.503
Because what we do is we take fat
from our butts and put it in our cheeks.

00:17:47.527 --> 00:17:50.966
(Laughter)

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.403
Which just, I hope in 100 years,
people will look back and go, "Wow."

00:17:54.427 --> 00:17:56.950
(Laughter)

00:17:56.974 --> 00:18:00.403
And we perfect,
most dangerously, our children.

00:18:00.427 --> 00:18:02.570
Let me tell you what we think
about children.

00:18:02.594 --> 00:18:05.403
They're hardwired for struggle
when they get here.

00:18:05.427 --> 00:18:08.309
And when you hold those perfect
little babies in your hand,

00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:11.291
our job is not to say,
"Look at her, she's perfect.

00:18:11.315 --> 00:18:13.211
My job is just to keep her perfect --

00:18:13.235 --> 00:18:16.642
make sure she makes the tennis team
by fifth grade and Yale by seventh."

00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:17.903
That's not our job.

00:18:17.927 --> 00:18:19.536
Our job is to look and say,

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.576
"You know what? You're imperfect,
and you're wired for struggle,

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.600
but you are worthy of love and belonging."

00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:26.688
That's our job.

00:18:27.104 --> 00:18:29.334
Show me a generation
of kids raised like that,

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.959
and we'll end the problems,
I think, that we see today.

00:18:31.983 --> 00:18:37.435
We pretend that what we do
doesn't have an effect on people.

00:18:38.871 --> 00:18:40.505
We do that in our personal lives.

00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:41.752
We do that corporate --

00:18:41.776 --> 00:18:43.886
whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ...

00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:46.546
a recall.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.547
We pretend like what we're doing

00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:50.657
doesn't have a huge impact
on other people.

00:18:51.427 --> 00:18:54.701
I would say to companies,
this is not our first rodeo, people.

00:18:55.769 --> 00:18:58.436
We just need you to be authentic
and real and say ...

00:18:59.919 --> 00:19:02.063
"We're sorry. We'll fix it."

00:19:05.535 --> 00:19:08.307
But there's another way,
and I'll leave you with this.

00:19:08.331 --> 00:19:09.712
This is what I have found:

00:19:09.736 --> 00:19:14.259
To let ourselves be seen,
deeply seen, vulnerably seen ...

00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:21.280
to love with our whole hearts,
even though there's no guarantee --

00:19:21.304 --> 00:19:22.558
and that's really hard,

00:19:22.582 --> 00:19:25.923
and I can tell you as a parent,
that's excruciatingly difficult --

00:19:28.495 --> 00:19:32.677
to practice gratitude and joy
in those moments of terror,

00:19:32.701 --> 00:19:35.014
when we're wondering,
"Can I love you this much?

00:19:35.038 --> 00:19:37.224
Can I believe in this this passionately?

00:19:37.248 --> 00:19:39.178
Can I be this fierce about this?"

00:19:39.202 --> 00:19:42.779
just to be able to stop and, instead of
catastrophizing what might happen,

00:19:42.803 --> 00:19:44.780
to say, "I'm just so grateful,

00:19:44.804 --> 00:19:47.204
because to feel this vulnerable
means I'm alive."

00:19:48.748 --> 00:19:52.410
And the last, which I think
is probably the most important,

00:19:52.434 --> 00:19:54.084
is to believe that we're enough.

00:19:54.664 --> 00:19:58.513
Because when we work from a place,
I believe, that says, "I'm enough" ...

00:20:00.743 --> 00:20:04.711
then we stop screaming
and start listening,

00:20:04.735 --> 00:20:07.062
we're kinder and gentler
to the people around us,

00:20:07.086 --> 00:20:09.235
and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.

00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:11.603
That's all I have. Thank you.

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:14.220
