00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
about two years ago.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I was in the desert, under the starry skies

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And we were in conversation

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
about how nothing had changed

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
since the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata."

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Now we do the same with airplanes.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Back then,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Now we do the same

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
with drills and machines.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
The conclusion that we came to

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
was that magic had been replaced

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
by machinery.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And this made me really sad.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I was terrified by this idea

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
that I would lose the ability

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
to enjoy and appreciate the sunset

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And it felt like technology

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
should enable magic, not kill it.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
When I was a little girl,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And this piece of 50-year-old technology

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
became the most magical thing to me.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
It became a gilded gateway

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and images in my imagination.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
So I felt like our cellphones

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and our fancy watches and our cameras

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
had stopped us from dreaming.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
They stopped us from being inspired.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
to see how I could use it to enable magic

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
as opposed to kill it.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
I've been illustrating books since I was 16.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And so when I saw the iPad,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
I saw it as a storytelling device

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that could connect readers all over the world.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
It can know how we're holding it.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
It can know where we are.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
It brings together image and text

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and animation and sound and touch.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Storytelling is becoming

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
more and more multi-sensorial.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
But what are we doing with it?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
an interactive app for the iPad.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
So it says, "Place your fingers

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
upon each light."

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And so --

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:41.260
(Music)

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.260
It says, "This box belongs to ... "

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And so I type in my name.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And actually I become a character in the book.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
At various points, a little letter drops down to me --

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS --

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
which is actually addressed to me.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
The child in me is really excited

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
by these kinds of possibilities.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Now I've been talking a lot about magic.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
And I don't mean wizards and dragons,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
I mean the kind of childhood magic,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
those ideas that we all harbored as children.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
was always really exciting to me.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
And so over here you need to tilt your iPad,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
take the fireflies out.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
was that an entire galaxy could be contained

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
within a single marble.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And so over here,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
each book and each world

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
becomes a little marble

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
that I drag in

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
to this magical device within the device.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And it opens up a map.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
All along, all fantasy books have always had maps,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
but these maps have been static.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
This is a map that grows and glows

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
So I'm just going to enter in.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Another thing that's actually really important to me

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
is creating content that is Indian

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
and yet very contemporary.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Over here, these are the Apsaras.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
but how many people outside of India

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.260
These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
in an old and musty book.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
And so we're bringing them back

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
in a contemporary story for children.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And a story that actually deals with new issues

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
like the environmental crisis.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
(Music)

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Speaking of the environmental crisis,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
is that children have been locked inside their rooms,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
But now with mobile technology,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
we can actually take our children outside into the natural world

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
with their technology.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
One of the interactions in the book

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
is that you're sent off on this quest

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
where you need to go outside,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
take out your camera on the iPad

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
and collect pictures of different natural objects.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
When I was a child, I had multiple collections

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And somehow kids don't do that anymore.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
So in bringing back this childhood ritual,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
you need to go out

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
and then tag it.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
and then tag that.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And what happens

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
that you can then put up online.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
A child in London puts up a picture of a fox

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today."

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today."

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And it creates this kind of social network

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
around a collection of digital photographs

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
that you've actually taken.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
In the possibilities of linking together

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
magic, the earth and technology,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
there are multiple possibilities.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
In the next book, we plan on having an interaction

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
where you take your iPad out with the video on

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and through augmented reality,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
you see this layer of animated pixies

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.260
appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and read the rest of the book.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
We're moving, we're all moving here,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
to a world where the forces of nature

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
come closer together to technology,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
and magic and technology can come closer together.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
We're harnessing energy from the sun.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
We're bringing our children and ourselves

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
closer to the natural world

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and that magic and joy

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and childhood love that we had

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
through the simple medium of a story.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
Thank you.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:30.260
(Applause)
