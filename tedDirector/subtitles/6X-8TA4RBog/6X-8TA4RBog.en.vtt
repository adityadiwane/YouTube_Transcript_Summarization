00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
It's a great pleasure to be here.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
It's a great pleasure to speak after

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Brian Cox from CERN.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I think CERN is the home

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
of the Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider?

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Where is the Small Hadron Collider?

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Now, the Small Hadron Collider

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
is in a cupboard, overlooked and neglected.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
You know when the Large Hadron Collider started,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and it didn't work, and people tried to work out why,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
it was the Small Hadron Collider team

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
who sabotaged it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
because they were so jealous.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
The whole Hadron Collider family

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
needs unlocking.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
The lesson of Brian's presentation, in a way --

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
all those fantastic pictures --

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
is this really:

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
that vantage point determines everything that you see.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
What Brian was saying was

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
science has opened up successively different vantage points

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
from which we can see ourselves,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and that's why it's so valuable.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
So the vantage point you take

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
determines virtually everything that you will see.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
The question that you will ask

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
will determine much of the answer that you get.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And so if you ask this question:

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Where would you look to see the future of education?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
The answer that we've traditionally given to that

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
is very straightforward, at least in the last 20 years:

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
You go to Finland.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
but by golly, they are qualified.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And they have absolutely amazing education systems.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
So we all troop off to Finland,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and then we struggle to imagine how we might

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
bring lessons back.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Well, so, for this last year,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
with the help of Cisco who sponsored me,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
for some balmy reason, to do this,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I've been looking somewhere else.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Because actually radical innovation does sometimes

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
come from the very best,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
but it often comes from places

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
where you have huge need --

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
unmet, latent demand --

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work --

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
traditional, high-cost solutions,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
which depend on professionals,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
which is what schools and hospitals are.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
So I ended up in places like this.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
This is a place called Monkey Hill.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
It's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Most of the population growth of the next 50 years

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
will be in cities.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
We'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
for the next 30 years.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Almost all of that growth will be in the developed world.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Almost all of that growth will be

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
in places like Monkey Hill.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
This is where you'll find the fastest growing

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
young populations of the world.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
So if you want recipes to work --

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
for virtually anything -- health, education,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
government politics

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
and education --

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
you have to go to these places.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And if you go to these places, you meet people like this.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
This is a guy called Juanderson.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
At the age of 14,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
in common with many 14-year-olds in the Brazilian education system,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
he dropped out of school.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
It was boring.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
And Juanderson, instead, went into

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
what provided kind of opportunity and hope

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
in the place that he lived, which was the drugs trade.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And by the age of 16, with rapid promotion,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
he was running the drugs trade in 10 favelas.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
He was turning over 200,000 dollars a week.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
He employed 200 people.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
He was going to be dead by the age of 25.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And luckily, he met this guy,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
who is Rodrigo Baggio,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
1994, Rodrigo started something

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
called CDI,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
which took computers

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
donated by corporations,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
put them into community centers in favelas

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and created places like this.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
What turned Juanderson around

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
was technology for learning

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
that made learning fun and accessible.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
Or you can go to places like this.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
This is Kibera, which is the largest slum in East Africa.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Millions of people living here,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
stretched over many kilometers.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And there I met these two,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Azra on the left, Maureen on the right.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
They just finished their Kenyan certificate

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
of secondary education.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
That name should tell you that the Kenyan education system

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
borrows almost everything

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
from Britain, circa 1950,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
but has managed to make it even worse.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
So there are schools in slums like this.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
They're places like this.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
That's where Maureen went to school.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
They're private schools. There are no state schools in slums.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And the education they got was pitiful.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
It was in places like this. This a school set up by some nuns

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
in another slum called Nakuru.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Half the children in this classroom have no parents

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
because they've died through AIDS.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
The other half have one parent

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
because the other parent has died through AIDS.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
So the challenges of education

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
in this kind of place

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
They are to stay alive, to earn a living,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
to not become HIV positive.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
The one technology that spans rich and poor

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
in places like this

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
is not anything to do with industrial technology.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
It's not to do with electricity or water.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
It's the mobile phone.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
If you want to design from scratch

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
virtually any service in Africa,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
you would start now with the mobile phone.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Or you could go to places like this.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
which is a very developed slum

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
about 25 minutes outside New Delhi,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
where I met these characters

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
who showed me around for the day.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
The remarkable thing about these girls,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
and the sign of the kind of social revolution

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
sweeping through the developing world

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
is that these girls are not married.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
Ten years ago, they certainly would have been married.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Now they're not married, and they want to go on

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
to study further, to have a career.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
They've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
who have never ever done homework.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
All across the developing world there are millions of parents --

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
tens, hundreds of millions --

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
who for the first time

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
are with children doing homework and exams.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
And the reason they carry on studying

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
is not because they went to a school like this.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
This is a private school.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
This is a fee-pay school. This is a good school.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
This is the best you can get

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
in Hyderabad in Indian education.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
The reason they went on studying was this.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
This is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
by a revolutionary social entrepreneur

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
called Sugata Mitra

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
who has conducted the most radical experiments,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
showing that children, in the right conditions,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
can learn on their own with the help of computers.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Those girls have never touched Google.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
They know nothing about Wikipedia.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Imagine what their lives would be like

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
if you could get that to them.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
So if you look, as I did,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
through this tour,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
and by looking at about a hundred case studies

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
of different social entrepreneurs

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
working in these very extreme conditions,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
look at the recipes that they come up with for learning,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
they look nothing like school.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
What do they look like?

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Well, education is a global religion.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And education, plus technology,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
is a great source of hope.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
You can go to places like this.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
This is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
Many of them don't have electricity at home.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
But they find it completely obvious

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
to use computers, websites,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
make videos, so on and so forth.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
When you go to places like this

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
what you see is that

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
education in these settings

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
works by pull, not push.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Most of our education system is push.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
I was literally pushed to school.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
When you get to school, things are pushed at you:

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
knowledge, exams,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
systems, timetables.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
If you want to attract people like Juanderson

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
who could, for instance,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
buy guns, wear jewelry,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
ride motorbikes and get girls

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
through the drugs trade,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and you want to attract him into education,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
having a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
That isn't really going to attract him.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
You need to pull him.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
And so education needs to work by pull, not push.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
And so the idea of a curriculum

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
is completely irrelevant in a setting like this.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
You need to start education

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
from things that make a difference

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
to them in their settings.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
What does that?

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
Well, the key is motivation, and there are two aspects to it.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
One is to deliver extrinsic motivation,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
that education has a payoff.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
Our education systems all work

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
on the principle that there is a payoff,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
but you have to wait quite a long time.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
That's too long if you're poor.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Waiting 10 years for the payoff from education

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
is too long when you need to meet daily needs,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
when you've got siblings to look after

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
or a business to help with.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
So you need education to be relevant and help people

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
to make a living there and then, often.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
So time and again, I found people like this.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
This is an amazing guy, Sebastiao Rocha,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
in Belo Horizonte,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
in the third largest city in Brazil.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
He's invented more than 200 games

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
to teach virtually any subject under the sun.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
In the schools and communities

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
that Taio works in,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
the day always starts in a circle

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and always starts from a question.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
Imagine an education system that started from questions,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
not from knowledge to be imparted,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
or started from a game, not from a lesson,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
or started from the premise

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
that you have to engage people first

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
before you can possibly teach them.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
Our education systems,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
you do all that stuff afterward, if you're lucky,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
sport, drama, music.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
These things, they teach through.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
They attract people to learning

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
because it's really a dance project

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
or a circus project

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
or, the best example of all --

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
El Sistema in Venezuela --

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
it's a music project.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And so you attract people through that into learning,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
not adding that on after

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
all the learning has been done

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
and you've eaten your cognitive greens.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
So El Sistema in Venezuela

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
uses a violin as a technology of learning.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Taio Rocha uses making soap

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
as a technology of learning.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
And what you find when you go to these schemes

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
is that they use people and places

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
in incredibly creative ways.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
Masses of peer learning.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
How do you get learning to people

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
when there are no teachers,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
when teachers won't come, when you can't afford them,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
and even if you do get teachers,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
what they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve?

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Well, you create your own teachers.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
You create peer-to-peer learning,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
or you create para-teachers, or you bring in specialist skills.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
But you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
through technology, people and places that are different.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
So this is a school in a bus

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
on a building site

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
in Pune, the fastest growing city in Asia.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
Pune has 5,000 building sites.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
It has 30,000 children

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
on those building sites.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
That's one city.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Imagine that urban explosion

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
that's going to take place across the developing world

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
and how many thousands of children

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
will spend their school years on building sites.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
Well, this is a very simple scheme

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
to get the learning to them through a bus.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
And they all treat learning,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
not as some sort of academic, analytical activity,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
but as that's something that's productive,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
something you make,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
something that you can do, perhaps earn a living from.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
So I met this character, Steven.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
He'd spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
because his parents had died of AIDS.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
And he was finally brought back into school,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
not by the offer of GCSEs,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
a practical making skill.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
So the trendiest schools in the world,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
High Tech High and others,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
Here, there isn't really an option.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Learning has to be productive

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
in order for it to make sense.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
And finally, they have a different model of scale,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
and it's a Chinese restaurant model

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
of how to scale.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
And I learned it from this guy,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
who is an amazing character.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
He's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
in education in the world.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
His name is Madhav Chavan,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
and he created something called Pratham.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And Pratham runs preschool play groups

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
for, now, 21 million children in India.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
It's the largest NGO in education in the world.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
And it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
He's a complete revolutionary.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
He's actually a trade union organizer by background,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
and that's how he learned the skills

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
to build his organization.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
When they got to a certain stage,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Pratham got big enough to attract

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
some pro bono support from McKinsey.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
"You know what you should do with this, Madhav?

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
You should turn it into McDonald's.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
And what you do when you go to any new site

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
is you kind of roll out a franchise.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
And it's the same wherever you go.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
It's reliable and people know exactly where they are.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
And there will be no mistakes."

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
And Madhav said,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
"Why do we have to do it that way?

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants?"

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
There are Chinese restaurants everywhere,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
but there is no Chinese restaurant chain.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
Yet, everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
They know what to expect, even though it'll be subtly different

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
and the colors will be different and the name will be different.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
These people work with the Chinese restaurant model --

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
same principles, different applications and different settings --

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
not the McDonald's model.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
The McDonald's model scales.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
The Chinese restaurant model spreads.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
So mass education

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
started with social entrepreneurship

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
in the 19th century.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
And that's desperately what we need again

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
on a global scale.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And what can we learn from all of that?

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Well, we can learn a lot

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
because our education systems

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
are failing desperately in many ways.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
They fail to reach the people

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
they most need to serve.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
They often hit their target but miss the point.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Improvement is increasingly

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
difficult to organize;

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
our faith in these systems, incredibly fraught.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
And this is just a very simple way of

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
understanding what kind of innovation,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
what kind of different design we need.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
There are two basic types of innovation.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
There's sustaining innovation,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
which will sustain an existing institution or an organization,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
and disruptive innovation

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
that will break it apart, create some different way of doing it.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
There are formal settings --

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
schools, colleges, hospitals --

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
in which innovation can take place,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
and informal settings -- communities,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
families, social networks.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
Almost all our effort goes in this box,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
sustaining innovation in formal settings,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
getting a better version

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
of the essentially Bismarckian school system

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
that developed in the 19th century.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
And as I said, the trouble with this is that,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
in the developing world

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
there just aren't teachers to make this model work.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
You'd need millions and millions of teachers

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
in China, India, Nigeria

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
and the rest of developing world to meet need.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
And in our system, we know

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
that simply doing more of this won't eat into

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
deep educational inequalities,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
especially in inner cities

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
and former industrial areas.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
So that's why we need three more kinds of innovation.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
We need more reinvention.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
And all around the world now you see

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
more and more schools reinventing themselves.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
They're recognizably schools, but they look different.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
There are Big Picture schools

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
in the U.S. and Australia.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
There are Kunskapsskolan schools

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
in Sweden.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
Of 14 of them,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
only two of them are in schools.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
There is an amazing school in Northen Queensland

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
called Jaringan.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
And they all have the same kind of features:

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
highly collaborative, very personalized,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
often pervasive technology,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
learning that starts from questions

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
and problems and projects,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
not from knowledge and curriculum.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
So we certainly need more of that.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
But because so many of the issues in education

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
aren't just in school,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
they're in family and community,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
what you also need, definitely,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
is more on the right hand side.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
You need efforts to supplement schools.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
The most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
the family-based learning system

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
to support and encourage people in schools.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
The most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
which over 10 years, led by Geoffrey Canada,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
has, through a mixture of schooling

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
and family and community projects,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
attempted to transform not just education in schools,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
but the entire culture and aspiration

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
of about 10,000 families in Harlem.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
We need more of that

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
completely new and radical thinking.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
You can go to places an hour away, less,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
from this room,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
just down the road, which need that,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
And finally, you need transformational innovation

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
that could imagine getting learning to people

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
in completely new and different ways.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
So we are on the verge, 2015,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
of an amazing achievement,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
the schoolification of the world.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
Every child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
will be able to have one in 2015.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
It's an amazing thing.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
But it is,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
unlike cars, which have developed

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
so rapidly and orderly,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
actually the school system is recognizably

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
an inheritance from the 19th century,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.260
from a Bismarkian model of German schooling

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.260
that got taken up by English reformers,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260
and often by

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
religious missionaries,

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
taken up in the United States

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
as a force of social cohesion,

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
It's recognizably 19th century in its roots.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
And of course it's a huge achievement.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
And of course it will bring great things.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
It will bring skills and learning and reading.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.260
But it will also lay waste to imagination.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.260
It will lay waste to appetite. It will lay waste to social confidence.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
It will stratify society

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.260
as much as it liberates it.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
And we are bequeathing to the developing world

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.260
school systems that they will now spend

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
a century trying to reform.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.260
That is why we need really radical thinking,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
and why radical thinking is now

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.260
more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
Thank you. (Applause)
