00:00:16.117 --> 00:00:17.950
Hello, Doha. Hello!

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:20.065
Salaam alaikum.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.066
I love coming to Doha.
It's such an international place.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.618
It feels like the United Nations here.

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:32.911
You land at the airport,
and you're welcomed by an Indian lady

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:36.798
who takes you to Al Maha Services,
where you meet a Filipino lady

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:39.036
who hands you off to a South African lady

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.783
who then takes you to a Korean

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.604
who takes you to a Pakistani guy
with the luggage

00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:45.642
who takes you to the car
with a Sri Lankan.

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.476
You go to the hotel and you check in.
There's a Lebanese.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.680
Yeah? And then a Swedish guy
showed me my room.

00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:53.526
I said, "Where are the Qataris?"

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.196
(Laughter)

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.166
(Applause)

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.525
They said, "No, no, it's too hot.
They come out later. They're smart."

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:02.700
"They know."

00:01:02.724 --> 00:01:04.440
(Laughter)

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:08.253
And of course, it's growing so fast,
sometimes there's growing pains.

00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:10.555
You know, like sometimes
you run into people

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.840
that you think know the city well,
but they don't know it that well.

00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:16.436
My Indian cab driver showed up at the W,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.727
and I asked him to take me
to the Sheraton,

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:20.382
and he said, "No problem, sir."

00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:23.341
And then we sat there for two minutes.

00:01:23.365 --> 00:01:25.869
I said, "What's wrong?"
He said, "One problem, sir."

00:01:25.893 --> 00:01:26.932
(Laughter)

00:01:26.956 --> 00:01:28.821
I said, "What?" He goes, "Where is it?"

00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:31.258
(Laughter)

00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:33.321
I go, "You're the driver,
you should know."

00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:35.075
He goes, "No, I just arrived, sir."

00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:38.965
I go, "You just arrived at the W?"
"No, I just arrived in Doha, sir."

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:40.027
(Laughter)

00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:41.948
"I was on my way home from the airport,

00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:43.599
I got a job. I'm working already."

00:01:43.623 --> 00:01:45.114
(Laughter)

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.278
He goes, "Sir, why don't you drive?"

00:01:47.302 --> 00:01:48.330
(Laughter)

00:01:48.354 --> 00:01:49.934
"I don't know where we're going."

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.062
"Neither do I. It will be
an adventure, sir."

00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:53.878
(Laughter)

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.536
The Middle East has been
an adventure the past couple of years.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.711
It is going crazy with the Arab Spring
and revolution and all this.

00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:04.113
Are there any Lebanese
here tonight, by applause?

00:02:04.137 --> 00:02:05.146
(Cheering)

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.322
Lebanese, yeah.

00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:07.853
The Middle East is going crazy.

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:09.798
You know the Middle East is going crazy

00:02:09.822 --> 00:02:12.511
when Lebanon is the most peaceful
place in the region.

00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:15.099
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:15.123 --> 00:02:16.519
Who would have thought?

00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:18.036
(Laughter)

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.573
Oh my gosh.

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:22.168
No, there's serious issues in the region.

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:25.914
Some people don't want to talk about them.
I'm here to talk about them tonight.

00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:28.953
Ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East,
here's a serious issue.

00:02:28.977 --> 00:02:31.287
When we see each other, when we say hello,

00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:33.060
how many kisses are we going to do?

00:02:33.084 --> 00:02:34.535
(Laughter)

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.036
Every country is different
and it's confusing, okay?

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.866
In Lebanon, they do three.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.597
In Egypt, they do two.

00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:42.869
I was in Lebanon, I got used to three.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.505
I went to Egypt. I went to say hello
to this one Egyptian guy,

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:48.377
I went, one, two. I went for three --

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:49.605
He wasn't into it.

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.527
(Laughter)

00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:57.003
I told him, I said, "No, no,
I was just in Lebanon."

00:02:57.027 --> 00:03:00.631
He goes, "I don't care where you were.
You just stay where you are, please."

00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:02.664
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:04.265 --> 00:03:05.618
I went to Saudi Arabia.

00:03:05.642 --> 00:03:09.046
In Saudi Arabia, they go one, two,
and then they stay on the same side:

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.587
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine,

00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:14.304
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 --

00:03:14.328 --> 00:03:16.995
(Laughter)

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.941
Next time you see a Saudi, look closely.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.635
They're just a little bit tilted.

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.353
(Laughter)

00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:23.551
"Abdul, are you okay?"

00:03:23.575 --> 00:03:26.243
"I was saying hello
for half an hour. I'll be all right."

00:03:26.267 --> 00:03:27.417
(Laughter)

00:03:28.028 --> 00:03:30.995
Qataris, you guys do the nose to nose.

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:34.303
Why is that? Are you too tired
to go all the way around?

00:03:34.327 --> 00:03:35.363
(Laughter)

00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:38.483
"Habibi, it's so hot. Just come here
for a second. Say hello.

00:03:38.507 --> 00:03:41.249
Hello, Habibi. Just don't move.
Just stay there, please.

00:03:41.273 --> 00:03:42.499
I need to rest."

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.638
(Laughter)

00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:48.750
Iranians, sometimes we do two,
sometimes we do three.

00:03:48.774 --> 00:03:52.213
A friend of mine explained to me,
before the '79 revolution, it was two.

00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:53.274
(Laughter)

00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:55.260
After the revolution, three.

00:03:55.284 --> 00:03:58.009
So with Iranians, you can tell
whose side the person is on

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:00.117
based on the number
of kisses they give you.

00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:03.784
Yeah, if you go one, two, three --
"I can't believe you support this regime!"

00:04:03.808 --> 00:04:04.809
(Laughter)

00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:06.357
"With your three kisses."

00:04:06.381 --> 00:04:09.049
(Laughter)

00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:11.554
But no, guys, really,
it is exciting to be here,

00:04:11.578 --> 00:04:14.433
and like I said, you guys
are doing a lot culturally,

00:04:14.457 --> 00:04:16.128
you know, and it's amazing,

00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:19.013
and it helps change the image
of the Middle East in the West.

00:04:19.037 --> 00:04:22.557
A lot of Americans don't know
a lot about us, about the Middle East.

00:04:22.581 --> 00:04:26.020
I'm Iranian and American. I'm there.
I know, I've traveled here.

00:04:26.044 --> 00:04:27.756
There's so much, we laugh, right?

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.143
People don't know we laugh.

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:32.508
When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour,
it came out on Comedy Central,

00:04:32.532 --> 00:04:34.640
I went online to see
what people were saying.

00:04:34.664 --> 00:04:36.451
I ended up on a conservative website.

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:39.857
One guy wrote another guy. He said,
"I never knew these people laughed."

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:44.106
Think about it. You never see us laughing
in American film or television, right?

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.724
Maybe like an evil laugh: "Wuhahaha."

00:04:46.748 --> 00:04:47.799
(Laughter)

00:04:47.823 --> 00:04:50.926
"I will kill you in the name
of Allah, wuhahahahaha."

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.108
(Laughter)

00:04:52.132 --> 00:04:54.033
But never like, "Ha ha ha ha la."

00:04:54.057 --> 00:04:55.784
(Laughter)

00:04:55.808 --> 00:04:58.471
We like to laugh.
We like to celebrate life.

00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:00.551
And I wish more Americans
would travel here.

00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:02.019
I always encourage my friends:

00:05:02.043 --> 00:05:03.493
"Travel, see the Middle East,

00:05:03.517 --> 00:05:05.659
there's so much to see,
so many good people."

00:05:05.683 --> 00:05:07.933
And it's vice versa,
and it helps stop problems

00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:10.980
of misunderstanding
and stereotypes from happening.

00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:13.358
For example, I don't know
if you heard about this,

00:05:13.382 --> 00:05:16.016
a little while ago in the US,
there was a Muslim family

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.031
walking down the aisle of an airplane,

00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:20.449
talking about the safest place
to sit on the plane.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.307
Some passengers overheard them,

00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:25.577
somehow misconstrued that
as terrorist talk,

00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:27.393
got them kicked off the plane.

00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:30.703
It was a family, a mother, father, child,
talking about the seating.

00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:31.983
As a Middle Eastern male,

00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:34.753
I know there's certain things
I'm not supposed to say

00:05:34.777 --> 00:05:36.466
on an airplane in the US, right?

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.665
I'm not supposed to be
walking down the aisle,

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:40.697
and be like, "Hi, Jack." That's not cool.

00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:42.143
(Laughter)

00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:44.596
Even if I'm there with my friend
named Jack, I say,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.576
"Greetings, Jack. Salutations, Jack."

00:05:47.104 --> 00:05:48.299
Never "Hi, Jack."

00:05:48.323 --> 00:05:51.216
(Laughter)

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.428
But now, apparently we can't even talk

00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:55.628
about the safest place
to sit on an airplane.

00:05:55.953 --> 00:05:59.038
So my advice to all my Middle Eastern
friends and Muslim friends

00:05:59.062 --> 00:06:01.349
and anyone who looks
Middle Eastern or Muslim,

00:06:01.373 --> 00:06:04.871
so to, you know, Indians, and Latinos,
everyone, if you're brown --

00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:06.583
(Laughter)

00:06:06.607 --> 00:06:08.869
Here's my advice to my brown friends.

00:06:08.893 --> 00:06:09.946
(Laughter)

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.339
The next time you're
on an airplane in the US,

00:06:12.363 --> 00:06:13.980
just speak your mother tongue.

00:06:14.392 --> 00:06:16.970
That way no one knows
what you're saying. Life goes on.

00:06:16.994 --> 00:06:18.016
(Laughter)

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.949
Granted, some mother tongues
might sound a little threatening

00:06:20.973 --> 00:06:22.135
to the average American.

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:24.468
If you're walking
down the aisle speaking Arabic,

00:06:24.492 --> 00:06:25.854
you might freak them out --

00:06:25.878 --> 00:06:28.180
(Imitating Arabic)

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:30.259
They might say, "What's he talking about?"

00:06:30.283 --> 00:06:32.272
The key, to my Arab brothers and sisters,

00:06:32.296 --> 00:06:34.836
is to throw in random
good words to put people at ease

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.444
as you're walking down the aisle.

00:06:36.468 --> 00:06:37.898
Just as you're walking down --

00:06:37.922 --> 00:06:39.267
(Imitating Arabic)

00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:40.469
Strawberry!

00:06:40.493 --> 00:06:47.429
(Laughter)

00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:49.162
(Imitating Arabic)

00:06:49.186 --> 00:06:50.337
Rainbow!

00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:52.330
(Laughter)

00:06:52.354 --> 00:06:53.611
(Imitating Arabic)

00:06:53.635 --> 00:06:54.786
Tutti Frutti!

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.920
(Laughter)

00:06:55.944 --> 00:06:59.086
"I think he's going to hijack
the plane with some ice cream."

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.050
Thank you very much. Have a good night.

00:07:01.074 --> 00:07:02.225
Thank you, TED.

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:06.077
(Cheers) (Applause)
