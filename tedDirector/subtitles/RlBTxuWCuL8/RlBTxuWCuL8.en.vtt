00:00:25.944 --> 00:00:27.333
Over the past couple of days,

00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:29.134
as I've been preparing for my speech,

00:00:29.158 --> 00:00:32.698
I've become more and more nervous
about what I'm going to say

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:35.841
and about being on the same stage
as all these fascinating people.

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:40.155
Being on the same stage as Al Gore,
who was the first person I ever voted for.

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:41.339
And --

00:00:41.363 --> 00:00:44.976
(Laughter)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.790
So I was getting pretty nervous

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:49.619
and, you know, I didn't know
that Chris sits on the stage,

00:00:49.643 --> 00:00:51.127
and that's more nerve-racking.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.207
But then I started thinking
about my family.

00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:55.976
I started thinking about my father
and my grandfather

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.063
and my great-grandfather,

00:00:58.087 --> 00:00:59.755
and I realized

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:04.025
that I had all of these Teds
going through my bloodstream --

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.447
(Laughter)

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:08.976
that I had to consider this "my element."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.377
So, who am I?

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:15.030
Chris kind of mentioned I started
a company with my husband.

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:17.473
We have about 125 people internationally.

00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:18.976
If you looked in the book,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.584
you saw this ...

00:01:20.608 --> 00:01:21.877
(Laughter)

00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:25.173
which I really was appalled by.

00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:27.600
(Laughter)

00:01:27.624 --> 00:01:30.976
And because I wanted
to impress you all with slides,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.738
since I saw the great presentations
yesterday with graphs,

00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:36.080
I made a graph that moves,

00:01:36.104 --> 00:01:38.976
and I talk about the makeup of me.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.346
(Laughter)

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.423
So, besides this freakish thing,

00:01:44.447 --> 00:01:45.699
this is my science slide.

00:01:45.723 --> 00:01:48.291
This is math, and this is science,
this is genetics.

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:51.187
This is my grandmother,
and this is where I get this mouth.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.159
(Laughter)

00:01:53.183 --> 00:01:54.439
So --

00:01:55.163 --> 00:01:59.219
I'm a blogger, which, probably,
to a lot of you, means different things.

00:01:59.243 --> 00:02:03.295
You may have heard
about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha,

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.303
where a blogger talked about how you hack

00:02:05.327 --> 00:02:07.976
or break into a Kryptonite
lock using a ballpoint pen,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.349
and it spread all over.

00:02:09.373 --> 00:02:11.339
Kryptonite had to adjust the lock,

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:14.976
and they had to address it
to avoid too many customer concerns.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.975
You may have heard about Rathergate,

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.106
which was basically the result of bloggers

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.150
realizing that the "th" in 111

00:02:24.174 --> 00:02:27.347
is not typeset on an old typewriter;

00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:28.647
it's on Word.

00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:30.384
Bloggers exposed this,

00:02:30.408 --> 00:02:32.976
or they worked hard to expose this.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.567
You know, blogs are scary.
This is what you see.

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:41.064
I see this, and I'm sure scared --
I swear on stage -- shitless about blogs,

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:44.072
because this is not
something that's friendly.

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:47.722
But there are blogs that are changing
the way we read news

00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:50.143
and consume media,
and these are great examples.

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:52.452
These people are reaching thousands,

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:54.322
if not millions, of readers,

00:02:54.346 --> 00:02:55.976
and that's incredibly important.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.976
During the hurricane,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.314
you had MSNBC posting
about the hurricane on their blog,

00:03:01.338 --> 00:03:02.680
updating it frequently.

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:05.976
This was possible because of the easy
nature of blogging tools.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.715
You have my friend,

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.274
who has a blog on PVRs,
personal recorders.

00:03:12.298 --> 00:03:14.568
He makes enough money just by running ads,

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:16.409
to support his family up in Oregon.

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:17.584
That's all he does now,

00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:20.050
and this is something
that blogs have made possible.

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:22.858
And then you have something
like this, which is Interplast.

00:03:22.882 --> 00:03:24.460
It's a wonderful organization

00:03:24.484 --> 00:03:28.669
of people and doctors
who go to developing nations

00:03:28.693 --> 00:03:30.976
to offer plastic surgery
to those who need it.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.662
Children with cleft palates get it,
and they document their story.

00:03:34.686 --> 00:03:35.976
This is wonderful.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.976
I am not that caring.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.727
(Laughter)

00:03:41.751 --> 00:03:42.927
I talk about myself.

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:44.544
That's what I am. I'm a blogger.

00:03:44.568 --> 00:03:48.097
I have always decided that I was going
to be an expert on one thing,

00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:50.351
and I am an expert on this person,

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:52.540
and so I write about it.

00:03:52.842 --> 00:03:54.485
So, the short story about my blog:

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.660
it started in 2001, I was 23.

00:03:56.684 --> 00:03:58.408
I wasn't happy with my job,

00:03:58.432 --> 00:03:59.884
because I was a designer,

00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:01.828
but I wasn't being really stimulated.

00:04:01.852 --> 00:04:03.485
I was an English major in college.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.184
I didn't have any use for it,
but I missed writing.

00:04:06.208 --> 00:04:07.842
So, I started to write a blog

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:10.739
and I started to create things
like these little stories.

00:04:10.763 --> 00:04:14.976
This was an illustration about my camp
experience when I was 11 years old,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.976
and how I went to a YMCA camp,
Christian camp,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.616
and basically by the end,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.520
I had made my friends hate me so much
that I hid in a bunk,

00:04:24.544 --> 00:04:26.800
They couldn't find me,
they sent a search party,

00:04:26.824 --> 00:04:29.801
and I overheard people saying
they wish I had killed myself --

00:04:29.825 --> 00:04:31.667
jumped off Bible Peak.

00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:33.336
You can laugh, this is OK.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.752
(Laughter)

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:36.976
This is me.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.469
This is what happened to me.

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:41.976
And when I started my blog,
it was really this one goal --

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.696
I said, "I am not going
to be famous to the world,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.174
but I could be famous
to people on the Internet."

00:04:50.198 --> 00:04:51.358
And I set a goal.

00:04:51.382 --> 00:04:53.768
I said, "I'm going to win an award,"

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:56.210
because I had never won
an award in my entire life.

00:04:56.234 --> 00:05:00.165
And I said, "I'm going to win
the South by Southwest Weblog award."

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.976
And I won it -- I reached
all of these people,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.487
and I had tens of thousands of people
reading about my life every day.

00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:08.938
And then I wrote a post about a banjo.

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.057
I wrote a post

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:13.637
about wanting to buy a banjo --

00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:16.113
a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.

00:05:16.613 --> 00:05:18.296
And I don't play instruments;

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.491
I don't know anything about music.

00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:22.976
I like music, and I like banjos,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.380
and I think I probably heard
Steve Martin playing,

00:05:25.404 --> 00:05:26.976
and I said, "I could do that."

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.293
And I said to my husband,

00:05:28.317 --> 00:05:30.507
"Ben, can I buy a banjo?"
And he's like, "No."

00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:31.762
And my husband --

00:05:31.786 --> 00:05:32.948
(Laughter)

00:05:32.972 --> 00:05:35.016
this is my husband, who is very hot --

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.976
he won an award for being hot.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.648
(Laughter)

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:41.537
He told me,

00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:42.976
"You cannot buy a banjo.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.175
You're just like your dad,"
who collects instruments.

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.072
And I wrote a post
about how I was so mad at him,

00:05:50.096 --> 00:05:52.945
he was such a tyrant --
he would not let me buy this banjo.

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.331
And those people who know me
understood my joke --

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.704
this is Mena, this is how
I make a joke at people.

00:05:57.728 --> 00:06:00.976
Because the joke in this
is that this person is not a tyrant,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.976
this person is so loving and so sweet

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.789
that he lets me dress him up

00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:07.903
and post pictures of him to my blog.

00:06:07.927 --> 00:06:11.750
(Laughter)

00:06:11.774 --> 00:06:15.100
And if he knew I was showing
this right now -- I put this in today --

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:16.957
he would kill me.

00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:19.301
But the thing was, my friends read it,

00:06:19.325 --> 00:06:21.752
and they're like, "Oh, that Mena,
she wrote a post

00:06:21.776 --> 00:06:24.244
about wanting a stupid thing
and being stupid."

00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:26.724
But I got emails from people that said,

00:06:26.748 --> 00:06:29.811
"Oh my God, your husband
is such an asshole.

00:06:29.835 --> 00:06:32.646
How much money does
he spend on beer in a year?

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.662
You could take that money
and buy your banjo.

00:06:35.686 --> 00:06:37.551
Why don't you open a separate account?"

00:06:37.575 --> 00:06:41.127
I've been with him since I was 17,
we've never had a separate bank account.

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.032
They said, "Separate your bank account.

00:06:43.056 --> 00:06:45.239
Spend your money;
spend his money, that's it."

00:06:45.263 --> 00:06:47.392
And then I got people saying, "Leave him."

00:06:47.416 --> 00:06:48.563
(Laughter)

00:06:48.587 --> 00:06:51.438
I was like, "OK, what?
Who are these people?

00:06:51.462 --> 00:06:52.976
And why are they reading this?"

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.385
And I realized: I don't
want to reach these people.

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:57.976
I don't want to write
for this public audience.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.976
And I started to kill my blog slowly.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.102
I'm like, I don't want
to write this anymore.

00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:03.746
Slowly and slowly --

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.758
And I did tell personal
stories from time to time.

00:07:06.782 --> 00:07:09.694
I wrote this one, and I put this
up because of Einstein today.

00:07:09.718 --> 00:07:12.397
I'm going to get choked up,
because this is my first pet,

00:07:12.421 --> 00:07:14.049
and she passed away two years ago.

00:07:14.073 --> 00:07:17.531
And I decided to break from, "I don't
really write about my public life,"

00:07:17.555 --> 00:07:19.761
because I wanted to give her
a little memorial.

00:07:19.785 --> 00:07:22.276
But anyways, it's these sorts
of personal stories --

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.091
You know, you read the blogs
about politics or about media,

00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:26.645
and gossip and all these things.

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:27.827
These are out there,

00:07:27.851 --> 00:07:30.976
but it's more of the personal
that interests me,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.268
and this is who I am.

00:07:33.292 --> 00:07:35.845
You see Norman Rockwell,
and you have art critics say,

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:37.296
"Norman Rockwell is not art.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.452
Norman Rockwell hangs
in living rooms and bathrooms,

00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:43.976
and this is not something
to be considered high art."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.783
And I think this is one
of the most important things

00:07:46.807 --> 00:07:49.045
to us as humans.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.667
These things resonate with us,

00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:54.715
and, if you think about blogs,
you think of high art blogs,

00:07:54.739 --> 00:07:58.705
the history paintings about,
you know, all the biblical stories,

00:07:58.729 --> 00:07:59.880
and then you have this.

00:07:59.904 --> 00:08:03.596
These are the blogs that interest me:
the people that just tell stories.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.564
One story is about this baby,
and his name is Odin.

00:08:07.588 --> 00:08:09.770
His father was a blogger.

00:08:09.794 --> 00:08:12.664
And he was writing his blog one day,

00:08:12.688 --> 00:08:15.289
and his wife gave birth to her baby

00:08:15.313 --> 00:08:16.976
at 25 weeks.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.749
And he never expected this.

00:08:18.773 --> 00:08:21.976
One day, it was normal;
the next day, it was hell.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.774
And this is a one-pound baby.

00:08:23.798 --> 00:08:26.976
So Odin was documented every single day.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.672
Pictures were taken every day:
day one, day two ...

00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:32.585
You have day nine --
they're talking about his apnea;

00:08:32.609 --> 00:08:34.466
day 39 -- he gets pneumonia.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.976
His baby is so small,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.357
and I've never encountered such a --

00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:42.976
just -- a disturbing image,
but just so heartfelt.

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:46.782
And you're reading this as it happens,

00:08:46.806 --> 00:08:50.911
so on day 55, everybody reads
that he's having failures:

00:08:50.935 --> 00:08:52.789
breathing failures and heart failures,

00:08:52.813 --> 00:08:55.976
and it's slowing down,
and you don't know what to expect.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.212
But then it gets better.
Day 96, he goes home.

00:08:59.236 --> 00:09:01.322
And you see this post.

00:09:01.346 --> 00:09:04.376
That's not something you're going
to see in a paper or magazine

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.354
but this is something this person feels,

00:09:06.378 --> 00:09:08.759
and people are excited
about it -- 28 comments.

00:09:08.783 --> 00:09:10.846
That's not a huge amount
of people reading,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.640
but 28 people matter.

00:09:12.664 --> 00:09:15.575
And today, he is a healthy baby,

00:09:15.599 --> 00:09:17.734
who, if you read his blog --

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:20.813
it's snowdeal.org, his father's blog --

00:09:20.837 --> 00:09:24.000
he is taking pictures of him still,
because he is still his son

00:09:24.024 --> 00:09:26.976
and he is, I think,
at his age level right now

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.754
because he had received such
great treatment from the hospital.

00:09:31.317 --> 00:09:32.858
So, blogs.

00:09:32.882 --> 00:09:35.429
So what? You've probably
heard these things before.

00:09:35.453 --> 00:09:39.096
We talked about the WELL,
and about all these sorts of things

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.976
throughout our online history.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.638
But I think blogs are basically
just an evolution,

00:09:44.662 --> 00:09:46.305
and that's where we are today.

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:48.925
It's this record
of who you are, your persona.

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:52.014
You have your Google search,
where you say, "What is Mena Trott?"

00:09:52.038 --> 00:09:55.784
And then you find these things
and you're happy or unhappy.

00:09:55.808 --> 00:09:57.976
But then you also find people's blogs,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.898
and those are the records of people
that are writing daily --

00:10:00.922 --> 00:10:04.842
not necessarily about the same topic,
but things that interest them.

00:10:04.866 --> 00:10:08.612
And we talk about the world
flattens, being in this panel,

00:10:08.636 --> 00:10:11.733
and I am very optimistic --
whenever I think about blogs,

00:10:11.757 --> 00:10:14.015
I'm like, "We've got to reach
all these people."

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:16.118
Hundreds of millions
and billions of people.

00:10:16.142 --> 00:10:18.288
We're getting into China,
we want to be there,

00:10:18.312 --> 00:10:22.013
but there are so many people that
won't have the access to write a blog.

00:10:22.037 --> 00:10:24.774
But to see something
like the $100 computer is amazing,

00:10:24.798 --> 00:10:26.848
because blogging software is simple.

00:10:26.872 --> 00:10:29.115
We have a successful company
because of timing,

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:31.647
and because of perseverance,
but it's simple stuff --

00:10:31.671 --> 00:10:33.182
it's not rocket science.

00:10:33.206 --> 00:10:36.206
And so, that's an amazing
thing to consider.

00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:38.035
So --

00:10:39.294 --> 00:10:44.163
the life record of a blog is something
that I find incredibly important.

00:10:44.187 --> 00:10:46.484
And we started with a slide of my Teds,

00:10:46.508 --> 00:10:48.166
and I had to add this slide,

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.560
because I knew the minute
I showed this, my mom --

00:10:50.584 --> 00:10:53.126
my mom will see this,
because she does read my blog

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.638
and she'll say, "Why wasn't there
a picture of me?"

00:10:55.662 --> 00:10:56.879
This is my mom.

00:10:56.903 --> 00:10:59.173
So, I have all the people that I know of.

00:10:59.197 --> 00:11:03.123
But this is basically the extent
of the family that I know

00:11:03.147 --> 00:11:06.031
in terms of my direct line.

00:11:06.055 --> 00:11:10.138
I showed a Norman Rockwell painting
before, and this one, I grew up with,

00:11:10.162 --> 00:11:11.976
looking at constantly.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.196
I would spend hours
looking at the connections,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.976
saying, "Oh, the little kid
up at the top has red hair;

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.976
so does that first generation up there."

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.642
And it's just these little things.

00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:24.593
This is not science,
but this was enough for me

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:27.976
to be really interested
in how we have evolved

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.274
and how we can trace our line.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.976
So that has always influenced me.

00:11:33.285 --> 00:11:36.897
I have this record, this 1910 census,

00:11:36.921 --> 00:11:39.428
of another Grabowski --
that's my maiden name --

00:11:39.452 --> 00:11:42.189
and there's a Theodore,
because there's always a Theodore.

00:11:42.213 --> 00:11:45.845
This is all I have,
a couple of facts about somebody.

00:11:45.869 --> 00:11:50.010
I have their date of birth, their age,
what they did in their household,

00:11:50.034 --> 00:11:51.185
if they spoke English,

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:53.548
and that's it, that's all I know
of these people.

00:11:53.572 --> 00:11:54.976
And it's pretty sad,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.643
because I only go back
five generations, and that's it.

00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:00.934
I don't even know what happens
on my mom's side,

00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.901
because she's from Cuba
and I don't have that many things.

00:12:04.999 --> 00:12:07.305
Just doing this,
I spent time in the archives --

00:12:07.329 --> 00:12:08.973
that's why my husband's a saint --

00:12:08.997 --> 00:12:10.925
I spent time in the Washington archives,

00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:13.054
just sitting there,
looking for these things.

00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:15.058
Now it's online, but he sat through that.

00:12:15.082 --> 00:12:17.573
And so you have this record and --

00:12:17.597 --> 00:12:19.685
This is my great-great-grandmother.

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:21.336
This is the only picture I have.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.623
And to think of what we have the ability
to do with our blogs;

00:12:25.647 --> 00:12:28.976
to think about the people
that are on those $100 computers,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.641
talking about who they are,
sharing these personal stories --

00:12:32.665 --> 00:12:34.379
this is an amazing thing.

00:12:34.784 --> 00:12:37.976
Another photo that has
greatly influenced me,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.976
or a series of photos, is this project

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.273
that's done by an Argentinean
man and his wife.

00:12:43.297 --> 00:12:46.471
And he's basically taking a picture
of his family every day

00:12:46.495 --> 00:12:52.263
for the past, what is '76? -- 20 ...
Oh my God, I'm '77 -- 29 years?

00:12:52.287 --> 00:12:54.008
Twenty-nine years.

00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:58.425
There was a joke, originally,
about my graph that I left out, which is:

00:12:58.449 --> 00:12:59.606
You see all this math?

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.805
I'm just happy I was able
to add it up to 100,

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:03.624
because that's my skill set.

00:13:03.648 --> 00:13:05.862
(Laughter)

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:08.547
So you have these people aging,

00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:11.877
and now this is them today, or last year.

00:13:12.205 --> 00:13:15.150
And that's a powerful thing
to have, to be able to track this.

00:13:15.174 --> 00:13:17.976
I wish that I would have
this of my family.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.976
I know that one day my children
will be wondering --

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.239
or my grandchildren,
or my great-grandchildren,

00:13:24.263 --> 00:13:26.337
if I ever have children --

00:13:26.361 --> 00:13:28.976
what I am going to --

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.287
who I was.

00:13:30.311 --> 00:13:32.562
So I do something
that's very narcissistic --

00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:34.078
I am a blogger --

00:13:34.102 --> 00:13:36.562
that is an amazing thing for me,

00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:39.561
because it captures
a moment in time every day.

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:42.845
I take a picture of myself --
I've been doing this since last year --

00:13:42.869 --> 00:13:44.174
every single day.

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:46.024
And, you know, it's the same picture;

00:13:46.048 --> 00:13:47.805
it's basically the same person.

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:49.408
Only a couple of people read it.

00:13:49.432 --> 00:13:51.285
I don't write this for this audience;

00:13:51.309 --> 00:13:55.316
I'm showing it now, but I would go
insane if this was really public.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.031
About four people probably read it,

00:13:57.055 --> 00:13:59.403
and they tell me, "You haven't updated."

00:13:59.427 --> 00:14:02.387
I'm probably going to get people
telling me I haven't updated.

00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:05.976
But this is amazing, because I can
go back to a day -- to April 2005,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.672
and say, what was I doing this day?

00:14:07.696 --> 00:14:09.096
I look at it, I know exactly.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.116
It's this visual cue
that is so important to what we do.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.239
I put the bad pictures up too,

00:14:14.263 --> 00:14:16.669
because there are bad pictures.

00:14:16.693 --> 00:14:17.859
(Laughter)

00:14:17.883 --> 00:14:21.543
And I remember instantly:
I am in Germany in this --

00:14:21.567 --> 00:14:23.067
I had to go for a one-day trip.

00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:25.755
I was sick, and I was in a hotel room,

00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:27.555
and I wanted not to be there.

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:30.506
And so you see these things,
it's not just always smiling.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.843
Now I've kind of evolved it,
so I have this look.

00:14:32.867 --> 00:14:35.559
If you look at my driver's license,
I have the same look,

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:38.862
and it's a pretty disturbing thing,

00:14:38.886 --> 00:14:41.311
but it's something
that is really important.

00:14:41.724 --> 00:14:47.112
And the last story
I really want to tell is this story,

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:50.409
because this is probably the one
that means the most to me

00:14:50.433 --> 00:14:51.676
in all of what I'm doing.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.024
I'll probably get choked up,
because I tend to when I talk about this.

00:14:55.048 --> 00:14:57.176
So, this woman, her name was Emma,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.240
and she was a blogger
on our service, TypePad.

00:15:00.264 --> 00:15:03.425
And she was a beta tester,
so she was there right when we opened --

00:15:03.449 --> 00:15:04.976
you know, there was 100 people.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.976
And she wrote about her life
dealing with cancer.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.136
She was writing and writing,
and we all started reading it,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.227
because we had
so few blogs on the service,

00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:14.862
we could keep track of everyone.

00:15:14.886 --> 00:15:16.857
And she was writing one day,

00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:19.135
and then she disappeared for a little bit.

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:23.574
And her sister came on, and she said
that Emma had passed away.

00:15:23.598 --> 00:15:28.458
And all of our support staff who had
talked to her were really emotional,

00:15:28.482 --> 00:15:31.641
and it was a very hard day at the company.

00:15:31.665 --> 00:15:34.976
And this was one of those
instances where I realized

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.708
how much blogging
affects our relationship,

00:15:37.732 --> 00:15:39.394
and flattening this sort of world.

00:15:39.418 --> 00:15:41.102
That this woman is in England,

00:15:41.126 --> 00:15:44.363
and she lives -- she lived -- a life

00:15:44.387 --> 00:15:47.649
where she was talking
about what she was doing.

00:15:47.673 --> 00:15:51.202
But the big thing
that really influenced us was,

00:15:51.226 --> 00:15:53.112
her sister wrote to me, and she said --

00:15:53.136 --> 00:15:54.540
and she wrote on this blog --

00:15:54.564 --> 00:15:57.800
that writing her blog during
the last couple of months of her life

00:15:57.824 --> 00:16:00.317
was probably the best thing
that had happened to her,

00:16:00.341 --> 00:16:03.409
and being able to talk to people
and to share what was going on,

00:16:03.433 --> 00:16:06.322
and being able to write
and receive comments.

00:16:06.346 --> 00:16:07.514
And that was amazing,

00:16:07.538 --> 00:16:09.800
to be able to know
that we had empowered that,

00:16:09.824 --> 00:16:13.004
and that blogging was something
that she felt comfortable doing,

00:16:13.028 --> 00:16:16.163
and the idea that blogging
doesn't have to be scary,

00:16:16.187 --> 00:16:18.670
that we don't always have
to be attack of the blogs,

00:16:18.694 --> 00:16:22.377
that we can be people who are open,
and wanting to help and talk to people.

00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:23.976
That was an amazing thing.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.487
And so I printed out and sent
a PDF of her blog to her family,

00:16:29.511 --> 00:16:31.710
and they passed it
out at her memorial service,

00:16:31.734 --> 00:16:34.096
and even in her obituary,
they mentioned her blog,

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.129
because it was such
a big part of her life.

00:16:36.153 --> 00:16:37.390
And that's a huge thing.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:40.379
So, this is her legacy,

00:16:40.403 --> 00:16:43.699
and I think that my call to action
to all of you is:

00:16:43.723 --> 00:16:45.880
think about blogs,
think about what they are,

00:16:45.904 --> 00:16:47.832
think about what you've thought of them,

00:16:47.856 --> 00:16:49.021
and then actually do it,

00:16:49.045 --> 00:16:52.043
because it's something
that's really going to change our lives.

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:53.229
So, thank you.

00:16:53.253 --> 00:16:54.253
(Applause)
