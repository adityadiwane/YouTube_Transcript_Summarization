00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:17.619
I essentially drag sledges for a living,

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.803
so it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually,

00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:22.345
but I'm going to read this question

00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:24.812
from an interview earlier this year:

00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:28.204
"Philosophically, does the constant supply of information

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:30.939
steal our ability to imagine

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.755
or replace our dreams of achieving?

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:36.541
After all, if it is being done somewhere by someone,

00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:38.844
and we can participate virtually,

00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:42.345
then why bother leaving the house?"

00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:44.994
I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer.

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:47.295
I'm not sure that's the most progressive or 21st-century

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:52.061
of job titles, but I've spent more than two percent now

00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:55.789
of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle,

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.316
so I get out of the house a fair bit.

00:00:59.316 --> 00:01:02.863
And in my nature, I guess, I am a doer of things

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:07.355
more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things,

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:11.579
and it's that dichotomy, the gulf between ideas and action

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.445
that I'm going to try and explore briefly.

00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:17.778
The pithiest answer to the question "why?"

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:20.146
that's been dogging me for the last 12 years

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.930
was credited certainly to this chap, the rakish-looking gentleman

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.186
standing at the back, second from the left,

00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:27.824
George Lee Mallory. Many of you will know his name.

00:01:27.824 --> 00:01:31.813
In 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds

00:01:31.813 --> 00:01:33.487
near the summit of Mt. Everest.

00:01:33.487 --> 00:01:36.742
He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest,

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:38.718
more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary.

00:01:38.718 --> 00:01:41.414
No one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery.

00:01:41.414 --> 00:01:44.483
But he was credited with coining the phrase, "Because it's there."

00:01:44.483 --> 00:01:47.173
Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.499
There's very little evidence to suggest it, but what he did say

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.979
is actually far nicer,

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.033
and again, I've printed this. I'm going to read it out.

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:56.987
"The first question which you will ask

00:01:56.987 --> 00:01:59.484
and which I must try to answer is this:

00:01:59.484 --> 00:02:03.260
What is the use of climbing Mt. Everest?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.948
And my answer must at once be, it is no use.

00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:09.709
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.582
Oh, we may learn a little about the behavior

00:02:11.582 --> 00:02:13.664
of the human body at high altitudes,

00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:16.328
and possibly medical men may turn our observation

00:02:16.328 --> 00:02:19.357
to some account for the purposes of aviation,

00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:21.557
but otherwise nothing will come of it.

00:02:21.557 --> 00:02:23.943
We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver,

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.542
and not a gem, nor any coal or iron.

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:29.341
We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted

00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:33.483
with crops to raise food. So it is no use.

00:02:33.483 --> 00:02:35.142
If you cannot understand that there is something in man

00:02:35.142 --> 00:02:37.814
which responds to the challenge of this mountain

00:02:37.814 --> 00:02:41.037
and goes out to meet it, that the struggle

00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:45.491
is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward,

00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:48.739
then you won't see why we go.

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.868
What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy,

00:02:51.868 --> 00:02:54.802
and joy, after all, is the end of life.

00:02:54.802 --> 00:02:57.005
We don't live to eat and make money.

00:02:57.005 --> 00:02:59.467
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life.

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:04.375
That is what life means, and that is what life is for."

00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:07.829
Mallory's argument that leaving the house,

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.272
embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun,

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:14.178
however, doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience.

00:03:14.178 --> 00:03:17.580
The furthest I've ever got away from my front door

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.724
was in the spring of 2004. I still don't know exactly

00:03:20.724 --> 00:03:23.231
what came over me, but my plan was to make

00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:27.474
a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean.

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:30.031
I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia

00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:33.363
to the North Pole, and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada.

00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:36.271
No one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time.

00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:38.523
A lot of experts were saying it was impossible,

00:03:38.523 --> 00:03:41.877
and my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea.

00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:44.230
(Laughter)

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.156
The journey from a small weather station on the north coast

00:03:47.156 --> 00:03:49.341
of Siberia up to my final starting point,

00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:51.893
the edge of the pack ice, the coast of the Arctic Ocean,

00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:55.354
took about five hours, and if anyone watched fearless

00:03:55.354 --> 00:03:58.666
Felix Baumgartner going up, rather than just coming down,

00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:01.270
you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension,

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.582
as I sat in a helicopter thundering north,

00:04:04.582 --> 00:04:07.239
and the sense, I think if anything, of impending doom.

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.929
I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into.

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:12.973
There was a bit of fun, a bit of joy.

00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:14.814
I was 26. I remember sitting there

00:04:14.814 --> 00:04:17.406
looking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go,

00:04:17.406 --> 00:04:19.647
I had a satellite phone, a pump-action shotgun

00:04:19.647 --> 00:04:21.670
in case I was attacked by a polar bear.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.961
I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter.

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:27.447
We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn,

00:04:27.447 --> 00:04:30.312
and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:33.204
and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me

00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:39.526
felt quite proud of myself, but mostly I was just utterly terrified.

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:41.616
And that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days.

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:44.115
I didn't see anyone else. We took this photo next to the helicopter.

00:04:44.115 --> 00:04:46.674
Beyond that, I didn't see anyone for 10 weeks.

00:04:46.674 --> 00:04:48.616
The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea,

00:04:48.616 --> 00:04:51.877
so I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean.

00:04:51.877 --> 00:04:55.987
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began.

00:04:55.987 --> 00:04:59.643
I was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies,

00:04:59.643 --> 00:05:02.244
about 400 pounds. The average temperature for the 10 weeks

00:05:02.244 --> 00:05:04.935
was minus 35. Minus 50 was the coldest.

00:05:04.935 --> 00:05:12.214
So again, there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had.

00:05:12.214 --> 00:05:13.747
One of the magical things about this journey, however,

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:15.850
is that because I'm walking over the sea,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.912
over this floating, drifting, shifting crust of ice

00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:22.107
that's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is

00:05:22.107 --> 00:05:24.055
it's an environment that's in a constant state of flux.

00:05:24.055 --> 00:05:26.401
The ice is always moving, breaking up, drifting around,

00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:29.861
refreezing, so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months

00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:33.308
was unique to me. No one else will ever, could ever,

00:05:33.308 --> 00:05:38.337
possibly see the views, the vistas, that I saw for 10 weeks.

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:42.300
And that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.182
I can try to tell you what it was like,

00:05:46.182 --> 00:05:48.027
but you'll never know what it was like,

00:05:48.027 --> 00:05:50.955
and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely,

00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:54.674
I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles,

00:05:54.674 --> 00:05:58.979
it was cold, nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day,

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.811
the more words fall short, and I'm unable to do it justice.

00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:07.002
And it seems to me, therefore, that the doing,

00:06:07.002 --> 00:06:12.300
you know, to try to experience, to engage, to endeavor,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.686
rather than to watch and to wonder, that's where

00:06:17.686 --> 00:06:19.912
the real meat of life is to be found,

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:23.856
the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days.

00:06:23.856 --> 00:06:26.339
And I would add a cautionary note here, however.

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:28.427
In my experience, there is something addictive

00:06:28.427 --> 00:06:32.866
about tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible.

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:35.101
Now I don't just mean in the field of

00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:37.388
daft macho Edwardian style derring-do,

00:06:37.388 --> 00:06:39.581
but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer,

00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:41.488
there is something addictive about this, and in my case,

00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:44.038
I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed

00:06:44.038 --> 00:06:45.420
from having a crack habit.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.125
I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it,

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:52.942
but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on,

00:06:52.942 --> 00:06:56.520
to ruin every relationship I've ever had,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.921
so be careful what you wish for.

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:03.302
Mallory postulated that there is something in man

00:07:03.302 --> 00:07:05.942
that responds to the challenge of the mountain,

00:07:05.942 --> 00:07:07.968
and I wonder if that's the case whether there's something

00:07:07.968 --> 00:07:11.025
in the challenge itself, in the endeavor, and particularly

00:07:11.025 --> 00:07:14.137
in the big, unfinished, chunky challenges that face humanity

00:07:14.137 --> 00:07:18.453
that call out to us, and in my experience that's certainly the case.

00:07:18.453 --> 00:07:20.233
There is one unfinished challenge

00:07:20.233 --> 00:07:23.505
that's been calling out to me for most of my adult life.

00:07:23.505 --> 00:07:24.933
Many of you will know the story.

00:07:24.933 --> 00:07:27.524
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team.

00:07:27.524 --> 00:07:29.397
Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try

00:07:29.397 --> 00:07:32.664
to become the first person to reach the South Pole.

00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:34.488
No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped

00:07:34.488 --> 00:07:36.513
at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon

00:07:36.513 --> 00:07:39.260
than we did about the heart of Antarctica.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.176
Scott, as many of you will know, was beaten to it

00:07:42.176 --> 00:07:44.469
by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team,

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:46.824
who used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot,

00:07:46.824 --> 00:07:49.245
all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges,

00:07:49.245 --> 00:07:53.677
and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there,

00:07:53.677 --> 00:07:56.935
I'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized.

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.205
All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast

00:07:59.205 --> 00:08:02.793
and all five died on that return journey.

00:08:02.793 --> 00:08:05.027
There is a sort of misconception nowadays that

00:08:05.027 --> 00:08:08.653
it's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure.

00:08:08.653 --> 00:08:09.940
When I talk about Antarctica, people often say,

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.230
"Hasn't, you know, that's interesting,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.423
hasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike?"

00:08:14.423 --> 00:08:18.013
Or, "That's nice. You know, my grandmother's going

00:08:18.013 --> 00:08:20.643
on a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know.

00:08:20.643 --> 00:08:23.509
Is there a chance you'll see her there?"

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:25.327
(Laughter)

00:08:25.327 --> 00:08:28.541
But Scott's journey remains unfinished.

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.868
No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica

00:08:30.868 --> 00:08:32.665
to the South Pole and back again.

00:08:32.665 --> 00:08:35.439
It is, arguably, the most audacious endeavor

00:08:35.439 --> 00:08:38.064
of that Edwardian golden age of exploration,

00:08:38.064 --> 00:08:40.617
and it seemed to me high time, given everything

00:08:40.617 --> 00:08:42.538
we have figured out in the century since

00:08:42.538 --> 00:08:46.119
from scurvy to solar panels, that it was high time

00:08:46.119 --> 00:08:47.896
someone had a go at finishing the job.

00:08:47.896 --> 00:08:50.592
So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do.

00:08:50.592 --> 00:08:53.160
This time next year, in October, I'm leading a team of three.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.019
It will take us about four months to make this return journey.

00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:59.072
That's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole.

00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:00.466
We have to turn around and come back again.

00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:02.713
I'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be

00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:05.448
blogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live

00:09:05.448 --> 00:09:07.881
vicariously and virtually through this journey

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.888
in a way that no one has ever before.

00:09:10.888 --> 00:09:13.471
And it'll also be a four-month chance for me to finally

00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:17.345
come up with a pithy answer to the question, "Why?"

00:09:17.345 --> 00:09:22.278
And our lives today are safer and more comfortable

00:09:22.278 --> 00:09:24.860
than they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.718
for explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school

00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:31.359
never mentioned it as an option.

00:09:31.359 --> 00:09:33.781
If I wanted to know, for example,

00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:36.077
how many stars were in the Milky Way,

00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:38.656
how old those giant heads on Easter Island were,

00:09:38.656 --> 00:09:40.781
most of you could find that out right now

00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:43.607
without even standing up.

00:09:43.607 --> 00:09:46.372
And yet, if I've learned anything in nearly 12 years now

00:09:46.372 --> 00:09:49.459
of dragging heavy things around cold places,

00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:53.418
it is that true, real inspiration and growth

00:09:53.418 --> 00:09:57.678
only comes from adversity and from challenge,

00:09:57.678 --> 00:10:00.694
from stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar

00:10:00.694 --> 00:10:03.175
and stepping out into the unknown.

00:10:03.175 --> 00:10:06.716
In life, we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to,

00:10:06.716 --> 00:10:08.525
and I think metaphorically speaking, at least,

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:11.395
we could all benefit from getting outside the house

00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:15.276
a little more often, if only we could summon up the courage.

00:10:15.276 --> 00:10:18.501
I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit

00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:21.397
and take a look at what's outside.

00:10:21.397 --> 00:10:22.625
Thank you very much.

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:31.594
