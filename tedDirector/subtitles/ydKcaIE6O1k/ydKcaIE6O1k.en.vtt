00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:16.502
I'd like to start with a simple question:

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.660
Why do the poor make
so many poor decisions?

00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:25.223
I know it's a harsh question,

00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:27.212
but take a look at the data.

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:29.079
The poor borrow more, save less,

00:00:29.103 --> 00:00:31.762
smoke more, exercise less, drink more

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:33.306
and eat less healthfully.

00:00:34.192 --> 00:00:35.353
Why?

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:37.798
Well, the standard explanation

00:00:37.822 --> 00:00:41.202
was once summed up by the British
Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.

00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:44.611
And she called poverty
"a personality defect."

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:46.475
(Laughter)

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.405
A lack of character, basically.

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:53.276
Now, I'm sure not many of you
would be so blunt.

00:00:54.317 --> 00:00:58.167
But the idea that there's something
wrong with the poor themselves

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.174
is not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher.

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:04.308
Some of you may believe that the poor
should be held responsible

00:01:04.332 --> 00:01:06.085
for their own mistakes.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.006
And others may argue that we should
help them to make better decisions.

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:13.903
But the underlying assumption is the same:

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.044
there's something wrong with them.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.735
If we could just change them,

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.251
if we could just teach them
how to live their lives,

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:23.808
if they would only listen.

00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:26.750
And to be honest,

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:30.112
this was what I thought for a long time.

00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:33.012
It was only a few years ago
that I discovered

00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:36.533
that everything I thought I knew
about poverty was wrong.

00:01:38.106 --> 00:01:40.757
It all started when I accidentally
stumbled upon a paper

00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:42.389
by a few American psychologists.

00:01:42.413 --> 00:01:44.966
They had traveled 8,000 miles,
all the way to India,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.565
for a fascinating study.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.833
And it was an experiment
with sugarcane farmers.

00:01:50.658 --> 00:01:54.006
You should know that these farmers
collect about 60 percent

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.163
of their annual income all at once,

00:01:56.187 --> 00:01:57.895
right after the harvest.

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:01.459
This means that they're relatively
poor one part of the year

00:02:01.483 --> 00:02:03.077
and rich the other.

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:08.471
The researchers asked them to do
an IQ test before and after the harvest.

00:02:09.722 --> 00:02:13.742
What they subsequently discovered
completely blew my mind.

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:19.428
The farmers scored much worse
on the test before the harvest.

00:02:20.277 --> 00:02:22.577
The effects of living
in poverty, it turns out,

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:25.969
correspond to losing 14 points of IQ.

00:02:25.993 --> 00:02:27.862
Now, to give you an idea,

00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:30.327
that's comparable
to losing a night's sleep

00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:32.524
or the effects of alcoholism.

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:36.764
A few months later,
I heard that Eldar Shafir,

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:40.335
a professor at Princeton University
and one of the authors of this study,

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.678
was coming over to Holland, where I live.

00:02:42.702 --> 00:02:44.104
So we met up in Amsterdam

00:02:44.128 --> 00:02:47.679
to talk about his revolutionary
new theory of poverty.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.313
And I can sum it up in just two words:

00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:53.252
scarcity mentality.

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.621
It turns out that people
behave differently

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:59.131
when they perceive a thing to be scarce.

00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:01.370
And what that thing is
doesn't much matter --

00:03:01.394 --> 00:03:04.407
whether it's not enough time,
money or food.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.558
You all know this feeling,

00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:08.545
when you've got too much to do,

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.585
or when you've put off breaking for lunch

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.272
and your blood sugar takes a dive.

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:15.124
This narrows your focus
to your immediate lack --

00:03:15.148 --> 00:03:17.158
to the sandwich you've got to have now,

00:03:17.182 --> 00:03:19.444
the meeting that's starting
in five minutes

00:03:19.468 --> 00:03:22.347
or the bills that have
to be paid tomorrow.

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:26.084
So the long-term perspective
goes out the window.

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:30.186
You could compare it to a new computer

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.397
that's running 10 heavy programs at once.

00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:35.794
It gets slower and slower, making errors.

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:37.640
Eventually, it freezes --

00:03:37.664 --> 00:03:39.770
not because it's a bad computer,

00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:42.414
but because it has too much to do at once.

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.147
The poor have the same problem.

00:03:46.654 --> 00:03:49.444
They're not making dumb decisions
because they are dumb,

00:03:49.468 --> 00:03:51.390
but because they're living in a context

00:03:51.414 --> 00:03:53.758
in which anyone would make dumb decisions.

00:03:54.362 --> 00:03:57.310
So suddenly I understood

00:03:57.334 --> 00:04:01.300
why so many of our anti-poverty
programs don't work.

00:04:02.467 --> 00:04:06.991
Investments in education, for example,
are often completely ineffective.

00:04:07.015 --> 00:04:09.827
Poverty is not a lack of knowledge.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.135
A recent analysis of 201 studies

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.471
on the effectiveness
of money-management training

00:04:15.495 --> 00:04:19.244
came to the conclusion
that it has almost no effect at all.

00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:20.713
Now, don't get me wrong --

00:04:20.737 --> 00:04:23.233
this is not to say the poor
don't learn anything --

00:04:23.257 --> 00:04:25.162
they can come out wiser for sure.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.470
But it's not enough.

00:04:27.494 --> 00:04:30.496
Or as Professor Shafir told me,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.504
"It's like teaching someone to swim

00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:35.554
and then throwing them in a stormy sea."

00:04:36.508 --> 00:04:38.103
I still remember sitting there,

00:04:39.023 --> 00:04:40.278
perplexed.

00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:42.268
And it struck me

00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:44.805
that we could have figured
this all out decades ago.

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:48.080
I mean, these psychologists didn't need
any complicated brain scans;

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:50.113
they only had to measure the farmer's IQ,

00:04:50.137 --> 00:04:52.645
and IQ tests were invented
more than 100 years ago.

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.748
Actually, I realized I had read about
the psychology of poverty before.

00:04:57.367 --> 00:05:01.041
George Orwell, one of the greatest
writers who ever lived,

00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:03.968
experienced poverty
firsthand in the 1920s.

00:05:04.676 --> 00:05:06.854
"The essence of poverty,"
he wrote back then,

00:05:06.878 --> 00:05:09.812
is that it "annihilates the future."

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:13.154
And he marveled at, quote,

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:17.032
"How people take it for granted
they have the right to preach at you

00:05:17.056 --> 00:05:18.207
and pray over you

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:20.703
as soon as your income falls
below a certain level."

00:05:20.727 --> 00:05:24.632
Now, those words are every bit
as resonant today.

00:05:26.965 --> 00:05:28.946
The big question is, of course:

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.310
What can be done?

00:05:30.334 --> 00:05:33.129
Modern economists have
a few solutions up their sleeves.

00:05:33.153 --> 00:05:35.212
We could help the poor
with their paperwork

00:05:35.236 --> 00:05:38.218
or send them a text message
to remind them to pay their bills.

00:05:38.242 --> 00:05:42.949
This type of solution is hugely popular
with modern politicians,

00:05:42.973 --> 00:05:44.676
mostly because,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.760
well, they cost next to nothing.

00:05:47.955 --> 00:05:51.965
These solutions are, I think,
a symbol of this era

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:54.166
in which we so often treat the symptoms,

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.033
but ignore the underlying cause.

00:05:57.494 --> 00:05:58.748
So I wonder:

00:05:59.606 --> 00:06:02.953
Why don't we just change the context
in which the poor live?

00:06:03.545 --> 00:06:05.670
Or, going back to our computer analogy:

00:06:05.694 --> 00:06:07.831
Why keep tinkering around
with the software

00:06:07.855 --> 00:06:11.920
when we can easily solve the problem
by installing some extra memory instead?

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:15.342
At that point, Professor Shafir
responded with a blank look.

00:06:16.112 --> 00:06:17.749
And after a few seconds, he said,

00:06:18.742 --> 00:06:20.867
"Oh, I get it.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.211
You mean you want to just hand out
more money to the poor

00:06:25.964 --> 00:06:27.815
to eradicate poverty.

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:30.640
Uh, sure, that'd be great.

00:06:31.734 --> 00:06:34.035
But I'm afraid that brand
of left-wing politics

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:35.903
you've got in Amsterdam --

00:06:35.927 --> 00:06:37.590
it doesn't exist in the States."

00:06:38.342 --> 00:06:42.317
But is this really
an old-fashioned, leftist idea?

00:06:43.214 --> 00:06:45.201
I remembered reading about an old plan --

00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:48.709
something that has been proposed
by some of history's leading thinkers.

00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:52.549
The philosopher Thomas More
first hinted at it in his book, "Utopia,"

00:06:52.573 --> 00:06:54.472
more than 500 years ago.

00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:58.575
And its proponents have spanned
the spectrum from the left to the right,

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.369
from the civil rights campaigner,
Martin Luther King,

00:07:01.393 --> 00:07:04.144
to the economist Milton Friedman.

00:07:05.093 --> 00:07:07.913
And it's an incredibly simple idea:

00:07:09.063 --> 00:07:11.698
basic income guarantee.

00:07:13.285 --> 00:07:14.443
What it is?

00:07:14.824 --> 00:07:15.986
Well, that's easy.

00:07:16.547 --> 00:07:19.278
It's a monthly grant, enough to pay
for your basic needs:

00:07:19.302 --> 00:07:20.980
food, shelter, education.

00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:23.324
It's completely unconditional,

00:07:23.348 --> 00:07:26.108
so no one's going to tell you
what you have to do for it,

00:07:26.132 --> 00:07:28.950
and no one's going to tell you
what you have to do with it.

00:07:28.974 --> 00:07:31.264
The basic income
is not a favor, but a right.

00:07:31.288 --> 00:07:33.421
There's absolutely no stigma attached.

00:07:34.192 --> 00:07:36.822
So as I learned about the true
nature of poverty,

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:38.336
I couldn't stop wondering:

00:07:39.028 --> 00:07:41.868
Is this the idea
we've all been waiting for?

00:07:42.518 --> 00:07:44.699
Could it really be that simple?

00:07:46.168 --> 00:07:47.968
And in the three years that followed,

00:07:47.992 --> 00:07:50.530
I read everything I could find
about basic income.

00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:52.491
I researched the dozens of experiments

00:07:52.515 --> 00:07:54.636
that have been conducted
all over the globe,

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.728
and it didn't take long before I stumbled
upon a story of a town

00:07:57.752 --> 00:08:00.224
that had done it --
had actually eradicated poverty.

00:08:00.248 --> 00:08:01.518
But then ...

00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:03.868
nearly everyone forgot about it.

00:08:05.406 --> 00:08:07.935
This story starts in Dauphin, Canada.

00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:14.451
In 1974, everybody in this small town
was guaranteed a basic income,

00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:17.210
ensuring that no one fell
below the poverty line.

00:08:17.234 --> 00:08:18.830
At the start of the experiment,

00:08:18.854 --> 00:08:22.327
an army of researchers
descended on the town.

00:08:23.187 --> 00:08:25.718
For four years, all went well.

00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:29.763
But then a new government
was voted into power,

00:08:29.787 --> 00:08:33.297
and the new Canadian cabinet saw
little point to the expensive experiment.

00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:37.574
So when it became clear there was
no money left to analyze the results,

00:08:37.598 --> 00:08:42.400
the researchers decided to pack
their files away in some 2,000 boxes.

00:08:43.995 --> 00:08:46.785
Twenty-five years went by,

00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:49.497
and then Evelyn Forget,
a Canadian professor,

00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:50.737
found the records.

00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:54.728
For three years, she subjected the data
to all manner of statistical analysis,

00:08:54.752 --> 00:08:56.338
and no matter what she tried,

00:08:56.362 --> 00:08:59.098
the results were the same every time:

00:08:59.788 --> 00:09:03.606
the experiment had been
a resounding success.

00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:06.291
Evelyn Forget discovered

00:09:06.315 --> 00:09:08.899
that the people in Dauphin
had not only become richer

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.454
but also smarter and healthier.

00:09:10.478 --> 00:09:13.984
The school performance of kids
improved substantially.

00:09:14.976 --> 00:09:19.204
The hospitalization rate decreased
by as much as 8.5 percent.

00:09:19.942 --> 00:09:21.752
Domestic violence incidents were down,

00:09:21.776 --> 00:09:23.567
as were mental health complaints.

00:09:23.973 --> 00:09:26.029
And people didn't quit their jobs.

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:30.063
The only ones who worked a little less
were new mothers and students --

00:09:30.087 --> 00:09:31.532
who stayed in school longer.

00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:34.583
Similar results have since been found

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:37.003
in countless other experiments
around the globe,

00:09:37.027 --> 00:09:39.274
from the US to India.

00:09:41.433 --> 00:09:42.653
So ...

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.834
here's what I've learned.

00:09:45.815 --> 00:09:47.971
When it comes to poverty,

00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:53.111
we, the rich, should stop
pretending we know best.

00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:56.785
We should stop sending shoes
and teddy bears to the poor,

00:09:56.809 --> 00:09:58.330
to people we have never met.

00:09:58.354 --> 00:10:01.887
And we should get rid of the vast
industry of paternalistic bureaucrats

00:10:01.911 --> 00:10:04.092
when we could simply
hand over their salaries

00:10:04.116 --> 00:10:05.922
to the poor they're supposed to help.

00:10:05.946 --> 00:10:08.242
(Applause)

00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:11.139
Because, I mean, the great
thing about money

00:10:11.163 --> 00:10:13.514
is that people can use it
to buy things they need

00:10:13.538 --> 00:10:16.691
instead of things that self-appointed
experts think they need.

00:10:17.702 --> 00:10:22.106
Just imagine how many brilliant scientists
and entrepreneurs and writers,

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.281
like George Orwell,

00:10:23.305 --> 00:10:26.095
are now withering away in scarcity.

00:10:26.119 --> 00:10:28.575
Imagine how much energy
and talent we would unleash

00:10:28.599 --> 00:10:31.338
if we got rid of poverty once and for all.

00:10:31.362 --> 00:10:35.714
I believe that a basic income would work
like venture capital for the people.

00:10:36.913 --> 00:10:38.957
And we can't afford not to do it,

00:10:38.981 --> 00:10:41.826
because poverty is hugely expensive.

00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:45.758
Just look at the cost of child poverty
in the US, for example.

00:10:45.782 --> 00:10:50.014
It's estimated at 500 billion
dollars each year,

00:10:50.038 --> 00:10:52.986
in terms of higher health care
spending, higher dropout rates,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.393
and more crime.

00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:58.297
Now, this is an incredible waste
of human potential.

00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:02.386
But let's talk about
the elephant in the room.

00:11:03.146 --> 00:11:06.158
How could we ever afford
a basic income guarantee?

00:11:06.872 --> 00:11:09.971
Well, it's actually a lot cheaper
than you may think.

00:11:09.995 --> 00:11:13.559
What they did in Dauphin is finance it
with a negative income tax.

00:11:13.583 --> 00:11:15.591
This means that your income is topped up

00:11:15.615 --> 00:11:18.027
as soon as you fall
below the poverty line.

00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:19.413
And in that scenario,

00:11:19.437 --> 00:11:21.951
according to our economists'
best estimates,

00:11:21.975 --> 00:11:25.000
for a net cost of 175 billion --

00:11:25.024 --> 00:11:29.931
a quarter of US military spending,
one percent of GDP --

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:33.509
you could lift all impoverished Americans
above the poverty line.

00:11:34.386 --> 00:11:37.527
You could actually eradicate poverty.

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:39.764
Now, that should be our goal.

00:11:40.536 --> 00:11:41.620
(Applause)

00:11:41.644 --> 00:11:44.576
The time for small thoughts
and little nudges is past.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.908
I really believe that the time has come
for radical new ideas,

00:11:47.932 --> 00:11:51.132
and basic income is so much more
than just another policy.

00:11:51.156 --> 00:11:55.794
It is also a complete rethink
of what work actually is.

00:11:55.818 --> 00:11:57.488
And in that sense,

00:11:57.512 --> 00:11:59.304
it will not only free the poor,

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:01.820
but also the rest of us.

00:12:03.081 --> 00:12:05.327
Nowadays, millions of people feel

00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:07.857
that their jobs have little
meaning or significance.

00:12:07.881 --> 00:12:10.698
A recent poll among 230,000 employees

00:12:10.722 --> 00:12:12.628
in 142 countries

00:12:12.652 --> 00:12:17.317
found that only 13 percent of workers
actually like their job.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.087
And another poll found that as much
as 37 percent of British workers

00:12:22.111 --> 00:12:25.041
have a job that they think
doesn't even need to exist.

00:12:26.207 --> 00:12:28.501
It's like Brad Pitt says in "Fight Club,"

00:12:28.525 --> 00:12:32.181
"Too often we're working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need."

00:12:32.205 --> 00:12:33.683
(Laughter)

00:12:33.707 --> 00:12:35.104
Now, don't get me wrong --

00:12:35.128 --> 00:12:37.682
I'm not talking about the teachers
and the garbagemen

00:12:37.706 --> 00:12:39.188
and the care workers here.

00:12:39.212 --> 00:12:40.826
If they stopped working,

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.167
we'd be in trouble.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.435
I'm talking about all those well-paid
professionals with excellent résumés

00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:48.264
who earn their money doing ...

00:12:48.288 --> 00:12:50.324
strategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings

00:12:50.348 --> 00:12:53.380
while brainstorming the value
add-on of disruptive co-creation

00:12:53.404 --> 00:12:54.577
in the network society.

00:12:54.601 --> 00:12:55.624
(Laughter)

00:12:55.648 --> 00:12:56.666
(Applause)

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:57.892
Or something like that.

00:12:57.916 --> 00:13:00.840
Just imagine again how much
talent we're wasting,

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:04.704
simply because we tell our kids
they'll have to "earn a living."

00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:09.200
Or think of what a math whiz working
at Facebook lamented a few years ago:

00:13:09.224 --> 00:13:11.086
"The best minds of my generation

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.223
are thinking about how
to make people click ads."

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:17.764
I'm a historian.

00:13:18.812 --> 00:13:20.881
And if history teaches us anything,

00:13:20.905 --> 00:13:23.697
it is that things could be different.

00:13:23.721 --> 00:13:25.112
There is nothing inevitable

00:13:25.136 --> 00:13:28.093
about the way we structured our society
and economy right now.

00:13:28.117 --> 00:13:30.473
Ideas can and do change the world.

00:13:30.497 --> 00:13:33.008
And I think that especially
in the past few years,

00:13:33.032 --> 00:13:34.461
it has become abundantly clear

00:13:34.485 --> 00:13:36.438
that we cannot stick to the status quo --

00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:38.037
that we need new ideas.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:43.532
I know that many of you
may feel pessimistic

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.619
about a future of rising inequality,

00:13:45.643 --> 00:13:46.920
xenophobia

00:13:46.944 --> 00:13:48.140
and climate change.

00:13:48.806 --> 00:13:51.024
But it's not enough
to know what we're against.

00:13:51.048 --> 00:13:52.660
We also need to be for something.

00:13:52.684 --> 00:13:55.218
Martin Luther King didn't say,
"I have a nightmare."

00:13:55.242 --> 00:13:57.115
(Laughter)

00:13:57.139 --> 00:13:58.298
He had a dream.

00:13:58.322 --> 00:13:59.401
(Applause)

00:13:59.425 --> 00:14:00.577
So ...

00:14:01.655 --> 00:14:02.880
here's my dream:

00:14:04.123 --> 00:14:05.761
I believe in a future

00:14:05.785 --> 00:14:08.138
where the value of your work
is not determined

00:14:08.162 --> 00:14:09.639
by the size of your paycheck,

00:14:09.663 --> 00:14:11.695
but by the amount of happiness you spread

00:14:11.719 --> 00:14:13.696
and the amount of meaning you give.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.952
I believe in a future

00:14:14.976 --> 00:14:18.636
where the point of education is not
to prepare you for another useless job

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.270
but for a life well-lived.

00:14:21.024 --> 00:14:22.303
I believe in a future

00:14:22.327 --> 00:14:25.421
where an existence
without poverty is not a privilege

00:14:25.445 --> 00:14:27.458
but a right we all deserve.

00:14:27.482 --> 00:14:28.947
So here we are.

00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:30.122
Here we are.

00:14:30.146 --> 00:14:32.336
We've got the research,
we've got the evidence

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.523
and we've got the means.

00:14:33.547 --> 00:14:37.456
Now, more than 500 years after Thomas More
first wrote about a basic income,

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.535
and 100 years after George Orwell
discovered the true nature of poverty,

00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:44.000
we all need to change our worldview,

00:14:44.024 --> 00:14:47.013
because poverty
is not a lack of character.

00:14:47.652 --> 00:14:50.220
Poverty is a lack of cash.

00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:52.325
Thank you.

00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:56.772
(Applause)
