00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.519
So it was the fall of 1902,

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.437
and President Theodore Roosevelt

00:00:17.437 --> 00:00:19.217
needed a little break from the White House,

00:00:19.217 --> 00:00:21.595
so he took a train to Mississippi

00:00:21.595 --> 00:00:23.723
to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.910
called Smedes.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.970
The first day of the hunt,
they didn't see a single bear,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.490
so it was a big bummer for everyone,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.334
but the second day, the dogs cornered one

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:34.734
after a really long chase, but by that point,

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.178
the president had given up

00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:37.920
and gone back to camp for lunch,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.531
so his hunting guide cracked the animal

00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:43.199
on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle,

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.907
and then tied it up to a tree

00:00:44.907 --> 00:00:47.519
and started tooting away on his bugle

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.558
to call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor

00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:51.074
of shooting it.

00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:53.431
The bear was a female.

00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:56.007
It was dazed, injured,

00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.654
severely underweight, a little mangy-looking,

00:00:59.654 --> 00:01:01.721
and when Roosevelt saw this animal

00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:03.343
tied up to the tree,

00:01:03.343 --> 00:01:05.142
he just couldn't bring himself to fire at it.

00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:07.293
He felt like that would go against his code

00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:09.259
as a sportsman.

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.960
A few days later, the scene was memorialized

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.995
in a political cartoon back in Washington.

00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:17.116
It was called "Drawing a Line in Mississippi,"

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:19.495
and it showed Roosevelt with
his gun down and his arm out,

00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:21.132
sparing the bear's life,

00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:22.658
and the bear was sitting on its hind legs

00:01:22.658 --> 00:01:24.696
with these two big, frightened, wide eyes

00:01:24.696 --> 00:01:26.826
and little ears pricked up at the top of its head.

00:01:26.826 --> 00:01:28.334
It looked really helpless, like you just wanted to

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:30.034
sweep it up into your arms

00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:31.250
and reassure it.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.716
It wouldn't have looked familiar at the time,

00:01:32.716 --> 00:01:34.784
but if you go looking for the cartoon now,

00:01:34.784 --> 00:01:37.520
you recognize the animal right away:

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.474
It's a teddy bear.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:41.095
And this is how the teddy bear was born.

00:01:41.095 --> 00:01:43.603
Essentially, toymakers took
the bear from the cartoon,

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.203
turned it into a plush toy, and then named it

00:01:45.203 --> 00:01:48.397
after President Roosevelt -- Teddy's bear.

00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:50.541
And I do feel a little ridiculous

00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:53.476
that I'm up here on this stage

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:54.894
and I'm choosing to use my time

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:57.162
to tell you about a 100-year-old story

00:01:57.162 --> 00:02:00.260
about the invention of a squishy kid's toy,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.220
but I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.181
inside that story is a more important story,

00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:09.409
a story about how dramatically our ideas

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.005
about nature can change,

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:14.345
and also about how, on the planet right now,

00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:16.441
the stories that we tell

00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:18.709
are dramatically changing nature.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.241
Because think about the teddy bear.

00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:22.746
For us, in retrospect, it feels like an obvious fit,

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:24.249
because bears are so cute and cuddly,

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.721
and who wouldn't want to give
one to their kids to play with,

00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:29.253
but the truth is that in 1902,

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:30.881
bears weren't cute and cuddly.

00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:32.182
I mean, they looked the same,

00:02:32.182 --> 00:02:33.315
but no one thought of them that way.

00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:36.161
In 1902, bears were monsters.

00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:39.485
Bears were something that frickin' terrified kids.

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:41.145
For generations at that point,

00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:44.418
the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger

00:02:44.418 --> 00:02:46.177
that people were encountering on the frontier,

00:02:46.177 --> 00:02:47.545
and the federal government was actually

00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:49.830
systematically exterminating bears

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.083
and lots of other predators too,

00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:52.933
like coyotes and wolves.

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:54.781
These animals, they were being demonized.

00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:56.079
They were called murderers

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.235
because they killed people's livestock.

00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:00.773
One government biologist, he explained this

00:03:00.773 --> 00:03:02.953
war on animals like the bear by saying

00:03:02.953 --> 00:03:05.343
that they no longer had a place

00:03:05.343 --> 00:03:07.589
in our advancing civilization,

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:11.317
and so we were just clearing them out of the way.

00:03:11.317 --> 00:03:15.083
In one 10-year period, close to half a million wolves

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:16.290
had been slaughtered.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.147
The grizzly would soon be wiped out

00:03:18.147 --> 00:03:21.580
from 95 percent of its original territory,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.802
and whereas once there had been 30 million bison

00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:26.420
moving across the plains, and you would have

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.128
these stories of trains having to stop

00:03:28.128 --> 00:03:30.116
for four or five hours so that these thick,

00:03:30.116 --> 00:03:33.444
living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks,

00:03:33.444 --> 00:03:38.803
now, by 1902, there were maybe 
less than 100 left in the wild.

00:03:38.803 --> 00:03:41.840
And so what I'm saying is, the teddy bear was born

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.364
into the middle of this great spasm of extermination,

00:03:45.364 --> 00:03:46.910
and you can see it as a sign that

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.550
maybe some people deep down

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.616
were starting to feel conflicted about all that killing.

00:03:52.616 --> 00:03:55.644
America still hated the bear and feared it,

00:03:55.644 --> 00:03:57.200
but all of a sudden, America also wanted

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.086
to give the bear a great big hug.

00:04:00.086 --> 00:04:02.315
So this is something that I've been really
curious about in the last few years.

00:04:02.315 --> 00:04:03.989
How do we imagine animals,

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.587
how do we think and feel about them,

00:04:05.587 --> 00:04:08.063
and how do their reputations get written

00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:10.319
and then rewritten in our minds?

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.163
We're here living in the eye of a great storm

00:04:13.163 --> 00:04:16.015
of extinction where half the species on the planet

00:04:16.015 --> 00:04:18.167
could be gone by the end of the century,

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:19.701
and so why is it that we come to care about

00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:22.571
some of those species and not others?

00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:24.701
Well, there's a new field, a relatively new field

00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:26.147
of social science that started looking at

00:04:26.147 --> 00:04:28.315
these questions and trying to unpack the powerful

00:04:28.315 --> 00:04:30.047
and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships

00:04:30.047 --> 00:04:32.168
that we have to animals,

00:04:32.168 --> 00:04:33.609
and I spent a lot of time looking through

00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:35.633
their academic journals,

00:04:35.633 --> 00:04:37.439
and all I can really say is that their findings

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:39.425
are astonishingly wide-ranging.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.251
So some of my favorites include that

00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:43.892
the more television a person
watches in Upstate New York,

00:04:43.892 --> 00:04:45.545
the more he or she is afraid

00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:47.242
of being attacked by a black bear.

00:04:47.242 --> 00:04:50.030
If you show a tiger to an American,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.140
they're much more likely to assume that it's female

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.400
and not male.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.168
In a study where a fake snake

00:04:55.168 --> 00:04:57.153
and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road,

00:04:57.153 --> 00:04:59.405
drivers hit the snake much
more often than the turtle,

00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:01.469
and about three percent of
drivers who hit the fake animals

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.747
seemed to do it on purpose.

00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:06.337
Women are more likely than men to get a

00:05:06.337 --> 00:05:09.372
"magical feeling" when they see dolphins in the surf.

00:05:09.372 --> 00:05:11.184
Sixty-eight percent of mothers with

00:05:11.184 --> 00:05:14.564
"high feelings of entitlement and self-esteem"

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.209
identified with the dancing cats

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:18.674
in a commercial for Purina. (Laughter)

00:05:18.674 --> 00:05:20.359
Americans consider lobsters

00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:21.655
more important than pigeons

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.841
but also much, much stupider.

00:05:23.841 --> 00:05:26.837
Wild turkeys are seen as only slightly
more dangerous than sea otters,

00:05:26.837 --> 00:05:32.010
and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.443
So some of this is physical, right?

00:05:33.443 --> 00:05:36.066
We tend to sympathize more
with animals that look like us,

00:05:36.066 --> 00:05:37.696
and especially that resemble human babies,

00:05:37.696 --> 00:05:39.123
so with big, forward-facing eyes

00:05:39.123 --> 00:05:40.385
and circular faces,

00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:42.119
kind of a roly-poly posture.

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:44.154
This is why, if you get a Christmas card from, like,

00:05:44.154 --> 00:05:45.294
your great aunt in Minnesota,

00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:46.867
there's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it,

00:05:46.867 --> 00:05:49.579
and not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider.

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:52.248
But it's not all physical, right?

00:05:52.248 --> 00:05:55.432
There's a cultural dimension to
how we think about animals,

00:05:55.432 --> 00:05:57.312
and we're telling stories about these animals,

00:05:57.312 --> 00:05:58.670
and like all stories,

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.743
they are shaped by the times and the places

00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:01.619
in which we're telling them.

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:03.093
So think about that moment

00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:06.011
back in 1902 again where a ferocious bear

00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:07.444
became a teddy bear.

00:06:07.444 --> 00:06:10.511
What was the context?
Well, America was urbanizing.

00:06:10.511 --> 00:06:13.270
For the first time, nearly a
majority of people lived in cities,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.706
so there was a growing distance
between us and nature.

00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:17.498
There was a safe space where we could

00:06:17.498 --> 00:06:20.172
reconsider the bear and romanticize it.

00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:22.906
Nature could only start to
seem this pure and adorable

00:06:22.906 --> 00:06:25.660
because we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.185
And you can see that cycle playing out

00:06:27.185 --> 00:06:29.347
again and again with all kinds of animals.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.223
It seems like we're always stuck between

00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:33.630
demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out,

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.210
and then when we get very close to doing that,

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.747
empathizing with it as an underdog

00:06:37.747 --> 00:06:40.272
and wanting to show it compassion.

00:06:40.272 --> 00:06:42.070
So we exert our power,

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.514
but then we're unsettled

00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:46.289
by how powerful we are.

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.413
So for example, this is one of

00:06:48.413 --> 00:06:51.050
probably thousands of letters and drawings

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.594
that kids sent to the Bush administration,

00:06:52.594 --> 00:06:54.305
begging it to protect the polar bear

00:06:54.305 --> 00:06:55.572
under the Endangered Species Act,

00:06:55.572 --> 00:06:58.080
and these were sent back in the mid-2000s,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.233
when awareness of climate
change was suddenly surging.

00:07:00.233 --> 00:07:01.562
We kept seeing that image of a polar bear

00:07:01.562 --> 00:07:02.980
stranded on a little ice floe

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.327
looking really morose.

00:07:04.327 --> 00:07:06.091
I spent days looking through these files.

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:08.250
I really love them. This one's my favorite.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.361
If you can see, it's a polar bear that's drowning

00:07:10.361 --> 00:07:12.776
and then it's also being eaten simultaneously

00:07:12.776 --> 00:07:15.480
by a lobster and a shark.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.192
This one came from a kid named Fritz,

00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:18.886
and he's actually got a solution to climate change.

00:07:18.886 --> 00:07:20.732
He's got it all worked out to an ethanol-based solution.

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:23.382
He says, "I feel bad about the polar bears.

00:07:23.382 --> 00:07:25.494
I like polar bears.

00:07:25.494 --> 00:07:31.280
Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz."

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.275
So 200 years ago, you would have Arctic explorers

00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:36.583
writing about polar bears leaping into their boats

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:37.826
and trying to devour them,

00:07:37.826 --> 00:07:39.493
even if they lit the bear on fire,

00:07:39.493 --> 00:07:41.673
but these kids don't see the polar bear that way,

00:07:41.673 --> 00:07:43.463
and actually they don't even see the polar bear

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.223
the way that I did back in the '80s.

00:07:45.223 --> 00:07:46.343
I mean, we thought of these animals

00:07:46.343 --> 00:07:49.209
as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic.

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:51.529
But look now how quickly that climate change

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:54.415
has flipped the image of the animal in our minds.

00:07:54.415 --> 00:07:56.855
It's gone from that bloodthirsty man-killer

00:07:56.855 --> 00:07:59.929
to this delicate, drowning victim,

00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:01.442
and when you think about it, that's kind of

00:08:01.442 --> 00:08:03.423
the conclusion to the story

00:08:03.423 --> 00:08:06.725
that the teddy bear started telling back in 1902,

00:08:06.725 --> 00:08:09.615
because back then, America had more or less

00:08:09.615 --> 00:08:10.930
conquered its share of the continent.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.233
We were just getting around to

00:08:12.233 --> 00:08:14.251
polishing off these last wild predators.

00:08:14.251 --> 00:08:16.805
Now, society's reach has expanded

00:08:16.805 --> 00:08:18.865
all the way to the top of the world,

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:21.159
and it's made even these, the most remote,

00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:23.191
the most powerful bears on the planet,

00:08:23.191 --> 00:08:26.690
seem like adorable and blameless victims.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.581
But you know, there's also a
postscript to the teddy bear story

00:08:29.581 --> 00:08:31.218
that not a lot of people talk about.

00:08:31.218 --> 00:08:33.001
We're going to talk about it,

00:08:33.001 --> 00:08:35.174
because even though it didn't really take long

00:08:35.174 --> 00:08:36.974
after Roosevelt's hunt in 1902

00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:38.951
for the toy to become a full-blown craze,

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.452
most people figured it was a fad,

00:08:41.452 --> 00:08:43.684
it was a sort of silly political novelty item

00:08:43.684 --> 00:08:45.926
and it would go away once the president left office,

00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:49.723
and so by 1909, when Roosevelt's successor,

00:08:49.723 --> 00:08:51.148
William Howard Taft,

00:08:51.148 --> 00:08:52.556
was getting ready to be inaugurated,

00:08:52.556 --> 00:08:54.488
the toy industry was on the hunt

00:08:54.488 --> 00:08:57.315
for the next big thing.

00:08:57.315 --> 00:08:59.572
They didn't do too well.

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:02.171
That January, Taft was the guest of honor

00:09:02.171 --> 00:09:03.610
at a banquet in Atlanta,

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.479
and for days in advance,

00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:06.924
the big news was the menu.

00:09:06.924 --> 00:09:08.010
They were going to be serving him

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.074
a Southern specialty, a delicacy, really,

00:09:10.074 --> 00:09:12.980
called possum and taters.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.582
So you would have a whole opossum

00:09:15.582 --> 00:09:16.947
roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes,

00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:18.394
and then sometimes they'd leave

00:09:18.394 --> 00:09:21.878
the big tail on it like a big, meaty noodle.

00:09:21.878 --> 00:09:23.557
The one brought to Taft's table

00:09:23.557 --> 00:09:26.742
weighed 18 pounds.

00:09:26.742 --> 00:09:29.446
So after dinner, the orchestra started to play,

00:09:29.446 --> 00:09:31.286
and the guests burst into song,

00:09:31.286 --> 00:09:32.910
and all of a sudden, Taft was surprised

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.632
with the presentation of a gift

00:09:34.632 --> 00:09:36.524
from a group of local supporters,

00:09:36.524 --> 00:09:38.960
and this was a stuffed opossum toy,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.170
all beady-eyed and bald-eared,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.870
and it was a new product they were putting forward

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.592
to be the William Taft presidency's answer

00:09:46.592 --> 00:09:50.140
to Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.586
They were calling it the "billy possum."

00:09:54.586 --> 00:09:58.436
Within 24 hours, the Georgia Billy Possum Company

00:09:58.436 --> 00:09:59.986
was up and running, brokering deals

00:09:59.986 --> 00:10:01.586
for these things nationwide,

00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:03.184
and the Los Angeles Times announced,

00:10:03.184 --> 00:10:05.136
very confidently, "The teddy bear

00:10:05.136 --> 00:10:07.662
has been relegated to a seat in the rear,

00:10:07.662 --> 00:10:10.260
and for four years, possibly eight,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.214
the children of the United States

00:10:12.214 --> 00:10:15.446
will play with billy possum."

00:10:15.446 --> 00:10:17.570
So from that point, there was a fit of opossum fever.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.038
There were billy possum postcards, billy possum pins,

00:10:20.038 --> 00:10:22.200
billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.930
There were smaller billy possums on a stick

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.872
that kids could wave around like flags.

00:10:26.872 --> 00:10:28.790
But even with all this marketing,

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.820
the life of the billy possum

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.004
turned out to be just pathetically brief.

00:10:34.004 --> 00:10:36.047
The toy was an absolute flop,

00:10:36.047 --> 00:10:37.626
and it was almost completely forgotten

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:38.994
by the end of the year,

00:10:38.994 --> 00:10:41.086
and what that means is that the billy possum

00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:42.586
didn't even make it to Christmastime,

00:10:42.586 --> 00:10:43.626
which when you think about it is

00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:47.475
a special sort of tragedy for a toy.

00:10:47.475 --> 00:10:49.398
So we can explain that failure two ways.

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:51.588
The first, well, it's pretty obvious.

00:10:51.588 --> 00:10:53.476
I'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway:

00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:56.337
Opossums are hideous. (Laughter)

00:10:56.337 --> 00:10:59.000
But maybe more importantly is that

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.690
the story of the billy possum was all wrong,

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.221
especially compared

00:11:03.221 --> 00:11:05.302
to the backstory of the teddy bear.

00:11:05.302 --> 00:11:07.544
Think about it: for most of
human's evolutionary history,

00:11:07.544 --> 00:11:09.869
what's made bears impressive to us

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:12.041
has been their complete independence from us.

00:11:12.041 --> 00:11:14.626
It's that they live these parallel lives

00:11:14.626 --> 00:11:17.131
as menaces and competitors.

00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:19.486
By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi,

00:11:19.486 --> 00:11:21.464
that stature was being crushed,

00:11:21.464 --> 00:11:23.702
and the animal that he had roped to a tree

00:11:23.702 --> 00:11:26.003
really was a symbol for all bears.

00:11:26.003 --> 00:11:28.430
Whether those animals lived or died now

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.440
was entirely up to the compassion

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.857
or the indifference of people.

00:11:33.857 --> 00:11:35.681
That said something really ominous

00:11:35.681 --> 00:11:38.363
about the future of bears,

00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:41.500
but it also said something very 
unsettling about who we'd become,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.942
if the survival of even an animal like that

00:11:43.942 --> 00:11:46.231
was up to us now.

00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:48.311
So now, a century later, if you're at all

00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:50.511
paying attention to what's
happening in the environment,

00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:54.189
you feel that discomfort so much more intensely.

00:11:54.189 --> 00:11:57.011
We're living now in an age of what scientists

00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:59.221
have started to call "conservation reliance,"

00:11:59.221 --> 00:12:01.411
and what that term means is that we've disrupted

00:12:01.411 --> 00:12:04.575
so much that nature can't possibly
stand on its own anymore,

00:12:04.575 --> 00:12:06.277
and most endangered species

00:12:06.277 --> 00:12:08.049
are only going to survive

00:12:08.049 --> 00:12:10.167
if we stay out there in the landscape

00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:12.663
riggging the world around them in their favor.

00:12:12.663 --> 00:12:14.519
So we've gone hands-on

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:16.957
and we can't ever take our hands off,

00:12:16.957 --> 00:12:18.850
and that's a hell of a lot of work.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.929
Right now, we're training condors

00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:23.881
not to perch on power lines.

00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:26.594
We teach whooping cranes
to migrate south for the winter

00:12:26.594 --> 00:12:28.893
behind little ultra-light airplanes.

00:12:28.893 --> 00:12:32.202
We're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets.

00:12:32.202 --> 00:12:36.552
We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones.

00:12:36.552 --> 00:12:39.869
So we've gone from annihilating species

00:12:39.869 --> 00:12:43.373
to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species

00:12:43.373 --> 00:12:45.315
indefinitely, and which ones?

00:12:45.315 --> 00:12:46.507
Well, the ones that we've told

00:12:46.507 --> 00:12:48.131
compelling stories about,

00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:51.346
the ones we've decided ought to stick around.

00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:54.920
The line between conservation and domestication

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.945
is blurred.

00:12:56.945 --> 00:12:58.797
So what I've been saying is that the stories

00:12:58.797 --> 00:13:01.420
that we tell about wild animals are so subjective

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.582
they can be irrational

00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:04.766
or romanticized or sensationalized.

00:13:04.766 --> 00:13:07.515
Sometimes they just have
nothing to do with the facts.

00:13:07.515 --> 00:13:10.765
But in a world of conservation reliance,

00:13:10.765 --> 00:13:12.971
those stories have very real consequences,

00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:15.399
because now, how we feel about an animal

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:17.029
affects its survival

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:19.389
more than anything that you read about

00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:21.438
in ecology textbooks.

00:13:21.438 --> 00:13:23.840
Storytelling matters now.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.373
Emotion matters.

00:13:25.373 --> 00:13:31.025
Our imagination has become an ecological force.

00:13:31.025 --> 00:13:32.962
And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part

00:13:32.962 --> 00:13:35.653
because the legend of Roosevelt

00:13:35.653 --> 00:13:37.708
and that bear in Mississippi

00:13:37.708 --> 00:13:39.168
was kind of like an allegory

00:13:39.168 --> 00:13:41.261
of this great responsibility that society

00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:43.955
was just beginning to face up to back then.

00:13:43.955 --> 00:13:46.375
It would be another 71 years

00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:48.229
before the Endangered Species Act was passed,

00:13:48.229 --> 00:13:50.559
but really, here's its whole ethos

00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:52.513
boiled down into something like a scene

00:13:52.513 --> 00:13:54.859
you'd see in a stained glass window.

00:13:54.859 --> 00:13:57.851
The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree,

00:13:57.851 --> 00:14:00.402
and the president of the United States

00:14:00.402 --> 00:14:02.794
decided to show it some mercy.

00:14:02.794 --> 00:14:05.440
Thank you.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.154
(Applause)
