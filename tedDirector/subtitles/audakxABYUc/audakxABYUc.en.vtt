00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
This is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
that pays all the bills.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
It's held every two years in Burma.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And I particularly remember a really good speech

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
(Laughter)

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
But, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
that what we create in advertising,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
you might call it badge value, subjective value,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
intangible value of some kind --

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
gets rather a bad rap.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
where there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
You can either live in a world which is poorer,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
which people in general don't like.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.260
constitutes a greater part of overall value,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
that actually intangible value, in many ways

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
is a very, very fine substitute

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
for using up labor or limited resources

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
in the creation of things.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
The question was given to a bunch of engineers,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
about 15 years ago, "How do we make the journey to Paris better?"

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And they came up with a very good engineering solution,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
which was to spend six billion pounds

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
building completely new tracks

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
from London to the coast,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.260
... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
merely to make it shorter.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and female supermodels,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
for the entire duration of the journey.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
(Laughter)

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.260
(Applause)

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Now, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.260
(Laughter)

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Now, here is another naive advertising man's question again.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And this shows that engineers,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
medical people, scientific people,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
have an obsession with solving the problems of reality,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
when actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
in society, most problems are actually problems of perception.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
So I'll ask you another question.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
What on earth is wrong with placebos?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
They work extraordinarily well.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
They have no side effects,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
or if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
(Laughter)

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and actually produce placebo education.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
It actually works by giving you the impression

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
that you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
of unwarranted self-confidence,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
which then makes you very, very successful in later life.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
So, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
(Laughter)

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.260
(Applause)

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
But, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
How many problems of life can be solved

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
actually by tinkering with perception,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
of actually trying to change reality?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
but doing a bit of historical research,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
it seems to be Fredrick the Great.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.260
wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And you get a far lower risk of famine,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
The only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables --

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
rather like contemporary Scottish people.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
(Laughter)

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
So, actually, he tried making it compulsory.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
The Prussian peasantry said,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing."

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
There are even records of people being executed

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
for refusing to grow potatoes.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
So he tried plan B.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And he planted it in a royal potato patch,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
with guards who had instructions

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
to guard over it, night and day,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
but with secret instructions not to guard it very well.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.260
(Laughter)

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Now, 18th century peasants know that there is one

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
pretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
it's worth stealing.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Before long, there was a massive underground

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
potato-growing operation in Germany.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.260
What he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
It was an absolute masterpiece.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.260
"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk."

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
in Turkey, to modernize it.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
and a hell of a lot of resistance.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Ataturk was a lateral thinker.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.260
(Laughter)

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
(Applause)

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
I can't verify that fully, but it does not matter.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
All convicted child molesters

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
have to drive a Porsche Cayenne.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.260
(Laughter)

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Which is that, actually, first one,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
all value is actually relative.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
All value is perceived value.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
For those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja -- it's actually the Spanish for "orange juice."

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
decided to practice price discrimination

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
As an advertising man, I have to admire that.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.260
But the first thing is that all value is subjective.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
These funny signs that flash your speed at you,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
some of the new ones, on the bottom right,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
to act as an emotional trigger.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
of the running cost of a conventional speed camera,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
but they prevent twice as many accidents.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
So, the bizarre thing, which is baffling

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
to conventional, classically trained economists,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
is that a weird little smiley face

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
has a better effect on changing your behavior

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.260
than the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Tiny little behavioral economics detail:

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
in Italy, penalty points go backwards.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
You start with 12 and they take them away.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
Because they found that loss aversion

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
is a more powerful influence on people's behavior.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
In Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!"

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Not so in Italy.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Another fantastic case of creating intangible value

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
after all, the environmental movement needs to be about:

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
The wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
were encouraged to give in all their jewelry.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
And it was replaced with replica jewelry

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
made of cast iron.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Here's one: "Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813."

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
wasn't made of gold or diamonds.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
It was made of cast iron.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
of having gold jewelry. This actually

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
had symbolic value, badge value.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
So, the modern equivalent would of course be this.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.260
(Laughter)

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare --

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
there are opposite kind of things

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
where actually the value in them depends on them being

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Adam Smith talks about 18th century America,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.260
where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
it was almost a block in the economy in New England,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
which lead to more egalitarian societies.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
What's also interesting, if you look at products

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
that have a high component

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
of what you might call messaging value,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
They are often quite egalitarian.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
In terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.260
which replaces material value with symbolic value.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Coca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and you may not like the Coca-Cola company,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
What Warhol said about Coke is, he said,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.260
can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street."

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
Now, that is, actually, when you think about it -- we take it for granted --

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
it's actually a remarkable achievement,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
to produce something that's that democratic.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Now, we basically have to change our views slightly.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
There is a basic view that real value involves making things,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
involves labor. It involves engineering.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
It involves limited raw materials.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
It patently veers toward propaganda.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
However, what we do have now

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
is a much more variegated media ecosystem

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
in which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
When I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
as translated into food.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
You had a monopoly supplier. On the left,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
you have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.260
(Laughter)

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
And on your right you have a dependent public

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
(Laughter)

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
Nowadays, the user is actually involved.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
This is actually what's called, in the digital world, "user-generated content."

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
Although it's called agriculture in the world of food.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.260
(Laughter)

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
This is actually called a mash-up,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
where you take content that someone else has produced

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and you do something new with it.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
In the world of food we call it cooking.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
This is food 2.0,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
This is mobile food. British are very good at that.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
the pie, the sandwich.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
We invented the whole lot of them.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
but it's not very portable, generally.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.260
(Laughter)

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
I only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
He actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.260
(Laughter)

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
Finally, we have contextual communication.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
Now, the reason I show you Pernod -- it's only one example.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
It tastes great within the borders of that country,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
(Laughter)

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Unicum in Hungary, for example.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
which even tastes shite when you're in Greece.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
(Laughter)

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
But so much communication now is contextual

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
that the capacity for actually nudging people,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
for giving them better information -- B.J. Fogg,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
at the University of Stanford, makes the point

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
that actually the mobile phone is --

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
He's invented the phrase, "persuasive technologies."

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
contextual, timely and immediate,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
Now, if we have all these tools at our disposal,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
we simply have to ask the question,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
and Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
I'll give you one example.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
put 50 dollars into your pension,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
you would save a lot more.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
the behavior. Okay?

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Now, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
opportunities for impulse buying.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.260
Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
If you did this, more people would save more.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
It's simply a question of changing the interface

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
by which people make decisions,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and the very nature of the decisions changes.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Obviously, I don't want people to do this,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
consumerism needlessly postponed.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.260
(Laughter)

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
But if anybody did want to do that,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
fundamental opportunities to change human behavior.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Now, I've got an example here from Canada.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
called Hunter Somerville,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
who was working in improv in Toronto,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
and got a part-time job in advertising,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
and was given the job of advertising Shreddies.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
Now this is the most perfect case of creating

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
intangible, added value,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
without changing the product in the slightest.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.260
only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
(Laughter)

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
In working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
he came up with this.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Video: (Buzzer)

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Man: Shreddies is supposed to be square.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.260
(Laughter)

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Woman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
(Laughter)

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Voiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.260
(Applause)

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Rory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
of intangible value creation. All it requires is

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
photons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
I would say it's a work of genius.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
Man: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
which is something very exciting for them.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:32.260
(Laughter)

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.260
(Laughter)

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
Woman: Weren't they square?

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
Woman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
Man: They -- Yeah, it's all in the appearance.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.260
But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
if you flip it over it looks like a nine.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
But a six is very different from a nine.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Woman # 3: Or an "M" and a "W". Man: An "M" and a "W", exactly.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
Man #2: [unclear]

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
it's more interesting looking.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
Man: Just try both of them.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Take a square one there, first.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:18.260
(Laughter)

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
Man: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
Man: The first one?

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
(Laughter)

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.260
Rory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
There were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
who actually resented this intrusion.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
So, eventually, the manufacturers actually

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
arrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
(Laughter)

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:49.260
(Applause)

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:54.260
(Laughter)

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
If you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
the American Institute of Wine Economics,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
which actually does extensive research into perception of things,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
and discovers that except for among

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
in wine,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
except when you tell the people how expensive it is,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
So drink your wine blind in the future.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
But this is both hysterically funny --

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
but I think an important philosophical point,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
and less time agonizing over what else we can do.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
Two quotations to more or less end with.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
One of them is, "Poetry is when you make new things

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
familiar and familiar things new."

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.260
to gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
those things which are already existing.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
Because they help people share news.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.260
They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
and increase the kind of third-party

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.260
enjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
The second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
which is, "We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,"

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
which I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
And a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
love, sex and other things,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
and learn to place a material value

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
on what you've previously discounted

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
for being merely intangible, a thing not seen,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
Thank you very much indeed.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.260
(Applause)
