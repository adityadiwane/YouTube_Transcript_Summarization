00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:14.723
A few years ago,

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:18.293
my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis.

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:25.088
Her wrists, knees and toes swelled up,
causing crippling, chronic pain.

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:28.081
She had to file for disability.

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:30.734
She stopped attending our local mosque.

00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:34.913
Some mornings it was too painful
for her to brush her teeth.

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:37.516
I wanted to help.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.266
But I didn't know how.

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:41.941
I'm not a doctor.

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:47.011
So, what I am is a historian of medicine.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.392
So I started to research
the history of chronic pain.

00:00:51.957 --> 00:00:55.978
Turns out, UCLA has an entire
history of pain collection

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.166
in their archives.

00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:02.045
And I found a story --
a fantastic story --

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:07.865
of a man who saved -- rescued --
millions of people from pain;

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:09.277
people like my mom.

00:01:10.772 --> 00:01:12.232
Yet, I had never heard of him.

00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:15.888
There were no biographies
of him, no Hollywood movies.

00:01:16.483 --> 00:01:20.272
His name was John J. Bonica.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.618
But when our story begins,

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:26.755
he was better known as
Johnny "Bull" Walker.

00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:30.951
It was a summer day in 1941.

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:37.017
The circus had just arrived
in the tiny town of Brookfield, New York.

00:01:37.486 --> 00:01:41.407
Spectators flocked to see
the wire-walkers, the tramp clowns --

00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:44.166
if they were lucky, the human cannonball.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.074
They also came to see the strongman,
Johnny "Bull" Walker,

00:01:48.098 --> 00:01:51.431
a brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:55.408
You know, on that particular day,
a voice rang out

00:01:55.432 --> 00:01:57.417
over the circus P.A. system.

00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:01.278
They needed a doctor urgently,
in the live animal tent.

00:02:01.302 --> 00:02:03.686
Something had gone wrong
with the lion tamer.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.839
The climax of his act had gone wrong,

00:02:06.863 --> 00:02:11.059
and his head was stuck
inside the lion's mouth.

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.288
He was running out of air;

00:02:13.312 --> 00:02:15.479
the crowd watched in horror

00:02:15.503 --> 00:02:18.407
as he struggled and then passed out.

00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:22.049
When the lion finally did relax its jaws,

00:02:22.073 --> 00:02:26.527
the lion tamer just slumped
to the ground, motionless.

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:30.182
When he came to a few minutes later,

00:02:30.206 --> 00:02:32.346
he saw a familiar figure hunched over him.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.169
It was Bull Walker.

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:41.049
The strongman had given the lion tamer
mouth-to-mouth, and saved his life.

00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:44.692
Now, the strongman hadn't told anyone,

00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:48.175
but he was actually
a third-year medical student.

00:02:48.788 --> 00:02:52.450
He toured with the circus
during summers to pay tuition,

00:02:52.474 --> 00:02:55.184
but kept it a secret
to protect his persona.

00:02:55.787 --> 00:02:59.191
He was supposed to be
a brute, a villain --

00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:01.437
not a nerdy do-gooder.

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:05.132
His medical colleagues didn't
know his secret, either.

00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:09.235
As he put it, "If you were
an athlete, you were a dumb dodo."

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.320
So he didn't tell them about the circus,

00:03:12.344 --> 00:03:17.661
or about how he wrestled professionally
on evenings and weekends.

00:03:18.353 --> 00:03:20.973
He used a pseudonym like Bull Walker,

00:03:20.997 --> 00:03:22.926
or later, the Masked Marvel.

00:03:23.627 --> 00:03:27.135
He even kept it a secret that same year,

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.518
when he was crowned
the Light Heavyweight Champion

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:31.771
of the world.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:37.919
Over the years, John J. Bonica
lived these parallel lives.

00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:40.209
He was a wrestler;

00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:41.390
he was a doctor.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.310
He was a heel;

00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:44.491
he was a hero.

00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:46.834
He inflicted pain,

00:03:46.858 --> 00:03:48.016
and he treated it.

00:03:49.242 --> 00:03:52.744
And he didnâ€™t know it at the time,
but over the next five decades,

00:03:52.768 --> 00:03:55.586
he'd draw on these dueling identities

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.923
to forge a whole new way
to think about pain.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.750
It'd change modern medicine
so much so, that decades later,

00:04:03.774 --> 00:04:08.276
Time magazine would call him
pain relief's founding father.

00:04:09.351 --> 00:04:10.844
But that all happened later.

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:17.791
In 1942, Bonica graduated
medical school and married Emma,

00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:21.491
his sweetheart, whom he had met
at one of his matches years before.

00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:25.321
He still wrestled in secret -- he had to.

00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:30.428
His internship at New York's
St. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing.

00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:34.853
With his championship belt,
he wrestled in big-ticket venues,

00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:36.814
like Madison Square Garden,

00:04:36.838 --> 00:04:38.514
against big-time opponents,

00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:41.387
like Everett "The Blonde Bear" Marshall,

00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:45.053
or three-time world champion,
Angelo Savoldi.

00:04:46.192 --> 00:04:48.969
The matches took a toll on his body;

00:04:48.993 --> 00:04:52.271
he tore hip joints, fractured ribs.

00:04:52.295 --> 00:04:57.193
One night, The Terrible Turk's big toe
scratched a scar like Capone's

00:04:57.217 --> 00:04:58.519
down the side of his face.

00:04:59.302 --> 00:05:03.341
The next morning at work,
he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.064
Twice Bonica showed up to the O.R.
with one eye so bruised,

00:05:09.088 --> 00:05:10.334
he couldn't see out of it.

00:05:11.138 --> 00:05:15.641
But worst of all were
his mangled cauliflower ears.

00:05:16.094 --> 00:05:19.502
He said they felt like two baseballs
on the sides of his head.

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:24.415
Pain just kept accumulating in his life.

00:05:25.177 --> 00:05:28.733
Next, he watched his wife go
into labor at his hospital.

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.633
She heaved and pushed, clearly in anguish.

00:05:33.657 --> 00:05:36.101
Her obstetrician called
out to the intern on duty

00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:38.633
to give her a few drops of ether
to ease her pain.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:42.880
But the intern was a young guy,
just three weeks on the job --

00:05:42.904 --> 00:05:45.840
he was jittery, and in applying the ether,

00:05:45.864 --> 00:05:47.692
irritated Emma's throat.

00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:52.093
She vomited and choked,
and started to turn blue.

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:58.235
Bonica, who was watching all this,
pushed the intern out of the way,

00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:59.840
cleared her airway,

00:05:59.864 --> 00:06:02.682
and saved his wife
and his unborn daughter.

00:06:04.172 --> 00:06:09.017
At that moment, he decided
to devote his life to anesthesiology.

00:06:09.414 --> 00:06:14.826
Later, he'd even go on to help develop
the epidural, for delivering mothers.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.985
But before he could focus on obstetrics,

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.765
Bonica had to report for basic training.

00:06:22.373 --> 00:06:23.967
Right around D-Day,

00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:27.213
Bonica showed up
to Madigan Army Medical Center,

00:06:27.237 --> 00:06:28.387
near Tacoma.

00:06:28.783 --> 00:06:33.476
At 7,700 beds, it was one of the largest
army hospitals in America.

00:06:34.242 --> 00:06:36.936
Bonica was in charge
of all pain control there.

00:06:37.618 --> 00:06:39.618
He was only 27.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.764
Treating so many patients,
Bonica started noticing cases

00:06:43.788 --> 00:06:46.283
that contradicted everything
he had learned.

00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:51.822
Pain was supposed to be
a kind of alarm bell -- in a good way --

00:06:51.846 --> 00:06:55.446
a body's way of signaling an injury,
like a broken arm.

00:06:56.538 --> 00:06:58.150
But in some cases,

00:06:58.174 --> 00:07:01.649
like after a patient had a leg amputated,

00:07:01.673 --> 00:07:05.694
that patient might still complain
of pain in that nonexistent leg.

00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:10.223
But if the injury had been treated, why
would the alarm bell keep ringing?

00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:14.990
There were other cases in which there
was no evidence of an injury whatsoever,

00:07:15.014 --> 00:07:17.496
and yet, still the patient hurt.

00:07:18.678 --> 00:07:22.646
Bonica tracked down all the specialists
at his hospital -- surgeons,

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.008
neurologists, psychiatrists, others.

00:07:25.782 --> 00:07:28.858
And he tried to get
their opinions on his patients.

00:07:29.643 --> 00:07:34.617
It took too long, so he started organizing
group meetings over lunch.

00:07:35.123 --> 00:07:39.589
It would be like a tag team of specialists
going up against the patient's pain.

00:07:39.613 --> 00:07:43.553
No one had ever focused on pain
this way before.

00:07:44.928 --> 00:07:46.928
After that, he hit the books.

00:07:47.845 --> 00:07:50.708
He read every medical textbook
he could get his hands on,

00:07:50.732 --> 00:07:53.283
carefully noting every mention
of the word "pain."

00:07:54.282 --> 00:07:58.163
Out of the 14,000 pages he read,

00:07:58.187 --> 00:08:02.363
the word "pain" was
on 17 and a half of them.

00:08:02.908 --> 00:08:04.910
Seventeen and a half.

00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:10.206
For the most basic, most common,
most frustrating part of being a patient.

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:12.982
Bonica was shocked -- I'm quoting him,

00:08:13.006 --> 00:08:17.460
he said, "What the hell kind of conclusion
can you come to there?

00:08:17.484 --> 00:08:20.666
The most important thing
from the patient's perspective,

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.055
they don't talk about."

00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:27.185
So over the next eight years,
Bonica would talk about it.

00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:29.654
He'd write about it; he'd write
those missing pages.

00:08:30.057 --> 00:08:33.771
He wrote what would later be known
as the Bible of Pain.

00:08:34.575 --> 00:08:37.992
In it he proposed new strategies,

00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:41.590
new treatments using
nerve-block injections.

00:08:41.614 --> 00:08:44.357
He proposed a new institution,
the Pain Clinic,

00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:46.379
based on those lunchtime meetings.

00:08:47.248 --> 00:08:49.659
But the most important thing
about his book

00:08:49.683 --> 00:08:53.765
was that it was kind of an emotional
alarm bell for medicine.

00:08:54.486 --> 00:09:00.467
A desperate plea to doctors
to take pain seriously

00:09:00.491 --> 00:09:01.887
in patients' lives.

00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:06.590
He recast the very purpose of medicine.

00:09:07.373 --> 00:09:11.558
The goal wasn't to make patients better;

00:09:11.582 --> 00:09:14.934
it was to make patients feel better.

00:09:16.955 --> 00:09:19.042
He pushed his pain agenda for decades,

00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:22.084
before it finally took hold
in the mid-'70s.

00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:26.285
Hundreds of pain clinics sprung up
all over the world.

00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:30.941
But as they did -- a tragic twist.

00:09:31.754 --> 00:09:34.915
Bonica's years of wrestling
caught up to him.

00:09:36.597 --> 00:09:38.749
He had been out of the ring
for over 20 years,

00:09:38.773 --> 00:09:43.078
but those 1,500 professional bouts
had left a mark on his body.

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:47.838
Still in his mid-50s, he suffered
severe osteoarthritis.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.379
Over the next 20 years
he'd have 22 surgeries,

00:09:52.403 --> 00:09:54.930
including four spine operations,

00:09:54.954 --> 00:09:57.521
and hip replacement after hip replacement.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.367
He could barely raise
his arm, turn his neck.

00:10:02.144 --> 00:10:04.797
He needed aluminum crutches to walk.

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:09.899
His friends and former students
became his doctors.

00:10:09.923 --> 00:10:14.125
One recalled that he probably
had more nerve-block injections

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:16.727
than anyone else on the planet.

00:10:18.043 --> 00:10:21.481
Already a workaholic,
he worked even more --

00:10:21.505 --> 00:10:23.451
15- to 18-hour days.

00:10:23.922 --> 00:10:26.431
Healing others became more
than just his job,

00:10:26.455 --> 00:10:29.177
it was his own most effective
form of relief.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.321
"If I wasn't as busy as I am,"
he told a reporter at the time,

00:10:34.345 --> 00:10:37.530
"I would be a completely disabled guy."

00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:42.962
On a business trip to Florida
in the early 1980s,

00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:48.318
Bonica got a former student to drive
him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa.

00:10:49.338 --> 00:10:53.482
They drove past palm trees
and pulled up to an old mansion,

00:10:53.506 --> 00:10:58.116
with giant silver howitzer cannons
hidden in the garage.

00:10:58.895 --> 00:11:01.834
The house belonged to the Zacchini family,

00:11:01.858 --> 00:11:04.830
who were something like
American circus royalty.

00:11:06.229 --> 00:11:08.802
Decades earlier, Bonica had watched them,

00:11:08.826 --> 00:11:11.713
clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles,

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:15.505
doing the act they pioneered --
the Human Cannonball.

00:11:16.772 --> 00:11:19.847
But now they were like him: retired.

00:11:21.267 --> 00:11:24.838
That generation is all dead
now, including Bonica,

00:11:24.862 --> 00:11:27.805
so there's no way to know exactly
what they said that day.

00:11:28.475 --> 00:11:30.475
But still, I love imagining it.

00:11:31.233 --> 00:11:34.486
The strongman and the human
cannonballs reunited,

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.963
showing off old scars, and new ones.

00:11:37.802 --> 00:11:40.058
Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice.

00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:45.408
Maybe he told them what he later
said in an oral history,

00:11:45.432 --> 00:11:51.338
which is that his time in the circus
and wrestling deeply molded his life.

00:11:53.286 --> 00:11:55.970
Bonica saw pain close up.

00:11:57.236 --> 00:11:59.236
He felt it. He lived it.

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:04.470
And it made it impossible
for him to ignore in others.

00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:08.563
Out of that empathy, he spun
a whole new field,

00:12:08.587 --> 00:12:11.699
played a major role in getting
medicine to acknowledge pain

00:12:11.723 --> 00:12:12.975
in and of itself.

00:12:14.627 --> 00:12:16.539
In that same oral history,

00:12:16.563 --> 00:12:19.072
Bonica claimed that pain

00:12:19.096 --> 00:12:23.353
is the most complex human experience.

00:12:24.215 --> 00:12:28.029
That it involves your past life,
your current life,

00:12:28.053 --> 00:12:30.243
your interactions, your family.

00:12:31.256 --> 00:12:33.811
That was definitely true for Bonica.

00:12:34.593 --> 00:12:37.264
But it was also true for my mom.

00:12:40.043 --> 00:12:43.342
It's easy for doctors to see my mom

00:12:43.366 --> 00:12:46.628
as a kind of professional patient,

00:12:46.652 --> 00:12:50.470
a woman who just spends her days
in waiting rooms.

00:12:51.714 --> 00:12:54.605
Sometimes I get stuck seeing her
that same way.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:59.043
But as I saw Bonica's pain --

00:12:59.067 --> 00:13:03.599
a testament to his fully lived life --

00:13:03.623 --> 00:13:08.130
I started to remember all the things
that my mom's pain holds.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.138
Before they got swollen and arthritic,

00:13:14.162 --> 00:13:17.477
my mom's fingers clacked away

00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:20.399
in the hospital H.R. department
where she worked.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.238
They folded samosas for our entire mosque.

00:13:26.734 --> 00:13:30.435
When I was a kid, they cut my hair,

00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:32.911
wiped my nose,

00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:34.585
tied my shoes.

00:13:41.832 --> 00:13:43.157
Thank you.

00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:50.000
(Applause)
