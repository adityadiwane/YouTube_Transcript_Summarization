00:00:13.622 --> 00:00:16.946
Today I want to confess something to you,

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.865
but first of all I'm going to ask you
a couple of questions.

00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:21.642
How many people here have children?

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:25.074
And how many of you are confident

00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:27.152
that you know how
to bring up your children

00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:28.411
in exactly the right way?

00:00:28.435 --> 00:00:31.876
(Laughter)

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.039
OK, I don't see too many hands
going up on that second one,

00:00:35.063 --> 00:00:36.610
and that's my confession, too.

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:37.885
I've got three boys;

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:39.716
they're three, nine and 12.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.806
And like you, and like most parents,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.770
the honest truth is I have
pretty much no idea what I'm doing.

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.874
I want them to be
happy and healthy in their lives,

00:00:47.898 --> 00:00:49.884
but I don't know what I'm supposed to do

00:00:49.908 --> 00:00:51.914
to make sure they are happy and healthy.

00:00:51.938 --> 00:00:54.915
There's so many books
offering all kinds of conflicting advice,

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:56.475
it can be really overwhelming.

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:59.595
So I've spent most of their lives
just making it up as I go along.

00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:03.870
However, something changed me
a few years ago,

00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:06.692
when I came across a little secret
that we have in Britain.

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:10.666
It's helped me become more confident
about how I bring up my own children,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.099
and it's revealed a lot about
how we as a society can help all children.

00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:16.802
I want to share that secret
with you today.

00:01:17.948 --> 00:01:19.885
For the last 70 years,

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.386
scientists in Britain have been following
thousands of children through their lives

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.414
as part of an incredible scientific study.

00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.991
There's nothing quite like it
anywhere else in the world.

00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:32.924
Collecting information
on thousands of children

00:01:32.948 --> 00:01:34.521
is a really powerful thing to do,

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:36.832
because it means we can compare
the ones who say,

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:40.266
do well at school or end up healthy
or happy or wealthy as adults,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.078
and the ones who struggle much more,

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:45.103
and then we can sift through
all the information we've collected

00:01:45.127 --> 00:01:48.027
and try to work out why
their lives turned out different.

00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:51.007
This British study --
it's actually a kind of crazy story.

00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.436
So it all starts back in 1946,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.701
just a few months
after the end of the war,

00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:57.156
when scientists wanted to know

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.975
what it was like for a woman
to have a baby at the time.

00:02:00.572 --> 00:02:02.979
They carried out
this huge survey of mothers

00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:05.948
and ended up recording the birth
of nearly every baby

00:02:05.972 --> 00:02:08.535
born in England, Scotland
and Wales in one week.

00:02:08.947 --> 00:02:11.331
That was nearly 14,000 babies.

00:02:12.324 --> 00:02:14.087
The questions they asked these women

00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:16.573
are very different than the ones
we might ask today.

00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:18.323
They sound really old-fashioned now.

00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:19.682
They asked them things like,

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:20.912
"During pregnancy,

00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:24.045
did you get your full extra ration
of a pint of milk a day?"

00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:28.594
"How much did you spend
on smocks, corsets,

00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:31.537
nightdresses, knickers and brassieres?"

00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:34.225
And this is my favorite one:

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.501
"Who looked after your husband
while you were in bed with this baby?"

00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:42.044
(Laughter)

00:02:42.068 --> 00:02:45.463
Now, this wartime study
actually ended up being so successful

00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:47.256
that scientists did it again.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.619
They recorded the births
of thousands of babies born in 1958

00:02:50.643 --> 00:02:52.567
and thousands more in 1970.

00:02:52.916 --> 00:02:54.918
They did it again in the early 1990s,

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.990
and again at the turn of the millennium.

00:02:57.014 --> 00:03:00.680
Altogether, more than 70,000 children
have been involved in these studies

00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:02.717
across those five generations.

00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:04.932
They're called the British birth cohorts,

00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:07.719
and scientists have gone back
and recorded more information

00:03:07.743 --> 00:03:10.092
on all of these people
every few years ever since.

00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:14.087
The amount of information
that's now been collected on these people

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.691
is just completely mind-boggling.

00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:17.905
It includes thousands
of paper questionnaires

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.796
and terabytes' worth of computer data.

00:03:20.293 --> 00:03:23.119
Scientists have also built up
a huge bank of tissue samples,

00:03:23.143 --> 00:03:27.623
which includes locks of hair,
nail clippings, baby teeth and DNA.

00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:32.873
They've even collected 9,000 placentas
from some of the births,

00:03:32.897 --> 00:03:37.211
which are now pickled in plastic buckets
in a secure storage warehouse.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.280
This whole project has become unique --

00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:43.640
so, no other country in the world
is tracking generations of children

00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:45.000
in quite this detail.

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.620
These are some of the best-studied
people on the planet,

00:03:48.644 --> 00:03:51.748
and the data has become
incredibly valuable for scientists,

00:03:51.772 --> 00:03:55.066
generating well over 6,000
academic papers and books.

00:03:56.525 --> 00:03:59.384
But today I want to focus
on just one finding --

00:03:59.408 --> 00:04:03.742
perhaps the most important discovery
to come from this remarkable study.

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:06.104
And it's also the one
that spoke to me personally,

00:04:06.128 --> 00:04:09.442
because it's about how to use science
to do the best for our children.

00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:13.205
So, let's get the bad news
out of the way first.

00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:17.081
Perhaps the biggest message
from this remarkable study is this:

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:21.172
don't be born into poverty
or into disadvantage,

00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:22.410
because if you are,

00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:25.119
you're far more likely
to walk a difficult path in life.

00:04:25.923 --> 00:04:28.805
Many children in this study
were born into poor families

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:33.156
or into working-class families that had
cramped homes or other problems,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.658
and it's clear now
that those disadvantaged children

00:04:35.682 --> 00:04:38.774
have been more likely to struggle
on almost every score.

00:04:38.798 --> 00:04:41.148
They've been more likely
to do worse at school,

00:04:41.172 --> 00:04:43.927
to end up with worse jobs
and to earn less money.

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:45.958
Now, maybe that sounds really obvious,

00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:48.677
but some of the results
have been really surprising,

00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:50.654
so children who had a tough start in life

00:04:50.678 --> 00:04:53.182
are also more likely to end up
unhealthy as adults.

00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:55.312
They're more likely to be overweight,

00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:56.671
to have high blood pressure,

00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:58.788
and then decades down the line,

00:04:58.812 --> 00:05:03.185
more likely to have a failing memory,
poor health and even to die earlier.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:08.510
Now, I talked about what happens later,

00:05:08.534 --> 00:05:11.851
but some of these differences emerge
at a really shockingly early age.

00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:13.509
In one study,

00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:15.428
children who were growing up in poverty

00:05:15.452 --> 00:05:19.313
were almost a year behind
the richer children on educational tests,

00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:21.251
and that was by the age of just three.

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.177
These types of differences have been found
again and again across the generations.

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.471
It means that our early circumstances
have a profound influence

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:32.140
on the way that the rest
of our lives play out.

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:33.594
And working out why that is

00:05:33.618 --> 00:05:36.438
is one of the most difficult questions
that we face today.

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:39.310
So there we have it.

00:05:39.334 --> 00:05:42.010
The first lesson for successful life,
everyone, is this:

00:05:42.034 --> 00:05:43.890
choose your parents very carefully.

00:05:43.914 --> 00:05:44.915
(Laughter)

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.991
Don't be born into a poor family
or into a struggling family.

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:51.926
Now, I'm sure you can see
the small problem here.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.388
We can't choose our parents
or how much they earn,

00:05:55.412 --> 00:05:58.641
but this British study has also struck
a real note of optimism

00:05:58.665 --> 00:06:02.016
by showing that not everyone
who has a disadvantaged start

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.635
ends up in difficult circumstances.

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:07.619
As you know, many people
have a tough start in life,

00:06:07.643 --> 00:06:10.502
but they end up doing very well
on some measure nevertheless,

00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:12.317
and this study starts to explain how.

00:06:13.157 --> 00:06:15.258
So the second lesson is this:

00:06:15.282 --> 00:06:17.107
parents really matter.

00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:18.878
In this study,

00:06:18.902 --> 00:06:21.020
children who had engaged,
interested parents,

00:06:21.044 --> 00:06:23.108
ones who had ambition for their future,

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:25.966
were more likely to escape
from a difficult start.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.015
It seems that parents and what they do
are really, really important,

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.143
especially in the first few years of life.

00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:34.415
Let me give you an example of that.

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:35.633
In one study,

00:06:35.657 --> 00:06:39.713
scientists looked at about 17,000 children
who were born in 1970.

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.546
They sifted all the mountains of data
that they had collected

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.797
to try to work out

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.702
what allowed the children
who'd had a difficult start in life

00:06:47.726 --> 00:06:49.849
to go on and do well
at school nevertheless.

00:06:49.873 --> 00:06:52.226
In other words, which ones beat the odds.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.997
The data showed that what mattered
more than anything else was parents.

00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:59.619
Having engaged, interested parents
in those first few years of life

00:06:59.643 --> 00:07:03.350
was strongly linked to children going on
to do well at school later on.

00:07:04.058 --> 00:07:07.024
In fact, quite small things
that parents do

00:07:07.048 --> 00:07:09.526
are associated with good
outcomes for children.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.095
Talking and listening to a child,

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:14.023
responding to them warmly,

00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:16.015
teaching them their letters and numbers,

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:17.711
taking them on trips and visits.

00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:20.752
Reading to children every day
seems to be really important, too.

00:07:21.324 --> 00:07:22.712
So in one study,

00:07:22.736 --> 00:07:26.023
children whose parents were reading
to them daily when they were five

00:07:26.047 --> 00:07:29.096
and then showing an interest
in their education at the age of 10,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.141
were significantly less likely
to be in poverty at the age of 30

00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:35.757
than those whose parents
weren't doing those things.

00:07:36.931 --> 00:07:40.972
Now, there are huge challenges
with interpreting this type of science.

00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:44.156
These studies show
that certain things that parents do

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.542
are correlated with good
outcomes for children,

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:49.979
but we don't necessarily know
those behaviors caused the good outcomes,

00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:52.385
or whether some other factor
is getting in the way.

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:54.654
For example, we have to take
genes into account,

00:07:54.678 --> 00:07:56.825
and that's a whole other talk in itself.

00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:59.532
But scientists working
with this British study

00:07:59.556 --> 00:08:01.722
are working really hard to get at causes,

00:08:01.746 --> 00:08:03.767
and this is one study I particularly love.

00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:04.973
In this one,

00:08:04.997 --> 00:08:07.864
they looked at the bedtime routines
of about 10,000 children

00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:09.680
born at the turn of the millennium.

00:08:09.704 --> 00:08:12.033
Were the children going to bed
at regular times,

00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:14.955
or did they go to bed
at different times during the week?

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:18.552
The data showed that those children
who were going to bed at different times

00:08:18.576 --> 00:08:20.949
were more likely
to have behavioral problems,

00:08:20.973 --> 00:08:23.682
and then those that switched
to having regular bedtimes

00:08:23.706 --> 00:08:26.092
often showed an improvement in behavior,

00:08:26.116 --> 00:08:27.472
and that was really crucial,

00:08:27.496 --> 00:08:29.768
because it suggested
it was the bedtime routines

00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:32.507
that were really helping things
get better for those kids.

00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:34.702
Here's another one to think about.

00:08:34.726 --> 00:08:35.884
In this one,

00:08:35.908 --> 00:08:38.799
scientists looked at children
who were reading for pleasure.

00:08:38.823 --> 00:08:42.876
That means that they picked up
a magazine, a picture book, a story book.

00:08:43.626 --> 00:08:46.399
The data showed that children
who were reading for pleasure

00:08:46.423 --> 00:08:48.683
at the ages of five and 10

00:08:48.707 --> 00:08:51.603
were more likely to go on in school
better, on average,

00:08:51.627 --> 00:08:53.598
on school tests later in their lives.

00:08:53.622 --> 00:08:55.327
And not just tests of reading,

00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:57.491
but tests of spelling and maths as well.

00:08:58.325 --> 00:09:01.135
This study tried to control
for all the confounding factors,

00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:03.643
so it looked at children
who were equally intelligent

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:05.699
and from the same social-class background,

00:09:05.723 --> 00:09:09.106
so it seemed as if it was the reading
which really helped those children

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.273
go on and score better on those
school tests later in their lives.

00:09:13.597 --> 00:09:14.747
Now at the start,

00:09:14.771 --> 00:09:16.720
I said the first lesson from this study

00:09:16.744 --> 00:09:19.292
was not to be born into poverty
or into disadvantage,

00:09:19.316 --> 00:09:22.868
because those children tend to follow
more difficult paths in their lives.

00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:25.129
But then I said that parenting matters,

00:09:25.153 --> 00:09:27.455
and that good parenting,
if you can call it that,

00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:28.815
helps children beat the odds

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:31.642
and overcome some
of those early disadvantages.

00:09:31.666 --> 00:09:32.991
So wait,

00:09:33.015 --> 00:09:36.359
does that actually mean, then,
that poverty doesn't matter after all?

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:41.048
You could argue it doesn't matter
if a child is born poor --

00:09:41.072 --> 00:09:44.793
as long as their parents are good parents,
they're going to do just fine.

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:46.224
I don't believe that's true.

00:09:46.248 --> 00:09:48.759
This study shows that poverty
and parenting matter.

00:09:49.258 --> 00:09:51.258
And one study actually
put figures on that,

00:09:51.282 --> 00:09:53.981
so it looked at children
growing up in persistent poverty

00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:56.074
and how well they were doing at school.

00:09:56.416 --> 00:09:57.567
The data showed

00:09:57.591 --> 00:10:00.447
that even when their parents
were doing everything right --

00:10:00.471 --> 00:10:01.773
putting them to bed on time

00:10:01.797 --> 00:10:04.234
and reading to them every day
and everything else --

00:10:04.258 --> 00:10:06.091
that only got those children so far.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.399
Good parenting only reduced
the educational gap

00:10:09.423 --> 00:10:12.436
between the rich and poor children
by about 50 percent.

00:10:13.292 --> 00:10:17.443
Now that means that poverty
leaves a really lasting scar,

00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:20.849
and it means that if we really want
to ensure the success and well-being

00:10:20.873 --> 00:10:22.310
of the next generation,

00:10:22.334 --> 00:10:26.222
then tackling child poverty
is an incredibly important thing to do.

00:10:27.702 --> 00:10:30.090
Now, what does all this mean
for you and me?

00:10:30.114 --> 00:10:32.544
Are there lessons here
we can all take home and use?

00:10:32.568 --> 00:10:34.098
As a scientist and a journalist,

00:10:34.122 --> 00:10:36.670
I like to have some science
to inform my parenting ...

00:10:37.732 --> 00:10:40.489
and I can tell you that when
you're shouting at your kids

00:10:40.513 --> 00:10:41.773
to go to bed on time,

00:10:41.797 --> 00:10:44.829
it really helps to have
the scientific literature on your side.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:45.872
(Laughter)

00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:47.499
And wouldn't it be great to think

00:10:47.523 --> 00:10:50.232
that all we had to do to have
happy, successful children

00:10:50.256 --> 00:10:52.955
was to talk to them,
be interested in their future,

00:10:52.979 --> 00:10:55.553
put them to bed on time,
and give them a book to read?

00:10:55.577 --> 00:10:56.727
Our job would be done.

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:58.658
Now, as you can imagine,

00:10:58.682 --> 00:11:01.891
the answers aren't quite
as simple as that.

00:11:01.915 --> 00:11:04.106
For one thing, this study
looks at what happens

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.551
to thousands and thousands
of children on average,

00:11:06.575 --> 00:11:10.173
but that doesn't necessarily say
what will help my child or your child

00:11:10.197 --> 00:11:11.934
or any individual child.

00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.166
In the end, each of our children
is going to walk their own path,

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.769
and that's partly defined
by the genes they inherit

00:11:17.793 --> 00:11:20.794
and of course all the experiences
they have through their lives,

00:11:20.818 --> 00:11:23.270
including their interactions
with us, their parents.

00:11:23.294 --> 00:11:25.749
I will tell you what I did
after I learned all this.

00:11:25.773 --> 00:11:26.923
It's a bit embarrassing.

00:11:27.772 --> 00:11:30.245
I realized I was so busy working,

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:31.428
and ironically,

00:11:31.452 --> 00:11:35.036
learning and writing about this incredible
study of British children,

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.518
that there were days when I hardly
even spoke to my own British children.

00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:41.520
So at home, we introduced talking time,

00:11:41.544 --> 00:11:43.688
which is just 15 minutes
at the end of the day

00:11:43.712 --> 00:11:45.878
when we talk and listen to the boys.

00:11:46.527 --> 00:11:49.838
I try better now to ask them
what they did today,

00:11:49.862 --> 00:11:52.193
and to show that I value
what they do at school.

00:11:52.805 --> 00:11:55.447
Of course, I make sure
they always have a book to read.

00:11:55.471 --> 00:11:57.716
I tell them I'm ambitious
for their future,

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.900
and I think they can be happy
and do great things.

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:04.611
I don't know that any of that
will make a difference,

00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:07.025
but I'm pretty confident
it won't do them any harm,

00:12:07.049 --> 00:12:08.780
and it might even do them some good.

00:12:09.555 --> 00:12:12.399
Ultimately, if we want happy children,

00:12:12.423 --> 00:12:14.463
all we can do is listen to the science,

00:12:14.487 --> 00:12:15.653
and of course,

00:12:15.677 --> 00:12:17.503
listen to our children themselves.

00:12:17.527 --> 00:12:18.681
Thank you.
