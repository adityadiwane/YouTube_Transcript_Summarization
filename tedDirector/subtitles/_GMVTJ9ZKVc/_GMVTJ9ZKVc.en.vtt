00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.739
As a kid I always loved information

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:17.587
that I could get from data

00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:20.629
and the stories that could be told with numbers.

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:22.913
I remember, growing up, I'd be frustrated at

00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:28.459
how my own parents would lie to me using numbers.

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:33.443
"Talithia, if I've told you once 
I've told you a thousand times."

00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:37.335
No dad, you've only told me 17 times

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:40.497
and twice it wasn't my fault. (Laughter)

00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:43.661
I think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics.

00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:44.569
I always wanted to know,

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:47.755
what are people trying to hide with numbers?

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:48.938
As a statistician,

00:00:48.938 --> 00:00:52.791
I want people to show me the data

00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:55.126
so I can decide for myself.

00:00:55.126 --> 00:00:58.175
Donald and I were pregnant with our third child

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:00.909
and we were at about 41 and a half weeks,

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.286
what some of you may refer to as being overdue.

00:01:04.286 --> 00:01:06.121
Statisticians, we call that

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:08.807
being within the 95 percent confidence interval.

00:01:08.807 --> 00:01:10.673
(Laughter)

00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:12.951
And at this point in the process

00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:15.144
we had to come in every couple of days

00:01:15.144 --> 00:01:16.952
to do a stress test on the baby,

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:18.134
and this is just routine,

00:01:18.134 --> 00:01:22.720
it tests whether or not the baby 
is feeling any type of undue stress.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.113
And you are rarely, if ever, seen by your actual doctor,

00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:29.280
just whoever happens to be 
working at the hospital that day.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.026
So we go in for a stress test and after 20 minutes

00:01:32.026 --> 00:01:35.524
the doctor comes out and he says,

00:01:35.524 --> 00:01:41.079
"Your baby is under stress, we need to induce you."

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.698
Now, as a statistician, what's my response?

00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:49.370
Show me the data!

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.072
So then he proceeds to tell us

00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:54.497
the baby's heart rate trace went from 18 minutes,

00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:56.468
the baby's heart rate was in the normal zone

00:01:56.468 --> 00:01:59.421
and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be

00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:03.131
my heart rate zone and I said,

00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:05.497
"Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate?

00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:07.492
I was moving around a little bit,

00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:09.790
it's hard to lay still on your back,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.308
41 weeks pregnant for 20 minutes.

00:02:12.308 --> 00:02:14.481
Maybe it was shifting around."

00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:19.457
He said, "Well, we don't want to take any chances."

00:02:19.457 --> 00:02:20.717
I said okay.

00:02:20.717 --> 00:02:22.436
I said, "What if I was at 36 weeks

00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:24.245
with this same data?

00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:28.124
Would your decision be to induce?"

00:02:28.124 --> 00:02:31.692
"Well, no, I would wait until you were at least

00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:33.702
38 weeks, but you are almost 42,

00:02:33.702 --> 00:02:35.709
there is no reason to leave that baby inside,

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.660
let's get you a room."

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.241
I said, "Well, why don't we just do it again?

00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:45.962
We can collect more data.

00:02:45.962 --> 00:02:48.373
I can try to be really still for 20 minutes.

00:02:48.373 --> 00:02:51.056
We can average the two and see

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:53.738
what that means. (Laughter)

00:02:53.738 --> 00:02:57.385
And he goes,

00:02:57.385 --> 00:03:04.434
"Ma'am, I just don't want you to have a miscarriage."

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:07.566
That makes three of us.

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:08.720
And then he says,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.838
"Your chances of having a miscarriage double

00:03:12.838 --> 00:03:16.605
when you go past your due date. Let's get you a room."

00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:22.892
Wow. So now as a statistician, what's my response?

00:03:22.892 --> 00:03:24.240
Show me the data!

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.445
Dude, you're talking chances,

00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:27.701
I do chances all day long, tell me all about chances.

00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:29.523
Let's talk chances. (Laughter)

00:03:29.523 --> 00:03:31.488
Let's talk chances.

00:03:31.488 --> 00:03:32.689
So I say, "Okay, great.

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.590
Do I go from a 30-percent 
chance to a 60-percent chance?

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.141
Where are we here with this miscarriage thing?

00:03:39.141 --> 00:03:42.437
And he goes, "Not quite, but it doubles,

00:03:42.437 --> 00:03:47.419
and we really just want what's best for the baby."

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.582
Undaunted, I try a different angle.

00:03:49.582 --> 00:03:55.089
I said, "Okay, out of 1,000 full-term pregnant women,

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.616
how many of them are going to miscarry

00:03:57.616 --> 00:03:59.411
just before their due date?

00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:02.259
And then he looks at me and looks at Donald,

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:06.962
and he goes, about one in 1,000.

00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:09.792
I said, "Okay, so of those 1,000 women, how many

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:14.650
are going to miscarry just after their due date?"

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.222
"About two." (Laughter)

00:04:18.222 --> 00:04:20.266
I said, "Okay, so you are telling me that my chances

00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:24.213
go from a 0.1-percent chance

00:04:24.213 --> 00:04:28.459
to a 0.2-percent chance."

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:30.757
Okay, so at this point the data is not convincing us

00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:32.385
that we need to be induced,

00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:34.334
and so then we proceed to have a conversation

00:04:34.334 --> 00:04:36.982
about how inductions lead to a higher rate

00:04:36.982 --> 00:04:40.973
of Cesarean sections, and if at all 
possible we'd like to avoid that.

00:04:40.973 --> 00:04:42.225
And then I said,

00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:45.105
"And I really don't think my due date is accurate."

00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:47.705
(Laughter)

00:04:47.705 --> 00:04:50.445
And so this really stunned him

00:04:50.445 --> 00:04:52.095
and he looked sort of puzzled

00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:54.227
and I said, "You may not know this,

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:55.808
but pregnancy due dates are calculated

00:04:55.808 --> 00:04:58.346
assuming that you have a standard 28-day cycle,

00:04:58.346 --> 00:04:59.748
and my cycle ranges —

00:04:59.748 --> 00:05:03.295
sometimes it's 27, sometimes it's up to 38 —

00:05:03.295 --> 00:05:06.449
and I have been collecting the data to prove it.

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.233
(Laughter)

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:16.070
And so we ended up leaving the hospital 
that day without being induced.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.263
We actually had to sign a waiver 
to walk out of the hospital.

00:05:22.263 --> 00:05:25.951
And I'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors,

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:27.869
because even with our first child,

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:31.511
we were induced at 38 weeks; cervical fluid was low.

00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:33.969
I'm not anti-medical intervention.

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.833
But why were confident to leave that day?

00:05:36.833 --> 00:05:40.483
Well, we had data that told a different story.

00:05:40.483 --> 00:05:45.491
We had been collecting data for six years.

00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:47.789
I had this temperature data,

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.064
and it told a different story.

00:05:49.064 --> 00:05:56.477
In fact, we could probably pretty 
accurately estimate conception.

00:05:56.477 --> 00:05:58.379
Yeah, that's a story you want to tell

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.631
at your kid's wedding reception. (Laughter)

00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:05.324
I remember like it was yesterday.

00:06:05.324 --> 00:06:07.965
My temperature was a sizzling 97.8 degrees

00:06:07.965 --> 00:06:12.119
as I stared into your father's eyes. (Laughter)

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:18.931
Oh, yeah. Twenty-two more years, we're telling that story.

00:06:18.931 --> 00:06:21.982
But we were confident to leave 
because we had been collecting data.

00:06:21.984 --> 00:06:23.590
Now, what does that data look like?

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.427
Here's a standard chart

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:29.729
of a woman's waking body temperature

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.246
during the course of a cycle.

00:06:31.246 --> 00:06:32.699
So from the beginning of the menstrual cycle

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.051
till the beginning of the next.

00:06:34.051 --> 00:06:36.872
You'll see that the temperature is not random.

00:06:36.872 --> 00:06:38.936
Clearly there is a low pattern

00:06:38.936 --> 00:06:40.935
at the beginning of her cycle

00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:43.434
and then you see this jump and then a higher

00:06:43.434 --> 00:06:45.712
set of temperatures at the end of her cycle.

00:06:45.712 --> 00:06:47.133
So what's happening here?

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:49.739
What is that data telling you?

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:52.438
Well, ladies, at the beginning of our cycle,

00:06:52.438 --> 00:06:55.780
the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.589
causes a suppression of your body temperature.

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:03.126
And at ovulation, your body releases an egg

00:07:03.126 --> 00:07:08.141
and progesterone takes over, pro-gestation.

00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:10.493
And so your body heats up in anticipation

00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:14.279
of housing this new little fertilized egg.

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:17.011
So why this temperature jump?

00:07:17.011 --> 00:07:20.687
Well, think about when a bird sits on her eggs.

00:07:20.687 --> 00:07:22.153
Why is she sitting on them?

00:07:22.153 --> 00:07:24.090
She wants to keep them warm,

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.594
protect them and keep them warm.

00:07:25.594 --> 00:07:27.865
Ladies, this is exactly what our bodies do every month,

00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:29.956
they heat up in anticipation

00:07:29.956 --> 00:07:33.092
of keeping a new little life warm.

00:07:33.092 --> 00:07:36.022
And if nothing happens, if you are not pregnant,

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:40.564
then estrogen takes back over and 
that cycle starts all over again.

00:07:40.564 --> 00:07:42.511
But if you do get pregnant, sometimes you

00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:45.055
actually see another shift in your temperatures

00:07:45.055 --> 00:07:48.342
and it stays elevated for those whole nine months.

00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:51.667
That's why you see those pregnant 
women just sweating and hot,

00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:55.045
because their temperatures are high.

00:07:55.045 --> 00:07:59.414
Here's a chart that we had about three or four years ago.

00:07:59.414 --> 00:08:01.434
We were really very excited about this chart.

00:08:01.434 --> 00:08:03.970
You'll see the low temperature level

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.012
and then a shift and for about five days,

00:08:07.012 --> 00:08:09.471
that's about the time it takes for the egg to travel

00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:11.918
down the fallopian tube and implant,

00:08:11.918 --> 00:08:15.559
and then you see those temperatures 
start to go up a little bit.

00:08:15.559 --> 00:08:18.772
And in fact, we had a second temperature shift,

00:08:18.772 --> 00:08:22.832
confirmed with a pregnancy test 
that were indeed pregnant

00:08:22.832 --> 00:08:25.913
with our first child, very exciting.

00:08:25.913 --> 00:08:27.944
Until a couple of days later

00:08:27.944 --> 00:08:32.885
I saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow,

00:08:32.885 --> 00:08:37.244
and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage.

00:08:37.244 --> 00:08:41.114
Had I not been taking my temperature

00:08:41.114 --> 00:08:45.012
I really would have just thought 
my period was late that month,

00:08:45.012 --> 00:08:46.820
but we actually had data to show

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.447
that we had miscarried this baby,

00:08:49.447 --> 00:08:51.280
and even though this data revealed a really

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.064
unfortunate event in our lives,

00:08:53.064 --> 00:08:55.531
it was information that we could then take to our doctor.

00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:58.159
So if there was a fertility issue or some problem,

00:08:58.159 --> 00:08:59.414
I had data to show:

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:01.761
Look, we got pregnant, our temperature shifted,

00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:03.445
we somehow lost this baby.

00:09:03.445 --> 00:09:06.805
What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem?

00:09:06.805 --> 00:09:10.326
And it's not just about temperatures

00:09:10.326 --> 00:09:13.067
and it's not just about fertility;

00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:16.955
we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things.

00:09:16.955 --> 00:09:20.785
For instance, did you know that taking 
your temperature can tell you a lot

00:09:20.785 --> 00:09:22.924
about the condition of your thyroid?

00:09:22.924 --> 00:09:26.939
So, your thyroid works a lot like 
the thermostat in your house.

00:09:26.939 --> 00:09:29.157
There is an optimal temperature 
that you want in your house;

00:09:29.157 --> 00:09:30.681
you set your thermostat.

00:09:30.681 --> 00:09:33.175
When it gets too cold in the house,
your thermostat kicks in

00:09:33.175 --> 00:09:36.393
and says, "Hey, we need to blow some heat around."

00:09:36.393 --> 00:09:38.062
Or if it gets too hot, your thermostat

00:09:38.062 --> 00:09:41.619
registers, "Turn the A.C. on. Cool us off."

00:09:41.619 --> 00:09:45.416
That's exactly how your thyroid works in your body.

00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:48.116
Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature

00:09:48.116 --> 00:09:49.144
for your body.

00:09:49.144 --> 00:09:51.626
If it gets too cold, your thyroid 
says, "Hey, we need to heat up."

00:09:51.626 --> 00:09:54.814
If it gets too hot, your thyroid cools you down.

00:09:54.814 --> 00:09:59.220
But what happens when your 
thyroid is not functioning well?

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.587
When it doesn't function, then it shows up

00:10:01.587 --> 00:10:02.773
in your body temperatures,

00:10:02.773 --> 00:10:05.428
they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic.

00:10:05.428 --> 00:10:06.698
And so by collecting this data

00:10:06.698 --> 00:10:09.685
you can find out information about your thyroid.

00:10:09.685 --> 00:10:13.249
Now, what is it, if you had a thyroid 
problem and you went to the doctor,

00:10:13.249 --> 00:10:15.682
your doctor would actually test the amount of

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:18.620
thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.803
Fine. But the problem with that test is

00:10:22.803 --> 00:10:25.568
it doesn't tell you how active the hormone is in your body.

00:10:25.568 --> 00:10:27.617
So you might have a lot of hormone present,

00:10:27.617 --> 00:10:29.365
but it might not be actively working to regulate

00:10:29.365 --> 00:10:30.613
your body temperature.

00:10:30.613 --> 00:10:32.362
So just by collecting your temperature every day,

00:10:32.362 --> 00:10:35.982
you get information about the condition of your thyroid.

00:10:35.982 --> 00:10:38.463
So, what if you don't want to take 
your temperature every day?

00:10:38.463 --> 00:10:40.021
I advocate that you do,

00:10:40.021 --> 00:10:41.876
but there are tons of other things you could take.

00:10:41.876 --> 00:10:44.681
You could take your blood pressure, 
you could take your weight —

00:10:44.681 --> 00:10:46.271
yeah, who's excited about

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:49.808
taking their weight every day? (Laughter)

00:10:49.808 --> 00:10:54.599
Early on in our marriage, Donald had a stuffy nose

00:10:54.599 --> 00:10:57.719
and he had been taking a slew of medications

00:10:57.719 --> 00:11:01.718
to try to relieve his stuffy nose, to no avail.

00:11:01.718 --> 00:11:05.957
And so, that night he comes and 
he wakes me up and he says,

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:09.764
"Honey, I can't breath out of my nose."

00:11:09.764 --> 00:11:14.582
And I roll over and I look, and I said, 
"Well, can you breath out of your mouth?"

00:11:14.582 --> 00:11:16.060
(Laughter)

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:23.140
And he goes, "Yes, but I can't breath out of my nose!"

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.160
And so like any good wife, I rush him

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.995
to the emergency room

00:11:27.995 --> 00:11:30.427
at 2 o'clock in the morning.

00:11:30.427 --> 00:11:33.897
And the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking,

00:11:33.897 --> 00:11:36.746
you can't die on me now.

00:11:36.746 --> 00:11:38.916
We just got married,

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:43.374
people will think I killed you! (Laughter)

00:11:43.374 --> 00:11:47.047
And so, we get to the emergency 
room, and the nurse sees us,

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:49.668
and he can't breath out of his nose, and so

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:51.751
she brings us to the back and the doctor says,

00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:54.940
"What seems to be the problem?" and 
he goes, "I can't breath out of my nose."

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.989
And he said, "You can't breath out of your nose?

00:11:56.989 --> 00:12:02.866
No, but he can breath out of his mouth. (Laughter)

00:12:02.866 --> 00:12:05.508
He takes a step back and he looks at both of us

00:12:05.508 --> 00:12:09.374
and he says "Sir, I think I know the problem.

00:12:09.374 --> 00:12:10.810
You're having a heart attack.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.861
I'm going to order an EKG and a CAT scan

00:12:12.861 --> 00:12:16.203
for you immediately."

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:17.831
And we are thinking,

00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:20.771
no, no, no. It's not a heart attack. He can breathe,

00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:25.768
just out of his mouth. No, no, no, no, no.

00:12:25.768 --> 00:12:28.031
And so we go back and forth with this doctor

00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:30.509
because we think this is the incorrect diagnosis,

00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:34.461
and he's like, "No really, it'll be fine, just calm down."

00:12:34.461 --> 00:12:38.380
And I'm thinking, how do you calm down? 
But I don't think he's having a heart attack.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.621
And so fortunately for us, this 
doctor was at the end of the shift.

00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:44.536
So this new doctor comes in, he sees us clearly

00:12:44.536 --> 00:12:47.537
distraught, with a husband who can't breath

00:12:47.537 --> 00:12:50.639
out of his nose. (Laughter)

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:53.425
And he starts asking us questions.

00:12:53.425 --> 00:12:58.305
He says, "Well, do you two exercise?"

00:12:58.305 --> 00:13:05.378
We ride our bikes, we go to the gym occasionally.

00:13:05.378 --> 00:13:07.031
(Laughter)

00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:09.896
We move around.

00:13:09.896 --> 00:13:12.559
And he says, "What were you doing 
just before you came here?"

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:15.271
I'm thinking, I was sleeping, honestly.

00:13:15.271 --> 00:13:18.102
But okay, what was Donald doing just before?

00:13:18.102 --> 00:13:21.650
So Donald goes into this slew 
of medications he was taking.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.612
He lists, "I took this decongestant 
and then I took this nasal spray,"

00:13:24.612 --> 00:13:26.607
and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says,

00:13:26.615 --> 00:13:30.242
"Oh! You should never mix this 
decongestant with this nasal spray.

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:33.059
Clogs you up every time. Here, take this one instead."

00:13:33.059 --> 00:13:35.325
He gives us a prescription.

00:13:35.325 --> 00:13:37.315
We're looking at each other, and I looked at the doctor,

00:13:37.315 --> 00:13:39.541
and I said, "Why is it that it seems like you

00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:41.952
were able to accurately diagnose his condition,

00:13:41.952 --> 00:13:44.168
but this previous doctor wanted to order

00:13:44.168 --> 00:13:46.674
an EKG and a CAT scan?"

00:13:46.674 --> 00:13:49.281
And he looks at us and says,

00:13:49.281 --> 00:13:53.499
"Well, when a 350-pound man walks in the 
emergency room and says he can't breath,

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.263
you assume he's having a heart attack

00:13:55.263 --> 00:13:59.212
and you ask questions later."

00:13:59.212 --> 00:14:04.932
Now, emergency room doctors are 
trained to make decisions quickly,

00:14:04.932 --> 00:14:07.023
but not always accurately.

00:14:07.023 --> 00:14:08.572
And so had we had some information

00:14:08.572 --> 00:14:10.966
about our heart health to share with him,

00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:14.741
maybe we would have gotten a 
better diagnosis the first time.

00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:16.973
I want you to consider the following chart,

00:14:16.973 --> 00:14:18.927
of systolic blood pressure measurements

00:14:18.927 --> 00:14:22.999
from October 2010 to July 2012.

00:14:22.999 --> 00:14:24.692
You'll see that these measurements start

00:14:24.692 --> 00:14:28.360
in the prehypertension/hypertension zone,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.946
but over about the course of a year and a half

00:14:30.946 --> 00:14:33.591
they move into the normal zone.

00:14:33.591 --> 00:14:37.700
This is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.731
What story is this data telling you?

00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:44.612
Obviously it's the data from someone

00:14:44.612 --> 00:14:47.285
who's made a drastic transformation,

00:14:47.285 --> 00:14:52.443
and fortunately for us, that person 
happens to be here today.

00:14:52.443 --> 00:14:56.697
So that 350-pound guy that walked 
into the emergency room with me

00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:59.669
is now an even sexier and healthier

00:14:59.669 --> 00:15:06.357
225-pound guy, and that's his blood pressure trace.

00:15:06.357 --> 00:15:09.818
So over the course of that year and a half

00:15:09.818 --> 00:15:11.387
Donald's eating changed

00:15:11.387 --> 00:15:13.378
and our exercise regimen changed,

00:15:13.378 --> 00:15:16.168
and his heart rate responded,

00:15:16.168 --> 00:15:17.670
his blood pressure responded to that change

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.969
that he made in his body.

00:15:19.969 --> 00:15:21.947
So what's the take-home message

00:15:21.947 --> 00:15:25.661
that I want you to leave with today?

00:15:25.661 --> 00:15:30.035
By taking ownership of your data just like we've done,

00:15:30.035 --> 00:15:33.982
just by taking this daily measurements about yourself,

00:15:33.982 --> 00:15:36.491
you become the expert on your body.

00:15:36.491 --> 00:15:38.493
You become the authority.

00:15:38.493 --> 00:15:40.916
It's not hard to do.

00:15:40.916 --> 00:15:42.836
You don't have to have a Ph.D. in statistics

00:15:42.836 --> 00:15:44.168
to be an expert in yourself.

00:15:44.168 --> 00:15:45.609
You don't have to have a medical degree

00:15:45.609 --> 00:15:47.735
to be your body's expert.

00:15:47.735 --> 00:15:51.154
Medical doctors, they're experts on the population,

00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:53.432
but you are the expert on yourself.

00:15:53.432 --> 00:15:55.342
And so when two of you come together,

00:15:55.342 --> 00:15:57.312
when two experts come together,

00:15:57.312 --> 00:16:00.107
the two of you are able to make a better decision

00:16:00.107 --> 00:16:02.107
than just your doctor alone.

00:16:02.107 --> 00:16:05.874
Now that you understand the power of information

00:16:05.874 --> 00:16:07.745
that you can get through personal data collection,

00:16:07.745 --> 00:16:11.414
I'd like you all to stand and raise your right hand.

00:16:11.414 --> 00:16:13.973
(Laughter)

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.093
Yes, get it up.

00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:25.679
I challenge you to take ownership of your data.

00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:29.241
And today, I hereby confer upon you

00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:33.586
a TEDx associate's degree in elementary statistics

00:16:33.586 --> 00:16:38.030
with a concentration in time-dependent data analysis

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.743
with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto.

00:16:41.743 --> 00:16:45.219
And so the next time you are in your doctor's office,

00:16:45.219 --> 00:16:48.410
as newly inducted statisticians,

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.920
what should always be your response?

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.752
Audience: Show me the data! 
Talithia Williams: I can't hear you!

00:16:52.752 --> 00:16:54.520
Audience: Show me the data!

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.828
TW: One more time!

00:16:55.828 --> 00:16:57.367
Audience: Show me the data!

00:16:57.367 --> 00:16:58.549
TW: Show me the data.

00:16:58.549 --> 00:17:01.570
Thank you.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:06.370
(Applause)
