00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
what it could be,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
and what your relationship to it is.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
And in doing that, I want to offer you a vision,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
an imagined future, if you will,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.330
of how, as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
"Once in a lifetime

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.330
the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.330
and hope and history rhyme."

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
I want to start with these word pairs here.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.330
We all know which side of these we'd like to be on.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
when the foundation form was actually invented,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.330
they didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
In fact they would never have thought of themselves

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
as closed and set in their ways,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
as slow to respond to new challenges,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
as small and risk-averse.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
And in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
what Rockefeller called "the business of benevolence."

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
But by the end of the 20th century,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
a new generation of critics and reformers

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.330
had come to see philanthropy just this way.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
The thing to watch for

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
as a global philanthropy industry comes about --

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
and that's exactly what is happening --

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
is how the aspiration is to flip

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
these old assumptions,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
for philanthropy to become open and big

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
and fast and connected, in service of the long term.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
This entrepreneurial energy

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
is emerging from many quarters.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
by new tools, like the ones we've seen here,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
and by new pressures.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
I've been following this change for quite a while now, and participating in it.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
This report is our main public report.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
What it tells is the story of how today

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
actually could be as historic

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
as 100 years ago.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
What I want to do is share some of the coolest things

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
that are going on with you.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
And as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.330
on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about --

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
the Gates or the Soros or the Google.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
Instead, what I want to do

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.330
is talk about the philanthropy of all of us:

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
the democratization of philanthropy.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
This is a moment in history when the average person

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
has more power than at any time.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.330
each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.330
The first is mass collaboration, represented here by Wikipedia.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
Now, this may surprise you.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.330
But remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.330
Clay Shirky, that great chronicler of everything networked,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
has captured the assumption that this challenges

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
in such a beautiful way.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
He said, "We have lived in this world

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
where little things are done for love

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
and big things for money.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
Now we have Wikipedia.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.330
Suddenly big things can be done for love."

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
Watch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book --

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
The book is called "Blessed Unrest."

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
And when it comes out, a series of wiki sites

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
under the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
WISER stands for World Index

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
for Social and Environmental Responsibility.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
WISER sets out to document, link and empower

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
what Paul calls the largest movement,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
and fastest-growing movement in human history:

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
humanity's collective immune response

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
to today's threats.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.330
Now, all of these big things for love -- experiments --

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
aren't going to take off.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
But the ones that do

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
are going to be the biggest, the most open,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.330
the fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.330
Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
This is, of course, to philanthropy

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.330
what eBay and Amazon are to commerce.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
And this challenges yet another assumption,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.330
which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
It's one of the best known of these new marketplaces

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
where a donor can go straight into a classroom

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
and connect with what a teacher says they need.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
Take a look at Changing the Present,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
started by a TEDster, next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
GiveIndia is for a whole country.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
And it goes on and on.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
which I call aggregated giving.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
in that historic act last summer.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
It's that he challenged another assumption,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
that every giver should have his or her own

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
fund or foundation.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.330
There are now, today, so many new funds

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
that are aggregating giving and investing,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
bringing together people

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
around a common goal, to think bigger.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.330
One of the best known is Acumen Fund, led by Jacqueline Novogratz,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
But there are many others: New Profit in Cambridge,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
New School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
Global Fund for Women in San Francisco.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
Take a look at these.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
These funds are to philanthropy

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.330
what venture capital, private equity, and eventually mutual funds

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
are to investing,

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
but with a twist --

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.330
because often a community forms around these funds,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.330
as it has at Acumen and other places.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
Now, imagine for a second

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
these first three types of experiments:

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
mass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
And understand how they help us re-perceive

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
what organized philanthropy is.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
It's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.330
And imagine the mash-up, if you will, of these things, in the future,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
when these things come together in the experiments of the future --

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
imagine that somebody puts up, say,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
100 million dollars

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
for an inspiring goal --

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the US last year,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
not out of the question --

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
but only puts it up if it's matched

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
by millions of small gifts from around the globe,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
thereby engaging lots of people,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
and building visibility and engaging people

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
in the goal that's stated.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
I'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.330
which are innovation, competitions and social investing.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.330
They're betting a visible competition, a prize,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.330
and thereby speed the solution.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
This tackles yet another assumption,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
that the giver and the organization is at the center,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
as opposed to putting the problem at the center.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
You can look to these innovators

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
to help us especially with things that require

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.330
technological or scientific solution.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.330
That leaves the final category, social investing,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
which is really, anyway, the biggest of them all,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
represented here by Xigi.net.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.330
And this, of course, tackles the biggest assumption of all,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
that business is business,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.330
and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
Xigi is a new community site

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
that's built by the community,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.330
linking and mapping this new social capital market.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
It lists already 1,000 entities

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.330
that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
So we can look to these innovators

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.330
to help us remember

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
that seeks a return,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.330
the good that can be driven could be astonishing.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
Now, what's really interesting here

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.330
is that we're not thinking our way

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
into a new way of acting;

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
we're acting our way into a new way of thinking.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.330
Philanthropy is reorganizing itself

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
before our very eyes.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.330
And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
don't yet fulfill this aspiration,

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
I think this is the new zeitgeist:

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
open, big, fast, connected,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
and, let us also hope, long.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.330
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
If we don't develop the stamina to stick with things --

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
whatever it is you pick, stick with it --

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.330
all of this stuff is just going to be, you know, a fad.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
But I'm really hopeful.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
And I'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
that's reorganizing itself,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
it's also whole other portions of the social sector,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
and of business,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.330
that are busy challenging "business as usual."

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
And everywhere I go, including here at TED,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.330
I feel that there is a new moral hunger

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
that is growing.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
What we're seeing is people really wrestling

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
to describe what is this new thing that's happening.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
Words like "philanthrocapitalism,"

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
and "natural capitalism," and "philanthroentrepreneur,"

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
and "venture philanthropy."

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
We don't have a language for it yet.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
Whatever we call it,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
it's new, it's beginning,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.330
and I think it's gong to quite significant.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
And that's where my imagined future comes in,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.330
which I am going to call the social singularity.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
Many of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
Vernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
where a number of trends accelerate and converge

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.330
and come together to create, really, a shockingly new reality.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
It may be that the social singularity

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.330
ahead is the one that we fear the most:

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
a convergence of catastrophes,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
of environmental degradation,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
of weapons of mass destruction, of pandemics,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
of poverty.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
That's because

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.330
our ability to confront the problems that we face

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.330
has not kept pace with our ability to create them.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
And as we've heard here,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
it is no exaggeration to say

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.330
that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
as never before.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.330
The question is, is there a positive social singularity?

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
Is there a frontier for us

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
of how we live together?

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
Our future doesn't have to be imagined.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:34.330
We can create a future where hope and history rhyme.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
But we have a problem.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.330
Our experience to date, both individually and collectively,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.330
hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.330
or who we're going to need to be.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.330
We are going to need

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:53.330
a new generation of citizen leaders

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.330
as rapidly as possible.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.330
That's why I have one last thing I want to show you.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.330
This is a photograph taken about 100 years ago

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.330
of my grandfather and great-grandfather.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.330
This is a newspaper publisher and a banker.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
And they were great community leaders.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
And, yes, they were great philanthropists.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
I keep this photograph close by to me --

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
it's in my office --

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.330
because I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
both of whom I never knew.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.330
And so, in their honor,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.330
I want to offer you this blank slide.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
And I want you to imagine

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
that this a photograph of you.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
And I want you to think about the community

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
that you want to be part of creating.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
Whatever that means to you.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.330
And I want you to imagine

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.330
that it's 100 years from now,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.330
and your grandchild, or great-grandchild,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.330
or niece or nephew or god-child,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.330
is looking at this photograph of you.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:19.330
What is the story you most want for them to tell?

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
Thank you very much.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:27.330
(Applause)
