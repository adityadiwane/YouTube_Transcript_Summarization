00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:17.886
So I'm going to talk about work;

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.696
specifically, why people can't
seem to get work done at work,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.149
which is a problem we all kind of have.

00:00:24.173 --> 00:00:26.336
But let's sort of start at the beginning.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.966
So, we have companies
and non-profits and charities

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.934
and all these groups that have
employees or volunteers of some sort.

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:39.164
And they expect these people
who work for them

00:00:39.188 --> 00:00:40.870
to do great work --

00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:42.236
I would hope, at least.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.975
At least good work, hopefully,
at least it's good work --

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:46.236
hopefully great work.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.308
And so what they typically
do is they decide

00:00:48.332 --> 00:00:52.236
that all these people need to come
together in one place to do that work.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.235
So a company, or a charity,
or an organization of any kind,

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:59.423
unless you're working in Africa,
if you're really lucky to do that --

00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:01.680
most people have to go
to an office every day.

00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:03.640
And so these companies,

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:05.389
they build offices.

00:01:05.413 --> 00:01:08.309
They go out and they buy a building,
or they rent a building,

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.236
or they lease some space,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.236
and they fill this space with stuff.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.236
They fill it with tables, or desks,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.135
chairs, computer equipment,

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.236
software, Internet access,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.505
maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:28.110
and they expect their employees,
or their volunteers,

00:01:28.134 --> 00:01:30.783
to come to that location
every day to do great work.

00:01:30.807 --> 00:01:33.728
It seems like it's perfectly
reasonable to ask that.

00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:36.085
However, if you actually talk to people

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.753
and even question yourself,
and you ask yourself,

00:01:38.777 --> 00:01:42.291
where do you really want to go when you
really need to get something done?

00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:46.041
You'll find out that people don't say
what businesses think they would say.

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:47.562
If you ask people the question:

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:50.402
Where do you need to go
when you need to get something done?

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:52.900
Typically, you get three different
kinds of answers.

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:55.787
One is kind of a place
or a location or a room.

00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:57.755
Another one is a moving object,

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:59.446
and a third is a time.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.482
So here are some examples.

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:04.737
I've been asking people this question
for about 10 years:

00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:07.917
"Where do you go when you
really need to get something done?"

00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:11.489
I'll hear things like, the porch,
the deck, the kitchen.

00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:14.561
I'll hear things like
an extra room in the house,

00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:15.862
the basement,

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:17.787
the coffee shop, the library.

00:02:18.807 --> 00:02:21.362
And then you'll hear
things like the train,

00:02:21.386 --> 00:02:24.486
a plane, a car -- so, the commute.

00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:26.638
And then you'll hear people say,

00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:28.664
"Well, it doesn't really
matter where I am,

00:02:28.688 --> 00:02:32.200
as long as it's early in the morning
or late at night or on the weekends."

00:02:32.224 --> 00:02:35.049
You almost never hear
someone say, "The office."

00:02:35.073 --> 00:02:38.645
But businesses are spending all this money
on this place called the office,

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:40.923
and they're making people
go to it all the time,

00:02:40.947 --> 00:02:42.982
yet people don't do work in the office.

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:44.169
What is that about?

00:02:44.193 --> 00:02:45.653
(Laughter)

00:02:45.677 --> 00:02:48.930
Why is that? Why is that happening?

00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:50.623
And what you find out is,

00:02:50.647 --> 00:02:54.035
if you dig a little bit deeper,
you find out that people --

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:55.709
this is what happens:

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:57.462
People go to work,

00:02:57.486 --> 00:02:59.796
and they're basically
trading in their work day

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.312
for a series of "work moments" --
that's what happens at the office.

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:06.019
You don't have a work day anymore.
You have work moments.

00:03:06.043 --> 00:03:08.821
It's like the front door
of the office is like a Cuisinart,

00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:11.147
and you walk in and your day
is shredded to bits,

00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:13.719
because you have 15 minutes here,
30 minutes there,

00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:16.466
and something else happens,
you're pulled off your work,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.379
then you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch,
then you have something else to do ...

00:03:20.403 --> 00:03:24.213
Then you've got 15 minutes, and someone
pulls you aside and asks you a question,

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:26.433
and before you know it, it's 5 p.m.,

00:03:26.457 --> 00:03:28.029
and you look back on the day,

00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:31.084
and you realize that you
didn't get anything done.

00:03:31.108 --> 00:03:32.465
We've all been through this.

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.292
We probably went through it yesterday
or the day before, or the day before that.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:37.730
You look back on your day,

00:03:37.754 --> 00:03:39.770
and you're like,
"I got nothing done today.

00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:44.384
I was at work. I sat at my desk.
I used my expensive computer.

00:03:44.408 --> 00:03:46.645
I used the software they told me to use.

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.122
I went to these meetings
I was asked to go to.

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:51.843
I did these conference calls.
I did all this stuff.

00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:54.236
But I didn't actually do anything.

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:55.844
I just did tasks.

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:58.308
I didn't actually get
meaningful work done."

00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:01.643
And what you find is that,
especially with creative people --

00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:07.236
designers, programmers,
writers, engineers, thinkers --

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.148
that people really need long stretches
of uninterrupted time

00:04:11.172 --> 00:04:12.494
to get something done.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:15.946
You cannot ask somebody
to be creative in 15 minutes

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.589
and really think about a problem.

00:04:17.613 --> 00:04:18.979
You might have a quick idea,

00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:22.962
but to be in deep thought about a problem
and really consider a problem carefully,

00:04:22.986 --> 00:04:25.374
you need long stretches
of uninterrupted time.

00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:28.573
And even though the work day
is typically eight hours,

00:04:28.597 --> 00:04:32.152
how many people here have ever had
eight hours to themselves at the office?

00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:33.343
How about seven hours?

00:04:33.367 --> 00:04:36.575
Six? Five? Four?

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.751
When's the last time you had
three hours to yourself at the office?

00:04:39.775 --> 00:04:41.797
Two hours? One, maybe?

00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:43.536
Very, very few people actually have

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.234
long stretches of uninterrupted
time at an office.

00:04:46.258 --> 00:04:49.788
And this is why people
choose to do work at home,

00:04:49.812 --> 00:04:51.391
or they might go to the office,

00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:54.050
but they might go to the office
really early in the day,

00:04:54.074 --> 00:04:55.900
or late at night when no one's around,

00:04:55.924 --> 00:04:57.992
or they stick around
after everyone's left,

00:04:58.016 --> 00:04:59.430
or go in on the weekends,

00:04:59.454 --> 00:05:02.545
or they get work done on the plane,
in the car or in the train,

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.474
because there are no distractions.

00:05:04.498 --> 00:05:06.693
Now there are different
kinds of distractions,

00:05:06.717 --> 00:05:10.106
but not the really bad distractions,
which I'll talk about in a minute.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.594
And this whole phenomenon of having
short bursts of time to get things done

00:05:14.618 --> 00:05:18.260
reminds me of another thing
that doesn't work when you're interrupted,

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:19.469
and that is sleep.

00:05:20.031 --> 00:05:23.220
I think that sleep and work
are very closely related --

00:05:23.244 --> 00:05:26.942
not because you can work while you're
sleeping and sleep while you're working.

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:28.410
That's not really what I mean.

00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:34.505
I'm talking specifically about the fact
that sleep and work are phase-based,

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.260
or stage-based, events.

00:05:36.584 --> 00:05:42.639
Sleep is about sleep phases, or stages --
some people call them different things.

00:05:42.663 --> 00:05:46.497
There are five of them, and in order
to get to the really deep ones,

00:05:46.521 --> 00:05:49.290
the meaningful ones,
you have to go through the early ones.

00:05:49.314 --> 00:05:52.505
If you're interrupted while you're
going through the early ones --

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.236
if someone bumps you in bed,
or there's a sound, or whatever happens --

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
you don't just pick up where you left off.

00:05:58.284 --> 00:06:00.236
If you're interrupted and woken up,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.998
you have to start again.

00:06:02.022 --> 00:06:05.236
So you have to go back
a few phases and start again.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.027
And what ends up happening --
you might have days like this

00:06:08.051 --> 00:06:11.599
where you wake up at eight or seven
in the morning, or whenever you get up,

00:06:11.623 --> 00:06:13.739
and you're like,
"I didn't sleep very well.

00:06:13.763 --> 00:06:16.331
I did the sleep thing --
I went to bed, I laid down,

00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:18.733
but I didn't really sleep."

00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:21.123
People say you go "to" sleep,

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:24.265
but you don't go to sleep,
you go towards sleep; it takes a while.

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.344
You've got to go through phases and stuff,

00:06:26.368 --> 00:06:28.677
and if you're interrupted,
you don't sleep well.

00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:31.057
So does anyone here
expect someone to sleep well

00:06:31.081 --> 00:06:32.663
if they're interrupted all night?

00:06:32.687 --> 00:06:34.401
I don't think anyone would say yes.

00:06:34.425 --> 00:06:36.750
Why do we expect people to work well

00:06:36.774 --> 00:06:39.246
if they're being interrupted
all day at the office?

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.704
How can we possibly expect
people to do their job

00:06:41.728 --> 00:06:43.833
if they go to the office
and are interrupted?

00:06:43.857 --> 00:06:46.764
That doesn't really seem
like it makes a lot of sense, to me.

00:06:46.788 --> 00:06:50.656
So what are the interruptions that happen
at the office but not at other places?

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.941
Because in other places, you can have
interruptions like the TV,

00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:58.236
or you could go for a walk,
or there's a fridge downstairs,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.365
or you've got your own couch,
or whatever you want to do.

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.198
If you talk to certain managers,
they'll tell you

00:07:04.222 --> 00:07:06.793
that they don't want
their employees to work at home

00:07:06.817 --> 00:07:08.714
because of these distractions.

00:07:08.738 --> 00:07:11.769
They'll sometimes also say,

00:07:11.793 --> 00:07:14.636
"If I can't see the person,
how do I know they're working?"

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.961
which is ridiculous, but that's one
of the excuses that managers give.

00:07:17.985 --> 00:07:21.242
And I'm one of these managers.
I understand. I know how this goes.

00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:23.989
We all have to improve
on this sort of thing.

00:07:24.013 --> 00:07:25.983
But oftentimes they'll cite distractions:

00:07:26.007 --> 00:07:27.641
"I can't let someone work at home.

00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:29.681
They'll watch TV, or do this other thing."

00:07:29.705 --> 00:07:32.440
It turns out those aren't
the things that are distracting,

00:07:32.464 --> 00:07:34.420
Because those are voluntary distractions.

00:07:34.444 --> 00:07:36.896
You decide when you want
to be distracted by the TV,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.611
when you want to turn something on,

00:07:38.635 --> 00:07:41.029
or when you want to go
downstairs or go for a walk.

00:07:41.053 --> 00:07:42.204
At the office,

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:44.251
most of the interruptions and distractions

00:07:44.275 --> 00:07:47.392
that really cause people not
to get work done are involuntary.

00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:50.527
So let's go through a couple of those.

00:07:50.551 --> 00:07:53.868
Now, managers and bosses
will often have you think

00:07:53.892 --> 00:07:55.896
that the real distractions at work

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.730
are things like Facebook and Twitter

00:07:58.754 --> 00:08:01.924
and YouTube and other websites,

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.790
and in fact, they'll go so far
as to actually ban these sites at work.

00:08:05.814 --> 00:08:09.155
Some of you may work at places
where you can't get to certain sites.

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:11.798
I mean, is this China?
What the hell is going on here?

00:08:11.822 --> 00:08:14.565
You can't go to a website at work,
and that's the problem?

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:16.597
That's why people aren't
getting work done,

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.549
because they're on Facebook and Twitter?

00:08:18.573 --> 00:08:20.826
That's kind of ridiculous.
It's a total decoy.

00:08:21.557 --> 00:08:24.974
Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,

00:08:24.998 --> 00:08:27.236
these things are just
modern-day smoke breaks.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.275
No one cared about letting people take
a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago,

00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:33.917
so why does anyone care
if someone goes to Facebook

00:08:33.941 --> 00:08:36.052
or Twitter or YouTube here and there?

00:08:36.076 --> 00:08:38.653
Those aren't the real
problems in the office.

00:08:38.677 --> 00:08:42.288
The real problems are
what I like to call the M&amp;Ms,

00:08:42.312 --> 00:08:44.565
the Managers and the Meetings.

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:47.978
Those are the real problems
in the modern office today.

00:08:48.002 --> 00:08:50.482
And this is why
things don't get done at work,

00:08:50.506 --> 00:08:52.306
it's because of the M&amp;Ms.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.632
Now what's interesting is,

00:08:54.656 --> 00:08:57.797
if you listen to all the places
that people talk about doing work,

00:08:57.821 --> 00:09:01.785
like at home, in the car, on a plane,
late at night, or early in the morning,

00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:03.940
you don't find managers and meetings.

00:09:03.964 --> 00:09:07.201
You find a lot of other distractions,
but not managers and meetings.

00:09:07.225 --> 00:09:10.202
So these are the things
that you don't find elsewhere,

00:09:10.226 --> 00:09:11.821
but you do find at the office.

00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:15.982
And managers are basically people
whose job it is to interrupt people.

00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:19.498
That's pretty much what managers are for.
They're for interrupting people.

00:09:19.522 --> 00:09:23.361
They don't really do the work, so they
make sure everyone else is doing work,

00:09:23.385 --> 00:09:25.109
which is an interruption.

00:09:25.133 --> 00:09:28.727
We have lots of managers in the world now,
and a lot of people in the world,

00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:30.852
and a lot of interruptions
by these managers.

00:09:30.876 --> 00:09:32.929
They have to check in:
"Hey, how's it going?

00:09:32.953 --> 00:09:34.837
Show me what's up." This sort of thing.

00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:37.019
They keep interrupting you
at the wrong time,

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:40.344
while you're actually trying to do
something they're paying you to do,

00:09:40.368 --> 00:09:41.771
they tend to interrupt you.

00:09:41.795 --> 00:09:43.358
That's kind of bad.

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:46.493
But what's even worse is the thing
that managers do most of all,

00:09:46.517 --> 00:09:47.964
which is call meetings.

00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:50.534
And meetings are just toxic,

00:09:50.558 --> 00:09:53.560
terrible, poisonous things

00:09:53.584 --> 00:09:55.003
during the day at work.

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:56.243
(Laughter)

00:09:56.267 --> 00:09:58.054
We all know this to be true,

00:09:58.078 --> 00:10:01.299
and you would never see a spontaneous
meeting called by employees.

00:10:01.323 --> 00:10:02.584
It doesn't work that way.

00:10:02.608 --> 00:10:04.336
The manager calls the meeting

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.275
so the employees can all come together,

00:10:06.299 --> 00:10:09.022
and it's an incredibly disruptive
thing to do to people --

00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:10.236
to say, "Hey look,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.958
we're going to bring 10 people
together right now and have a meeting.

00:10:13.982 --> 00:10:15.474
I don't care what you're doing,

00:10:15.498 --> 00:10:18.505
you've got to stop doing it,
so you can have this meeting."

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:21.903
I mean, what are the chances
that all 10 people are ready to stop?

00:10:21.927 --> 00:10:25.680
What if they're thinking about something
important, or doing important work?

00:10:25.704 --> 00:10:29.493
All of a sudden you tell them they have
to stop doing that to do something else.

00:10:29.517 --> 00:10:32.236
So they go into a meeting room,
they get together,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.532
and they talk about stuff
that doesn't really matter, usually.

00:10:35.556 --> 00:10:37.200
Because meetings aren't work.

00:10:37.224 --> 00:10:39.390
Meetings are places to go
to talk about things

00:10:39.414 --> 00:10:41.111
you're supposed to be doing later.

00:10:41.135 --> 00:10:43.106
But meetings also procreate.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.395
So one meeting tends
to lead to another meeting,

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:46.904
which leads to another meeting.

00:10:46.928 --> 00:10:49.134
There's often too many people
in the meetings,

00:10:49.158 --> 00:10:51.883
and they're very, very expensive
to the organization.

00:10:51.907 --> 00:10:55.032
Companies often think of a one-hour
meeting as a one-hour meeting,

00:10:55.056 --> 00:10:57.517
but that's not true,
unless there's only one person.

00:10:57.541 --> 00:11:01.065
If there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour
meeting, not a one-hour meeting.

00:11:01.089 --> 00:11:04.366
It's 10 hours of productivity taken
from the rest of the organization

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.729
to have this one-hour meeting,
which probably should have been handled

00:11:07.753 --> 00:11:10.236
by two or three people
talking for a few minutes.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.799
But instead, there's a long
scheduled meeting,

00:11:12.823 --> 00:11:15.394
because meetings are scheduled
the way software works,

00:11:15.418 --> 00:11:18.819
which is in increments of 15 minutes,
or 30 minutes, or an hour.

00:11:18.843 --> 00:11:22.486
You don't schedule an eight-hour meeting
with Outlook; you can't.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.484
You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes
or 45 minutes or an hour.

00:11:25.508 --> 00:11:27.482
And so we tend to fill these times up

00:11:27.506 --> 00:11:29.665
when things should go really quickly.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:33.339
So meetings and managers are
two major problems in businesses today,

00:11:33.363 --> 00:11:34.522
especially at offices.

00:11:34.546 --> 00:11:37.192
These things don't exist
outside of the office.

00:11:37.688 --> 00:11:42.489
So I have some suggestions
to remedy the situation.

00:11:42.513 --> 00:11:44.236
What can managers do --

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.236
enlightened managers, hopefully --

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.732
what can they do to make the office
a better place for people to work,

00:11:49.756 --> 00:11:52.601
so it's not the last resort,
but it's the first resort,

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:53.967
so that people start to say,

00:11:53.991 --> 00:11:56.768
"When I really want to get stuff done,
I go to the office."

00:11:56.792 --> 00:11:58.706
Because the offices are well-equipped;

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.864
everything is there
for them to do the work.

00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:04.149
But they don't want to go there right
now, so how do we change that?

00:12:04.173 --> 00:12:06.207
I have three suggestions
to share with you.

00:12:06.231 --> 00:12:09.102
I have about three minutes,
so that'll fit perfectly.

00:12:09.126 --> 00:12:11.963
We've all heard
of the Casual Friday thing.

00:12:11.987 --> 00:12:13.836
I don't know if people still do that.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.536
But how about "No-talk Thursdays?"

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.592
(Laughter)

00:12:17.616 --> 00:12:20.562
Pick one Thursday once a month,

00:12:20.586 --> 00:12:23.897
and cut it in half, just the afternoon --
I'll make it easy for you.

00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:25.651
So just the afternoon, one Thursday.

00:12:25.675 --> 00:12:27.929
First Thursday of the month,
just the afternoon,

00:12:27.953 --> 00:12:30.017
nobody in the office
can talk to each other.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.579
Just silence, that's it.

00:12:31.603 --> 00:12:33.236
And what you'll find

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.668
is that a tremendous amount
of work gets done

00:12:35.692 --> 00:12:37.296
when no one talks to each other.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.384
This is when people
actually get stuff done,

00:12:39.408 --> 00:12:41.924
is when no one's bothering them
or interrupting them.

00:12:41.948 --> 00:12:44.909
Giving someone four hours
of uninterrupted time

00:12:44.933 --> 00:12:47.107
is the best gift you can
give anybody at work.

00:12:47.131 --> 00:12:48.544
It's better than a computer,

00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:51.322
better than a new monitor,
better than new software,

00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:53.321
or whatever people typically use.

00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:55.749
Giving them four hours
of quiet time at the office

00:12:55.773 --> 00:12:57.694
is going to be incredibly valuable.

00:12:57.718 --> 00:13:01.686
If you try that, I think you'll agree,
and hopefully you can do it more often.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:03.432
So maybe it's every other week,

00:13:03.456 --> 00:13:05.236
or every week, once a week,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.313
afternoons no one can talk to each other.

00:13:07.337 --> 00:13:10.424
That's something that you'll find
will really, really work.

00:13:10.448 --> 00:13:12.750
Another thing you can try,

00:13:12.774 --> 00:13:16.236
is switching from active
communication and collaboration,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.451
which is like face-to-face stuff --
tapping people on the shoulder,

00:13:19.475 --> 00:13:21.451
saying hi to them, having meetings,

00:13:21.475 --> 00:13:24.261
and replace that with more
passive models of communication,

00:13:24.285 --> 00:13:26.586
using things like email
and instant messaging,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.562
or collaboration products,
things like that.

00:13:29.888 --> 00:13:32.809
Now some people might say
email is really distracting,

00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:36.403
I.M. is really distracting, and these
other things are really distracting,

00:13:36.427 --> 00:13:39.999
but they're distracting at a time
of your own choice and your own choosing.

00:13:40.023 --> 00:13:42.831
You can quit the email app;
you can't quit your boss.

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.633
You can quit I.M.;

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.474
you can't hide your manager.

00:13:46.498 --> 00:13:48.236
You can put these things away,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.641
and then you can be interrupted
on your own schedule, at your own time,

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:54.142
when you're available,
when you're ready to go again.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.236
Because work, like sleep,
happens in phases.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.353
So you'll be going up, doing some work,

00:13:58.377 --> 00:14:00.336
and then you'll come down from that work,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.812
and then maybe it's time
to check that email or I.M.

00:14:02.836 --> 00:14:05.337
There are very, very few things
that are that urgent,

00:14:05.361 --> 00:14:08.408
that need to happen, that need
to be answered right this second.

00:14:08.432 --> 00:14:09.607
So if you're a manager,

00:14:09.631 --> 00:14:12.615
start encouraging people to use
more things like I.M. and email

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:14.655
and other things that someone can put away

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:16.880
and then get back to you
on their own schedule.

00:14:16.904 --> 00:14:20.483
And the last suggestion I have is that,

00:14:20.507 --> 00:14:22.236
if you do have a meeting coming up,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.886
if you have the power, just cancel it.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.370
Just cancel that next meeting.

00:14:27.394 --> 00:14:28.560
(Laughter)

00:14:28.584 --> 00:14:31.229
Today's Friday, usually people
have meetings on Monday.

00:14:31.253 --> 00:14:32.415
Just don't have it.

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:33.844
I don't mean move it;

00:14:33.868 --> 00:14:36.510
I mean just erase it
from memory, it's gone.

00:14:36.534 --> 00:14:39.122
And you'll find out that everything
will be just fine.

00:14:39.146 --> 00:14:42.162
All these discussions and decisions
you thought you had to make

00:14:42.186 --> 00:14:43.970
at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,

00:14:43.994 --> 00:14:46.291
just forget about them,
and things will be fine.

00:14:46.315 --> 00:14:49.296
People will have a more open morning,
they can actually think.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.095
You'll find out all these things
you thought you had to do,

00:14:52.119 --> 00:14:53.572
you don't actually have to do.

00:14:53.596 --> 00:14:57.588
So those are just three quick suggestions
I wanted to give you guys to think about.

00:14:57.612 --> 00:15:00.637
I hope that some of these ideas
were at least provocative enough

00:15:00.661 --> 00:15:02.767
for managers and bosses
and business owners

00:15:02.791 --> 00:15:05.607
and organizers and people
who are in charge of other people,

00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:07.502
to think about laying off a little bit,

00:15:07.526 --> 00:15:09.661
and giving people more time
to get work done.

00:15:09.685 --> 00:15:11.495
I think it'll all pay off in the end.

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:13.521
So, thanks for listening.

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:15.204
(Applause)
