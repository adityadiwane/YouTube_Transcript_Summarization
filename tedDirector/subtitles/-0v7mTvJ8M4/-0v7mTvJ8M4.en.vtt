00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:28.260
(Music)

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Text: BeatJazz.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
BeatJazz is:

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
1. Live looping,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
2. Jazz improvisation

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
3. "Gestural" sound design.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Accelerometers

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
on each hand

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
read hand position.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.260
The color of the lights

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
indicates which sound I am playing.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Red = Drums,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Blue = Bass,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Green = Chords,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Orange = Leads,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Purple = Pads

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
The mouthpiece

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
consists of ...

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
a button,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
two guitar picks

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and lots of hot glue.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
The heads-up display

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.260
is a smartphone that displays system parameters.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Why?

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
To atomize music culture

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
so that ALL past, present and future genres

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
can be studied and abstracted, live.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
"BeatJazzers"

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.260
become as common as D.J.'s.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.260
But mostly ...

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.260
to MAKE the future

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
rather than wait for it.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:23.260
(Applause)
