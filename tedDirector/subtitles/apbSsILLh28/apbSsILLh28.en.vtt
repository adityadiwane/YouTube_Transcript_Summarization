00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.008
Well, we all need a reason to wake up.

00:00:18.898 --> 00:00:21.271
For me, it just took 11,000 volts.

00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:24.742
I know you're too polite to ask,

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.401
so I will tell you.

00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:29.577
One night, sophomore year of college,

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:33.299
just back from Thanksgiving holiday,

00:00:33.323 --> 00:00:35.975
a few of my friends and I
were horsing around,

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.564
and we decided to climb atop
a parked commuter train.

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:43.281
It was just sitting there,
with the wires that run overhead.

00:00:43.305 --> 00:00:46.407
Somehow, that seemed
like a great idea at the time.

00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:49.286
We'd certainly done stupider things.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.291
I scurried up the ladder on the back,

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:55.037
and when I stood up,

00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:58.643
the electrical current entered my arm,

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:01.207
blew down and out my feet,
and that was that.

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.288
Would you believe that watch still works?

00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:09.423
Takes a licking!

00:01:09.447 --> 00:01:10.478
(Laughter)

00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:12.811
My father wears it now in solidarity.

00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:21.318
That night began my formal relationship
with death -- my death --

00:01:21.342 --> 00:01:25.150
and it also began
my long run as a patient.

00:01:25.174 --> 00:01:26.328
It's a good word.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.079
It means one who suffers.

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:30.266
So I guess we're all patients.

00:01:31.607 --> 00:01:33.973
Now, the American health care system

00:01:33.997 --> 00:01:37.118
has more than its fair share
of dysfunction --

00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:39.202
to match its brilliance, to be sure.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.202
I'm a physician now,
a hospice and palliative medicine doc,

00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:46.472
so I've seen care from both sides.

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:50.975
And believe me: almost everyone
who goes into healthcare

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:54.136
really means well -- I mean, truly.

00:01:54.874 --> 00:01:58.807
But we who work in it
are also unwitting agents

00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:03.075
for a system that too often
does not serve.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:05.156
Why?

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:09.005
Well, there's actually a pretty easy
answer to that question,

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.277
and it explains a lot:

00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:17.259
because healthcare was designed
with diseases, not people, at its center.

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.325
Which is to say, of course,
it was badly designed.

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:28.210
And nowhere are the effects
of bad design more heartbreaking

00:02:28.234 --> 00:02:31.569
or the opportunity
for good design more compelling

00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:33.734
than at the end of life,

00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:37.114
where things are so distilled
and concentrated.

00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:40.020
There are no do-overs.

00:02:42.073 --> 00:02:46.564
My purpose today is
to reach out across disciplines

00:02:46.588 --> 00:02:50.955
and invite design thinking
into this big conversation.

00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:56.852
That is, to bring intention and creativity

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.645
to the experience of dying.

00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:05.268
We have a monumental
opportunity in front of us,

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:09.633
before one of the few universal issues

00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:12.967
as individuals as well as a civil society:

00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:16.907
to rethink and redesign how it is we die.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.079
So let's begin at the end.

00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:27.546
For most people, the scariest thing
about death isn't being dead,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.389
it's dying, suffering.

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.184
It's a key distinction.

00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:34.629
To get underneath this,
it can be very helpful

00:03:34.653 --> 00:03:39.007
to tease out suffering
which is necessary as it is,

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:41.696
from suffering we can change.

00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:47.553
The former is a natural,
essential part of life, part of the deal,

00:03:47.577 --> 00:03:52.691
and to this we are called
to make space, adjust, grow.

00:03:55.013 --> 00:04:00.359
It can be really good
to realize forces larger than ourselves.

00:04:01.098 --> 00:04:04.222
They bring proportionality,

00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:06.565
like a cosmic right-sizing.

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:11.213
After my limbs were gone,

00:04:11.237 --> 00:04:15.823
that loss, for example,
became fact, fixed --

00:04:15.847 --> 00:04:19.160
necessarily part of my life,

00:04:19.184 --> 00:04:25.300
and I learned that I could no more
reject this fact than reject myself.

00:04:27.173 --> 00:04:29.794
It took me a while,
but I learned it eventually.

00:04:30.572 --> 00:04:33.016
Now, another great thing
about necessary suffering

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.548
is that it is the very thing

00:04:36.572 --> 00:04:41.975
that unites caregiver and care receiver --

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:43.252
human beings.

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:48.903
This, we are finally realizing,
is where healing happens.

00:04:49.673 --> 00:04:53.193
Yes, compassion -- literally,
as we learned yesterday --

00:04:53.217 --> 00:04:54.645
suffering together.

00:04:56.672 --> 00:05:00.010
Now, on the systems side,
on the other hand,

00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:03.892
so much of the suffering
is unnecessary, invented.

00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:06.650
It serves no good purpose.

00:05:06.674 --> 00:05:10.975
But the good news is,
since this brand of suffering is made up,

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:12.483
well, we can change it.

00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:16.335
How we die is indeed
something we can affect.

00:05:18.446 --> 00:05:22.499
Making the system sensitive
to this fundamental distinction

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:25.975
between necessary
and unnecessary suffering

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:29.689
gives us our first of three
design cues for the day.

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:34.828
After all, our role as caregivers,
as people who care,

00:05:34.852 --> 00:05:39.514
is to relieve suffering --
not add to the pile.

00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:44.163
True to the tenets of palliative care,

00:05:44.187 --> 00:05:47.860
I function as something
of a reflective advocate,

00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:50.003
as much as prescribing physician.

00:05:51.177 --> 00:05:57.198
Quick aside: palliative care -- a very
important field but poorly understood --

00:05:57.222 --> 00:06:00.176
while it includes, it is not
limited to end of life care.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.041
It is not limited to hospice.

00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:06.268
It's simply about comfort
and living well at any stage.

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:10.038
So please know that you don't
have to be dying anytime soon

00:06:10.062 --> 00:06:11.749
to benefit from palliative care.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.730
Now, let me introduce you to Frank.

00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:18.983
Sort of makes this point.

00:06:19.007 --> 00:06:21.037
I've been seeing Frank now for years.

00:06:21.061 --> 00:06:25.255
He's living with advancing prostate cancer
on top of long-standing HIV.

00:06:26.197 --> 00:06:28.183
We work on his bone pain and his fatigue,

00:06:28.207 --> 00:06:32.921
but most of the time we spend thinking
out loud together about his life --

00:06:32.945 --> 00:06:34.310
really, about our lives.

00:06:35.071 --> 00:06:36.731
In this way, Frank grieves.

00:06:37.207 --> 00:06:40.986
In this way, he keeps up with
his losses as they roll in,

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.159
so that he's ready to take in
the next moment.

00:06:45.524 --> 00:06:49.695
Loss is one thing,
but regret, quite another.

00:06:51.243 --> 00:06:53.200
Frank has always been an adventurer --

00:06:53.224 --> 00:06:56.065
he looks like something
out of a Norman Rockwell painting --

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:57.653
and no fan of regret.

00:06:58.566 --> 00:07:01.247
So it wasn't surprising
when he came into clinic one day,

00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:04.007
saying he wanted to raft
down the Colorado River.

00:07:05.142 --> 00:07:06.817
Was this a good idea?

00:07:07.268 --> 00:07:11.472
With all the risks to his safety
and his health, some would say no.

00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:15.062
Many did, but he went for it,
while he still could.

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:19.610
It was a glorious, marvelous trip:

00:07:20.928 --> 00:07:26.250
freezing water, blistering dry heat,
scorpions, snakes,

00:07:26.274 --> 00:07:31.705
wildlife howling off the flaming walls
of the Grand Canyon --

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:35.273
all the glorious side of the world
beyond our control.

00:07:36.492 --> 00:07:38.382
Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic,

00:07:38.406 --> 00:07:40.693
is exactly the kind
so many of us would make,

00:07:40.717 --> 00:07:46.914
if we only had the support to figure out
what is best for ourselves over time.

00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:52.660
So much of what we're talking about today
is a shift in perspective.

00:07:54.723 --> 00:07:56.975
After my accident,
when I went back to college,

00:07:56.999 --> 00:07:59.365
I changed my major to art history.

00:08:00.095 --> 00:08:04.395
Studying visual art, I figured
I'd learn something about how to see --

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:09.079
a really potent lesson
for a kid who couldn't change

00:08:09.103 --> 00:08:11.144
so much of what he was seeing.

00:08:12.602 --> 00:08:16.340
Perspective, that kind of alchemy
we humans get to play with,

00:08:16.364 --> 00:08:18.874
turning anguish into a flower.

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:25.791
Flash forward: now I work
at an amazing place in San Francisco

00:08:25.815 --> 00:08:28.054
called the Zen Hospice Project,

00:08:28.078 --> 00:08:31.698
where we have a little ritual
that helps with this shift in perspective.

00:08:32.405 --> 00:08:35.466
When one of our residents dies,

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.960
the mortuary men come, and as we're
wheeling the body out through the garden,

00:08:39.984 --> 00:08:42.014
heading for the gate, we pause.

00:08:42.038 --> 00:08:44.223
Anyone who wants --

00:08:44.247 --> 00:08:46.971
fellow residents, family,
nurses, volunteers,

00:08:46.995 --> 00:08:49.439
the hearse drivers too, now --

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:53.890
shares a story or a song or silence,

00:08:53.914 --> 00:08:56.702
as we sprinkle the body
with flower petals.

00:08:57.282 --> 00:08:59.586
It takes a few minutes;

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.975
it's a sweet, simple parting image
to usher in grief with warmth,

00:09:04.999 --> 00:09:06.710
rather than repugnance.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:13.106
Contrast that with the typical experience
in the hospital setting,

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.994
much like this -- floodlit room
lined with tubes and beeping machines

00:09:18.018 --> 00:09:22.186
and blinking lights that don't stop
even when the patient's life has.

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:26.445
Cleaning crew swoops in,
the body's whisked away,

00:09:26.469 --> 00:09:31.497
and it all feels as though that person
had never really existed.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.693
Well-intended, of course,
in the name of sterility,

00:09:35.717 --> 00:09:39.213
but hospitals tend to assault our senses,

00:09:39.237 --> 00:09:44.741
and the most we might hope for
within those walls is numbness --

00:09:44.765 --> 00:09:49.007
anesthetic, literally
the opposite of aesthetic.

00:09:50.499 --> 00:09:54.804
I revere hospitals for what they can do;
I am alive because of them.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.213
But we ask too much of our hospitals.

00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:03.029
They are places for acute trauma
and treatable illness.

00:10:03.053 --> 00:10:07.078
They are no place to live and die;
that's not what they were designed for.

00:10:10.078 --> 00:10:12.378
Now mind you -- I am not
giving up on the notion

00:10:12.402 --> 00:10:15.612
that our institutions
can become more humane.

00:10:16.057 --> 00:10:18.438
Beauty can be found anywhere.

00:10:21.092 --> 00:10:23.364
I spent a few months in a burn unit

00:10:23.388 --> 00:10:26.136
at St. Barnabas Hospital
in Livingston, New Jersey,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.317
where I got really
great care at every turn,

00:10:30.341 --> 00:10:32.538
including good
palliative care for my pain.

00:10:33.415 --> 00:10:36.260
And one night, it began to snow outside.

00:10:37.426 --> 00:10:41.341
I remember my nurses
complaining about driving through it.

00:10:42.103 --> 00:10:44.287
And there was no window in my room,

00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:47.617
but it was great to just imagine it
coming down all sticky.

00:10:49.299 --> 00:10:53.233
Next day, one of my nurses
smuggled in a snowball for me.

00:10:53.257 --> 00:10:54.890
She brought it in to the unit.

00:10:56.731 --> 00:11:02.139
I cannot tell you the rapture I felt
holding that in my hand,

00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:05.212
and the coldness dripping
onto my burning skin;

00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:07.546
the miracle of it all,

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.329
the fascination as I watched it melt
and turn into water.

00:11:15.293 --> 00:11:17.424
In that moment,

00:11:17.448 --> 00:11:21.936
just being any part of this planet
in this universe mattered more to me

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.059
than whether I lived or died.

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:27.206
That little snowball packed
all the inspiration I needed

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.435
to both try to live
and be OK if I did not.

00:11:31.176 --> 00:11:34.060
In a hospital, that's a stolen moment.

00:11:36.356 --> 00:11:39.745
In my work over the years,
I've known many people

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:41.596
who were ready to go, ready to die.

00:11:43.192 --> 00:11:47.975
Not because they had found
some final peace or transcendence,

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:52.308
but because they were so repulsed
by what their lives had become --

00:11:54.553 --> 00:11:59.102
in a word, cut off, or ugly.

00:12:03.394 --> 00:12:09.480
There are already record numbers of us
living with chronic and terminal illness,

00:12:09.504 --> 00:12:10.956
and into ever older age.

00:12:11.947 --> 00:12:16.747
And we are nowhere near ready
or prepared for this silver tsunami.

00:12:19.335 --> 00:12:22.596
We need an infrastructure
dynamic enough to handle

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.684
these seismic shifts in our population.

00:12:27.637 --> 00:12:30.657
Now is the time to create
something new, something vital.

00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:33.041
I know we can because we have to.

00:12:33.065 --> 00:12:35.087
The alternative is just unacceptable.

00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:37.533
And the key ingredients are known:

00:12:37.557 --> 00:12:41.231
policy, education and training,

00:12:41.255 --> 00:12:43.317
systems, bricks and mortar.

00:12:44.642 --> 00:12:48.448
We have tons of input
for designers of all stripes to work with.

00:12:49.123 --> 00:12:51.004
We know, for example, from research

00:12:51.028 --> 00:12:54.514
what's most important to people
who are closer to death:

00:12:54.538 --> 00:13:01.503
comfort; feeling unburdened
and unburdening to those they love;

00:13:01.527 --> 00:13:06.769
existential peace; and a sense
of wonderment and spirituality.

00:13:08.896 --> 00:13:12.654
Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years,

00:13:12.678 --> 00:13:16.321
we've learned much more
from our residents in subtle detail.

00:13:17.662 --> 00:13:20.127
Little things aren't so little.

00:13:21.499 --> 00:13:22.673
Take Janette.

00:13:22.697 --> 00:13:26.184
She finds it harder to breathe
one day to the next due to ALS.

00:13:26.208 --> 00:13:27.358
Well, guess what?

00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:31.499
She wants to start smoking again --

00:13:31.523 --> 00:13:34.451
and French cigarettes, if you please.

00:13:36.786 --> 00:13:39.009
Not out of some self-destructive bent,

00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:42.992
but to feel her lungs filled
while she has them.

00:13:44.786 --> 00:13:45.983
Priorities change.

00:13:47.556 --> 00:13:50.027
Or Kate -- she just wants to know

00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:54.086
her dog Austin is lying
at the foot of her bed,

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:57.827
his cold muzzle against her dry skin,

00:13:57.851 --> 00:14:00.574
instead of more chemotherapy
coursing through her veins --

00:14:00.598 --> 00:14:01.779
she's done that.

00:14:02.849 --> 00:14:07.865
Sensuous, aesthetic gratification,
where in a moment, in an instant,

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:11.241
we are rewarded for just being.

00:14:15.373 --> 00:14:19.655
So much of it comes down to
loving our time by way of the senses,

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:24.971
by way of the body -- the very thing
doing the living and the dying.

00:14:26.258 --> 00:14:27.817
Probably the most poignant room

00:14:27.841 --> 00:14:30.094
in the Zen Hospice guest house
is our kitchen,

00:14:30.118 --> 00:14:32.155
which is a little strange when you realize

00:14:32.179 --> 00:14:35.992
that so many of our residents
can eat very little, if anything at all.

00:14:36.016 --> 00:14:41.886
But we realize we are providing
sustenance on several levels:

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.976
smell, a symbolic plane.

00:14:46.356 --> 00:14:51.273
Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff
happening under our roof,

00:14:51.297 --> 00:14:55.031
one of the most tried and true
interventions we know of,

00:14:55.055 --> 00:14:58.548
is to bake cookies.

00:15:10.144 --> 00:15:11.748
As long as we have our senses --

00:15:11.772 --> 00:15:13.784
even just one --

00:15:13.808 --> 00:15:17.217
we have at least
the possibility of accessing

00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:20.409
what makes us feel human, connected.

00:15:22.999 --> 00:15:25.785
Imagine the ripples of this notion

00:15:25.809 --> 00:15:28.594
for the millions of people
living and dying with dementia.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:33.819
Primal sensorial delights that say
the things we don't have words for,

00:15:33.843 --> 00:15:36.717
impulses that make us stay present --

00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:39.546
no need for a past or a future.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:48.474
So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out
of the system was our first design cue,

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:53.263
then tending to dignity
by way of the senses,

00:15:53.287 --> 00:15:57.079
by way of the body --
the aesthetic realm --

00:15:57.103 --> 00:15:58.960
is design cue number two.

00:15:59.944 --> 00:16:03.750
Now this gets us quickly to the third
and final bit for today;

00:16:03.774 --> 00:16:10.638
namely, we need to lift our sights,
to set our sights on well-being,

00:16:10.662 --> 00:16:13.975
so that life and health and healthcare

00:16:13.999 --> 00:16:16.384
can become about making life
more wonderful,

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:18.852
rather than just less horrible.

00:16:20.196 --> 00:16:21.352
Beneficence.

00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:25.134
Here, this gets right at the distinction

00:16:25.158 --> 00:16:30.292
between a disease-centered and a patient-
or human-centered model of care,

00:16:30.316 --> 00:16:33.777
and here is where caring
becomes a creative, generative,

00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:35.643
even playful act.

00:16:36.657 --> 00:16:38.657
"Play" may sound like a funny word here.

00:16:39.687 --> 00:16:42.591
But it is also one of our
highest forms of adaptation.

00:16:42.615 --> 00:16:47.274
Consider every major compulsory effort
it takes to be human.

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.801
The need for food has birthed cuisine.

00:16:49.825 --> 00:16:52.413
The need for shelter
has given rise to architecture.

00:16:52.437 --> 00:16:54.643
The need for cover, fashion.

00:16:54.667 --> 00:16:57.398
And for being subjected to the clock,

00:16:57.422 --> 00:17:00.949
well, we invented music.

00:17:03.766 --> 00:17:06.975
So, since dying
is a necessary part of life,

00:17:06.999 --> 00:17:09.630
what might we create with this fact?

00:17:12.054 --> 00:17:15.430
By "play" I am in no way suggesting
we take a light approach to dying

00:17:15.454 --> 00:17:18.093
or that we mandate
any particular way of dying.

00:17:18.117 --> 00:17:20.975
There are mountains of sorrow
that cannot move,

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:24.066
and one way or another,
we will all kneel there.

00:17:24.999 --> 00:17:28.500
Rather, I am asking that we make space --

00:17:28.524 --> 00:17:34.267
physical, psychic room, to allow life
to play itself all the way out --

00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:37.648
so that rather than just
getting out of the way,

00:17:37.672 --> 00:17:42.489
aging and dying can become
a process of crescendo through to the end.

00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:48.772
We can't solve for death.

00:17:50.283 --> 00:17:52.590
I know some of you are working on this.

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:56.289
(Laughter)

00:17:57.003 --> 00:17:58.815
Meanwhile, we can --

00:17:58.839 --> 00:18:00.855
(Laughter)

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:03.185
We can design towards it.

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:05.417
Parts of me died early on,

00:18:05.441 --> 00:18:08.205
and that's something we can all say
one way or another.

00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:11.224
I got to redesign my life
around this fact,

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:14.588
and I tell you it has been a liberation

00:18:14.612 --> 00:18:17.767
to realize you can always find
a shock of beauty or meaning

00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:20.058
in what life you have left,

00:18:20.082 --> 00:18:22.846
like that snowball lasting
for a perfect moment,

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.168
all the while melting away.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:32.719
If we love such moments ferociously,

00:18:32.743 --> 00:18:35.015
then maybe we can learn to live well --

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:37.126
not in spite of death,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.736
but because of it.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.696
Let death be what takes us,

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.582
not lack of imagination.

00:18:48.868 --> 00:18:50.020
Thank you.

00:18:50.044 --> 00:18:57.964
(Applause)
