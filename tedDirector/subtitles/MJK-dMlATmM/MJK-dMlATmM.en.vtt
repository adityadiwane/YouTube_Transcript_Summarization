00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:14.383
Sleep.

00:00:14.383 --> 00:00:17.204
It's something we spend about
a third of our lives doing,

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:20.525
but do any of us really understand what it's all about?

00:00:20.525 --> 00:00:22.740
Two thousand years ago, Galen,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.880
one of the most prominent medical researchers

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.939
of the ancient world,

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.258
proposed that while we're awake,

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:31.620
our brain's motive force, its juice,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.190
would flow out to all the other parts of the body,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.204
animating them but leaving the brain all dried up,

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.820
and he thought that when we sleep,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.358
all this moisture that filled the rest of the body

00:00:42.358 --> 00:00:44.102
would come rushing back,

00:00:44.102 --> 00:00:45.913
rehydrating the brain

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.459
and refreshing the mind.

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:50.880
Now, that sounds completely ridiculous to us now,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.921
but Galen was simply trying to explain

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:54.528
something about sleep

00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:57.185
that we all deal with every day.

00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:59.109
See, we all know based on our own experience

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.821
that when you sleep, it clears your mind,

00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:03.283
and when you don't sleep,

00:01:03.283 --> 00:01:06.210
it leaves your mind murky.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.722
But while we know a great deal more about sleep now

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:10.526
than when Galen was around,

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:13.406
we still haven't understood why it is that sleep,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.035
of all of our activities, has this incredible

00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:18.754
restorative function for the mind.

00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:20.254
So today I want to tell you about

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:21.610
some recent research

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.368
that may shed new light on this question.

00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:27.573
We've found that sleep may actually be

00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:29.946
a kind of elegant design solution

00:01:29.946 --> 00:01:32.523
to some of the brain's most basic needs,

00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:34.469
a unique way that the brain

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.292
meets the high demands and the narrow margins

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:42.291
that set it apart from all the other organs of the body.

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:45.346
So almost all the biology that we observe

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:47.800
can be thought of as a series of problems

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.841
and their corresponding solutions,

00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:53.321
and the first problem that every organ must solve

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:55.819
is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.560
all those cells of the body.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.138
In the brain, that is especially critical;

00:02:00.138 --> 00:02:02.355
its intense electrical activity uses up

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:05.213
a quarter of the body's entire energy supply,

00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:06.843
even though the brain accounts

00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:10.180
for only about two percent of the body's mass.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.792
So the circulatory system

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:14.223
solves the nutrient delivery problem

00:02:14.223 --> 00:02:16.763
by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients

00:02:16.763 --> 00:02:20.106
and oxygen to every corner of our body.

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:23.120
You can actually see it in this video here.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.702
Here, we're imaging blood vessels

00:02:24.702 --> 00:02:27.597
in the brain of a living mouse.

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:30.117
The blood vessels form a complex network

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:32.465
that fills the entire brain volume.

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:34.266
They start at the surface of the brain,

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:37.147
and then they dive down into the tissue itself,

00:02:37.147 --> 00:02:39.508
and as they spread out, they supply nutrients

00:02:39.508 --> 00:02:45.273
and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain.

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:48.246
Now, just as every cell requires

00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:50.137
nutrients to fuel it,

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:53.277
every cell also produces waste as a byproduct,

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:54.823
and the clearance of that waste

00:02:54.823 --> 00:02:57.090
is the second basic problem

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.882
that each organ has to solve.

00:02:59.882 --> 00:03:02.465
This diagram shows the body's lymphatic system,

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:04.895
which has evolved to meet this need.

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:07.707
It's a second parallel network of vessels

00:03:07.707 --> 00:03:09.721
that extends throughout the body.

00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:11.678
It takes up proteins and other waste

00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:13.602
from the spaces between the cells,

00:03:13.602 --> 00:03:16.414
it collects them, and then dumps them into the blood

00:03:16.414 --> 00:03:18.675
so they can be disposed of.

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:20.464
But if you look really closely at this diagram,

00:03:20.464 --> 00:03:21.858
you'll see something

00:03:21.858 --> 00:03:24.186
that doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:03:24.186 --> 00:03:26.943
So if we were to zoom into this guy's head,

00:03:26.943 --> 00:03:29.136
one of the things that you would see there

00:03:29.136 --> 00:03:33.298
is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain.

00:03:33.298 --> 00:03:36.392
But that doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?

00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:39.597
I mean, the brain is this intensely active organ

00:03:39.597 --> 00:03:42.162
that produces a correspondingly
large amount of waste

00:03:42.162 --> 00:03:44.739
that must be efficiently cleared.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.701
And yet, it lacks lymphatic vessels, which means that

00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:49.497
the approach that the rest of the body takes

00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:51.482
to clearing away its waste

00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:54.491
won't work in the brain.

00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:56.539
So how, then, does the brain solve

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.293
its waste clearance problem?

00:03:58.293 --> 00:04:01.982
Well, that seemingly mundane question

00:04:01.982 --> 00:04:05.390
is where our group first jumped into this story,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.411
and what we found

00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:09.746
as we dove down into the brain,

00:04:09.746 --> 00:04:12.637
down among the neurons and the blood vessels,

00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:14.820
was that the brain's solution

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.383
to the problem of waste clearance,

00:04:17.383 --> 00:04:19.200
it was really unexpected.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.050
It was ingenious,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.168
but it was also beautiful.

00:04:25.168 --> 00:04:26.835
Let me tell you about what we found.

00:04:26.835 --> 00:04:29.389
So the brain has this large pool

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.850
of clean, clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.169
We call it the CSF.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.149
The CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain,

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:39.672
and wastes from inside the brain

00:04:39.672 --> 00:04:41.894
make their way out to the CSF,

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:45.157
which gets dumped, along with 
the waste, into the blood.

00:04:45.157 --> 00:04:46.277
So in that way, it sounds a lot like

00:04:46.277 --> 00:04:48.869
the lymphatic system, doesn't it?

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:51.625
But what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.357
from inside the brain,

00:04:53.357 --> 00:04:55.764
they don't just percolate their way randomly

00:04:55.764 --> 00:04:58.138
out to these pools of CSF.

00:04:58.138 --> 00:05:01.861
Instead, there is a specialized network of plumbing

00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:05.753
that organizes and facilitates this process.

00:05:05.753 --> 00:05:07.902
You can see that in these videos.

00:05:07.902 --> 00:05:10.940
Here, we're again imaging into the brain

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.424
of living mice.

00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:14.347
The frame on your left shows

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:16.406
what's happening at the brain's surface,

00:05:16.406 --> 00:05:17.970
and the frame on your right shows

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.916
what's happening down below the surface of the brain

00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:21.639
within the tissue itself.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.898
We've labeled the blood vessels in red,

00:05:23.898 --> 00:05:25.922
and the CSF that's surrounding the brain

00:05:25.922 --> 00:05:27.745
will be in green.

00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:29.545
Now, what was surprising to us

00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:32.796
was that the fluid on the outside of the brain,

00:05:32.796 --> 00:05:35.608
it didn't stay on the outside.

00:05:35.608 --> 00:05:39.011
Instead, the CSF was pumped back into

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:40.884
and through the brain

00:05:40.884 --> 00:05:43.916
along the outsides of the blood vessels,

00:05:43.916 --> 00:05:46.300
and as it flushed down into the brain

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.100
along the outsides of these vessels,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.912
it was actually helping to clear away,

00:05:50.912 --> 00:05:53.353
to clean the waste from the spaces

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.199
between the brain's cells.

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.111
If you think about it,

00:05:58.111 --> 00:06:01.588
using the outsides of these blood vessels like this

00:06:01.588 --> 00:06:04.107
is a really clever design solution,

00:06:04.107 --> 00:06:06.829
because the brain is enclosed

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:08.652
in a rigid skull

00:06:08.652 --> 00:06:10.755
and it's packed full of cells,

00:06:10.755 --> 00:06:13.500
so there is no extra space inside it

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.100
for a whole second set of vessels
like the lymphatic system.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.359
Yet the blood vessels,

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:20.317
they extend from the surface of the brain

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:22.926
down to reach every single cell in the brain,

00:06:22.926 --> 00:06:24.164
which means that fluid

00:06:24.164 --> 00:06:27.460
that's traveling along the outsides of these vessels

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.260
can gain easy access to the entire brain's volume,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.444
so it's actually this really clever way

00:06:33.444 --> 00:06:37.209
to repurpose one set of vessels, the blood vessels,

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:39.998
to take over and replace the function

00:06:39.998 --> 00:06:43.181
of a second set of vessels, the lymphatic vessels,

00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:45.592
to make it so you don't need them.

00:06:45.592 --> 00:06:47.909
And what's amazing is that no other organ

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.550
takes quite this approach

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.610
to clearing away the waste from between its cells.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.430
This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.698
But our most surprising finding

00:07:00.698 --> 00:07:02.801
was that all of this,

00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:05.151
everything I just told you about,

00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:08.469
with all this fluid rushing through the brain,

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:12.653
it's only happening in the sleeping brain.

00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:14.103
Here, the video on the left

00:07:14.103 --> 00:07:16.364
shows how much of the CSF is moving

00:07:16.364 --> 00:07:19.970
through the brain of a living mouse while it's awake.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.843
It's almost nothing.

00:07:21.843 --> 00:07:23.418
Yet in the same animal,

00:07:23.418 --> 00:07:26.623
if we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep,

00:07:26.623 --> 00:07:29.380
what we see is that the CSF

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.798
is rushing through the brain,

00:07:31.798 --> 00:07:33.958
and we discovered that at the same time

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.570
when the brain goes to sleep,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.233
the brain cells themselves seem to shrink,

00:07:39.233 --> 00:07:41.270
opening up spaces in between them,

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.407
allowing fluid to rush through

00:07:43.407 --> 00:07:46.140
and allowing waste to be cleared out.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.654
So it seems that Galen may actually have been

00:07:48.654 --> 00:07:50.910
sort of on the right track when he wrote about

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.610
fluid rushing through the brain

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.252
when sleep came on.

00:07:55.252 --> 00:07:58.705
Our own research, now it's 2,000 years later,

00:07:58.705 --> 00:08:00.775
suggests that what's happening is that

00:08:00.775 --> 00:08:02.834
when the brain is awake

00:08:02.834 --> 00:08:04.948
and is at its most busy,

00:08:04.948 --> 00:08:07.310
it puts off clearing away the waste

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.381
from the spaces between its cells until later,

00:08:10.381 --> 00:08:12.240
and then, when it goes to sleep

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.588
and doesn't have to be as busy,

00:08:14.588 --> 00:08:17.165
it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode

00:08:17.165 --> 00:08:18.852
to clear away the waste

00:08:18.852 --> 00:08:20.360
from the spaces between its cells,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.777
the waste that's accumulated throughout the day.

00:08:22.777 --> 00:08:25.185
So it's actually a little bit like how you or I,

00:08:25.185 --> 00:08:28.267
we put off our household chores during the work week

00:08:28.267 --> 00:08:29.729
when we don't have time to get to it,

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:32.990
and then we play catch up on all
the cleaning that we have to do

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.748
when the weekend rolls around.

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:39.020
Now, I've just talked a lot about waste clearance,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.472
but I haven't been very specific

00:08:40.472 --> 00:08:41.866
about the kinds of waste

00:08:41.866 --> 00:08:44.161
that the brain needs to be clearing

00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:46.704
during sleep in order to stay healthy.

00:08:46.704 --> 00:08:48.301
The waste product that these recent studies

00:08:48.301 --> 00:08:50.719
focused most on is amyloid-beta,

00:08:50.719 --> 00:08:53.914
which is a protein that's made
in the brain all the time.

00:08:53.914 --> 00:08:55.772
My brain's making amyloid-beta right now,

00:08:55.772 --> 00:08:57.930
and so is yours.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.932
But in patients with Alzheimer's disease,

00:08:59.932 --> 00:09:02.531
amyloid-beta builds up and aggregates

00:09:02.531 --> 00:09:04.544
in the spaces between the brain's cells,

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.970
instead of being cleared away 
like it's supposed to be,

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.980
and it's this buildup of amyloid-beta

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.193
that's thought to be one of the key steps

00:09:12.193 --> 00:09:14.814
in the development of that terrible disease.

00:09:14.814 --> 00:09:17.908
So we measured how fast amyloid-beta is cleared

00:09:17.908 --> 00:09:19.640
from the brain when it's awake

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.418
versus when it's asleep,

00:09:21.418 --> 00:09:23.296
and we found that indeed,

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.186
the clearance of amyloid-beta

00:09:25.186 --> 00:09:29.705
is much more rapid from the sleeping brain.

00:09:29.705 --> 00:09:31.384
So if sleep, then,

00:09:31.384 --> 00:09:33.342
is part of the brain's solution

00:09:33.342 --> 00:09:35.352
to the problem of waste clearance,

00:09:35.352 --> 00:09:37.728
then this may dramatically change how we think

00:09:37.728 --> 00:09:39.963
about the relationship between sleep,

00:09:39.963 --> 00:09:43.319
amyloid-beta, and Alzheimer's disease.

00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:45.277
A series of recent clinical studies

00:09:45.277 --> 00:09:47.110
suggest that among patients

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.204
who haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease,

00:09:50.204 --> 00:09:53.270
worsening sleep quality and sleep duration

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.288
are associated with a greater amount

00:09:55.288 --> 00:09:58.100
of amyloid-beta building up in the brain,

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.967
and while it's important to point out

00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:01.677
that these studies don't prove

00:10:01.677 --> 00:10:03.866
that lack of sleep or poor sleep

00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:06.273
cause Alzheimer's disease,

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:08.883
they do suggest that the failure of the brain

00:10:08.883 --> 00:10:10.795
to keep its house clean

00:10:10.795 --> 00:10:13.551
by clearing away waste like amyloid-beta

00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:15.453
may contribute to the development

00:10:15.453 --> 00:10:19.070
of conditions like Alzheimer's.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.975
So what this new research tells us, then,

00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:23.302
is that the one thing that all of you

00:10:23.302 --> 00:10:24.710
already knew about sleep,

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.363
that even Galen understood about sleep,

00:10:27.363 --> 00:10:30.434
that it refreshes and clears the mind,

00:10:30.434 --> 00:10:31.975
may actually be a big part

00:10:31.975 --> 00:10:34.292
of what sleep is all about.

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:35.810
See, you and I, we go to sleep

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.543
every single night,

00:10:37.543 --> 00:10:40.546
but our brains, they never rest.

00:10:40.546 --> 00:10:42.380
While our body is still

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.451
and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere,

00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:47.127
the elegant machinery of the brain

00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:49.107
is quietly hard at work

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.300
cleaning and maintaining

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.135
this unimaginably complex machine.

00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:55.176
Like our housework,

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:57.925
it's a dirty and a thankless job,

00:10:57.925 --> 00:11:00.180
but it's also important.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.583
In your house, if you stop cleaning your kitchen

00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:04.491
for a month,

00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:06.930
your home will become completely unlivable

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.537
very quickly.

00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:10.625
But in the brain, the consequences

00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:13.556
of falling behind may be much greater

00:11:13.556 --> 00:11:16.284
than the embarrassment of dirty countertops,

00:11:16.284 --> 00:11:18.848
because when it comes to cleaning the brain,

00:11:18.848 --> 00:11:21.224
it is the very health and function

00:11:21.224 --> 00:11:24.169
of the mind and the body that's at stake,

00:11:24.169 --> 00:11:26.410
which is why understanding these

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.682
very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today

00:11:30.682 --> 00:11:33.675
may be critical for preventing and treating

00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:36.703
diseases of the mind tomorrow.

00:11:36.703 --> 00:11:38.751
Thank you.

00:11:38.751 --> 00:11:40.518
