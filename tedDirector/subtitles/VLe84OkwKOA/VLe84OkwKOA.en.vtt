00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.550
I'd like to have you look at this pencil.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.407
It's a thing. It's a legal thing.

00:00:18.407 --> 00:00:21.379
And so are books you might have
or the cars you own.

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:24.258
They're all legal things.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:27.881
The great apes that you'll see behind me,

00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:31.549
they too are legal things.

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:35.822
Now, I can do that to a legal thing.

00:00:35.822 --> 00:00:38.631
I can do whatever I want
to my book or my car.

00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:41.533
These great apes, you'll see.

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:45.420
The photographs are taken by a man
named James Mollison

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.464
who wrote a book called
"James &amp; Other Apes."

00:00:48.464 --> 00:00:51.227
And he tells in his book
how every single one them,

00:00:51.227 --> 00:00:53.525
almost every one of them, is an orphan

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:57.140
who saw his mother and father
die before his eyes.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.748
They're legal things.

00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:02.441
So for centuries, there's been
a great legal wall

00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:05.785
that separates legal things
from legal persons.

00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:09.570
On one hand, legal things
are invisible to judges.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.520
They don't count in law.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.215
They don't have any legal rights.

00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:15.699
They don't have
the capacity for legal rights.

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:17.836
They are the slaves.

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:20.660
On the other side of that legal wall
are the legal persons.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.097
Legal persons are very visible to judges.

00:01:23.607 --> 00:01:25.312
They count in law.

00:01:25.312 --> 00:01:27.239
They may have many rights.

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:30.142
They have the capacity
for an infinite number of rights.

00:01:30.142 --> 00:01:32.510
And they're the masters.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.779
Right now, all nonhuman animals
are legal things.

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:40.660
All human beings are legal persons.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.469
But being human and being a legal person

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:49.112
has never been, and is not today,
synonymous with a legal person.

00:01:49.112 --> 00:01:52.478
Humans and legal persons
are not synonymous.

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:55.358
On the one side,

00:01:55.358 --> 00:01:59.491
there have been many human beings
over the centuries

00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:01.464
who have been legal things.

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:02.997
Slaves were legal things.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:06.719
Women, children,
were sometimes legal things.

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:11.146
Indeed, a great deal of civil rights
struggle over the last centuries

00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:15.659
has been to punch a hole
through that wall and begin to feed

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.713
these human things through the wall
and have them become legal persons.

00:02:20.713 --> 00:02:24.182
But alas, that hole has closed up.

00:02:24.772 --> 00:02:26.819
Now, on the other side are legal persons,

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.952
but they've never only been
limited to human beings.

00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:34.940
There are, for example, there are many
legal persons who are not even alive.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.547
In the United States,

00:02:36.547 --> 00:02:40.540
we're aware of the fact
that corporations are legal persons.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.515
In pre-independence India,

00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:45.139
a court held that a Hindu idol
was a legal person,

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.200
that a mosque was a legal person.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.630
In 2000, the Indian Supreme Court

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.173
held that the holy books
of the Sikh religion was a legal person,

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.472
and in 2012, just recently,

00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:59.233
there was a treaty between
the indigenous peoples of New Zealand

00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:02.484
and the crown, in which it was agreed
that a river was a legal person

00:03:02.484 --> 00:03:05.525
who owned its own riverbed.

00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:08.776
Now, I read Peter Singer's book in 1980,

00:03:08.776 --> 00:03:12.500
when I had a full head
of lush, brown hair,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.088
and indeed I was moved by it,

00:03:15.088 --> 00:03:18.616
because I had become a lawyer because
I wanted to speak for the voiceless,

00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:19.851
defend the defenseless,

00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:24.263
and I'd never realized how voiceless
and defenseless the trillions,

00:03:24.263 --> 00:03:27.769
billions of nonhuman animals are.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.788
And I began to work
as an animal protection lawyer.

00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:35.664
And by 1985, I realized that I was trying
to accomplish something

00:03:35.664 --> 00:03:37.591
that was literally impossible,

00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:40.215
the reason being that all of my clients,

00:03:40.215 --> 00:03:43.697
all the animals whose interests
I was trying to defend,

00:03:43.697 --> 00:03:46.182
were legal things; they were invisible.

00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:48.102
It was not going to work, so I decided

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:52.066
that the only thing that was going to work
was they had, at least some of them,

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:55.864
had to also be moved through a hole
that we could open up again in that wall

00:03:55.864 --> 00:03:59.440
and begin feeding the appropriate
nonhuman animals through that hole

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.986
onto the other side
of being legal persons.

00:04:02.986 --> 00:04:08.426
Now, at that time, there was
very little known about or spoken about

00:04:08.426 --> 00:04:10.794
truly animal rights,

00:04:10.794 --> 00:04:15.235
about the idea of having legal personhood
or legal rights for a nonhuman animal,

00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:18.005
and I knew it was going
to take a long time.

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:21.405
And so, in 1985, I figured that it
would take about 30 years

00:04:21.405 --> 00:04:24.934
before we'd be able to even begin
a strategic litigation,

00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:30.716
long-term campaign, in order to be able
to punch another hole through that wall.

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:36.556
It turned out that I was pessimistic,
that it only took 28.

00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:45.240
So what we had to do in order
to begin was not only

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.922
to write law review articles
and teach classes, write books,

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:52.890
but we had to then begin
to get down to the nuts and bolts

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.875
of how you litigate that kind of case.

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:58.908
So one of the first things we needed to do
was figure out what a cause of action was,

00:04:58.908 --> 00:05:00.367
a legal cause of action.

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:03.264
And a legal cause of action
is a vehicle that lawyers use

00:05:03.264 --> 00:05:08.840
to put their arguments in front of courts.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.744
It turns out there's
a very interesting case

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:16.348
that had occurred almost 250 years ago
in London called Somerset vs. Stewart,

00:05:16.348 --> 00:05:19.444
whereby a black slave
had used the legal system

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:22.323
and had moved from a legal thing
to a legal person.

00:05:22.323 --> 00:05:26.386
I was so interested in it that I
eventually wrote an entire book about it.

00:05:26.386 --> 00:05:31.773
James Somerset was an eight-year-old boy
when he was kidnapped from West Africa.

00:05:31.773 --> 00:05:34.720
He survived the Middle Passage,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.894
and he was sold to a Scottish businessman
named Charles Stewart in Virginia.

00:05:39.894 --> 00:05:44.102
Now, 20 years later, Stewart
brought James Somerset to London,

00:05:44.102 --> 00:05:47.980
and after he got there, James decided
he was going to escape.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.620
And so one of the first things he did
was to get himself baptized,

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.901
because he wanted to get
a set of godparents,

00:05:53.901 --> 00:05:55.712
because to an 18th-century slave,

00:05:55.712 --> 00:05:58.870
they knew that one of the major
responsibilities of godfathers

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.982
was to help you escape.

00:06:00.982 --> 00:06:04.998
And so in the fall of 1771,

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:07.641
James Somerset had a confrontation
with Charles Stewart.

00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:12.313
We don't know exactly what happened,
but then James dropped out of sight.

00:06:12.313 --> 00:06:15.309
An enraged Charles Stewart
then hired slave catchers

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:17.550
to canvass the city of London,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.150
find him, bring him
not back to Charles Stewart,

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.173
but to a ship, the Ann and Mary,
that was floating in London Harbour,

00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:27.793
and he was chained to the deck,

00:06:27.793 --> 00:06:29.797
and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica

00:06:29.797 --> 00:06:32.816
where James was to be sold
in the slave markets

00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:36.299
and be doomed to the three to five
years of life that a slave had

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:39.150
harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.359
Well now James' godparents
swung into action.

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:44.866
They approached the most powerful judge,

00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:48.512
Lord Mansfield, who was chief judge
of the court of King's Bench,

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:52.157
and they demanded that he issue
a common law writ of habeus corpus

00:06:52.157 --> 00:06:53.991
on behalf of James Somerset.

00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:57.962
Now, the common law is the kind of law
that English-speaking judges can make

00:06:57.962 --> 00:07:02.099
when they're not cabined in
by statutes or constitutions,

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.695
and a writ of habeus corpus
is called the Great Writ,

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:06.762
capital G, capital W,

00:07:06.762 --> 00:07:11.290
and it's meant to protect any of us
who are detained against our will.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.263
A writ of habeus corpus is issued.

00:07:13.263 --> 00:07:15.701
The detainer is required
to bring the detainee in

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:21.576
and give a legally sufficient reason
for depriving him of his bodily liberty.

00:07:21.576 --> 00:07:26.570
Well, Lord Mansfield had to make
a decision right off the bat,

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.354
because if James Somerset
was a legal thing,

00:07:29.354 --> 00:07:32.419
he was not eligible
for a writ of habeus corpus,

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:34.439
only if he could be a legal person.

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:37.457
So Lord Mansfield decided
that he would assume,

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:41.560
without deciding, that James Somerset
was indeed a legal person,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.971
and he issued the writ of habeus corpus,
and James's body was brought in

00:07:44.971 --> 00:07:46.482
by the captain of the ship.

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:49.183
There were a series of hearings
over the next six months.

00:07:49.183 --> 00:07:55.011
On June 22, 1772, Lord Mansfield
said that slavery was so odious,

00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:56.845
and he used the word "odious,"

00:07:56.845 --> 00:08:00.723
that the common law would not support it,
and he ordered James free.

00:08:00.723 --> 00:08:04.313
At that moment, James Somerset
underwent a legal transubstantiation.

00:08:04.883 --> 00:08:06.943
The free man who walked
out of the courtroom

00:08:06.943 --> 00:08:09.191
looked exactly like the slave
who had walked in,

00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:14.330
but as far as the law was concerned,
they had nothing whatsoever in common.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.740
The next thing we did is that
the Nonhuman Rights Project,

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.250
which I founded, then began to look at
what kind of values and principles

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.128
do we want to put before the judges?

00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:28.007
What values and principles
did they imbibe with their mother's milk,

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:31.090
were they taught in law school,
do they use every day,

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.779
do they believe with all their hearts --
and we chose liberty and equality.

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:37.811
Now, liberty right is the kind of right
to which you're entitled

00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:40.152
because of how you're put together,

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:45.489
and a fundamental liberty right
protects a fundamental interest.

00:08:45.489 --> 00:08:48.724
And the supreme interest in the common law

00:08:48.724 --> 00:08:52.765
are the rights to autonomy
and self-determination.

00:08:54.015 --> 00:08:57.795
So they are so powerful that
in a common law country,

00:08:57.795 --> 00:09:02.393
if you go to a hospital and you refuse
life-saving medical treatment,

00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:04.640
a judge will not order it forced upon you,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.451
because they will respect
your self-determination and your autonomy.

00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:12.714
Now, an equality right is the kind
of right to which you're entitled

00:09:12.714 --> 00:09:15.610
because you resemble someone else
in a relevant way,

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.601
and there's the rub, relevant way.

00:09:17.601 --> 00:09:21.339
So if you are that, then because
they have the right, you're like them,

00:09:21.339 --> 00:09:23.684
you're entitled to the right.

00:09:23.684 --> 00:09:26.306
Now, courts and legislatures
draw lines all the time.

00:09:26.846 --> 00:09:29.118
Some are included, some are excluded.

00:09:29.118 --> 00:09:35.260
But you have to,
at the bare minimum you must --

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.695
that line has to be a reasonable means
to a legitimate end.

00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:42.435
The Nonhuman Rights Project
argues that drawing a line

00:09:42.435 --> 00:09:45.742
in order to enslave an autonomous
and self-determining being

00:09:45.742 --> 00:09:47.530
like you're seeing behind me,

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.560
that that's a violation of equality.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.820
We then searched through 80 jurisdictions,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.065
it took us seven years,
to find the jurisdiction

00:09:56.065 --> 00:09:58.271
where we wanted to begin
filing our first suit.

00:09:58.271 --> 00:09:59.770
We chose the state of New York.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.392
Then we decided upon
who our plaintiffs are going to be.

00:10:02.392 --> 00:10:04.258
We decided upon chimpanzees,

00:10:04.258 --> 00:10:07.109
not just because Jane Goodall
was on our board of directors,

00:10:07.109 --> 00:10:10.862
but because they, Jane and others,

00:10:10.862 --> 00:10:13.582
have studied chimpanzees
intensively for decades.

00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:17.158
We know the extraordinary
cognitive capabilities that they have,

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:20.292
and they also resemble the kind
that human beings have.

00:10:20.292 --> 00:10:25.424
And so we chose chimpanzees,
and we began to then canvass the world

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:28.256
to find the experts
in chimpanzee cognition.

00:10:28.256 --> 00:10:32.761
We found them in Japan, Sweden, Germany,
Scotland, England and the United States,

00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:35.524
and amongst them, they wrote
100 pages of affidavits

00:10:35.524 --> 00:10:38.320
in which they set out more than 40 ways

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.120
in which their complex
cognitive capability,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.140
either individually or together,

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.259
all added up to autonomy
and self-determination.

00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:50.936
Now, these included, for example,
that they were conscious.

00:10:50.936 --> 00:10:53.283
But they're also conscious
that they're conscious.

00:10:53.283 --> 00:10:56.139
They know they have a mind.
They know that others have minds.

00:10:56.139 --> 00:10:58.682
They know they're individuals,
and that they can live.

00:10:58.682 --> 00:11:01.975
They understand that they lived yesterday
and they will live tomorrow.

00:11:01.975 --> 00:11:05.419
They engage in mental time travel.
They remember what happened yesterday.

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:06.870
They can anticipate tomorrow,

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:11.587
which is why it's so terrible to imprison
a chimpanzee, especially alone.

00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:14.184
It's the thing that we do
to our worst criminals,

00:11:14.184 --> 00:11:18.955
and we do that to chimpanzees
without even thinking about it.

00:11:19.715 --> 00:11:22.426
They have some kind of moral capacity.

00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:25.352
When they play economic games
with human beings,

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:29.392
they'll spontaneously make fair offers,
even when they're not required to do so.

00:11:29.392 --> 00:11:31.425
They are numerate.
They understand numbers.

00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:32.805
They can do some simple math.

00:11:32.805 --> 00:11:36.869
They can engage in language --
or to stay out of the language wars,

00:11:36.869 --> 00:11:40.234
they're involved in intentional
and referential communication

00:11:40.234 --> 00:11:42.721
in which they pay attention
to the attitudes of those

00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:44.252
with whom they are speaking.

00:11:44.252 --> 00:11:45.710
They have culture.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.501
They have a material culture,
a social culture.

00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:50.916
They have a symbolic culture.

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:54.817
Scientists in the Taï Forests
in the Ivory Coast

00:11:54.817 --> 00:11:58.346
found chimpanzees who were using
these rocks to smash open

00:11:58.346 --> 00:12:01.132
the incredibly hard hulls of nuts.

00:12:01.132 --> 00:12:03.431
It takes a long time
to learn how to do that,

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.544
and they excavated the area
and they found

00:12:05.544 --> 00:12:08.377
that this material culture,
this way of doing it,

00:12:08.377 --> 00:12:11.720
these rocks, had passed down
for at least 4,300 years

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.712
through 225 chimpanzee generations.

00:12:16.712 --> 00:12:19.104
So now we needed to find our chimpanzee.

00:12:19.104 --> 00:12:22.284
Our chimpanzee,

00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:25.187
first we found two of them
in the state of New York.

00:12:25.187 --> 00:12:28.391
Both of them would die before
we could even get our suits filed.

00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:30.272
Then we found Tommy.

00:12:30.272 --> 00:12:33.384
Tommy is a chimpanzee.
You see him behind me.

00:12:33.384 --> 00:12:35.891
Tommy was a chimpanzee.
We found him in that cage.

00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:39.351
We found him in a small room
that was filled with cages

00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:44.537
in a larger warehouse structure on a used
trailer lot in central New York.

00:12:44.537 --> 00:12:46.711
We found Kiko, who is partially deaf.

00:12:46.711 --> 00:12:52.353
Kiko was in the back of a cement
storefront in western Massachusetts.

00:12:52.353 --> 00:12:54.250
And we found Hercules and Leo.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.953
They're two young male chimpanzees

00:12:55.953 --> 00:12:59.366
who are being used for biomedical,
anatomical research at Stony Brook.

00:12:59.366 --> 00:13:00.671
We found them.

00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:03.383
And so on the last week of December 2013,

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:07.323
the Nonhuman Rights Project filed three
suits all across the state of New York

00:13:07.323 --> 00:13:10.801
using the same common law
writ of habeus corpus argument

00:13:10.801 --> 00:13:13.529
that had been used with James Somerset,

00:13:13.529 --> 00:13:18.616
and we demanded that the judges issue
these common law writs of habeus corpus.

00:13:18.616 --> 00:13:20.727
We wanted the chimpanzees out,

00:13:20.727 --> 00:13:23.513
and we wanted them brought
to Save the Chimps,

00:13:23.513 --> 00:13:27.461
a tremendous chimpanzee
sanctuary in South Florida

00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:32.548
which involves an artificial lake
with 12 or 13 islands --

00:13:32.548 --> 00:13:35.411
there are two or three acres
where two dozen chimpanzees live

00:13:35.411 --> 00:13:36.571
on each of them.

00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:39.521
And these chimpanzees would then live
the life of a chimpanzee,

00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:43.923
with other chimpanzees in an environment
that was as close to Africa as possible.

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:47.870
Now, all these cases are still going on.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.902
We have not yet run into
our Lord Mansfield.

00:13:52.622 --> 00:13:54.230
We shall. We shall.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:58.110
This is a long-term strategic
litigation campaign. We shall.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.225
And to quote Winston Churchill,

00:14:00.225 --> 00:14:04.393
the way we view our cases
is that they're not the end,

00:14:04.393 --> 00:14:06.436
they're not even the beginning of the end,

00:14:06.436 --> 00:14:09.950
but they are perhaps
the end of the beginning.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.497
Thank you.

00:14:12.497 --> 00:14:16.497
(Applause)
