00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Some of the greatest innovations

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
and developments in the world

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
often happen at the intersection of two fields.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
So tonight I'd like to tell you

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
which is entertainment and robotics.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
So if we're trying to make robots

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
that can be more expressive

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and that can connect better with us in society,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
maybe we should look to some of the human professionals

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
of artificial emotion and personality

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
that occur in the dramatic arts.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and to attract people

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
to science and technology.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Some people in the last decade or two

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
have started creating artwork with technology.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
With my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
I would like to use art to create tech.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
(Laughter)

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
So we're based in New York City.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
with an adorable robot,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
please contact me, the Bot-Agent.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
The bot, our rising celebrity,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
He's named after the Star Trek character.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
I think he's going to be super popular.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
We've got the robot --

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
in his head is a database of a lot of jokes.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
It knows how much it's moving.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And so it's going to try to watch your response.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
(Laughter)

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
It can also learn from you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
about the quality of its jokes

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
over longer-term

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
to different communities or audiences,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
children versus adults, different cultures.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
You can learn something from the robot

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
about the community that you're in.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
to our future robot companions.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Some of you in this middle section --

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
you have red/green paddles.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
If you like what's going on,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
show the green.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
If you don't like the subject or the performance,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
you can hold the red.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Now don't be shy.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
It's just a robot.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
It doesn't have feelings ... yet.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
(Laughter)

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And the rest of you,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
you still count, you still matter.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
There's also a microphone

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and booing -- I hope not --

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
to help make some of its next decisions.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Right, so,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
let the robot stand-up comedy begin.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Data: Hello TEDWomen.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
It's an honor to be here.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
(Laughter)

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.260
(Applause)

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
You guys are looking good out there.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Ready for some jokes?

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Audience: Yeah.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Data: Here's the first one.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Right, so,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
a doctor says to his patient,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
"I have bad news and worse news.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.260
The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live."

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
"That's terrible," said the patient.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
"How can the news possibly be worse?"

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
"I've been trying to contact you since yesterday."

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
(Laughter)

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
(Applause)

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
Data: Pretty lucky for them.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Ever see that little Swiss Army knife

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
they have to fight with?

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
"Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
You get past me,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
the guy behind me has a spoon."

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
(Laughter)

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
HK: He's a French robot.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Data: A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
One of them falls to the ground.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
He does not seem to be breathing.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
The other guy whips out his cell phone

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and calls 911.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
He gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
What can I do?"

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
The operator says, "Just take it easy.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
I can help.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
First, let's make sure he's dead."

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
There is a silence,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
and the operator hears a shot.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
The guy's voice comes back on the line,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
"Okay, now what?"

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
(Laughter)

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
(Applause)

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Question: Why is television called a medium?

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Anyone?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Because it's neither rare nor well done.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
But to be completely honest with you,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
I kind of love television.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Data: I find it incredibly educational.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Actually, as soon as someone turns it on,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
I go into the other room and read.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.260
(Laughter)

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
That's all for now.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Was that okay for my first time?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:33.260
(Applause)

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
You've been a great audience.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Thank you.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
HK: Yay.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.260
(Applause)

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
So this is actually the first time

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
So thank you all for being a part of it.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
There's a lot more to come.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Thank you very much.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
(Applause)
