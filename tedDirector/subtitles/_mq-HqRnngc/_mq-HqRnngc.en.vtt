00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:24.503
(Music)

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:50.077
(Applause)

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.433
Trevor Copp: When "Dancing With the Stars"
first hit the airwaves,

00:01:59.457 --> 00:02:01.536
that is not what it looked like.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.097
(Laughter)

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:06.148
Jeff and I were full-time
ballroom dance instructors

00:02:06.172 --> 00:02:09.585
when the big TV ballroom revival hit,

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.800
and this was incredible.

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:15.736
I mean, one day we would say "foxtrot,"

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.797
and people were like "Foxes trotting."

00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:20.551
(Laughter)

00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:22.529
And the next day they were telling us

00:02:22.553 --> 00:02:24.941
the finer points of a good feather step.

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:27.318
And this blew our minds.

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:32.564
I mean, all of the ballroom dance
geeking out that we had always done

00:02:32.588 --> 00:02:36.227
on why salsa worked differently
than the competitive rumba

00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:38.755
and why tango traveled unlike the waltz,

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.796
all of that just hit
the public consciousness,

00:02:43.383 --> 00:02:44.899
and it changed everything.

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:48.200
But running parallel to this excitement,

00:02:48.224 --> 00:02:52.575
the excitement that suddenly,
somehow, we were cool --

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.020
(Laughter)

00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:57.057
there was also this reservation.

00:02:57.914 --> 00:03:00.371
Why this and why now?

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:04.789
Jeff Fox: When Trevor and I
would get together for training seminars

00:03:04.813 --> 00:03:05.972
or just for fun,

00:03:05.996 --> 00:03:07.862
we'd toss each other around, mix it up,

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:10.073
take a break from having
to lead all the time.

00:03:10.097 --> 00:03:12.867
We even came up with a system
for switching lead and follow

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:14.042
while we were dancing,

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:16.075
as a way of taking turns and playing fair.

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.056
It wasn't until we used that system
as part of a performance

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.241
in a small festival

00:03:20.265 --> 00:03:22.392
that we got an important tap
on the shoulder.

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:25.724
Lisa O'Connell, a dramaturge
and director of a playwright center,

00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:27.746
pulled us aside after the show and said,

00:03:28.154 --> 00:03:30.834
"Do you have any idea
how political that was?"

00:03:30.858 --> 00:03:32.874
(Laughter)

00:03:32.898 --> 00:03:35.667
So that began an eight-year
collaboration to create a play

00:03:35.691 --> 00:03:38.452
which not only further developed
our system for switching

00:03:38.476 --> 00:03:42.234
but also explored the impact
of being locked into a single role,

00:03:42.258 --> 00:03:43.422
and what's worse,

00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:45.575
being defined by that single role.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.492
TC: Because, of course,

00:03:47.968 --> 00:03:52.177
classic Latin and ballroom dancing
isn't just a system of dancing;

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.344
it's a way of thinking, of being,

00:03:55.924 --> 00:03:57.547
of relating to each other

00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:00.162
that captured a whole period's values.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.966
There's one thing that stayed
consistent, though:

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.316
the man leads

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.735
and the woman follows.

00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:08.854
So street salsa, championship tango,
it's all the same --

00:04:08.878 --> 00:04:10.736
he leads, she follows.

00:04:11.335 --> 00:04:13.074
So this was gender training.

00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:15.425
You weren't just learning to dance --

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.489
you were learning to "man" and to "woman."

00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:21.003
It's a relic.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.896
And in the way of relics,
you don't throw it out,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.303
but you need to know
that this is the past.

00:04:26.327 --> 00:04:27.707
This isn't the present.

00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:31.945
It's like Shakespeare:
respect it, revive it -- great!

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:33.455
But know that this is history.

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.021
This doesn't represent how we think today.

00:04:37.045 --> 00:04:38.585
So we asked ourselves:

00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:40.263
If you strip it all down,

00:04:40.672 --> 00:04:43.431
what is at the core of partner dancing?

00:04:44.094 --> 00:04:46.329
JF: Well, the core principle
of partner dancing

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:48.753
is that one person leads,
the other one follows.

00:04:49.094 --> 00:04:52.364
The machine works the same,
regardless of who's playing which role.

00:04:52.388 --> 00:04:55.659
The physics of movement doesn't really
give a crap about your gender.

00:04:55.683 --> 00:04:56.723
(Laughter)

00:04:56.747 --> 00:04:58.777
So if we were to update the existing form,

00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:00.895
we would need to make it
more representative

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.189
of how we interact here, now, in 2015.

00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:06.963
When you watch ballroom,
don't just watch what's there.

00:05:07.517 --> 00:05:08.699
Watch what's not.

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:12.101
The couple is always
only a man and a woman.

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.283
Together.

00:05:13.307 --> 00:05:14.579
Only.

00:05:14.603 --> 00:05:15.754
Ever.

00:05:15.778 --> 00:05:19.860
So, same-sex and gender nonconformist
couples just disappear.

00:05:19.884 --> 00:05:22.516
In most mainstream international
ballroom competitions,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.159
same-sex couples are rarely
recognized on the floor,

00:05:25.183 --> 00:05:26.367
and in many cases,

00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:28.128
the rules prohibit them completely.

00:05:28.152 --> 00:05:32.987
TC: Try this: Google-image,
"professional Latin dancer,"

00:05:33.504 --> 00:05:35.715
and then look for an actual Latino person.

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:37.106
(Laughter)

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.669
You'll be there for days.

00:05:39.145 --> 00:05:43.170
What you will get is page after page
of white, straight Russian couples

00:05:43.194 --> 00:05:45.159
spray-tanned to the point of mahogany.

00:05:45.183 --> 00:05:47.084
(Laughter)

00:05:47.108 --> 00:05:49.368
There are no black people,
there are no Asians,

00:05:49.392 --> 00:05:50.676
no mixed-race couples,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.228
so basically, non-white people
just disappeared.

00:05:54.727 --> 00:05:58.739
Even within the white-straight-
couple-only paradigm --

00:06:00.008 --> 00:06:01.389
she can't be taller,

00:06:01.413 --> 00:06:02.881
he can't be shorter.

00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:04.528
She can't be bolder,

00:06:05.025 --> 00:06:06.420
he can't be gentler.

00:06:07.261 --> 00:06:09.481
If you were to take a ballroom dance

00:06:09.505 --> 00:06:11.798
and translate that into a conversation

00:06:11.822 --> 00:06:13.264
and drop that into a movie,

00:06:13.288 --> 00:06:16.910
we, as a culture,
would never stand for this.

00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:19.857
He dictates, she reacts.

00:06:20.674 --> 00:06:23.679
No relationship -- gay,
straight or anything --

00:06:23.703 --> 00:06:28.110
that we would regard as remotely healthy
or functional looks like that,

00:06:28.134 --> 00:06:29.720
and yet somehow,

00:06:29.744 --> 00:06:32.358
you put it on prime time,
you slap some makeup on it,

00:06:32.382 --> 00:06:36.039
throw the glitter on, put it out there
as movement, not as text,

00:06:36.832 --> 00:06:38.950
and we, as a culture,

00:06:38.974 --> 00:06:40.297
tune in and clap.

00:06:41.805 --> 00:06:44.751
We are applauding our own absence.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.948
Too many people have disappeared
from partner dancing.

00:06:50.334 --> 00:06:54.592
(Music)

00:07:34.276 --> 00:07:38.915
(Applause)

00:07:40.957 --> 00:07:43.496
JF: Now, you just saw
two men dancing together.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.533
(Laughter)

00:07:44.557 --> 00:07:46.022
And you thought it looked ...

00:07:46.412 --> 00:07:47.694
a little strange.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.175
Interesting -- appealing, even --

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.752
but a little bit odd.

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:55.356
Even avid followers of the same-sex
ballroom circuit can attest

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.490
that while same-sex partner dancing
can be dynamic and strong and exciting,

00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:01.837
it just doesn't quite seem to fit.

00:08:02.446 --> 00:08:03.663
Aesthetically speaking,

00:08:03.687 --> 00:08:07.733
if Alida and I take the classic
closed ballroom hold ...

00:08:09.637 --> 00:08:11.194
this is considered beautiful.

00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:16.392
(Laughter)

00:08:16.703 --> 00:08:17.961
But why not this?

00:08:17.985 --> 00:08:19.675
(Laughter)

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:23.367
See, the standard image that the leader
must be larger and masculine

00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:25.485
and the follower smaller and feminine --

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.429
this is a stumbling point.

00:08:27.978 --> 00:08:31.848
TC: So we wanted to look at this
from a totally different angle.

00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:37.035
So, what if we could keep
the idea of lead and follow

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:40.255
but toss the idea that this
was connected to gender?

00:08:40.824 --> 00:08:45.827
Further, what if a couple
could lead and follow each other

00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:47.080
and then switch?

00:08:47.513 --> 00:08:48.746
And then switch back?

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.139
What if it could be like a conversation,

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:56.018
taking turns listening and speaking,
just like we do in life?

00:08:56.042 --> 00:08:59.254
What if we could dance like that?

00:09:00.418 --> 00:09:03.059
We call it "Liquid Lead Dancing."

00:09:04.542 --> 00:09:06.461
JF: Let's try this with a Latin dance,

00:09:07.045 --> 00:09:08.199
salsa.

00:09:08.524 --> 00:09:12.161
In salsa, there's a key transitional step,
called the cross-body lead.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:14.945
We use it as punctuation
to break up the improvisation.

00:09:14.969 --> 00:09:18.339
It can be a little tricky to spot
if you're not used to looking for it,

00:09:18.363 --> 00:09:19.514
so here it is.

00:09:25.191 --> 00:09:26.845
One more time for the cheap seats.

00:09:26.869 --> 00:09:29.305
(Laughter)

00:09:32.378 --> 00:09:34.383
And here's the action one more time,

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.766
nice and slow.

00:09:40.842 --> 00:09:44.929
Now, if we apply liquid-lead thinking
to this transitional step,

00:09:44.953 --> 00:09:46.635
the cross-body lead becomes a point

00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:48.644
where the lead and the follow can switch.

00:09:48.668 --> 00:09:51.191
The person following can elect
to take over the lead,

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:53.568
or the person leading can choose
to surrender it,

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:56.184
essentially making it
a counter-cross-body lead.

00:09:56.208 --> 00:09:58.144
Here's how that looks in slow motion.

00:10:05.913 --> 00:10:09.300
And here's how it looked
when we danced it in the opening dance.

00:10:14.789 --> 00:10:18.162
With this simple tweak,
the dance moves from being a dictation

00:10:18.186 --> 00:10:19.375
to a negotiation.

00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:22.254
Anyone can lead. Anyone can follow.

00:10:22.278 --> 00:10:24.761
And more importantly,
you can change your mind.

00:10:25.523 --> 00:10:27.889
Now, this is only one example
of how this applies,

00:10:27.913 --> 00:10:30.552
but once the blinkers come off,
anything can happen.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:36.273
TC: Let's look at how Liquid Lead thinking
could apply to a classic waltz.

00:10:36.297 --> 00:10:37.525
Because, of course,

00:10:37.549 --> 00:10:40.140
it isn't just a system of switching leads;

00:10:40.164 --> 00:10:41.330
it's a way of thinking

00:10:41.354 --> 00:10:44.610
that can actually make
the dance itself more efficient.

00:10:44.981 --> 00:10:46.329
So: the waltz.

00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:48.563
The waltz is a turning dance.

00:10:48.984 --> 00:10:50.596
This means that for the lead,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.832
you spend half of the dance
traveling backwards,

00:10:53.856 --> 00:10:55.326
completely blind.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.899
And because of the follower's position,

00:10:57.923 --> 00:11:00.731
basically, no one can see
where they're going.

00:11:00.755 --> 00:11:02.103
(Laughter)

00:11:02.127 --> 00:11:04.139
So you're out here on the floor,

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:06.827
and then imagine that coming right at you.

00:11:06.851 --> 00:11:08.200
JF: Raaaaaah!

00:11:08.224 --> 00:11:09.748
(Laughter)

00:11:09.772 --> 00:11:13.068
TC: There are actually a lot
of accidents out there

00:11:13.092 --> 00:11:15.334
that happen as a result
of this blind spot.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.322
But what if the partners
were to just allow for

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.495
a switch of posture for a moment?

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:23.798
A lot of accidents could be avoided.

00:11:24.253 --> 00:11:29.093
Even if one person led the whole dance
but allowed this switch to happen,

00:11:29.117 --> 00:11:30.503
it would be a lot safer,

00:11:30.527 --> 00:11:33.571
while at the same time,
offering new aesthetics into the waltz.

00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:37.654
Because physics doesn't give a damn
about your gender.

00:11:37.678 --> 00:11:38.737
(Laughter)

00:11:40.154 --> 00:11:43.155
JF: Now, we've danced Liquid Lead
in clubs, convention centers

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:46.007
and as part of "First Dance,"
the play we created with Lisa,

00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:48.363
on stages in North America and in Europe.

00:11:48.387 --> 00:11:50.070
And it never fails to engage.

00:11:50.736 --> 00:11:54.217
I mean, beyond the unusual sight
of seeing two men dancing together,

00:11:54.241 --> 00:11:56.735
it always evokes and engages.

00:11:57.174 --> 00:11:58.461
But why?

00:11:58.485 --> 00:12:01.580
The secret lies in what made
Lisa see our initial demonstration

00:12:01.604 --> 00:12:02.907
as "political."

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.506
It wasn't just that we were
switching lead and follow;

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.587
it's that we stayed consistent
in our presence, our personality

00:12:08.611 --> 00:12:11.540
and our power, regardless
of which role we were playing.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.184
We were still us.

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:15.851
And that's where the true freedom lies --

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:17.864
not just the freedom to switch roles,

00:12:17.888 --> 00:12:21.503
but the freedom from being defined
by whichever role you're playing,

00:12:21.527 --> 00:12:24.083
the freedom to always remain
true to yourself.

00:12:24.457 --> 00:12:27.557
Forget what a lead is supposed
to look like, or a follow.

00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:29.136
Be a masculine follow

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.383
or a feminine lead.

00:12:30.795 --> 00:12:32.065
Just be yourself.

00:12:32.873 --> 00:12:35.590
Obviously, this applies
off the dance floor as well,

00:12:35.614 --> 00:12:38.153
but on the floor, it gives us
the perfect opportunity

00:12:38.177 --> 00:12:41.474
to update an old paradigm,
reinvigorate an old relic,

00:12:41.498 --> 00:12:45.687
and make it more representative
of our era and our current way of being.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.971
TC: Jeff and I dance partner dancing
all the time with women and men

00:12:49.995 --> 00:12:51.383
and we love it.

00:12:51.407 --> 00:12:55.970
But we dance with a consciousness
that this is a historic form

00:12:55.994 --> 00:13:00.304
that can produce silence
and produce invisibility

00:13:00.328 --> 00:13:03.022
across the spectrum of identity
that we enjoy today.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.314
We invented Liquid Lead

00:13:05.338 --> 00:13:10.503
as a way of stripping out
all the ideas that don't belong to us

00:13:10.527 --> 00:13:14.822
and taking partner dancing back
to what it really always was:

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.756
the fine art of taking care of each other.

00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:27.413
(Music)

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:32.903
(Applause)
