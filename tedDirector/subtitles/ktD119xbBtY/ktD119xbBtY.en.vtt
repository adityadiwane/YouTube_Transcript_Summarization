00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:16.344
(Music)

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.606
Rainn Wilson: It takes
its toll, being alone.

00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:23.120
I'm a little bit lost,

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:26.057
and it's finally time
to make a real connection.

00:00:26.663 --> 00:00:27.819
Who am I?

00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:29.847
(Drums)

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:32.264
I'm a single white male,

00:00:32.288 --> 00:00:34.141
45 years of age.

00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:35.588
I love animals.

00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:37.781
Gainfully employed.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.212
I'm a people person.

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:43.103
I keep fit.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:46.042
Who am I looking for?

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.971
I'm looking for my idea mate.

00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:52.385
Are you that idea
that matches with who I really am?

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.266
(Video) Ron Finley: How would you feel

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.845
if you had no access to healthy food?

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:02.432
Gardening is the most therapeutic
and defiant act you can do.

00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:08.249
RW: Wow, we sure are getting
our fingers dirty for a first date, huh?

00:01:08.273 --> 00:01:12.051
RF: Gardening is the most therapeutic
and defiant act you can do.

00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:14.743
People in these areas --
they're exposed to crappy food.

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:17.035
I want people to know
that growing your own food

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:18.607
is like printing your own money.

00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:20.218
RW: You're like a food superhero!

00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:22.565
RF: Food is the problem
and food is the solution.

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:24.266
(Music)

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.873
Erin McKean: I'm a lexicographer.

00:01:25.897 --> 00:01:29.537
My job is to put every word
possible into the dictionary.

00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:30.901
RW: I love words, too --

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:33.536
just as much as any lexi-ta-tographer.

00:01:34.517 --> 00:01:36.930
What if you love a word
that you've just made up,

00:01:36.954 --> 00:01:38.890
like -- I don't know -- "scuberfinkles"?

00:01:38.914 --> 00:01:40.897
Beau Lotto: Do you think you see reality?

00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:43.228
RW: Well, I'm a little
nearsighted, but yeah.

00:01:43.252 --> 00:01:44.752
BL: Well, you can't -- I mean,

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:46.723
your brain has no access to this world.

00:01:46.747 --> 00:01:49.980
In fact, even the sensory information
that your eyes are receiving,

00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:51.161
your ears are receiving,

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:53.859
is completely meaningless
because it could mean anything.

00:01:53.883 --> 00:01:56.602
That tree could be a large object far away

00:01:56.626 --> 00:01:57.940
or a small object up close,

00:01:57.964 --> 00:01:59.907
and your brain has no way of knowing.

00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:03.141
RW: Once I thought I saw Bigfoot
but it was just a German shepherd.

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:06.302
Isabel Behncke Izquierdo: Bonobos
are, together with chimpanzees,

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.797
your closest living relatives.

00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:10.365
Bonobos have frequent and promiscuous sex

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.441
to manage conflict
and solve social issues.

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:15.189
RW: I'm just curious:

00:02:15.213 --> 00:02:17.403
Do we have any conflict
that needs managing

00:02:17.427 --> 00:02:19.443
or social issues to resolve?

00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:22.709
IBI: Remember --
you're on a date with my idea,

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:23.921
not me.

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:28.430
Jane McGonigal: This is the face
of someone who, against all odds,

00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:30.216
is on the verge of an epic win.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.441
RW: An epic win?

00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:35.069
JM: An epic win is an outcome
so extraordinarily positive,

00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:38.470
you didn't even know it was possible
until you achieved it.

00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:41.768
You're not making the face.

00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:47.459
You're making the "I'm not
good at life" face.

00:02:47.483 --> 00:02:49.753
RW: Arthur, I want to be
really honest with you.

00:02:49.777 --> 00:02:51.872
I am seeing other ideas. OK?

00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:53.053
I'm dating around.

00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:54.362
That's the situation.

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.231
Arthur Benjamin: I'd say this:

00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:58.684
Mathematics is not just solving for x,

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:00.842
it's also figuring out why.

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:03.277
RW: Do you want to get some pie?

00:03:03.301 --> 00:03:04.455
AB: Pi?

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:08.853
3.14159265358979 --

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:12.021
Reggie Watts: If we're going
to do something,

00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:13.872
we've got to just make a decision.

00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:16.441
Because without a decision
we're left powerless.

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:17.737
Without power,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.742
we have nothing to supply

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.078
the chain of those who are truly curious

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:25.360
to solve all of our current conditions.

00:03:26.242 --> 00:03:28.283
RW: And, "If you choose not to decide,

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:30.434
you still have made a choice" -- Rush.

00:03:31.172 --> 00:03:32.332
JM: Yes!

00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:33.867
This is the face we need to see

00:03:33.891 --> 00:03:35.985
on millions of problem solvers worldwide,

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.038
as we try to tackle the challenges
of the next century.

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:42.473
RW: So, are we going Dutch?

00:03:42.497 --> 00:03:47.444
AB: 3846264338327950

00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:49.728
28841...

00:03:50.907 --> 00:03:52.106
971?

00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:54.811
RW: One night, want to go
to a movie or something?

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.713
RF: Hell, no! Let's go plant some shit!

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:57.980
RW: Let's plant some shit!

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.981
Good, now what is this that I'm planting?

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:01.161
Bonobos!

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:03.323
IBI: Bonobos! (Laughs)

00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:04.696
Bonobos.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.637
RWatts: Um, interested much?

00:04:08.904 --> 00:04:10.619
RW: I want to have your idea baby.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.097
RWatts: Well, you know
what they say in Russia.

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:15.276
RW: Hm?

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.609
RWatts: "scuberfinckle."

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:18.633
