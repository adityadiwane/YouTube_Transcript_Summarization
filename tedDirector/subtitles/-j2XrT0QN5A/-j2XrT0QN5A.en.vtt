00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.330
I want to talk to you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.330
about one of the biggest myths in medicine,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
and that is the idea

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
that all we need are more medical breakthroughs

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
and then all of our problems will be solved.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
Our society loves to romanticize

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
the idea of the single, solo inventor

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
who, working late in the lab one night,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
makes an earthshaking discovery,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.330
and voila, overnight everything's changed.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
That's a very appealing picture,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
however, it's just not true.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
In fact, medicine today is a team sport.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
And in many ways,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
it always has been.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
I'd like to share with you a story

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
about how I've experienced this very dramatically

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
in my own work.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
I'm a surgeon,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
and we surgeons have always had

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
this special relationship with light.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.330
When I make an incision inside a patient's body, it's dark.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
We need to shine light to see what we're doing.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
And this is why, traditionally,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
surgeries have always started so early in the morning --

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
to take advantage of daylight hours.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
And if you look at historical pictures

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
of the early operating rooms,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
they have been on top of buildings.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
For example, this is the oldest operating room in the Western world,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
in London,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
where the operating room

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
is actually on top of a church

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
with a skylight coming in.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
And then this is a picture

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
of one of the most famous hospitals in America.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
This is Mass General in Boston.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
And do you know where the operating room is?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
Here it is

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
on the top of the building

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
with plenty of windows to let light in.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
So nowadays in the operating room,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
we no longer need to use sunlight.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
And because we no longer need to use sunlight,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
we have very specialized lights

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
that are made for the operating room.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
We have an opportunity

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
to bring in other kinds of lights --

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
lights that can allow us to see

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
what we currently don't see.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
And this is what I think

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
is the magic of fluorescence.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
So let me back up a little bit.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
When we are in medical school,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
where everything's color-coded.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
Nerves are yellow, arteries are red,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
veins are blue.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.330
That's so easy anybody could become a surgeon, right?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
However, when we have a real patient on the table,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
this is the same neck dissection --

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
not so easy to tell the difference

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
between different structures.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
We heard over the last couple days

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
what an urgent problem

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
cancer still is in our society,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
what a pressing need it is

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
for us to not have

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
one person die every minute.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
Well if cancer can be caught early,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.330
enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
excised with surgery,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
I don't care if it has this gene or that gene,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
or if it has this protein or that protein,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
it's in the jar.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
It's done, it's out, you're cured of cancer.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
This is how we excise cancers.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
We do our best, based upon our training

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
we say, you know what, the cancer's gone.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
We've made a good job. We've taken it out.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
when the patient's on the table.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
But then we actually don't know that it's all out.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
We actually have to take samples from the surgical bed,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
what's left behind in the patient,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.330
and then send those bits to the pathology lab.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
In the meanwhile, the patient's on the operating room table.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
The nurses, anesthesiologist, the surgeon,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
all the assistants are waiting around.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
And we wait.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
The pathologist takes that sample,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
freezes it, cuts it, looks in the microscope one by one

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
and then calls back into the room.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
And that may be 20 minutes later per piece.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
So if you've sent three specimens,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
it's an hour later.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
And very often they say,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
"You know what, points A and B are okay,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
but point C, you still have some residual cancer there.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
Please go cut that piece out."

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
So we go back and we do that again, and again.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
And this whole process:

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
"Okay you're done.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
We think the entire tumor is out."

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
But very often several days later,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
the patient's gone home,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
we get a phone call:

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
"I'm sorry,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
once we looked at the final pathology,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
once we looked at the final specimen,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
we actually found that there's a couple other spots

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
where the margins are positive.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
There's still cancer in your patient."

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
So now you're faced with telling your patient, first of all,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.330
that they may need another surgery,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
or that they need additional therapy

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.330
such as radiation or chemotherapy.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
So wouldn't it be better

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
if we could really tell,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
if the surgeon could really tell,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
whether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field?

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
I mean, in many ways, the way that we're doing it,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.330
we're still operating in the dark.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
So in 2004, during my surgical residency,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
I had the great fortune

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
to meet Dr. Roger Tsien,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
who went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
in 2008.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
Roger and his team

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
were working on a way to detect cancer,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
and they had a very clever molecule

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
that they had come up with.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
The molecule they had developed

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330
had three parts.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
The main part of it is the blue part, polycation,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
and it's basically very sticky

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
to every tissue in your body.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
So imagine that you make a solution

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
full of this sticky material

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
everything's going to get lit up.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
Nothing will be specific.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
There's no specificity there.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
So they added two additional components.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
The first one is a polyanionic segment,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
which basically acts as a non-stick backing

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
like the back of a sticker.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
So when those two are together, the molecule is neutral

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
and nothing gets stuck down.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.330
And the two pieces are then linked

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.330
by something that can only be cut

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
if you have the right molecular scissors --

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
for example, the kind of protease enzymes

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
that tumors make.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
So here in this situation,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.330
if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
along with the dye, which is shown in green,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
and you inject it into the vein

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
of someone who has cancer,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
normal tissue can't cut it.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
The molecule passes through and gets excreted.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
However, in the presence of the tumor,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
now there are molecular scissors

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
that can break this molecule apart

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
right there at the cleavable site.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
And now, boom,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
the tumor labels itself

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
and it gets fluorescent.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
So here's an example of a nerve

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
that has tumor surrounding it.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
Can you tell where the tumor is?

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
I couldn't when I was working on this.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
But here it is. It's fluorescent.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
Now it's green.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
See, so every single one in the audience

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
now can tell where the cancer is.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
We can tell in the operating room, in the field,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
at a molecular level,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
and how much more work they need to do

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
to cut that out.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
And the cool thing about fluorescence

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
is that it's not only bright,

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
it actually can shine through tissue.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
The light that the fluorescence emits

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
can go through tissue.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.330
So even if the tumor is not right on the surface,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.330
you'll still be able to see it.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
In this movie, you can see

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
that the tumor is green.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.330
There's actually normal muscle on top of it. See that?

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
And I'm peeling that muscle away.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
But even before I peel that muscle away,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
you saw that there was a tumor underneath.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330
So that's the beauty of having a tumor

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
that's labeled with fluorescent molecules.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
That you can, not only see the margins

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.330
right there on a molecular level,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
but you can see it even if it's not right on the top --

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
even if it's beyond your field of view.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
And this works for metastatic lymph nodes also.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
Sentinel lymph node dissection

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.330
has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer, melanoma.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
Women used to get

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
really debilitating surgeries

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
But when sentinel lymph node

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
came into our treatment protocol,

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
the surgeon basically looks for the single node

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.330
that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
And then if that node has cancer,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
the woman would go on to get

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
the axillary lymph node dissection.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
So what that means

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.330
is if the lymph node did not have cancer,

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
the woman would be saved

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
from having unnecessary surgery.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
But sentinel lymph node, the way that we do it today,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
is kind of like having a road map

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
just to know where to go.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
So if you're driving on the freeway

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
and you want to know where's the next gas station,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
It doesn't tell you whether or not

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
the gas station has gas.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.330
You have to cut it out, bring it back home,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
cut it up, look inside

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
and say, "Oh yes, it does have gas."

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
So that takes more time.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
Patients are still on the operating room table.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
Anesthesiologists, surgeons are waiting around.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
That takes time.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.330
So with our technology, we can tell right away.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.330
You see a lot of little, roundish bumps there.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.330
Some of these are swollen lymph nodes

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
that look a little larger than others.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
Who amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold?

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
That doesn't mean that there's cancer inside.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
Well with our technology,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
the surgeon is able to tell immediately

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
which nodes have cancer.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
I won't go into this very much,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
but our technology, besides being able

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.330
to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.330
we can also use the same smart three-part molecule

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.330
to tag gadolinium onto the system

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
so you can do this noninvasively.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
The patient has cancer,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.330
even before you go in.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
Well you can see this on an MRI.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
So in surgery,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
it's important to know what to cut out.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
But equally important

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.330
is to preserve things

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
that are important for function.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
So it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
And what I'm talking about

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
are nerves.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.330
Nerves, if they are injured,

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
can cause paralysis,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.330
can cause pain.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
In the setting of prostate cancer,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
up to 60 percent of men

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
after prostate cancer surgery

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
may have urinary incontinence

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
and erectile disfunction.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.330
That's a lot of people to have a lot of problems --

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
and this is even in

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
so-called nerve-sparing surgery,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.330
which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
and they are trying to avoid the nerves.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
But you know what, these little nerves are so small,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.330
in the context of prostate cancer,

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.330
that they are actually never seen.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
They are traced

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
just by their known anatomical path

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
along vasculature.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.330
And they're known because somebody has decided to study them,

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
which means that we're still learning

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
about where they are.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.330
Crazy to think that we're having surgery,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.330
we're trying to excise cancer, we don't know where the cancer is.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.330
We're trying to preserve nerves; we can't see where they are.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
So I said, wouldn't it be great

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.330
if we could find a way

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.330
to see nerves with fluorescence?

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.330
And at first this didn't get a lot of support.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
People said, "We've been doing it this way for all these years.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
What's the problem?

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
We haven't had that many complications."

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
But I went ahead anyway.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
And Roger helped me.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
And he brought his whole team with him.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.330
So there's that teamwork thing again.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
And we eventually discovered molecules

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
that were specifically labeling nerves.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
And when we made a solution of this,

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
tagged with the fluorescence

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
and injected in the body of a mouse,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.330
their nerves literally glowed.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.330
You can see where they are.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.330
Here you're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.330
and you can see that that big, fat portion you can see very easily.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.330
But in fact, at the tip of that where I'm dissecting now,

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.330
there's actually very fine arborizations

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
that can't really be seen.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.330
You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
We have been able to see nerves

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
for facial expression, for facial movement, for breathing --

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
every single nerve --

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.330
nerves for urinary function around the prostate.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.330
We've been able to see every single nerve.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.330
When we put these two probes together ...

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
So here's a tumor.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is?

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
Now you do.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
What about the nerve that's going into this tumor?

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
That white portion there is easy to see.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
But what about the part that goes into the tumor?

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
Do you know where it's going?

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.330
Now you do.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.330
Basically, we've come up with a way

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
to stain tissue

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
and color-code the surgical field.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
This was a bit of a breakthrough.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.330
I think that it'll change the way that we do surgery.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
We published our results

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
and in Nature Biotechnology.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.330
We received commentary in Discover magazine,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
in The Economist.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.330
And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
They said, "Wow!

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.330
I have patients

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
who would benefit from this.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
I think that this will result in my surgeries

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
with a better outcome

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
and fewer complications."

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
What needs to happen now

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
is further development of our technology

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
along with development

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
of the instrumentation

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
that allows us to see

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.330
this sort of fluorescence in the operating room.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.330
The eventual goal

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.330
is that we'll get this into patients.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.330
However, we've discovered

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.330
that there's actually no straightforward mechanism

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
to develop a molecule

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
for one-time use.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
Understandably, the majority of the medical industry

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.330
is focused on multiple-use drugs,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.330
such as long-term daily medications.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
We are focused on making this technology better.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.330
We're focused on adding drugs,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
adding growth factors,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.330
killing nerves that are causing problems

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
and not the surrounding tissue.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.330
We know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.330
I'd like to leave you with this final thought.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.330
Successful innovation

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.330
is not a single breakthrough.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
It is not a sprint.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.330
It is not an event for the solo runner.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.330
Successful innovation

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.330
is a team sport, it's a relay race.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.330
It requires one team for the breakthrough

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.330
and another team

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.330
to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.330
And this takes the long-term steady courage

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.330
of the day-in day-out struggle

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.330
to educate, to persuade

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.330
and to win acceptance.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
And that is the light that I want to shine

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
on health and medicine today.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
Thank you very much.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.330
(Applause)
