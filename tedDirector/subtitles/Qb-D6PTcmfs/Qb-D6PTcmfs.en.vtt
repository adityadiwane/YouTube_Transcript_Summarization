00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:18.465
I know a man who soars above the city every night.

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:21.459
In his dreams, he twirls and swirls

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:24.326
with his toes kissing the Earth.

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:27.140
Everything has motion, he claims,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.982
even a body as paralyzed as his own.

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:36.812
This man is my father.

00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:38.713
Three years ago, when I found out

00:00:38.713 --> 00:00:41.300
that my father had suffered a severe stroke

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.426
in his brain stem,

00:00:43.426 --> 00:00:46.900
I walked into his room in the ICU

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.884
at the Montreal Neurological Institute

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:52.527
and found him lying deathly still,

00:00:52.527 --> 00:00:55.463
tethered to a breathing machine.

00:00:55.463 --> 00:00:59.894
Paralysis had closed over his body slowly,

00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:01.965
beginning in his toes, then legs,

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:04.495
torso, fingers and arms.

00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:06.700
It made its way up his neck,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.905
cutting off his ability to breathe,

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:13.382
and stopped just beneath the eyes.

00:01:13.382 --> 00:01:15.553
He never lost consciousness.

00:01:15.553 --> 00:01:18.140
Rather, he watched from within

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.446
as his body shut down,

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.583
limb by limb,

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:25.542
muscle by muscle.

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:30.100
In that ICU room, I walked up to my father's body,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.699
and with a quivering voice and through tears,

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:37.112
I began reciting the alphabet.

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:43.010
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.140
H, I, J, K.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.092
At K, he blinked his eyes.

00:01:50.092 --> 00:01:52.246
I began again.

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:56.740
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.750
H, I.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.888
He blinked again at the letter I,

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:05.880
then at T, then at R, and A:

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.727
Kitra.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:11.685
He said "Kitra, my beauty, don't cry.

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:16.140
This is a blessing."

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.795
There was no audible voice, but my father

00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:21.843
called out my name powerfully.

00:02:21.843 --> 00:02:24.935
Just 72 hours after his stroke,

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:26.690
he had already embraced

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.165
the totality of his condition.

00:02:30.165 --> 00:02:32.665
Despite his extreme physical state,

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:35.621
he was completely present with me,

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:38.253
guiding, nurturing,

00:02:38.253 --> 00:02:40.503
and being my father as much

00:02:40.503 --> 00:02:43.739
if not more than ever before.

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.302
Locked-in syndrome

00:02:45.302 --> 00:02:48.703
is many people's worst nightmare.

00:02:48.703 --> 00:02:51.111
In French, it's sometimes called

00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:53.191
"maladie de l'emmurÃ© vivant."

00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:58.512
Literally, "walled-in-alive disease."

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.267
For many people, perhaps most,

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:03.799
paralysis is an unspeakable horror,

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.140
but my father's experience

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.511
losing every system of his body

00:03:08.511 --> 00:03:11.572
was not an experience of feeling trapped,

00:03:11.572 --> 00:03:15.733
but rather of turning the psyche inwards,

00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:18.928
dimming down the external chatter,

00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:21.853
facing the recesses of his own mind,

00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:23.690
and in that place,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.470
falling in love with life and body anew.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.166
As a rabbi and spiritual man

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:35.280
dangling between mind and body, life and death,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.807
the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him.

00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:42.221
He realized he no longer needed to look

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.250
beyond the corporeal world

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.499
in order to find the divine.

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:52.388
"Paradise is in this body.

00:03:52.388 --> 00:03:56.150
It's in this world," he said.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.006
I slept by my father's side for the first four months,

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.120
tending as much as I could

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.765
to his every discomfort,

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:08.115
understanding the deep 
human psychological fear

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:11.600
of not being able to call out for help.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.326
My mother, sisters, brother and I,

00:04:15.326 --> 00:04:19.690
we surrounded him in a cocoon of healing.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.790
We became his mouthpiece,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.619
spending hours each day reciting the alphabet

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:27.981
as he whispered back sermons

00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:31.650
and poetry with blinks of his eye.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.104
His room, it became our temple of healing.

00:04:37.104 --> 00:04:39.826
His bedside became a site for those

00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:43.911
seeking advice and spiritual counsel, and through us,

00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:46.451
my father was able to speak

00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:48.645
and uplift,

00:04:48.645 --> 00:04:50.636
letter by letter,

00:04:50.636 --> 00:04:53.100
blink by blink.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.992
Everything in our world became slow and tender

00:04:56.992 --> 00:05:00.356
as the din, drama and death of the hospital ward

00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:03.860
faded into the background.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.960
I want to read to you one of the first things

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.201
that we transcribed in the week following the stroke.

00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:12.581
He composed a letter,

00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:15.202
addressing his synagogue congregation,

00:05:15.202 --> 00:05:18.711
and ended it with the following lines:

00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:21.190
"When my nape exploded,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.953
I entered another dimension:

00:05:23.953 --> 00:05:28.610
inchoate, sub-planetary, protozoan.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.199
Universes are opened and closed continually.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.258
There are many when low,

00:05:35.258 --> 00:05:37.463
who stop growing.

00:05:37.463 --> 00:05:39.567
Last week, I was brought so low,

00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:43.002
but I felt the hand of my father around me,

00:05:43.002 --> 00:05:46.422
and my father brought me back."

00:05:46.422 --> 00:05:48.667
When we weren't his voice,

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:52.000
we were his legs and arms.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.652
I moved them like I know I would have wanted

00:05:54.652 --> 00:05:57.249
my own arms and legs to be moved

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:01.141
were they still for all the hours of the day.

00:06:01.141 --> 00:06:05.124
I remember I'd hold his fingers near my face,

00:06:05.124 --> 00:06:09.410
bending each joint to keep it soft and limber.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.761
I'd ask him again and again

00:06:11.761 --> 00:06:14.258
to visualize the motion,

00:06:14.258 --> 00:06:17.779
to watch from within as the finger curled

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:21.851
and extended, and to move along with it

00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:24.562
in his mind.

00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:26.575
Then, one day, from the corner of my eye,

00:06:26.575 --> 00:06:30.298
I saw his body slither like a snake,

00:06:30.298 --> 00:06:33.603
an involuntary spasm passing through the course

00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:35.890
of his limbs.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.105
At first, I thought it was my own hallucination,

00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:41.660
having spent so much time tending to this one body,

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.320
so desperate to see anything react on its own.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.980
But he told me he felt tingles,

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.515
sparks of electricity flickering on and off

00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:56.272
just beneath the surface of the skin.

00:06:56.272 --> 00:06:59.579
The following week, he began ever so slightly

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:02.335
to show muscle resistance.

00:07:02.335 --> 00:07:04.940
Connections were being made.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.164
Body was slowly and gently reawakening,

00:07:10.164 --> 00:07:13.710
limb by limb, muscle by muscle,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.641
twitch by twitch.

00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:19.278
As a documentary photographer,

00:07:19.278 --> 00:07:21.080
I felt the need to photograph

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.280
each of his first movements

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.930
like a mother with her newborn.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.434
I photographed him taking his first unaided breath,

00:07:30.434 --> 00:07:33.213
the celebratory moment after he showed

00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:37.220
muscle resistance for the very first time,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.930
the new adapted technologies that allowed him

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.810
to gain more and more independence.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.823
I photographed the care and the love

00:07:45.823 --> 00:07:48.151
that surrounded him.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.304
But my photographs only told the outside story

00:08:00.304 --> 00:08:03.616
of a man lying in a hospital bed

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:05.270
attached to a breathing machine.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.892
I wasn't able to portray his story from within,

00:08:08.892 --> 00:08:12.215
and so I began to search for a new visual language,

00:08:12.215 --> 00:08:15.513
one which strived to express the ephemeral quality

00:08:15.513 --> 00:08:19.409
of his spiritual experience.

00:08:38.026 --> 00:08:40.284
Finally, I want to share with you

00:08:40.284 --> 00:08:43.642
a video from a series that I've been working on

00:08:43.642 --> 00:08:46.910
that tries to express the slow, in-between existence

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.620
that my father has experienced.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.170
As he began to regain his ability to breathe,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.802
I started recording his thoughts,

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:57.726
and so the voice that you hear in this video

00:08:57.726 --> 00:09:00.336
is his voice.

00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:03.418
(Video) Ronnie Cahana: You have to believe

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:06.152
you're paralyzed

00:09:06.152 --> 00:09:08.907
to play the part

00:09:08.907 --> 00:09:14.140
of a quadriplegic.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.108
I don't.

00:09:16.108 --> 00:09:18.694
In my mind,

00:09:18.694 --> 00:09:21.456
and in my dreams

00:09:21.456 --> 00:09:24.296
every night

00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:29.211
I Chagall-man float

00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:32.339
over the city

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:35.556
twirl and swirl

00:09:35.556 --> 00:09:43.475
with my toes kissing the floor.

00:09:43.475 --> 00:09:50.382
I know nothing about the statement

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:56.175
of man without motion.

00:09:56.175 --> 00:09:59.799
Everything has motion.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:03.150
The heart pumps.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.446
The body heaves.

00:10:07.446 --> 00:10:12.160
The mouth moves.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.231
We never stagnate.

00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:23.055
Life triumphs up and down.

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:25.131
Kitra Cahana: For most of us,

00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:27.865
our muscles begin to twitch and move

00:10:27.865 --> 00:10:30.373
long before we are conscious,

00:10:30.373 --> 00:10:33.290
but my father tells me his privilege

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.469
is living on the far periphery

00:10:35.469 --> 00:10:38.472
of the human experience.

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:41.104
Like an astronaut who sees a perspective

00:10:41.104 --> 00:10:44.322
that very few of us will ever get to share,

00:10:44.322 --> 00:10:47.428
he wonders and watches as he takes

00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:49.305
his first breaths

00:10:49.305 --> 00:10:53.344
and dreams about crawling back home.

00:10:53.344 --> 00:10:57.123
So begins life at 57, he says.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:11:00.622
A toddler has no attitude in its being,

00:11:00.622 --> 00:11:06.325
but a man insists on his world every day.

00:11:06.325 --> 00:11:09.970
Few of us will ever have to face physical limitations

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.928
to the degree that my father has,

00:11:12.928 --> 00:11:16.079
but we will all have moments of paralysis

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:18.440
in our lives.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.658
I know I frequently confront walls

00:11:21.658 --> 00:11:24.897
that feel completely unscalable,

00:11:24.897 --> 00:11:27.157
but my father insists

00:11:27.157 --> 00:11:30.030
that there are no dead ends.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:35.240
Instead, he invites me into his space of co-healing

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.844
to give the very best of myself, and for him

00:11:38.844 --> 00:11:42.274
to give the very best of himself to me.

00:11:42.274 --> 00:11:45.311
Paralysis was an opening for him.

00:11:45.311 --> 00:11:47.662
It was an opportunity to emerge,

00:11:47.662 --> 00:11:49.856
to rekindle life force,

00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:51.890
to sit still long enough with himself

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.200
so as to fall in love with the full continuum

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.494
of creation.

00:11:57.494 --> 00:12:01.476
Today, my father is no longer locked in.

00:12:01.476 --> 00:12:04.637
He moves his neck with ease,

00:12:04.637 --> 00:12:07.368
has had his feeding peg removed,

00:12:07.368 --> 00:12:10.150
breathes with his own lungs,

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.634
speaks slowly with his own quiet voice,

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:15.938
and works every day

00:12:15.938 --> 00:12:21.148
to gain more movement in his paralyzed body.

00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:23.499
But the work will never be finished.

00:12:23.499 --> 00:12:28.212
As he says, "I'm living in a broken world,

00:12:28.212 --> 00:12:31.243
and there is holy work to do."

00:12:31.243 --> 00:12:33.263
Thank you.

00:12:33.263 --> 00:12:37.120
(Applause)
