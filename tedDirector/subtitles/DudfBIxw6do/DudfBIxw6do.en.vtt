00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Chris Anderson: Welcome to TED.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Richard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
CA: Have you met anyone interesting?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because I had an apology to make to her.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I went home to my wife that night

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and she wanted to know why I had another woman's big,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
massive, big wedding ring on my finger.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and get it cut off.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So -- (Laughter) --

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so apologies to Goldie.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
CA: That's pretty good.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, we're going to put up some slides

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
of some of your companies here.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You've started one or two in your time.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records --

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I guess it all started with a magazine called Student.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
RB: I read all these sort of TED instructions:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
you must not talk about your own business, and this,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and now you ask me.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
since you asked the question.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
(Laughter)

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
CA: It depends what the answer is though.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
RB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
you can really run any companies.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I mean, companies are all about finding the right people,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitive

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and I love taking on, you know, the status quo

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and trying to turn it upside down.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So I've seen life as one long learning process.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And if I see -- you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
CA: Well, that was a bizarre thing,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and his view was that you were trading, you know,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the world's fourth biggest record company

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Why did you do that?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
RB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And I think if you start a business without financial backing,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
They were trying to put our airline out of business,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
unless I chipped in a chip.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
for that as well.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
RB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
But, yeah, it was sad at the time, but we moved on.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
CA: Now, you use the Virgin brand a lot

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
What does the brand stand for in your head?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
RB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
CA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
RB: No, but I was going to move on this.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
As I say, we go in and shake up other industries,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and I think, you know, we do it differently

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and I think that industries are not quite the same

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
as a result of Virgin attacking the market.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
CA: I mean, there are a few launches you've done

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
where the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I mean, Virgin Brides -- what happened there?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
(Laughter)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
RB: We couldn't find any customers.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
(Laughter)

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
(Applause)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
CA: I was actually also curious why --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Ain't virgin no longer, or something.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
RB: Again, we may have had problems finding customers.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I mean, we had -- often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
you know, you can deal with them.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
But about three months after the launch of the condom company,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I had a letter, a complaint,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
But obviously, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
asking if I'd be godfather, which I became.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So, it all worked out well.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
CA: Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
RB: I should have.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
CA: So, just help us with some of the numbers.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I mean, what are the numbers on this?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I mean, how big is the group overall?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
How much -- what's the total revenue?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
RB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
CA: And how many employees?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
RB: About 55,000.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
CA: So, you've been photographed in various ways at various times

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
What was that? Was that real?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
RB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
No, I mean, I think --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
CA: But is that your hair?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
RB: No.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
CA: What was that one?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
RB: Dropping in for tea.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
CA: OK.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
(Laughter)

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
RB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
CA: Oh, that car that we -- actually we --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
it was a TEDster event there, I think.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Is that -- could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
(Laughter)

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
RB: It's a tough job, isn't it?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
CA: I mean, it is a tough job.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
(Laughter)

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
it's very strange.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but --

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
RB: "Pammy" we launched, you know --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy"

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but --

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
(Laughter)

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
CA: Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
RB: Of course.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
CA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And, OK, so stop there. This was -- you had some award I think?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
RB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols'

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
"God Save The Queen," and I'd certainly never expected

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But somehow, she must have had a forgetful memory, I think.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
CA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
RB: Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Occasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richard

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and think there's some Shakespearean play taking place.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But nowhere else anyway.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
CA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
RB: No. I suppose if you're having problems

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
getting a booking in a restaurant or something,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that might be worth using it.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
CA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
RB: I'll go get the secretary to use it.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
CA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and Virgin Galactic up in the air. (Video)

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
RB: Yeah, it'll be ready in -- well, ready in 12 months

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and then we do 12 months extensive testing.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And then 24 months from now,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
people will be able to take a ride into space.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
CA: So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
RB: Philippe has done the -- yeah, quite a bit of it:

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And basically, he's just taken an eye

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and the space station will be one giant eye,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
so when you're in space,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And when you land, you'll be able to go back into this giant eye.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
CA: But you didn't have him design the engine?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
RB: Philippe is quite erratic,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
CA: He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
RB: Yeah? No, he is a --

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
CA: Well, some people found it wonderful,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
some people found it completely bizarre.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
But, I personally found it wonderful.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
RB: He's a wonderful enthusiast, which is why I love him. But ...

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
CA: So, now, you've always had this exploration bug in you.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Have you ever regretted that?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
RB: Many times.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Well, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So in those moments,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
CA: What was the closest you got to --

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
when did you think, this is it, I might be on my way out?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
each one, actually, I think we came close.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And, I mean, first of all we --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000
so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and we weren't quite sure,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
when a balloon actually got into the jet stream,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
as we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and it just took off.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And we were just crossing every finger,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know --

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
something seemed to go wrong every time,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with me

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
jumped, and left me holding on for dear life.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
(Laughter)

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
CA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, "I'm out of here!" and ...

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ...

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
CA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
RB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
with my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
But, anyway, we managed to survive it.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
CA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
RB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I would only have a couple of minutes of life left.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
to make sure that I was making the right decision.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
looked down at those clouds again,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
climbed back into the capsule again.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And then finally, just thought, there's a better way.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
it's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And the balloon hit the sea

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and --

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
CA: What did you write to your family?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that:

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
just I love you very much. And

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
just in case anything had happened.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
But fortunately, they never had to use it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
CA: Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guy

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
How much was the PR value part of this?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000
RB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and crashing into the seas.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
(Laughter)

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
CA: They have a point, Richard.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
you know, come on, Richard,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
(Laughter)

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
CA: To do all this,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
you must have been a genius from the get-go, right?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
RB: Well, I won't contradict that.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
(Laughter)

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
CA: OK, this isn't exactly hardball. OK.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:34.000
RB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I certainly would have failed IQ tests.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And if I -- if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
As somebody who's dyslexic,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
you also have some quite bizarre situations.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I mean, for instance, I've had to -- you know,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And so the board meetings have been fascinating.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
(Laughter)

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And so, it's like, good news or bad news?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
CA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
(Laughter)

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
RB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having --

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
(Laughter) --

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I've got it right.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
CA: No, trust me, it's gross.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
(Laughter)

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
RB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
"Look Richard, here's a -- let me draw on a diagram.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Here's a net in the sea,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And that's the profits you've got left over in this little net,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
everything else is eaten."

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And I finally worked it all out.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
(Laughter)

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
(Applause)

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
CA: But, I mean, at school -- so as well as being,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
you know, doing pretty miserably academically,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ...

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:26.000
RB: Yeah, I think I was a bit of a maverick and -- but I ... And I was,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
yeah, I was fortunately good at sport,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
and so at least I had something to excel at, at school.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
CA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I mean, there's the story about your mother

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
allegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying "OK, walk home."

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Did this really happen?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
RB: She was, you know,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
So she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
such as pushing us out of the car,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
and telling us to find our own way to Granny's,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
about five miles before we actually got there.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And making us go on wonderful, long bike rides.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
And we were never allowed to watch television and the like.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
CA: But is there a risk here?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
they're too coddled, they don't know what they've got,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
we're going to raise a generation of privileged ...

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
RB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.000
you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
CA: You didn't turn out too bad, I have to say, I'm ...

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Your headmaster said to you --

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school --

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
he said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
and I'm not sure which.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Which of those happened first?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
(Laughter)

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
RB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Act

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
and the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000
On the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which --

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
we had a center where we would help young people who had problems.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And there's an ancient law that says

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
you can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
So the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest us

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
We changed it to social diseases

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
and people came along with acne and spots,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
but nobody came with VD any more.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
And then subsequently, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,"

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000
the word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
And John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And so I rang up Nottingham University,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And he said, "Look, bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
It's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century."

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
(Laughter)

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And he went, "Furthermore, I'm a priest myself."

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
And so I said, "Would you mind coming to the court?"

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And he said he'd be delighted. And I said --

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
and he said, "Would you like me to wear my dog collar?"

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
And I said, "Yes, definitely. Please."

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
(Laughter)

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
CA: That's great.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
RB: So our key witness argued that it was actually

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
"Never Mind the Priest, Here's the Sex Pistols."

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
(Laughter)

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And the judge found us -- reluctantly found us not guilty, so ...

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
(Laughter)

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
CA: That is outrageous.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
(Applause)

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
So seriously, is there a dark side?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
A lot of people would say there's no way

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
without knifing a few people in the back,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
you know, doing some ugly things.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
You've been accused of being ruthless.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
There was a nasty biography written about you by someone.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Is any of it true? Is there an element of truth in it?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
RB: I don't actually think that the stereotype

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
generally speaking, works.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
I think if you treat people well,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
people will come back and come back for more.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And I think all you have in life is your reputation

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
and it's a very small world.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And I actually think that the best way

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000
of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
and I like to think that's how we run Virgin.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
CA: And what about the people who love you and who see you spending --

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
you keep getting caught up in these new projects,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
You get excited by an idea and, kapow!

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
I mean, do you think about life balance?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
How do your family feel about

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
each time you step into something big and new?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
RB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
so from the time the kids were very young,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
you know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000
And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Yes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can --

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
so I can take them there and we can bring friends,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
and we can play together,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
but I can also keep in touch with what's going on.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
CA: You started talking in recent years

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
about this term capitalist philanthropy.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
What is that?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
RB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
You know, the alternative, communism, has not worked.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
But the problem with capitalism is

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
and therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
And I think it's important that the individuals,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competing

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
for bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
but, you know, use that money to either create new jobs

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
or to tackle issues around the world.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
CA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
want to turn your resources toward?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
RB: Well, there's -- I mean there's a lot of issues.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.000
I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
and we are putting a lot of time and energy into,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
A, trying to come up with alternative fuels

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:14.000
and, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prize

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
cut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
of extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
And we just -- you know, there weren't really people

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
working on that before, so we wanted people to try to --

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
and also to try to extract the methane

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
out of the Earth's atmosphere as well.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
And actually, we've had about 15,000 people fill in the forms

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
saying they want to give it a go.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
And so we only need one, so we're hopeful.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
CA: And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
RB: Yes, I mean, we've got -- we're setting up something called

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
the war room, which is maybe the wrong word.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
We're trying to -- maybe we'll change it -- but anyway, it's a war room

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
to try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
all the different social problems in Africa,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
and try to look at best practices.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
So, for instance,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
there's a doctor in Africa that's found that

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
that the baby will not have HIV when it's born.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
And so disseminating that information to

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
around the rest of Africa is important.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
CA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
get so excited about -- I mean, they're used to having an idea,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
getting stuff done, and they believe profoundly

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
in their ability to make a difference in the world.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
we've got to fix this problem and we can do it,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
I've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da --

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
and actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000
RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually --

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
we're working with the government on it.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
HIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
it's a way of working with him, with his government.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
It's got to be consistent.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
and help governments approach things slightly differently.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
For instance, we're setting up clinics in Africa

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
where we're going to be giving

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
free antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatment

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
and free malaria treatment.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
But we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
so that people pay for some other aspects.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
CA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
or whatever, that this is really being -- it's almost driven by

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
some sort of desire again, you know, for the right image,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
What would you say to them?

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
RB: Well, I think that everybody --

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
people do things for a whole variety of different reasons

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
and I think that, you know, when I'm on me deathbed,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
I will want to feel that I've made a difference

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
to other people's lives.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
And that may be a selfish thing to think,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
but it's the way I've been brought up.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
I think if I'm in a position to

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
radically change other people's lives for the better,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
I should do so.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
CA: How old are you?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
RB: I'm 56.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand him

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
and I'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s, 40s people are driven by

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
and a search for legacy.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
I mean, it seems like you're still

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
a little bit in the growth phases,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
you're still doing these incredible new plans.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
How much do you think about legacy,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
and what would you like your legacy to be?

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
RB: I don't think I think too much about legacy.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
No, I just want to live life to its full.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
You know, if I can make a difference,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
I hope to be able to make a difference.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
And I think one of the positive things at the moment is

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
you've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
who are good friends.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
And, thank God, you've got two people

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
If they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
it would be very worrying.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
And I think it's important

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
that people in that kind of position do make a difference.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
CA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of --

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
well, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
So I would like to thank you for that inspiration,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
and for coming to TED today. Thank you.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Thank you so much.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.000
(Applause)
