00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.209
I dedicated the past two years
to understanding

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:17.574
how people achieve their dreams.

00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:19.575
When we think about the dreams we have,

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.108
and the dent we want to leave
in the universe,

00:00:22.132 --> 00:00:25.653
it is striking to see how big
of an overlap there is

00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:29.299
between the dreams that we have,
and projects that never happen.

00:00:29.323 --> 00:00:30.491
(Laughter)

00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:32.297
So I'm here to talk to you today

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:36.104
about five ways
how not to follow your dreams.

00:00:37.223 --> 00:00:41.525
One: Believe in overnight success.

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:43.261
You know the story, right?

00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:47.680
The tech guy built a mobile app
and sold it very fast for a lot of money.

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:52.624
You know, the story may seem real,
but I bet it's incomplete.

00:00:52.648 --> 00:00:54.701
If you go investigate further,

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:56.821
the guy has done 30 apps before

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.695
and he has done a master's
on the topic, a PhD.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.101
He has been working
on the topic for 20 years.

00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:05.143
This is really interesting.

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:10.772
I myself have a story in Brazil
that people think is an overnight success.

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:13.028
I come from a humble family,

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:16.523
and two weeks before
the deadline to apply for MIT,

00:01:16.547 --> 00:01:18.795
I started the application process.

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.851
And, voilÃ ! I got in.

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:24.535
People may think
it's an overnight success,

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:28.881
but that only worked
because for the 17 years prior to that,

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:31.126
I took life and education seriously.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.593
Your overnight success story
is always a result

00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:38.014
of everything you've done
in your life through that moment.

00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:42.441
Two: Believe someone else
has the answers for you.

00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:44.795
Constantly, people want
to help out, right?

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.164
All sorts of people: your family,
your friends, your business partners,

00:01:48.188 --> 00:01:51.407
they all have opinions
on which path you should take:

00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:53.673
"And let me tell you,
go through this pipe."

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:55.467
But whenever you go inside,

00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:58.220
there are other ways
you have to pick as well.

00:01:58.244 --> 00:02:00.923
And you need to make
those decisions yourself.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.642
No one else has the perfect
answers for your life.

00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:07.858
And you need to keep picking
those decisions, right?

00:02:07.882 --> 00:02:10.663
The pipes are infinite
and you're going to bump your head,

00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:12.547
and it's a part of the process.

00:02:13.806 --> 00:02:16.909
Three, and it's very subtle
but very important:

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.681
Decide to settle
when growth is guaranteed.

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:22.732
So when your life is going great,

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:25.067
you have put together a great team,

00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:28.453
and you have growing revenue,
and everything is set --

00:02:28.477 --> 00:02:29.772
time to settle.

00:02:30.478 --> 00:02:31.999
When I launched my first book,

00:02:32.023 --> 00:02:35.172
I worked really, really hard
to distribute it everywhere in Brazil.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.592
With that, over three million
people downloaded it,

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.308
over 50,000 people bought physical copies.

00:02:40.332 --> 00:02:43.807
When I wrote a sequel,
some impact was guaranteed.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.687
Even if I did little, sales would be OK.

00:02:48.204 --> 00:02:50.114
But OK is never OK.

00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:52.424
When you're growing towards a peak,

00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:55.832
you need to work harder than ever
and find yourself another peak.

00:02:56.546 --> 00:02:58.238
Maybe if I did little,

00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:00.462
a couple hundred thousand
people would read it,

00:03:00.486 --> 00:03:02.062
and that's great already.

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:04.231
But if I work harder than ever,

00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:06.753
I can bring this number up to millions.

00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:11.096
That's why I decided, with my new book,
to go to every single state of Brazil.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.025
And I can already see a higher peak.

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.769
There's no time to settle down.

00:03:15.238 --> 00:03:18.457
Fourth tip, and that's really important:

00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:20.985
Believe the fault is someone else's.

00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:24.133
I constantly see people saying,

00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:28.122
"Yes, I had this great idea,
but no investor had the vision to invest."

00:03:28.146 --> 00:03:29.900
"Oh, I created this great product,

00:03:29.924 --> 00:03:33.810
but the market is so bad,
the sales didn't go well."

00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:37.650
Or, "I can't find good talent;
my team is so below expectations."

00:03:38.683 --> 00:03:40.192
If you have dreams,

00:03:40.216 --> 00:03:42.753
it's your responsibility
to make them happen.

00:03:43.663 --> 00:03:46.196
Yes, it may be hard to find talent.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.297
Yes, the market may be bad.

00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:50.451
But if no one invested in your idea,

00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:52.344
if no one bought your product,

00:03:52.368 --> 00:03:55.356
for sure, there is something there
that is your fault.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.381
(Laughter)

00:03:57.405 --> 00:03:58.592
Definitely.

00:03:59.052 --> 00:04:01.926
You need to get your dreams
and make them happen.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.512
And no one achieved their goals alone.

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:09.286
But if you didn't make them happen,
it's your fault and no one else's.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.591
Be responsible for your dreams.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.250
And one last tip, and this one
is really important as well:

00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:22.868
Believe that the only things that matter
are the dreams themselves.

00:04:22.892 --> 00:04:26.102
Once I saw an ad,
and it was a lot of friends,

00:04:26.126 --> 00:04:29.094
they were going up a mountain,
it was a very high mountain,

00:04:29.118 --> 00:04:30.360
and it was a lot of work.

00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:33.378
You could see that they were sweating
and this was tough.

00:04:33.402 --> 00:04:36.754
And they were going up,
and they finally made it to the peak.

00:04:36.778 --> 00:04:38.845
Of course, they decided
to celebrate, right?

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:42.134
I'm going to celebrate, so,
"Yes! We made it, we're at the top!"

00:04:42.874 --> 00:04:45.484
Two seconds later,
one looks at the other and says,

00:04:45.508 --> 00:04:47.422
"OK, let's go down."

00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:48.706
(Laughter)

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.444
Life is never about the goals themselves.

00:04:51.468 --> 00:04:52.836
Life is about the journey.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.277
Yes, you should enjoy
the goals themselves,

00:04:56.301 --> 00:04:59.122
but people think that you have dreams,

00:04:59.146 --> 00:05:01.761
and whenever you get to reaching
one of those dreams,

00:05:01.785 --> 00:05:04.978
it's a magical place
where happiness will be all around.

00:05:05.851 --> 00:05:09.248
But achieving a dream
is a momentary sensation,

00:05:09.272 --> 00:05:10.629
and your life is not.

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:14.497
The only way to really achieve
all of your dreams

00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:17.800
is to fully enjoy every step
of your journey.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:19.614
That's the best way.

00:05:19.638 --> 00:05:22.014
And your journey is simple --
it's made of steps.

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:23.968
Some steps will be right on.

00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:25.561
Sometimes you will trip.

00:05:26.228 --> 00:05:30.825
If it's right on, celebrate, because
some people wait a lot to celebrate.

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.972
And if you tripped,
turn that into something to learn.

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:39.422
If every step becomes something
to learn or something to celebrate,

00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:41.494
you will for sure enjoy the journey.

00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:43.773
So, five tips:

00:05:43.797 --> 00:05:46.207
Believe in overnight success,

00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:48.633
believe someone else
has the answers for you,

00:05:48.657 --> 00:05:51.659
believe that when growth is guaranteed,
you should settle down,

00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:54.005
believe the fault is someone else's,

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.334
and believe that only
the goals themselves matter.

00:05:57.358 --> 00:06:00.362
Believe me, you do that,
and you will destroy your dreams.

00:06:00.386 --> 00:06:01.593
(Laughter)

00:06:01.617 --> 00:06:02.790
(Applause)

00:06:02.814 --> 00:06:03.989
Thank you.

00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:05.892
Thanks.

00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:09.992
(Applause)
