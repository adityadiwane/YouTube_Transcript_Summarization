00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:18.328
I'd like to tell you about two games of chess.

00:00:18.328 --> 00:00:22.192
The first happened in 1997, in which Garry Kasparov,

00:00:22.192 --> 00:00:25.908
a human, lost to Deep Blue, a machine.

00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:28.148
To many, this was the dawn of a new era,

00:00:28.148 --> 00:00:30.927
one where man would be dominated by machine.

00:00:30.927 --> 00:00:34.261
But here we are, 20 years on, and the greatest change

00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:36.951
in how we relate to computers is the iPad,

00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:38.996
not HAL.

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:41.644
The second game was a freestyle chess tournament

00:00:41.644 --> 00:00:44.613
in 2005, in which man and machine could enter together

00:00:44.613 --> 00:00:49.279
as partners, rather than adversaries, if they so chose.

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:51.130
At first, the results were predictable.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.627
Even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster

00:00:53.627 --> 00:00:55.939
with a relatively weak laptop.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:58.924
The surprise came at the end. Who won?

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.700
Not a grandmaster with a supercomputer,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.193
but actually two American amateurs

00:01:03.193 --> 00:01:07.015
using three relatively weak laptops.

00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:09.611
Their ability to coach and manipulate their computers

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:12.046
to deeply explore specific positions

00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:14.436
effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge

00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:17.045
of the grandmasters and the superior computational power

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:18.954
of other adversaries.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:21.859
This is an astonishing result: average men,

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.940
average machines beating the best man, the best machine.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.139
And anyways, isn't it supposed to be man versus machine?

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:33.291
Instead, it's about cooperation, and the right type of cooperation.

00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:36.148
We've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's

00:01:36.148 --> 00:01:39.390
vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.652
It's a sexy vision, for sure. Many have embraced it.

00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:44.405
It's become the dominant school of thought in computer science.

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:47.477
But as we enter the era of big data, of network systems,

00:01:47.477 --> 00:01:50.175
of open platforms, and embedded technology,

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:53.567
I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:56.637
that was actually developed around the same time.

00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:59.969
I'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider's human-computer symbiosis,

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.777
perhaps better termed "intelligence augmentation," I.A.

00:02:03.777 --> 00:02:06.417
Licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:09.423
effect on the development of technology and the Internet.

00:02:09.423 --> 00:02:12.291
His vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.881
in making decisions, controlling complex situations

00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:17.651
without the inflexible dependence

00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:20.184
on predetermined programs.

00:02:20.184 --> 00:02:22.682
Note that word "cooperate."

00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:25.429
Licklider encourages us not to take a toaster

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:27.713
and make it Data from "Star Trek,"

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:31.248
but to take a human and make her more capable.

00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:33.159
Humans are so amazing -- how we think,

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.777
our non-linear approaches, our creativity,

00:02:35.777 --> 00:02:37.908
iterative hypotheses, all very difficult if possible at all

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:39.253
for computers to do.

00:02:39.253 --> 00:02:41.705
Licklider intuitively realized this, contemplating humans

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:44.032
setting the goals, formulating the hypotheses,

00:02:44.032 --> 00:02:47.408
determining the criteria, and performing the evaluation.

00:02:47.408 --> 00:02:49.183
Of course, in other ways, humans are so limited.

00:02:49.183 --> 00:02:52.418
We're terrible at scale, computation and volume.

00:02:52.418 --> 00:02:54.254
We require high-end talent management

00:02:54.254 --> 00:02:56.318
to keep the rock band together and playing.

00:02:56.318 --> 00:02:58.522
Licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work

00:02:58.522 --> 00:03:01.798
that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making.

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:04.022
Silently, without much fanfare,

00:03:04.022 --> 00:03:07.376
this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess.

00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:10.732
Protein folding, a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess â€”

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:13.774
there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe.

00:03:13.774 --> 00:03:16.127
This is a world-changing problem with huge implications

00:03:16.127 --> 00:03:18.435
for our ability to understand and treat disease.

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:22.683
And for this task, supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough.

00:03:22.683 --> 00:03:25.067
Foldit, a game created by computer scientists,

00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:27.569
illustrates the value of the approach.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.610
Non-technical, non-biologist amateurs play a video game

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.683
in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein,

00:03:33.683 --> 00:03:35.182
allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:38.139
and interactions and identify structural issues.

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.162
This approach beat supercomputers 50 percent of the time

00:03:41.162 --> 00:03:43.746
and tied 30 percent of the time.

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:46.883
Foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery

00:03:46.883 --> 00:03:50.043
by deciphering the structure of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus.

00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:53.058
A protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years

00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:55.684
was solved was by three players in a matter of days,

00:03:55.684 --> 00:03:57.709
perhaps the first major scientific advance

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.032
to come from playing a video game.

00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:02.213
Last year, on the site of the Twin Towers,

00:04:02.213 --> 00:04:03.686
the 9/11 memorial opened.

00:04:03.686 --> 00:04:06.407
It displays the names of the thousands of victims

00:04:06.407 --> 00:04:09.470
using a beautiful concept called "meaningful adjacency."

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.636
It places the names next to each other based on their

00:04:11.636 --> 00:04:13.849
relationships to one another: friends, families, coworkers.

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.877
When you put it all together, it's quite a computational

00:04:16.877 --> 00:04:21.100
challenge: 3,500 victims, 1,800 adjacency requests,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.192
the importance of the overall physical specifications

00:04:24.192 --> 00:04:26.329
and the final aesthetics.

00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:28.944
When first reported by the media, full credit for such a feat

00:04:28.944 --> 00:04:30.836
was given to an algorithm from the New York City

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:34.837
design firm Local Projects. The truth is a bit more nuanced.

00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:37.708
While an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework,

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:40.716
humans used that framework to design the final result.

00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:42.941
So in this case, a computer had evaluated millions

00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:46.276
of possible layouts, managed a complex relational system,

00:04:46.276 --> 00:04:48.690
and kept track of a very large set of measurements

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.100
and variables, allowing the humans to focus

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.902
on design and compositional choices.

00:04:53.902 --> 00:04:54.938
So the more you look around you,

00:04:54.938 --> 00:04:56.900
the more you see Licklider's vision everywhere.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.204
Whether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car,

00:05:00.204 --> 00:05:03.174
human-computer symbiosis is making us more capable.

00:05:03.174 --> 00:05:04.829
So if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis,

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:06.258
what can you do?

00:05:06.258 --> 00:05:08.710
You can start by designing the human into the process.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.914
Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem,

00:05:10.914 --> 00:05:14.783
design the solution around what the human will do as well.

00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:16.720
When you do this, you'll quickly realize that you spent

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.599
all of your time on the interface between man and machine,

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.698
specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction.

00:05:22.698 --> 00:05:25.464
In fact, this friction is more important than the power

00:05:25.464 --> 00:05:27.516
of the man or the power of the machine

00:05:27.516 --> 00:05:29.447
in determining overall capability.

00:05:29.447 --> 00:05:31.424
That's why two amateurs with a few laptops

00:05:31.424 --> 00:05:33.880
handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.885
What Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction.

00:05:36.885 --> 00:05:39.286
The better the process, the less the friction.

00:05:39.286 --> 00:05:43.542
And minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable.

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.785
Or take another example: big data.

00:05:45.785 --> 00:05:47.691
Every interaction we have in the world is recorded

00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:50.750
by an ever growing array of sensors: your phone,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.123
your credit card, your computer. The result is big data,

00:05:53.123 --> 00:05:54.865
and it actually presents us with an opportunity

00:05:54.865 --> 00:05:57.527
to more deeply understand the human condition.

00:05:57.527 --> 00:05:59.832
The major emphasis of most approaches to big data

00:05:59.832 --> 00:06:02.047
focus on, "How do I store this data? How do I search

00:06:02.047 --> 00:06:04.323
this data? How do I process this data?"

00:06:04.323 --> 00:06:06.527
These are necessary but insufficient questions.

00:06:06.527 --> 00:06:08.998
The imperative is not to figure out how to compute,

00:06:08.998 --> 00:06:11.182
but what to compute. How do you impose human intuition

00:06:11.182 --> 00:06:12.973
on data at this scale?

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:16.472
Again, we start by designing the human into the process.

00:06:16.472 --> 00:06:19.284
When PayPal was first starting as a business, their biggest

00:06:19.284 --> 00:06:22.088
challenge was not, "How do I send money back and forth online?"

00:06:22.088 --> 00:06:25.960
It was, "How do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime?"

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.048
Why so challenging? Because while computers can learn

00:06:28.048 --> 00:06:31.192
to detect and identify fraud based on patterns,

00:06:31.192 --> 00:06:32.671
they can't learn to do that based on patterns

00:06:32.671 --> 00:06:34.787
they've never seen before, and organized crime

00:06:34.787 --> 00:06:37.496
has a lot in common with this audience: brilliant people,

00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:41.136
relentlessly resourceful, entrepreneurial spirit â€” (Laughter) â€”

00:06:41.136 --> 00:06:43.848
and one huge and important difference: purpose.

00:06:43.848 --> 00:06:46.680
And so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.933
fraudsters, catching the cleverest is the difference

00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:51.478
between success and failure.

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:53.699
There's a whole class of problems like this, ones with

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.274
adaptive adversaries. They rarely if ever present with a

00:06:56.274 --> 00:06:59.010
repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.003
Instead, there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption,

00:07:03.003 --> 00:07:05.738
and increasingly these problems are buried in big data.

00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:08.238
For example, terrorism. Terrorists are always adapting

00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:10.290
in minor and major ways to new circumstances, and despite

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.384
what you might see on TV, these adaptations,

00:07:13.384 --> 00:07:15.677
and the detection of them, are fundamentally human.

00:07:15.677 --> 00:07:18.794
Computers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors,

00:07:18.794 --> 00:07:22.029
but humans do. Humans, using technology, testing hypotheses,

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:26.649
searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them.

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:28.969
Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence.

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:31.522
He was caught by dedicated, resourceful, brilliant people

00:07:31.522 --> 00:07:35.791
in partnerships with various technologies.

00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:38.609
As appealing as it might sound, you cannot algorithmically

00:07:38.609 --> 00:07:40.210
data mine your way to the answer.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.065
There is no "Find Terrorist" button, and the more data

00:07:43.065 --> 00:07:45.367
we integrate from a vast variety of sources

00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:47.500
across a wide variety of data formats from very

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.809
disparate systems, the less effective data mining can be.

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:52.833
Instead, people will have to look at data

00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:56.289
and search for insight, and as Licklider foresaw long ago,

00:07:56.289 --> 00:07:58.974
the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation,

00:07:58.974 --> 00:08:00.498
and as Kasparov realized,

00:08:00.498 --> 00:08:03.529
that means minimizing friction at the interface.

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:06.287
Now this approach makes possible things like combing

00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:09.673
through all available data from very different sources,

00:08:09.673 --> 00:08:12.465
identifying key relationships and putting them in one place,

00:08:12.465 --> 00:08:15.393
something that's been nearly impossible to do before.

00:08:15.393 --> 00:08:17.335
To some, this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties

00:08:17.335 --> 00:08:20.745
implications. To others it foretells of an era of greater

00:08:20.745 --> 00:08:22.654
privacy and civil liberties protections,

00:08:22.654 --> 00:08:25.590
but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.783
That must be acknowledged, and they can't be swept aside,

00:08:27.783 --> 00:08:30.313
even with the best of intents.

00:08:30.313 --> 00:08:32.831
So let's explore, through a couple of examples, the impact

00:08:32.831 --> 00:08:35.237
that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis

00:08:35.237 --> 00:08:38.156
have had in recent time.

00:08:38.156 --> 00:08:41.572
In October, 2007, U.S. and coalition forces raided

00:08:41.572 --> 00:08:43.988
an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar

00:08:43.988 --> 00:08:45.922
on the Syrian border of Iraq.

00:08:45.922 --> 00:08:48.298
They found a treasure trove of documents:

00:08:48.298 --> 00:08:50.633
700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters.

00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:53.217
These foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf,

00:08:53.217 --> 00:08:56.363
the Levant and North Africa to join al Qaeda in Iraq.

00:08:56.363 --> 00:08:57.979
These records were human resource forms.

00:08:57.979 --> 00:09:00.834
The foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization.

00:09:00.834 --> 00:09:02.045
It turns out that al Qaeda, too,

00:09:02.045 --> 00:09:04.642
is not without its bureaucracy. (Laughter)

00:09:04.642 --> 00:09:06.740
They answered questions like, "Who recruited you?"

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.594
"What's your hometown?" "What occupation do you seek?"

00:09:09.594 --> 00:09:12.763
In that last question, a surprising insight was revealed.

00:09:12.763 --> 00:09:15.163
The vast majority of foreign fighters

00:09:15.163 --> 00:09:17.563
were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom --

00:09:17.563 --> 00:09:21.901
hugely important, since between 2003 and 2007, Iraq

00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:26.145
had 1,382 suicide bombings, a major source of instability.

00:09:26.145 --> 00:09:28.203
Analyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets

00:09:28.203 --> 00:09:30.945
of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.137
The friction in the process did not allow for meaningful

00:09:33.137 --> 00:09:36.487
results in an operational time frame using humans, PDFs

00:09:36.487 --> 00:09:38.705
and tenacity alone.

00:09:38.705 --> 00:09:40.658
The researchers had to lever up their human minds

00:09:40.658 --> 00:09:43.003
with technology to dive deeper, to explore non-obvious

00:09:43.003 --> 00:09:46.221
hypotheses, and in fact, insights emerged.

00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:48.865
Twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya,

00:09:48.865 --> 00:09:51.833
50 percent of those from a single town in Libya,

00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:54.283
hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at

00:09:54.283 --> 00:09:56.666
three percent. It also helped to hone in on a figure

00:09:56.666 --> 00:09:59.643
of rising importance in al Qaeda, Abu Yahya al-Libi,

00:09:59.643 --> 00:10:02.274
a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group.

00:10:02.274 --> 00:10:04.938
In March of 2007, he gave a speech, after which there was

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:08.404
a surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters.

00:10:08.404 --> 00:10:11.510
Perhaps most clever of all, though, and least obvious,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.583
by flipping the data on its head, the researchers were

00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:16.483
able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:19.000
that were ultimately responsible for receiving and

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.464
transporting the foreign fighters to the border.

00:10:21.464 --> 00:10:24.097
These were networks of mercenaries, not ideologues,

00:10:24.097 --> 00:10:26.495
who were in the coordination business for profit.

00:10:26.495 --> 00:10:28.399
For example, they charged Saudi foreign fighters

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.598
substantially more than Libyans, money that would have

00:10:30.598 --> 00:10:32.918
otherwise gone to al Qaeda.

00:10:32.918 --> 00:10:34.963
Perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network

00:10:34.963 --> 00:10:37.998
if they knew they cheating would-be jihadists.

00:10:37.998 --> 00:10:41.743
In January, 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti,

00:10:41.743 --> 00:10:44.659
third deadliest earthquake of all time, left one million people,

00:10:44.659 --> 00:10:47.243
10 percent of the population, homeless.

00:10:47.243 --> 00:10:50.380
One seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.556
became increasingly important as the delivery of food

00:10:52.556 --> 00:10:54.716
and water started rolling.

00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:56.174
January and February are the dry months in Haiti,

00:10:56.174 --> 00:10:59.116
yet many of the camps had developed standing water.

00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:01.238
The only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's

00:11:01.238 --> 00:11:02.535
floodplains had been leveled

00:11:02.535 --> 00:11:05.543
in the earthquake, leadership inside.

00:11:05.543 --> 00:11:08.118
So the question is, which camps are at risk,

00:11:08.118 --> 00:11:10.039
how many people are in these camps, what's the

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:12.350
timeline for flooding, and given very limited resources

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.734
and infrastructure, how do we prioritize the relocation?

00:11:15.734 --> 00:11:18.078
The data was incredibly disparate. The U.S. Army had

00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:21.007
detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country.

00:11:21.007 --> 00:11:23.518
There was data online from a 2006 environmental risk

00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:26.182
conference, other geospatial data, none of it integrated.

00:11:26.182 --> 00:11:29.140
The human goal here was to identify camps for relocation

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.535
based on priority need.

00:11:31.535 --> 00:11:33.975
The computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial

00:11:33.975 --> 00:11:36.559
information, social media data and relief organization

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:40.039
information to answer this question.

00:11:40.039 --> 00:11:42.454
By implementing a superior process, what was otherwise

00:11:42.454 --> 00:11:45.062
a task for 40 people over three months became

00:11:45.062 --> 00:11:48.238
a simple job for three people in 40 hours,

00:11:48.238 --> 00:11:50.866
all victories for human-computer symbiosis.

00:11:50.866 --> 00:11:52.920
We're more than 50 years into Licklider's vision

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.162
for the future, and the data suggests that we should be

00:11:55.162 --> 00:11:58.192
quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems,

00:11:58.192 --> 00:12:01.139
man and machine in cooperation together.

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:03.336
Thank you. (Applause)

00:12:03.336 --> 00:12:05.841
(Applause)
