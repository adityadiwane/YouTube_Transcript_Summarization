00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.096
Some of you have heard the story before,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.296
but, in fact, there's somebody
in the audience

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.176
who's never heard this story
in front of an audience before,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.936
so I'm a little more nervous
than I normally am telling this story.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.056
I used to be a photographer
for many years.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.936
In 1978, I was working for "TIME Magazine"

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.096
and I was given a three-day assignment
to photograph Amerasian children,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.456
children who had been fathered
by American GIs all over Southeast Asia,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.816
and then abandoned --
40,000 children all over Asia.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.920
I had never heard
the word Amerasian before.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.216
I spent a few days photographing
children in different countries,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.496
and like a lot of photographers
and a lot of journalists,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.976
I always hoped that
when my pictures are published,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.376
they might actually
have an effect on a situation,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.936
instead of just documenting it.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.216
So, I was so disturbed by what I saw

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.336
and I was so unhappy
with the article that ran afterwards,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.816
that I decided
I would take six months off.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.256
I was 28 years old.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.016
I decided I would find
six children in different countries,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.216
and actually go spend
some time with the kids,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.456
and try to tell their story
a little bit better

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.640
than I thought I had done
for Time magazine.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.096
In the course of doing the story,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.776
I was looking for children
who hadn't been photographed before,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.736
and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me
that they worked with a lot of Americans

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.176
who were donating money
to help some of these kids.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.456
And a man told me,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.136
who ran the Pearl Buck
Foundation in Korea,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.536
that there was a young girl,
who was 11 years old,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.136
being raised by her grandmother.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.856
And the grandmother
had never let any Westerners see her.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.936
Every time any Westerners
came to the village, she hid the girl.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.856
Of course, I was immediately intrigued.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.456
I saw photographs of her
and I thought I wanted to go.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.736
And the guy just told me,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.736
"This grandmother -- there's no way
she's ever going to let you

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.576
meet this girl that's she's raising."

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.096
I took a translator with me
and went to this village,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.096
found the grandmother, sat down with her.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.616
And to my astonishment, she agreed
to let me photograph her granddaughter.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.456
And I was paying for this myself,
so I asked the translator

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.496
if it would be OK
if I stayed for the week.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.136
I had a sleeping bag.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.856
The family had a small shed
on the side of the house,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.056
so I said, "Could I sleep
in my sleeping bag in the evenings?"

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.016
And I just told the little girl,
whose name was Eun-Sook Lee,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.256
that if I ever did anything
to embarrass her --

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.696
she didn't speak a word of English,
although she looked very American --

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.296
she could put up her hand and say, "Stop,"
and I would stop taking pictures.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.136
Then my translator left.
I couldn't speak a word of Korean.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.096
This is the first night I met Eun-Sook.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.456
Her mother was still alive.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.176
She was not raising her,
her grandmother was raising her.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.496
And what struck me immediately

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.976
was how in love
the two of these people were.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.216
The grandmother was incredibly fond,
deeply in love with this little girl.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.856
They slept on the floor at night.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.336
The way they heat their homes in Korea
is to put bricks under the floors,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.576
so the heat radiates
from underneath the floor.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.936
Eun-Sook was 11 years old.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.376
I had photographed,
as I said, a lot of these kids.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.376
Eun-Sook was the fifth child
that I found to photograph.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.936
And almost universally,
amongst all the kids,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.656
they were really psychologically damaged

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.496
by having been made fun of,
ridiculed, picked on and been rejected.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.296
And Korea was probably the place
I found to be the worst for these kids.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.496
And what struck me immediately
in meeting Eun-Sook

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.336
was how confident she appeared to be,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.576
how happy she seemed to be
in her own skin.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.856
And remember this picture,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.336
because I'm going to show you
another picture later.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.536
She looks much like her grandmother,
although she looks so Western.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.216
I decided to follow her to school.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.336
This is the first morning
I stayed with her.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.776
This is on the way to school.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.240
This is the morning assembly
outside her school.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.496
And I noticed that
she was clowning around.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.376
When the teachers would ask questions,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.816
she'd be the first person
to raise her hand.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.776
Again, not at all shy or withdrawn,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.536
or anything like the other children
that I'd photographed.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.296
The first one to go
to the blackboard to answer questions.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.256
Getting in trouble for whispering
into her best friend's ears.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.456
And one of the other things
I said to her through the translator --

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.056
again, this thing about saying stop --
was to not pay attention to me.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.896
So she really just completely
ignored me most of the time.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.136
I noticed that at recess,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.976
she was the girl who picked
the other girls to be on her team.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.976
It was very obvious, from the beginning,
that she was a leader.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.136
This is on the way home.
And that's North Korea up along the hill.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.376
This is up along the DMZ.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.776
They would actually
cover the windows every night,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.336
so that light couldn't be seen,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.896
because the South Korean government
has said for years

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.095
that the North Koreans
may invade at any time.

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:41.416
So the closer you were to North Korea,
the more terrifying it was.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.736
Very often at school,
I'd be taking pictures,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.096
and she would whisper
into her girlfriends' ears,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.936
and then look at me and say, "Stop."

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.016
And I would stand at attention,
and all the girls would crack up,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.656
and it was sort of a little joke.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.056
(Laughter)

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.576
The end of the week came
and my translator came back,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.296
because I'd asked her to come back,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.056
so I could formally thank
the grandmother and Eun-Sook.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.336
And in the course of the grandmother
talking to the translator,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.056
the grandmother started crying.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.216
And I said to my translator,
"What's going on, why is she crying?"

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.416
And she spoke to
the grandmother for a moment,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.656
and then she started
getting tears in her eyes.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.136
And I said, "What did I do?
Why is everyone crying?"

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.376
And the translator said,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.216
"The grandmother says
that she thinks she's dying,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.880
and she wants to know if you would take
Eun-Sook to America with you."

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.056
And I said, "I'm 28 years old
and I live in hotels,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.896
and I'm not married."

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.136
I mean, I had fallen in love
with this girl,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.096
but you know, emotionally
I was about 12 years old.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.696
If you know of photographers,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.136
the joke is it's the finest form
of delayed adolescence ever invented.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.776
"Sorry, I have to go
on an assignment, I'll be back" --

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.216
and then you never come back.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.536
So I asked the translator
why she thought she was dying.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.456
Can I get her to a hospital?
Could I pay to get her a doctor?

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.496
And she refused any help at all.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.680
So when I got outside,
I gave the translator some money and said,

00:06:00.704 --> 00:06:02.800
"Go back and see if you can do something."

00:06:02.824 --> 00:06:04.896
And I gave the grandmother
my business card.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.176
And I said, "If you're serious,
I will try to find a family for her."

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.616
And I immediately wrote a letter
to my best friends in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.976
who had an 11-year-old son.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.456
And my best friend
had mistakenly one day said something

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.976
about wishing he had another child.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.056
So my friends Gene and Gayle
had not heard from me in about a year,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.496
and suddenly I was calling,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.776
saying "I'm in Korea
and I've met this extraordinary girl."

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.496
And I said, "The grandmother
thinks she's sick,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.016
but I think maybe we would have to
bring the grandmother over also."

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.696
And I said, "I'll pay for the ... "
I mean, I had this whole sort of picture.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.976
So anyway, I left.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.496
And my friends actually said
they were very interested in adopting her.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.496
And I said, "Look, I think
I'll scare the grandmother to death,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.096
if I tell her that
you're willing to adopt her.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.136
I want to go back and talk to her."
But I was off on assignment.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.256
I figured I'd come back
in a couple of weeks

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.656
and talk to the grandmother.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.896
And on Christmas Day, I was in Bangkok
with a group of photographers

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.856
and got a telegram --
back in those days, you got telegrams --

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.296
from Time magazine
saying someone in Korea had died

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.576
and left their child in a will to me.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.136
Did I know anything about this?

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.256
Because I hadn't told them
what I was doing,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.816
because I was so upset
with the story they'd run.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.216
So, I went back to Korea,
and I went back to Eun-Sook's village,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.456
and she was gone.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.176
And the house that
I had spent time in was empty.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.816
It was incredibly cold.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.456
No one in the village
would tell me where Eun-Sook was,

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.416
because the grandmother
had always hidden her from Westerners.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.376
And they had no idea
about this request that she'd made of me.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.216
So I finally found Myung Sung,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.376
her best friend that she used to play with
after school every day.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.376
And Myung Sung, under some pressure
from me and the translator,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.776
gave us an address
on the outside of Seoul.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.416
And I went to that address
and knocked on the door,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.816
and a man answered the door.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.736
It was not a very nice area of Seoul,
there were mud streets outside of it.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.456
And I knocked on the door
and Eun-Sook answered the door,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.256
and her eyes were bloodshot,
and she seemed to be in shock.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.256
She didn't recognize me --
there was no recognition whatsoever.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.536
And this man came to the door
and kind of barked something in Korean.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.816
And I said to the translator,
"What did he say?"

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.976
And she said, "He wants
to know who you are."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.256
And I said, "Tell him
that I am a photographer."

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.696
I started explaining who I was,
and he interrupted.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.696
And she said, "He says he knows
who you are, what do you want?"

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.176
I said, "Well, tell him that I was asked
by this little girl's grandmother

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.136
to find a family for her."

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.400
And he said, "I'm her uncle,
she's fine, you can leave now."

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.520
So I was --

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.536
The door was being slammed in my face,

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.736
it's incredibly cold,
and I'm trying to think,

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.416
"What would the hero do in a movie,
if I was writing this as a movie script?"

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.096
So I said, "It's really cold,
I've come a very long way,

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.616
do you mind if I come in
for a minute? I'm freezing."

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.576
So the guy reluctantly let us in
and we sat down on the floor.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.055
And as we started talking,
I saw him yell something,

00:08:49.079 --> 00:08:51.856
and Eun-Sook came
and brought us some food.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.216
And I had this whole mental picture
of -- sort of like Cinderella.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.736
I sort of had this picture
of this incredibly wonderful,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.736
bright, happy little child,

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.736
who now appeared to be very withdrawn,
being enslaved by this family.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.816
And I was really appalled,
and I couldn't figure out what to do.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.136
And the more I tried talking to him,
the less friendly he was getting.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.176
So finally I said "Look," --
this is all through the translator,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.656
because, you know,
I don't speak a word of Korean --

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.976
and I said, "Look, I'm really glad
that Eun-Sook has a family to live with.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.416
I was very worried about her.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.096
I made a promise to her grandmother,
your mother, that I would find a family,

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.736
and I'm so happy that
you're going to take care of her.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.656
But I bought an airline ticket
and I'm stuck here for a week.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.256
I'm staying in a hotel downtown.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.496
Would you like to come
and have lunch tomorrow?

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.216
And you can practice your English."

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.536
Because he told me -- I was trying
to ask him questions about himself.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.656
And so I went to the hotel,
and I found two older Amerasians.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:50.136
A girl whose mother had been a prostitute,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.016
and she was a prostitute,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.976
and a boy who'd been in and out of jail.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.296
And I said to them,
"Look, there's a little girl

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.456
who has a tiny chance
of getting out of here

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.736
and going to America.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.096
I don't know if it's
the right decision or not,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.296
but I would like you
to come to lunch tomorrow

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.056
and tell the uncle what it's like
to walk down the street,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.656
what people say to you,
what you do for a living.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.696
I want him to understand
what happens if she stays here.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.136
And I could be wrong, I don't know,
but I wish you would come tomorrow."

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.976
So, these two came to lunch
and we got thrown out of the restaurant.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.456
They were yelling at him,
it got to be really ugly.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.433
We went outside, and he was just furious.

00:10:26.457 --> 00:10:28.496
And I knew I had totally blown this thing.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.896
Here I was again,
trying to figure out what to do.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.736
And he started yelling at me,
and I said to the translator,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.776
"Tell him to calm down,
what is he saying?"

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.216
And she said, "He's saying, 'Who the hell
are you to walk into my house,

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.776
some rich American
with your cameras around your neck,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.496
accusing me of enslaving my niece?

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.822
This is my niece, I love her,
she's my sister's daughter.

00:10:47.846 --> 00:10:52.256
Who the hell are you
to accuse me of something like this?'"

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.136
And I said, you know,
"Look, you're absolutely right.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.576
I don't pretend to understand
what's going on here.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.576
All I know is, I've been
photographing a lot of these children.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.536
I'm in love with your niece,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.896
I think she's an incredibly
special child."

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.376
And I said, "Look, I will fly my friends
over here from the United States

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.056
if you want to meet them,
to see if you approve of them.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.696
I just think that --
what little I know about the situation,

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.456
she has very little chance here
of having the kind of life

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.496
that you probably would like her to have."

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.016
So, everyone told me afterwards
that inviting the prospective parents over

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.816
was, again, the stupidest thing
I could have possibly done,

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.176
because who's ever
good enough for your relative?

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.296
But he invited me to come to a ceremony
they were having that day

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.696
for her grandmother.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.416
And they actually take
items of clothing and photographs,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.400
and they burn them as part of the ritual.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.096
And you can see how different she looks
just in three months.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.536
This was now, I think, early February.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.840
And the pictures before
were taken in September.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.296
Well, there was
an American Maryknoll priest

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.576
that I had met in the course
of doing the story,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.536
who had 75 children living in his house.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.176
He had three women helping him
take care of these kids.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.456
And so I suggested to the uncle
that we go down and meet Father Keane

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.576
to find out how
the adoption process worked.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.976
Because I wanted him to feel

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.416
like this was all being done
very much above board.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.800
So, this is on the way
down to the orphanage.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.400
This is Father Keane.
He's just a wonderful guy.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.496
He had kids from
all over Korea living there,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.520
and he would find families for these kids.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.056
This is a social worker
interviewing Eun-Sook.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.496
Now, I had always thought she was
completely untouched by all of this,

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.016
because the grandmother, to me,

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.616
appeared to be sort of
the village wise woman --

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.136
throughout the day, I noticed people
kept coming to visit her grandmother.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.896
And I always had this mental picture

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.616
that even though they may have been
one of the poorer families in the village,

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.376
they were one of the most respected.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.976
And I always felt that the grandmother
had kind of demanded, and insisted,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.440
that the villagers treat Eun-Sook
with the same respect they treated her.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.496
Eun-Sook stayed at Father Keane's,

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.096
and her uncle agreed to let her stay there
until the adoption went through.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.976
He actually agreed to the adoption.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.656
And I went off on assignment
and came back a week later,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.696
and Father Keane said,
"I've got to talk to you about Eun-Sook."

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.056
I said, "Oh God, now what?"

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.776
And he takes me into this room,
closes the door and says,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.936
"I have 75 children here in the orphanage,
and it's total bedlam."

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.416
There's clothes, there's kids.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.776
Three adults and 75 kids --
you can imagine.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.656
And he said, "The second day
she was here she made up a list

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.656
of all of the names
of the older kids and the younger kids.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.216
And she assigned one of the older kids
to each of the younger kids.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.816
And then she set up a work detail list
of who cleaned the orphanage on what day."

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.976
And he said, "She's telling me
that I'm messy

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.576
and I have to clean up my room."

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.176
And he said, "I don't know who raised her,
but she's running the orphanage,

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.776
and she's been here three days."

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.256
(Laughter)

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.320
This was movie day that she organized
where all the kids went to the movies.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.576
A lot of the kids who had been adopted
wrote back to the other kids,

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.536
telling them what their life
was like with their new families.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.176
So it was a really big deal
when the letters showed up.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.656
This is a woman who is
now working at the orphanage,

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.966
whose son had been adopted.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.136
Gene and Gayle started studying Korean

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.176
the moment they had gotten
my first letter.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.696
They really wanted to be able
to welcome Eun-Sook into their family.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.776
And one of the things Father Keane told me

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.816
when I came back
from one of these trips --

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.736
Eun-Sook had chosen the name Natasha,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.016
which I understood was from her watching
a "Rocky and Bullwinkle" cartoon

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.976
on the American Air Force station.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.056
This may be one
of those myth-buster things

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.256
that we'll have to
clear up here, in a minute.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.576
So, my friend Gene
flew over with his son, Tim.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.136
Gayle couldn't come.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.776
And they spent a lot of time
huddled over a dictionary.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.496
And this was Gene showing the uncle

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.640
where Atlanta was on the map,
where he lived.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.120
This is the uncle
signing the adoption papers.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.416
Now, we went out to dinner
that night to celebrate.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.056
The uncle went back to his family

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.536
and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I
went out to dinner.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.416
And Gene was showing Natasha
how to use a knife and fork,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.160
and then Natasha
was returning the utensil lessons.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.016
We went back to our hotel room,

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.496
and Gene was showing Natasha
also where Atlanta was.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.496
This is the third night we were in Korea.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.576
The first night we'd gotten a room
for the kids right next to us.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.216
I'd been staying in this room
for about three months --

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.160
it was a little 15-story Korean hotel.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.136
The second night,
we didn't keep the kids' room,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.256
because we slept on the floor
with all the kids at the orphanage.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.016
And the third night, we came back --

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.816
we'd just gone out to dinner,
where you saw the pictures --

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.056
and we got to the front desk,
and the guy said,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.496
"There's no other free rooms
on your floor tonight,

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.616
you can put the kids
five floors below you."

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.776
And Gene and I
looked at each other and said,

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.176
"We don't want two 11-year-olds
five floors away."

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.336
So his son said, "I have a sleeping bag,
I'll sleep on the floor."

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.296
And I said, "I have one too."
So Tim and I slept on the floor,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.096
Natasha got one bed,
Gene got the other -- kids pass out,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.016
it's been very exciting for three days.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.536
We're lying in bed, and Gene and I
are talking about how cool we are.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.536
We said, "That was so great,
we saved this little girl's life."

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.016
We were just like,
you know, just full of ourselves.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.376
And we fall asleep --

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.976
and I've been in this room
for a couple of months now.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.856
And they always overheat
the hotels in Korea terribly,

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.176
so during the day
I always left the window open.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.096
And then about midnight,
they turn the heat off in the hotel.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.416
So at 1am, the whole room would be
like 20 below zero, and I'd get up.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.656
I'd been doing this
every night I'd been there.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.176
So, sure enough,
it's one o'clock, room's freezing,

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.896
I go to close the window
and I hear people shouting outside,

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.540
and I thought, "Oh, the bars
must have just gotten out."

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:23.976
I don't speak Korean,
but I'm hearing these voices,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.480
and I'm not hearing anger,
I'm hearing terror.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.336
So I open the window and I look out,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.096
and there's flames
coming up the side of our hotel,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.816
and the hotel's on fire.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.776
So I run over to Gene and I wake him up,

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.576
and I say, "Don't freak out,
I think the hotel's on fire."

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.296
And now there's smoke and flames
coming by our windows --

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.576
we're on the 11th floor.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.256
So the two of us were just like,
"Oh my God, oh my God."

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.656
So we're trying to get Natasha up,
and we can't talk to her.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.976
You know what kids are like
when they've been asleep for like an hour,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.976
it's like they took five Valiums --
they're all over the place.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.216
And we can't talk to her.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.656
His son had the L.L.Bean bootlaces,
and we're trying to do up his laces.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.856
So we try to get to the door,
we run to the door, we open the door,

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.936
and it's like walking
into a blast furnace.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.336
There's people screaming,
the sound of glass breaking, weird thumps.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.176
And the whole room filled
with smoke in about two seconds.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.096
And Gene turns around and says,
"We're not going to make it."

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.336
And he closes the door, and the whole room
is now filled with smoke.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.096
We're all choking, and there's smoke

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.136
pouring through the vents,
under the doors.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.416
There's people screaming.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.056
I just remember this unbelievable --
just utter chaos.

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.576
I remember sitting near the bed,
and I had two overwhelming feelings.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.896
One was absolute terror.
"Oh, please God, I just want to wake up.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.576
This has got to be a nightmare,
this can't be happening.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.176
Please, I just want to wake up."

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.936
And the other is unbelievable guilt.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.336
Here I've been playing God
with my friends' lives,

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.176
my friends' son, with Natasha's life,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.496
and this what you get when you try
playing God, is you hurt people.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.896
I remember just being
so frightened and terrified.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.896
And Gene, who's lying on the floor, says,

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.976
"We've got to soak towels."
I said, "What?"

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.936
"We've got to soak towels.
We're going to die from the smoke."

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.865
So got towels and put them
over our faces and the kids' faces.

00:17:57.889 --> 00:17:59.936
Then he said, "Do you have gaffer's tape?"

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.696
"What?" "Do you have gaffer's tape?"

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.576
I said, "Somewhere in my Halliburton."

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.458
He says, "We've got to stop the smoke.
That's all we can do."

00:18:06.482 --> 00:18:08.322
I mean, Gene -- thank God for Gene.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.816
So we put the room service menus
over the vents in the wall,

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.896
we put blankets at the bottom of the door,

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.616
we put the kids on the windowsill
to try to get some air.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.536
And there was a new building, going up,

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.416
that was being built
right across the street from our hotel.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.631
And there, in the building,
were photographers,

00:18:25.655 --> 00:18:27.456
waiting for people to jump.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.576
Eleven people ended up dying in the fire.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.656
Five people jumped and died,
other people were killed by the smoke.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.656
And there's this loud thumping on the door
after about 45 minutes in all this,

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.376
and people were shouting in Korean.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.640
And I remember --

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.776
Natasha didn't want us opening the door --

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.776
sorry, I was trying not to open the door,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.296
because we'd spent so much time
barricading the room.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.016
I didn't know who it was,
I didn't know what they wanted,

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.976
and Natasha could tell
they were firemen trying to get us out.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.336
I remember a sort of a tussle at the door,
trying to get the door open.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.776
In any case, 12 hours later --
I mean, they put us in the lobby.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.416
Gene ended up using his coat,
and his fist in the coat,

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.976
to break open a liquor cabinet.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.536
People were lying on the floor.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.736
It was one of just
the most horrifying nights.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.496
And then 12 hours later,
we rented a car, as we had planned to,

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.496
and drove back to Natasha's village.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.656
And we kept saying, "Do you realize
we were dying in a hotel fire,

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.896
like eight hours ago?"

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.656
It's so weird how life just goes on.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.096
Natasha wanted to introduce her brother
and father to all the villagers,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.456
and the day we showed up turned out
to be a 60-year-old man's birthday.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.696
This guy's 60 years old.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.496
So it turned into a dual celebration,

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.056
because Natasha was
the first person from this village

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.656
ever to go to the United States.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.376
So, these are the greenhouse tents.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.576
This is the elders
teaching Gene their dances.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.976
We drank a lot of rice wine.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.320
We were both so drunk,
I couldn't believe it.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.896
This is the last picture
before Gene and Tim headed back.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.576
The adoption people told us

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.640
it was going to take a year
for the adoption to go through.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.096
Like, what could you do for a year?

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.856
So I found out the name of every official
on both the Korean and American side,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.136
and I photographed them,

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.496
and told them how famous they were
going to be when this book was done.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.376
And four months later,
the adoption papers came through.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.576
This is saying goodbye
to everybody at the orphanage.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.520
This is Father Keane with Natasha
at the bus stop.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.696
Her great aunt at the airport.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.136
I had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific
airlines for many years,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.176
where they gave me free passes
on all their airlines

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.496
in return for photography.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.296
It was like the ultimate perk.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.216
And the pilot, I actually knew --

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.576
because they used to let me sit
in the jump seat,

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.256
to tell you how long ago this was.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.736
This is a TriStar, and so they let Natasha
actually sit in the jump seat.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.936
And the pilot, Jeff Cowley,
actually went back

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.056
and adopted one of the other kids
at the orphanage after meeting Natasha.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.136
This is 28 hours later in Atlanta.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.576
It's a very long flight.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.936
Just to make things even crazier,
Gayle, Natasha's new mom,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.680
was three days away
from giving birth to her own daughter.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.096
You know, if you were
writing this, you'd say,

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.376
"No, we've got to write
the script differently."

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.096
This is the first night showing Natasha
her new cousins and uncles and aunts.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.176
Gene and Gayle know everyone in Atlanta --
they're the most social couple imaginable.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.117
So, at this point, Natasha
doesn't speak a word of English,

00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:16.341
other than what little
Father Keane taught her.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.680
This is Kylie, her sister,
who's now a doctor, on the right.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.016
This is a deal I had with Natasha,
which is that when we got to Atlanta

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.200
she could cut off my beard.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.120
She never liked it very much.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.376
She learned English in three months.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.600
She entered seventh grade
at her own age level.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.296
Pledge of Allegiance for the first time.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.696
This is her cooking teacher.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.536
Natasha told me a lot of the kids
thought she was stuck up,

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.176
because they would talk to her
and she wouldn't answer,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.976
and they didn't realize
she didn't speak English very well.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.976
But what I noticed, again as an observer,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.480
was she was choosing
who was going to be on her team,

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.176
and seemed to be very popular
very, very quickly.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.496
Now, remember the picture,

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.296
how much she looked like
her grandmother, at the beginning?

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.976
People were always telling Natasha
how much she looks like her mother, Gayle.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.240
(Laughter)

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.760
This is a tense moment
in the first football game, I think.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.560
And Kylie -- I mean, it was
almost like Kylie was her own child.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.560
She's being baptized.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.896
Now, a lot of parents, when they adopt,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.176
actually want to erase
their children's history.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.336
And Gayle and Gene
did the complete opposite.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.936
They were studying Korean;
they bought Korean clothes.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.216
Gene even did a little
tile work in the kitchen,

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.136
which was that, "Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful girl

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.589
that came from the hills of Korea
to live happily ever after in Atlanta."

00:22:46.613 --> 00:22:48.829
She hates this picture --
it was her first job.

00:22:48.853 --> 00:22:51.256
She bought a bright red Karmann Ghia

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.656
with the money she made
working at Burger King.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.400
The captain of the cheerleaders.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.200
Beauty pageant.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.936
Used to do their
Christmas card every year.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.560
Gene's been restoring this car
for a million years.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.296
Kodak hired Natasha to be a translator
for them at the Olympics in Korea.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:16.216
Her future husband, Jeff,
was working for Canon cameras,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.200
and met Natasha at the Olympic Village.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.560
This is her first trip back to Korea.
So there's her uncle.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.360
This is her half sister.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.136
She went back to the village.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.720
That's her best friend's mother.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.296
And I always thought that was
a very Annie Hall kind of outfit.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.560
(Laughter)

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.376
It's just, you know, it was
just so interesting, just to watch --

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.440
this is her mother
in the background there.

00:23:47.367 --> 00:23:49.167
This is Natasha's wedding day.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.680
Gene is looking a little older.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.280
This is Sydney, who's going to be
three years old in a couple of days.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.520
And there's Evan.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.416
And Natasha, would you
just come up, for a second,

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.256
just maybe to say hello to everybody?

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:24.800
(Applause)

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.016
Natasha's actually
never heard me tell the story.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.296
You know, we've looked
at the pictures together.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.496
Natasha: I've seen pictures
millions of times,

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.360
but today was the first time I'm actually
seeing him give the whole presentation.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.056
I started crying.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.936
Rick Smolan: There's about 40 things
she's going to tell me,

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.296
"That wasn't what happened."
Natasha: I'll tell you that later.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.216
RS: Anyway, thank you, Mike and Richard,
so much for letting us tell the story.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.496
Thank you, all of you.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.000
(Applause)
