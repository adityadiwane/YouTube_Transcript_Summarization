00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:18.150
I think I'll start out
and just talk a little bit

00:00:18.174 --> 00:00:19.665
about what exactly autism is.

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.324
Autism is a very big continuum

00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:25.522
that goes from very severe --
the child remains nonverbal --

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:28.236
all the way up to brilliant
scientists and engineers.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.237
And I actually feel at home here,

00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:32.807
because there's a lot
of autism genetics here.

00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:33.863
(Laughter)

00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:35.045
You wouldn't have any --

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:38.038
(Applause)

00:00:38.062 --> 00:00:40.098
It's a continuum of traits.

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:45.779
When does a nerd turn into Asperger,
which is just mild autism?

00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:50.961
I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla
would all be probably diagnosed

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:52.877
as autistic spectrum today.

00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:56.192
And one of the things
that is really going to concern me

00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:58.451
is getting these kids to be the ones

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.297
that are going to invent
the next energy things

00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:03.571
that Bill Gates talked about this morning.

00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:07.971
OK, now, if you want
to understand autism: animals.

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:10.885
I want to talk to you now
about different ways of thinking.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.759
You have to get away from verbal language.

00:01:13.783 --> 00:01:17.384
I think in pictures.
I don't think in language.

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:23.352
Now, the thing about the autistic mind
is it attends to details.

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:26.431
This is a test where you either
have to pick out the big letters

00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:27.678
or the little letters,

00:01:27.702 --> 00:01:31.595
and the autistic mind picks out
the little letters more quickly.

00:01:31.947 --> 00:01:35.698
And the thing is, the normal brain
ignores the details.

00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:38.732
Well, if you're building a bridge,
details are pretty important

00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:41.154
because it'll fall down
if you ignore the details.

00:01:41.178 --> 00:01:44.045
And one of my big concerns
with a lot of policy things today

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.747
is things are getting too abstract.

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:48.998
People are getting away
from doing hands-on stuff.

00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:51.182
I'm really concerned
that a lot of the schools

00:01:51.206 --> 00:01:55.174
have taken out the hands-on classes,
because art, and classes like that --

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:57.511
those are the classes where I excelled.

00:01:57.535 --> 00:01:59.689
In my work with cattle,

00:01:59.713 --> 00:02:02.691
I noticed a lot of little things
that most people don't notice

00:02:02.715 --> 00:02:04.003
would make the cattle balk.

00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:07.574
For example, this flag waving
right in front of the veterinary facility.

00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:10.925
This feed yard was going to tear down
their whole veterinary facility;

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.863
all they needed to do was move the flag.

00:02:12.887 --> 00:02:14.955
Rapid movement, contrast.

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.013
In the early '70s when I started,
I got right down in the chutes

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:19.536
to see what cattle were seeing.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.022
People thought that was crazy.

00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:24.328
A coat on a fence would make them balk,
shadows would make them balk,

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:27.416
a hose on the floor --
people weren't noticing these things.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.956
A chain hanging down ...

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.236
And that's shown
very, very nicely in the movie.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.715
In fact, I loved the movie,
how they duplicated all my projects.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.080
That's the geek side.

00:02:36.104 --> 00:02:38.524
My drawings got to star in the movie, too.

00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:40.658
And, actually, it's called
"Temple Grandin,"

00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:42.006
not "Thinking in Pictures."

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.595
So what is thinking in pictures?

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:46.298
It's literally movies in your head.

00:02:46.322 --> 00:02:49.204
My mind works like Google for images.

00:02:49.228 --> 00:02:52.272
When I was a young kid,
I didn't know my thinking was different.

00:02:52.296 --> 00:02:54.215
I thought everybody thought in pictures.

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.494
Then when I did my book,
"Thinking in Pictures,"

00:02:56.518 --> 00:02:58.930
I started interviewing people
about how they think.

00:02:58.954 --> 00:03:02.109
And I was shocked to find out
that my thinking was quite different.

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.309
Like if I say, "Think
about a church steeple,"

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:06.846
most people get this sort
of generalized generic one.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.782
Now, maybe that's not true in this room,

00:03:08.806 --> 00:03:12.072
but it's going to be true
in a lot of different places.

00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:14.599
I see only specific pictures.

00:03:14.623 --> 00:03:18.432
They flash up into my memory,
just like Google for pictures.

00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:20.999
And in the movie,
they've got a great scene in there,

00:03:21.023 --> 00:03:24.823
where the word "shoe" is said,
and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes

00:03:24.847 --> 00:03:26.513
pop into my imagination.

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:29.419
OK, there's my childhood church;
that's specific.

00:03:29.807 --> 00:03:31.675
There's some more, Fort Collins.

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.746
OK, how about famous ones?

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.447
And they just kind of come up,
kind of like this.

00:03:36.471 --> 00:03:39.382
Just really quickly,
like Google for pictures.

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:40.965
And they come up one at a time,

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.940
and then I think, "OK, well,
maybe we can have it snow,

00:03:43.964 --> 00:03:45.588
or we can have a thunderstorm,"

00:03:45.612 --> 00:03:48.236
and I can hold it there
and turn them into videos.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.473
Now, visual thinking
was a tremendous asset

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:54.299
in my work designing
cattle-handling facilities.

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.999
And I've worked really hard
on improving how cattle are treated

00:03:58.023 --> 00:03:59.175
at the slaughter plant.

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.695
I'm not going to go
into any gucky slaughter slides.

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.607
I've got that stuff up on YouTube,
if you want to look at it.

00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:05.672
(Laughter)

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:08.589
But one of the things
that I was able to do in my design work

00:04:08.613 --> 00:04:11.236
is I could test-run a piece
of equipment in my mind,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.692
just like a virtual reality
computer system.

00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:18.349
And this is an aerial view
of a recreation of one of my projects

00:04:18.373 --> 00:04:19.735
that was used in the movie.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.770
That was like just so super cool.

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:25.272
And there were a lot of, kind of,
Asperger types and autism types

00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:27.244
working out there on the movie set, too.

00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:28.444
(Laughter)

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:31.259
But one of the things
that really worries me is:

00:04:31.283 --> 00:04:34.287
Where's the younger version
of those kids going today?

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.275
They're not ending up in Silicon Valley,

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:38.539
where they belong.

00:04:38.563 --> 00:04:40.383
(Laughter)

00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:45.315
(Applause)

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:48.920
One of the things I learned very early on
because I wasn't that social,

00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:52.355
is I had to sell my work, and not myself.

00:04:52.706 --> 00:04:55.666
And the way I sold livestock jobs
is I showed off my drawings,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.422
I showed off pictures of things.

00:04:57.446 --> 00:04:59.685
Another thing that helped me
as a little kid

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:01.938
is, boy, in the '50s,
you were taught manners.

00:05:01.962 --> 00:05:05.001
You were taught you can't pull
the merchandise off the shelves

00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:06.659
in the store and throw it around.

00:05:06.683 --> 00:05:08.835
When kids get to be
in third or fourth grade,

00:05:08.859 --> 00:05:11.687
you might see that this kid's going
to be a visual thinker,

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:12.976
drawing in perspective.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.198
Now, I want to emphasize

00:05:14.222 --> 00:05:17.145
that not every autistic kid
is going to be a visual thinker.

00:05:17.712 --> 00:05:21.690
Now, I had this brain scan
done several years ago,

00:05:21.714 --> 00:05:25.647
and I used to joke around about having
a gigantic Internet trunk line

00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:27.598
going deep into my visual cortex.

00:05:27.622 --> 00:05:29.497
This is tensor imaging.

00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:33.373
And my great big Internet trunk line
is twice as big as the control's.

00:05:33.397 --> 00:05:35.001
The red lines there are me,

00:05:35.025 --> 00:05:38.934
and the blue lines are the sex
and age-matched control.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.872
And there I got a gigantic one,

00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:45.904
and the control over there, the blue one,
has got a really small one.

00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:49.236
And some of the research now is showing

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.291
that people on the spectrum actually
think with the primary visual cortex.

00:05:53.315 --> 00:05:56.356
Now, the thing is, the visual thinker
is just one kind of mind.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.965
You see, the autistic mind
tends to be a specialist mind --

00:05:59.989 --> 00:06:02.602
good at one thing, bad at something else.

00:06:03.102 --> 00:06:04.856
And where I was bad was algebra.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.170
And I was never allowed
to take geometry or trig.

00:06:07.194 --> 00:06:08.357
Gigantic mistake.

00:06:08.381 --> 00:06:10.816
I'm finding a lot of kids
who need to skip algebra,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.489
go right to geometry and trig.

00:06:12.847 --> 00:06:15.447
Now, another kind of mind
is the pattern thinker.

00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:16.710
More abstract.

00:06:16.734 --> 00:06:19.297
These are your engineers,
your computer programmers.

00:06:19.321 --> 00:06:20.715
This is pattern thinking.

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:23.624
That praying mantis is made
from a single sheet of paper --

00:06:23.648 --> 00:06:25.065
no scotch tape, no cuts.

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:28.624
And there in the background
is the pattern for folding it.

00:06:28.648 --> 00:06:30.293
Here are the types of thinking:

00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:33.283
photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me;

00:06:33.856 --> 00:06:37.236
pattern thinkers, music and math minds.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.848
Some of these oftentimes
have problems with reading.

00:06:39.872 --> 00:06:44.353
You also will see these kind of problems
with kids that are dyslexic.

00:06:44.377 --> 00:06:46.401
You'll see these different kinds of minds.

00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:49.999
And then there's a verbal mind,
they know every fact about everything.

00:06:50.023 --> 00:06:51.989
Now, another thing is the sensory issues.

00:06:52.013 --> 00:06:55.305
I was really concerned about having
to wear this gadget on my face.

00:06:55.692 --> 00:06:57.846
And I came in half an hour beforehand

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.853
so I could have it put on
and kind of get used to it,

00:07:00.877 --> 00:07:03.615
and they got it bent
so it's not hitting my chin.

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:04.791
But sensory is an issue.

00:07:04.815 --> 00:07:06.964
Some kids are bothered
by fluorescent lights;

00:07:06.988 --> 00:07:09.145
others have problems
with sound sensitivity.

00:07:09.497 --> 00:07:11.670
You know, it's going to be variable.

00:07:12.652 --> 00:07:16.072
Now, visual thinking gave me
a whole lot of insight

00:07:16.096 --> 00:07:18.356
into the animal mind.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.813
Because think about it:
an animal is a sensory-based thinker,

00:07:21.837 --> 00:07:28.034
not verbal -- thinks in pictures,
thinks in sounds, thinks in smells.

00:07:28.058 --> 00:07:31.402
Think about how much information
there is on the local fire hydrant.

00:07:31.426 --> 00:07:32.788
He knows who's been there --

00:07:32.812 --> 00:07:33.843
(Laughter)

00:07:33.867 --> 00:07:35.024
When they were there.

00:07:35.048 --> 00:07:37.943
Are they friend or foe?
Is there anybody he can go mate with?

00:07:37.967 --> 00:07:40.849
There's a ton of information
on that fire hydrant.

00:07:40.873 --> 00:07:43.659
It's all very detailed information.

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:48.235
And looking at these kind of details
gave me a lot of insight into animals.

00:07:48.688 --> 00:07:52.236
Now, the animal mind, and also my mind,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.829
puts sensory-based information
into categories.

00:07:56.853 --> 00:07:58.556
Man on a horse,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.135
and a man on the ground --

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:02.944
that is viewed as two
totally different things.

00:08:02.968 --> 00:08:05.467
You could have a horse
that's been abused by a rider.

00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:07.761
They'll be absolutely fine
with the veterinarian

00:08:07.785 --> 00:08:10.236
and with the horseshoer,
but you can't ride him.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.435
You have another horse,
where maybe the horseshoer beat him up,

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:17.454
and he'll be terrible for anything
on the ground with the veterinarian,

00:08:17.478 --> 00:08:19.493
but a person can ride him.

00:08:19.517 --> 00:08:20.824
Cattle are the same way.

00:08:20.848 --> 00:08:24.773
Man on a horse, a man on foot --
they're two different things.

00:08:24.797 --> 00:08:26.753
You see, it's a different picture.

00:08:26.777 --> 00:08:29.898
See, I want you to think
about just how specific this is.

00:08:29.922 --> 00:08:33.309
Now, this ability to put
information into categories,

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:36.685
I find a lot of people
are not very good at this.

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:38.877
When I'm out troubleshooting equipment

00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:40.729
or problems with something in a plant,

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:42.758
they don't seem to be able to figure out:

00:08:42.782 --> 00:08:44.482
"Do I have a training-people issue?

00:08:44.506 --> 00:08:46.941
Or do I have something wrong
with the equipment?"

00:08:46.965 --> 00:08:50.659
In other words, categorize
equipment problem from a people problem.

00:08:50.683 --> 00:08:53.779
I find a lot of people
have difficulty doing that.

00:08:53.803 --> 00:08:56.367
Now, let's say I figure out
it's an equipment problem.

00:08:56.391 --> 00:08:59.167
Is it a minor problem,
with something simple I can fix?

00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.506
Or is the whole design
of the system wrong?

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.236
People have a hard time figuring that out.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.356
Let's just look at something
like, you know,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.626
solving problems with making
airlines safer.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.236
Yeah, I'm a million-mile flier.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.086
I do lots and lots of flying,

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.342
and if I was at the FAA,

00:09:15.366 --> 00:09:18.888
what would I be doing a lot
of direct observation of?

00:09:19.457 --> 00:09:21.761
It would be their airplane tails.

00:09:21.785 --> 00:09:24.335
You know, five fatal wrecks
in the last 20 years,

00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:26.134
the tail either came off,

00:09:26.158 --> 00:09:29.592
or steering stuff inside the tail
broke in some way.

00:09:30.007 --> 00:09:32.060
It's tails, pure and simple.

00:09:32.084 --> 00:09:34.617
And when the pilots walk
around the plane, guess what?

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:36.692
They can't see that stuff inside the tail.

00:09:36.716 --> 00:09:38.153
Now as I think about that,

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:41.636
I'm pulling up all of that
specific information.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.833
It's specific.

00:09:42.857 --> 00:09:44.352
See, my thinking's bottom-up.

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:48.073
I take all the little pieces and I put
the pieces together like a puzzle.

00:09:48.097 --> 00:09:51.864
Now, here is a horse that was deathly
afraid of black cowboy hats.

00:09:51.888 --> 00:09:54.448
He'd been abused by somebody
with a black cowboy hat.

00:09:54.472 --> 00:09:57.361
White cowboy hats,
that was absolutely fine.

00:09:57.856 --> 00:10:00.406
Now, the thing is,
the world is going to need

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.519
all of the different kinds of minds
to work together.

00:10:04.543 --> 00:10:07.734
We've got to work on developing
all these different kinds of minds.

00:10:07.758 --> 00:10:10.300
And one of the things
that is driving me really crazy

00:10:10.324 --> 00:10:12.671
as I travel around
and I do autism meetings,

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:15.836
is I'm seeing a lot of smart,
geeky, nerdy kids,

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.035
and they just aren't very social,

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:21.150
and nobody's working
on developing their interest

00:10:21.174 --> 00:10:22.549
in something like science.

00:10:22.926 --> 00:10:25.613
And this brings up the whole thing
of my science teacher.

00:10:25.637 --> 00:10:28.745
My science teacher is shown
absolutely beautifully in the movie.

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:31.255
I was a goofball student
when I was in high school.

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:33.307
I just didn't care at all about studying,

00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:36.560
until I had Mr. Carlock's science class.

00:10:36.584 --> 00:10:38.956
He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.

00:10:39.357 --> 00:10:45.236
And he got me challenged
to figure out an optical illusion room.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.975
This brings up the whole thing
of you've got to show kids

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:49.156
interesting stuff.

00:10:49.574 --> 00:10:52.887
You know, one of the things
that I think maybe TED ought to do

00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:56.226
is tell all the schools about all
the great lectures that are on TED,

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.737
and there's all kinds
of great stuff on the Internet

00:10:58.761 --> 00:11:00.133
to get these kids turned on.

00:11:00.157 --> 00:11:02.643
Because I'm seeing a lot
of these geeky, nerdy kids,

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:05.851
and the teachers out in the Midwest
and other parts of the country

00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:07.813
when you get away from these tech areas,

00:11:07.837 --> 00:11:09.849
they don't know what to do
with these kids.

00:11:09.873 --> 00:11:11.894
And they're not going down the right path.

00:11:11.918 --> 00:11:13.700
The thing is, you can make a mind

00:11:13.724 --> 00:11:16.449
to be more of a thinking
and cognitive mind,

00:11:16.473 --> 00:11:18.948
or your mind can be wired
to be more social.

00:11:18.972 --> 00:11:21.603
And what some of the research
now has shown in autism

00:11:21.627 --> 00:11:25.097
is there may by extra wiring back here
in the really brilliant mind,

00:11:25.121 --> 00:11:27.034
and we lose a few social circuits here.

00:11:27.058 --> 00:11:30.009
It's kind of a trade-off
between thinking and social.

00:11:30.033 --> 00:11:32.625
And then you can get to the point
where it's so severe,

00:11:32.649 --> 00:11:35.505
you're going to have a person
that's going to be non-verbal.

00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:37.236
In the normal human mind,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.882
language covers up the visual thinking
we share with animals.

00:11:40.906 --> 00:11:43.597
This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.

00:11:44.756 --> 00:11:48.488
He studied Alzheimer's patients
that had frontal temporal lobe dementia.

00:11:48.512 --> 00:11:51.535
And the dementia ate out
the language parts of the brain.

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:53.830
And then this artwork came out of somebody

00:11:53.854 --> 00:11:55.822
who used to install stereos in cars.

00:11:56.827 --> 00:12:00.493
Now, Van Gogh doesn't know
anything about physics,

00:12:00.517 --> 00:12:03.838
but I think it's very interesting
that there was some work done

00:12:03.862 --> 00:12:06.585
to show that this eddy pattern
in this painting

00:12:06.609 --> 00:12:09.757
followed a statistical model
of turbulence,

00:12:09.781 --> 00:12:11.800
which brings up the whole interesting idea

00:12:11.824 --> 00:12:15.562
of maybe some of this mathematical
patterns is in our own head.

00:12:15.586 --> 00:12:17.139
And the Wolfram stuff --

00:12:17.163 --> 00:12:21.729
I was taking notes and writing down
all the search words I could use,

00:12:21.753 --> 00:12:25.080
because I think that's going to go on
in my autism lectures.

00:12:25.104 --> 00:12:27.531
We've got to show
these kids interesting stuff.

00:12:27.555 --> 00:12:29.822
And they've taken out the auto-shop class

00:12:29.846 --> 00:12:31.946
and the drafting class and the art class.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.236
I mean, art was my best subject in school.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.119
We've got to think about all
these different kinds of minds,

00:12:37.143 --> 00:12:39.923
and we've got to absolutely
work with these kind of minds,

00:12:39.947 --> 00:12:42.235
because we absolutely are going to need

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:44.780
these kinds of people in the future.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.039
And let's talk about jobs.

00:12:47.524 --> 00:12:49.717
OK, my science teacher got me studying,

00:12:49.741 --> 00:12:52.155
because I was a goofball
that didn't want to study.

00:12:52.179 --> 00:12:54.524
But you know what?
I was getting work experience.

00:12:54.548 --> 00:12:58.012
I'm seeing too many of these smart kids
who haven't learned basic things,

00:12:58.036 --> 00:13:01.484
like how to be on time -- I was taught
that when I was eight years old.

00:13:01.508 --> 00:13:04.063
How to have table manners
at granny's Sunday party.

00:13:04.087 --> 00:13:06.272
I was taught that
when I was very, very young.

00:13:06.746 --> 00:13:11.723
And when I was 13, I had a job
at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes.

00:13:11.747 --> 00:13:14.335
I did internships in college,

00:13:14.359 --> 00:13:17.562
I was building things,

00:13:17.586 --> 00:13:20.603
and I also had to learn
how to do assignments.

00:13:20.627 --> 00:13:24.217
You know, all I wanted to do was draw
pictures of horses when I was little.

00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:27.069
My mother said, "Well let's do
a picture of something else."

00:13:27.093 --> 00:13:29.257
They've got to learn
how to do something else.

00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:31.125
Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos.

00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:33.846
Let's get him working
on building different things.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.466
The thing about the autistic mind
is it tends to be fixated.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.368
Like if the kid loves race cars,
let's use race cars for math.

00:13:41.392 --> 00:13:44.832
Let's figure out how long it takes
a race car to go a certain distance.

00:13:44.856 --> 00:13:47.969
In other words, use that fixation

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:51.849
in order to motivate that kid,
that's one of the things we need to do.

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:54.961
I really get fed up when the teachers,

00:13:54.985 --> 00:13:57.787
especially when you get away
from this part of the country,

00:13:57.811 --> 00:14:00.191
they don't know what to do
with these smart kids.

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.378
It just drives me crazy.

00:14:01.402 --> 00:14:03.644
What can visual thinkers
do when they grow up?

00:14:03.668 --> 00:14:06.617
They can do graphic design,
all kinds of stuff with computers,

00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:10.024
photography, industrial design.

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:15.575
The pattern thinkers -- they're the ones
that are going to be your mathematicians,

00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:18.106
your software engineers,
your computer programmers,

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.093
all of those kinds of jobs.

00:14:20.117 --> 00:14:23.689
And then you've got the word minds;
they make great journalists,

00:14:23.713 --> 00:14:26.236
and they also make really,
really good stage actors.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.652
Because the thing about being autistic is,

00:14:28.676 --> 00:14:31.507
I had to learn social skills
like being in a play.

00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:33.904
You just kind of ...
you just have to learn it.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.236
And we need to be working
with these students.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.368
And this brings up mentors.

00:14:39.392 --> 00:14:42.492
You know, my science teacher
was not an accredited teacher.

00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:44.236
He was a NASA space scientist.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.664
Some states now are getting it to where,
if you have a degree in biology

00:14:47.688 --> 00:14:48.959
or in chemistry,

00:14:48.983 --> 00:14:51.820
you can come into the school
and teach biology or chemistry.

00:14:51.844 --> 00:14:53.370
We need to be doing that.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.590
Because what I'm observing is,

00:14:55.614 --> 00:14:57.663
the good teachers,
for a lot of these kids,

00:14:57.687 --> 00:14:59.335
are out in the community colleges.

00:14:59.359 --> 00:15:01.895
But we need to be getting
some of these good teachers

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:03.070
into the high schools.

00:15:03.094 --> 00:15:06.650
Another thing that can be very,
very, very successful is:

00:15:06.674 --> 00:15:08.782
there's a lot of people
that may have retired

00:15:08.806 --> 00:15:10.628
from working in the software industry,

00:15:10.652 --> 00:15:12.040
and they can teach your kid.

00:15:12.064 --> 00:15:14.873
And it doesn't matter
if what they teach them is old,

00:15:14.897 --> 00:15:17.624
because what you're doing
is you're lighting the spark.

00:15:17.648 --> 00:15:20.112
You're getting that kid turned on.

00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:23.551
And you get him turned on,
then you'll learn all the new stuff.

00:15:23.575 --> 00:15:25.839
Mentors are just essential.

00:15:25.863 --> 00:15:29.596
I cannot emphasize enough
what my science teacher did for me.

00:15:30.204 --> 00:15:33.236
And we've got to mentor them, hire them.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.068
And if you bring them in
for internships in your companies,

00:15:36.092 --> 00:15:38.565
the thing about the autism,
Asperger-y kind of mind,

00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:40.557
you've got to give them a specific task.

00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:42.423
Don't just say, "Design new software."

00:15:42.447 --> 00:15:44.714
You've got to tell them
something more specific:

00:15:44.738 --> 00:15:46.635
"We're designing software for a phone

00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:48.459
and it has to do some specific thing,

00:15:48.483 --> 00:15:50.236
and it can only use so much memory."

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.687
That's the kind of specificity you need.

00:15:52.711 --> 00:15:54.570
Well, that's the end of my talk.

00:15:54.594 --> 00:15:56.837
And I just want to thank
everybody for coming.

00:15:56.861 --> 00:15:58.236
It was great to be here.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:05.260
(Applause)

00:16:09.786 --> 00:16:11.977
(Applause ends)

00:16:12.001 --> 00:16:13.826
Oh -- you have a question for me? OK.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.247
(Applause)

00:16:16.271 --> 00:16:18.299
Chris Anderson:
Thank you so much for that.

00:16:18.323 --> 00:16:20.649
You know, you once wrote --
I like this quote:

00:16:20.673 --> 00:16:25.234
"If by some magic, autism had been
eradicated from the face of the Earth,

00:16:25.258 --> 00:16:28.235
then men would still be socializing
in front of a wood fire

00:16:28.259 --> 00:16:29.600
at the entrance to a cave."

00:16:29.624 --> 00:16:30.652
(Laughter)

00:16:30.676 --> 00:16:33.912
Temple Grandin: Because who do you think
made the first stone spear?

00:16:33.936 --> 00:16:35.094
It was the Asperger guy,

00:16:35.118 --> 00:16:37.671
and if you were to get rid
of all the autism genetics,

00:16:37.695 --> 00:16:41.360
there'd be no more Silicon Valley,
and the energy crisis would not be solved.

00:16:41.384 --> 00:16:42.725
(Applause)

00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:44.979
CA: I want to ask you
a couple other questions,

00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:48.767
and if any of these feel inappropriate,
it's OK just to say, "Next question."

00:16:48.791 --> 00:16:52.405
But if there is someone here
who has an autistic child,

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:57.170
or knows an autistic child and feels
kind of cut off from them,

00:16:57.793 --> 00:16:59.640
what advice would you give them?

00:16:59.664 --> 00:17:01.993
TG: Well, first of all,
we've got to look at age.

00:17:02.017 --> 00:17:05.966
If you have a two, three or four-year-old,
no speech, no social interaction,

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.279
I can't emphasize enough: Don't wait.

00:17:08.303 --> 00:17:11.433
You need at least 20 hours a week
of one-to-one teaching.

00:17:11.612 --> 00:17:14.105
The thing is, autism comes
in different degrees.

00:17:14.129 --> 00:17:17.636
About half of the people on the spectrum
are not going to learn to talk,

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.761
and they won't be working
in Silicon Valley.

00:17:19.785 --> 00:17:22.235
That would not be a reasonable
thing for them to do.

00:17:22.259 --> 00:17:25.336
But then you get these smart,
geeky kids with a touch of autism,

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.840
and that's where you've got
to get them turned on

00:17:27.864 --> 00:17:29.353
with doing interesting things.

00:17:29.377 --> 00:17:32.392
I got social interaction
through shared interests --

00:17:32.416 --> 00:17:36.373
I rode horses with other kids,
I made model rockets with other kids,

00:17:36.397 --> 00:17:38.375
did electronics lab with other kids.

00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:42.650
And in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors
onto a rubber membrane on a speaker

00:17:42.674 --> 00:17:43.855
to make a light show.

00:17:43.879 --> 00:17:46.101
That was, like,
we considered that super cool.

00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:47.131
(Laughter)

00:17:47.155 --> 00:17:48.652
CA: Is it unrealistic for them

00:17:48.676 --> 00:17:53.416
to hope or think that that child
loves them, as some might, as most, wish?

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.674
TG: Well, I tell you,
that child will be loyal,

00:17:55.698 --> 00:17:59.073
and if your house is burning down,
they're going to get you out of it.

00:17:59.097 --> 00:18:02.756
CA: Wow. So most people, if you ask them
what they're most passionate about,

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.628
they'd say things like,
"My kids" or "My lover."

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.022
What are you most passionate about?

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:11.077
TG: I'm passionate
about that the things I do

00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:13.138
are going to make
the world a better place.

00:18:13.162 --> 00:18:15.384
When I have a mother
of an autistic child say,

00:18:15.408 --> 00:18:17.470
"My kid went to college
because of your book

00:18:17.494 --> 00:18:18.694
or one of your lectures,"

00:18:18.718 --> 00:18:19.869
that makes me happy.

00:18:19.893 --> 00:18:22.606
You know, the slaughter plants
I worked with in the '80s;

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.947
they were absolutely awful.

00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:27.247
I developed a really simple
scoring system for slaughter plants,

00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:28.823
where you just measure outcomes:

00:18:28.847 --> 00:18:30.089
How many cattle fell down?

00:18:30.113 --> 00:18:31.861
How many got poked with the prodder?

00:18:31.885 --> 00:18:33.916
How many cattle
are mooing their heads off?

00:18:34.278 --> 00:18:35.612
And it's very, very simple.

00:18:35.636 --> 00:18:37.613
You directly observe a few simple things.

00:18:37.637 --> 00:18:38.801
It's worked really well.

00:18:38.825 --> 00:18:41.164
I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff

00:18:41.188 --> 00:18:43.908
that makes real change in the real world.

00:18:43.932 --> 00:18:46.681
We need a lot more of that,
and a lot less abstract stuff.

00:18:46.705 --> 00:18:47.856
CA: Totally.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.963
(Applause)

00:18:52.987 --> 00:18:56.086
CA: When we were talking on the phone,
one of the things you said

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.312
that really astonished me

00:18:57.336 --> 00:19:00.497
was that one thing you were passionate
about was server farms.

00:19:01.103 --> 00:19:02.254
Tell me about that.

00:19:02.278 --> 00:19:05.655
TG: Well, the reason why I got really
excited when I read about that,

00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:07.335
it contains knowledge.

00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:09.017
It's libraries.

00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:12.560
And to me, knowledge is something
that is extremely valuable.

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:15.700
So, maybe over 10 years ago
now, our library got flooded.

00:19:15.724 --> 00:19:17.775
This is before the Internet
got really big.

00:19:17.799 --> 00:19:20.480
And I was really upset
about all the books being wrecked,

00:19:20.504 --> 00:19:22.480
because it was knowledge being destroyed.

00:19:22.504 --> 00:19:26.917
And server farms, or data centers,
are great libraries of knowledge.

00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:28.232
CA: Temple, can I just say,

00:19:28.256 --> 00:19:30.342
it's an absolute delight
to have you at TED.

00:19:30.366 --> 00:19:31.517
Thank you so much.

00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:33.436
TG: Well, thank you so much. Thank you.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:38.696
(Applause)
