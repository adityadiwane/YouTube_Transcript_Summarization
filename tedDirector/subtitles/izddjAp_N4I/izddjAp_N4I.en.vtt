00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So there are a few things

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
that bring us humans together in the way that an election does.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
We stand in elections; we vote in elections;

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
we observe elections.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Our democracies rely on elections.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
We all understand why we have elections,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and we all leave the house on the same day

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
to go and vote.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
We cherish the opportunity to have our say,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
to help decide the future of the country.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
The fundamental idea is that politicians

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
are given mandate to speak for us,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
to make decisions on our behalf

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
that affect us all.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Without that mandate, they would be corrupt.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Well unfortunately, power corrupts,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and so people will do lots of things

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
to get power and to stay in power,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
including doing bad things to elections.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
You see, even if the idea

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
of the election is perfect,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
running a countrywide election is a big project,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and big projects are messy.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Whenever there is an election,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
it seems like something always goes wrong,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
someone tries to cheat,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
or something goes accidentally awry --

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
a ballot box goes missing here,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
chads are left hanging over here.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.260
To make sure as few things as possible go wrong,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
we have all these procedures around the election.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
So for example, you come to the polling station,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and a poll station worker asks for your ID

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
before giving you a ballot form

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and asking you to go into a voting booth

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
to fill out your vote.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
When you come back out, you get to drop your vote

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
into the ballot box

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
where it mixes with all the other votes,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
so that no one knows how you voted.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Well, what I want us to think about for a moment

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
is what happens after that,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
after you drop your vote into the ballot box.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And most people would go home

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and feel sure that their vote has been counted,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
because they trust

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
that the election system works.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
They trust that election workers and election observers

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
do their jobs and do their jobs correctly.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
The ballot boxes go to counting places.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
They're unsealed and the votes are poured out

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and laboriously counted.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Most of us have to trust

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
that that happens correctly for our own vote,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and we all have to trust that that happens correctly

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
for all the votes in the election.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
So we have to trust a lot of people.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
We have to trust a lot of procedures.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And sometimes we even have to trust computers.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
So imagine hundreds of millions of voters

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
casting hundreds of millions of votes,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
all to be counted correctly

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and all the things that can possibly go wrong

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
causing all these bad headlines,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
of trying to make elections better.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Well in the face of all these bad headlines,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
researchers have taken a step back

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and thought about how we can do elections differently.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And the big picture is this:

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
elections should be verifiable.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Voters should be able to check

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
that their votes are counted correctly,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
without breaking election secrecy,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
which is so very important.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
And that's the tough part.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
How do we make an election system completely verifiable

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
while keeping the votes

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
absolutely secret?

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Well, the way we've come up with

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
uses computers

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
but doesn't depend on them.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And the secret is the ballot form.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And if you look closely at these ballot forms,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
you'll notice that the candidate list

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
is in a different order on each one.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
And that means, if you mark your choices on one of them

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
and then remove the candidate list,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
what your vote is for.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
in the form of this 2D barcode

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
on the right.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And there's some complicated cryptography

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
going on in there,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
but what's not complicated

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
is voting with one of these forms.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and then we'll use the paper for verification.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
So this is how you vote.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.260
You get one of these ballot forms at random,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and then you go into the voting booth,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and you mark your choices,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
and you tear along a perforation.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And you shred the candidate list.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And the bit that remains, the one with your marks --

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
this is your encrypted vote.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
So you let a poll station worker

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
scan your encrypted vote.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And because it's encrypted,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
it can be submitted, stored

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and counted centrally

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and displayed on a website

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
for anyone to see, including you.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
So you take this encrypted vote

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
home as your receipt.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
And after the close of the election,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
you can check that your vote was counted

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
by comparing your receipt

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
to the vote on the website.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And remember, the vote is encrypted

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
from the moment you leave the voting booth,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
so if an election official wants to find out how you voted,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
they will not be able to.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
If the government wants to find out how you voted,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
they won't be able to.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
No hacker can break in

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
and find out how you voted.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
No hacker can break in and change your vote,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
because then it won't match your receipt.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
Votes can't go missing

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
because then you won't find yours when you look for it.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
But the election magic doesn't stop there.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Instead, we want to make the whole process

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
so transparent

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
that news media and international observers

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
and anyone who wants to

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
can download all the election data

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and do the count themselves.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
They can check that all the votes were counted correctly.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
They can check

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
that the announced result of the election

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
is the correct one.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And these are elections

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
by the people, for the people.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
So the next step for our democracies

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
are transparent

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and verifiable elections.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
Thank you.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:56.260
(Applause)
