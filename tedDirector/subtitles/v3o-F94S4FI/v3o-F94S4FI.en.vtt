00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.717
So if you've been following the news,

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:20.206
you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids

00:00:20.206 --> 00:00:21.279
headed for the United States,

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.746
all scheduled to strike within the next 50 years.

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:27.799
Now I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal.

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:29.306
That actually wouldn't be such a problem,

00:00:29.306 --> 00:00:31.410
because if we were really all going to die,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.448
we would put aside our differences, we'd spend whatever it took,

00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:36.578
and we'd find a way to deflect them.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:39.280
I'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.416
but they're wrapped in a special energy field

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:45.766
that polarizes us, and therefore paralyzes us.

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.670
Last March, I went to the TED conference,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.506
and I saw Jim Hansen speak, the NASA scientist

00:00:50.506 --> 00:00:53.416
who first raised the alarm about global warming in the 1980s,

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:55.881
and it seems that the predictions he made back then

00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:57.722
are coming true.

00:00:57.722 --> 00:01:01.209
This is where we're headed in terms of global temperature rises,

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:02.818
and if we keep on going the way we're going,

00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:06.286
we get a four- or five-degree-Centigrade temperature rise

00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:07.634
by the end of this century.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:11.422
Hansen says we can expect about a five-meter rise in sea levels.

00:01:11.422 --> 00:01:14.664
This is what a five-meter rise in sea levels would look like.

00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:17.672
Low-lying cities all around the world will disappear

00:01:17.672 --> 00:01:21.470
within the lifetime of children born today.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.766
Hansen closed his talk by saying,

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:27.903
"Imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth.

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:30.256
That is the equivalent of what we face now.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:34.030
Yet we dither, taking no action to deflect the asteroid,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.739
even though the longer we wait,

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:38.816
the more difficult and expensive it becomes."

00:01:38.816 --> 00:01:40.623
Of course, the left wants to take action,

00:01:40.623 --> 00:01:43.959
but the right denies that there's any problem.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.537
All right, so I go back from TED,

00:01:45.537 --> 00:01:48.431
and then the following week, I'm invited to a dinner party

00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:50.896
in Washington, D.C., where I know that I'll be meeting

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:53.638
a number of conservative intellectuals, including Yuval Levin,

00:01:53.638 --> 00:01:57.234
and to prepare for the meeting, I read this article by Levin

00:01:57.234 --> 00:02:00.600
in National Affairs called "Beyond the Welfare State."

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.799
Levin writes that all over the world,

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.010
nations are coming to terms with the fact

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.311
that the social democratic welfare state

00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:11.830
is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.394
dependent upon dubious economics

00:02:14.394 --> 00:02:18.031
and the demographic model of a bygone era.

00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:20.676
All right, now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid,

00:02:20.676 --> 00:02:23.354
but look at these graphs that Levin showed.

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:25.804
This graph shows the national debt

00:02:25.804 --> 00:02:28.886
as a percentage of America's GDP, and as you see,

00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:30.967
if you go all the way back to the founding,

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:33.083
we borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War.

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:36.421
Wars are expensive. But then we'd pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,

00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:39.473
and then, oh, what's this? The Civil War. Even more expensive.

00:02:39.473 --> 00:02:42.206
Borrow a lot of money, pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:44.928
get down to near zero, and bang! -- World War I.

00:02:44.928 --> 00:02:46.630
Once again, the same process repeats.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.538
Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II.

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:52.896
We rise to an astronomical level, around 118 percent of GDP,

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:56.576
really unsustainable, really dangerous.

00:02:56.576 --> 00:03:01.203
But we pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, and then, what's this?

00:03:01.203 --> 00:03:04.212
Why has it been rising since the '70s?

00:03:04.212 --> 00:03:07.005
It's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded,

00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:09.699
but it's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending,

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.853
especially Medicare.

00:03:11.853 --> 00:03:14.948
We're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II,

00:03:14.948 --> 00:03:17.939
and the baby boomers haven't even retired yet,

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.209
and when they do, this is what will happen.

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.938
This is data from the Congressional Budget Office

00:03:22.938 --> 00:03:25.765
showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen

00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:29.880
if current situations and expectations and trends are extended.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.812
All right, now what you might notice is that these two graphs

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:37.443
are actually identical, not in terms of the x- and y-axes,

00:03:37.443 --> 00:03:38.638
or in terms of the data they present,

00:03:38.638 --> 00:03:43.111
but in terms of their moral and political implications, they say the same thing.

00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:44.947
Let me translate for you.

00:03:44.947 --> 00:03:48.614
"We are doomed unless we start acting now.

00:03:48.614 --> 00:03:51.594
What's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party?

00:03:51.594 --> 00:03:55.983
Can't you see reality? If you won't help, then get the hell out of the way."

00:03:55.983 --> 00:03:58.264
We can deflect both of these asteroids.

00:03:58.264 --> 00:04:01.654
These problems are both technically solvable.

00:04:01.654 --> 00:04:04.433
Our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper-partisan times,

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:07.425
the mere fact that one side says, "Look, there's an asteroid,"

00:04:07.425 --> 00:04:09.666
means that the other side's going to say, "Huh? What?

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.244
No, I'm not even going to look up. No."

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:15.348
To understand why this is happening to us,

00:04:15.348 --> 00:04:19.394
and what we can do about it, we need to learn more about moral psychology.

00:04:19.394 --> 00:04:22.052
So I'm a social psychologist, and I study morality,

00:04:22.052 --> 00:04:24.439
and one of the most important principles of morality

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.689
is that morality binds and blinds.

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.123
It binds us into teams that circle around sacred values

00:04:30.123 --> 00:04:34.036
but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality.

00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:35.142
Think of it like this.

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:39.205
Large-scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet.

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:41.364
There are only a few species that can do it.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:44.364
That's a beehive. That's a termite mound, a giant termite mound.

00:04:44.364 --> 00:04:47.464
And when you find this in other animals, it's always the same story.

00:04:47.464 --> 00:04:52.361
They're always all siblings who are children of a single queen,

00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:54.220
so they're all in the same boat.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.541
They rise or fall, they live or die, as one.

00:04:57.541 --> 00:04:59.832
There's only one species on the planet that can do this

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:02.407
without kinship, and that, of course, is us.

00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:04.678
This is a reconstruction of ancient Babylon,

00:05:04.678 --> 00:05:07.001
and this is Tenochtitlan.

00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:09.093
Now how did we do this? How did we go

00:05:09.093 --> 00:05:12.087
from being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago

00:05:12.087 --> 00:05:16.105
to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years?

00:05:16.105 --> 00:05:19.148
It's miraculous, and part of the explanation

00:05:19.148 --> 00:05:23.372
is this ability to circle around sacred values.

00:05:23.372 --> 00:05:27.296
As you see, temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations.

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:31.148
This is an image of Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca.

00:05:31.148 --> 00:05:34.293
It's a sacred rock, and when people circle something together,

00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:38.664
they unite, they can trust each other, they become one.

00:05:38.664 --> 00:05:40.845
It's as though you're moving an electrical wire

00:05:40.845 --> 00:05:42.982
through a magnetic field that generates current.

00:05:42.982 --> 00:05:45.905
When people circle together, they generate a current.

00:05:45.905 --> 00:05:47.438
We love to circle around things.

00:05:47.438 --> 00:05:51.136
We circle around flags, and then we can trust each other.

00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:53.977
We can fight as a team, as a unit.

00:05:53.977 --> 00:05:57.136
But even as morality binds people together into a unit,

00:05:57.136 --> 00:06:01.108
into a team, the circling blinds them.

00:06:01.108 --> 00:06:02.916
It causes them to distort reality.

00:06:02.916 --> 00:06:06.953
We begin separating everything into good versus evil.

00:06:06.953 --> 00:06:10.851
Now that process feels great. It feels really satisfying.

00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:15.070
But it is a gross distortion of reality.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.478
You can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress.

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.710
This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.541
in Congress falls strictly along the left-right axis,

00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:26.217
so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is,

00:06:26.217 --> 00:06:29.443
you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues.

00:06:29.443 --> 00:06:31.497
And what you can see is that,

00:06:31.497 --> 00:06:33.882
in the decades after the Civil War,

00:06:33.882 --> 00:06:36.371
Congress was extraordinarily polarized,

00:06:36.371 --> 00:06:38.914
as you would expect, about as high as can be.

00:06:38.914 --> 00:06:41.890
But then, after World War I, things dropped,

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.795
and we get this historically low level of polarization.

00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:46.487
This was a golden age of bipartisanship,

00:06:46.487 --> 00:06:49.762
at least in terms of the parties' ability to work together

00:06:49.762 --> 00:06:52.770
and solve grand national problems.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.219
But in the 1980s and '90s, the electromagnet turns back on.

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:00.060
Polarization rises.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.026
It used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals

00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:04.858
could all work together in Congress.

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:07.699
They could rearrange themselves, form bipartisan committees,

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:10.972
but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up,

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:13.242
the force field increased,

00:07:13.242 --> 00:07:16.006
Democrats and Republicans were pulled apart.

00:07:16.006 --> 00:07:17.993
It became much harder for them to socialize,

00:07:17.993 --> 00:07:19.471
much harder for them to cooperate.

00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:24.312
Retiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare.

00:07:24.312 --> 00:07:27.824
Did anybody notice that in two of the three debates,

00:07:27.824 --> 00:07:31.340
Obama wore a blue tie and Romney wore a red tie?

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.326
Do you know why they do this?

00:07:33.326 --> 00:07:37.468
It's so that the Bloods and the Crips will know which side to vote for. (Laughter)

00:07:37.468 --> 00:07:40.234
The polarization is strongest among our political elites.

00:07:40.234 --> 00:07:42.412
Nobody doubts that this is happening in Washington.

00:07:42.412 --> 00:07:45.848
But for a while, there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people.

00:07:45.848 --> 00:07:47.156
Well, in the last 12 years it's become

00:07:47.156 --> 00:07:49.243
much more apparent that it is.

00:07:49.243 --> 00:07:52.465
So look at this data. This is from the American National Elections Survey.

00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:55.105
And what they do on that survey is they ask

00:07:55.105 --> 00:07:57.117
what's called a feeling thermometer rating.

00:07:57.117 --> 00:08:01.354
So, how warm or cold do you feel about, you know,

00:08:01.354 --> 00:08:04.129
Native Americans, or the military, the Republican Party,

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:07.055
the Democratic Party, all sorts of groups in American life.

00:08:07.055 --> 00:08:09.737
The blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel

00:08:09.737 --> 00:08:12.200
about Democrats, and they like them.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.905
You know, ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale.

00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:17.920
Republicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.994
But when you look at cross-party ratings,

00:08:19.994 --> 00:08:22.529
you find, well, that it's lower, but actually,

00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:24.513
when I first saw this data, I was surprised.

00:08:24.513 --> 00:08:27.808
That's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations,

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:32.385
they were rating the other party 43, 45. It's not terrible.

00:08:32.385 --> 00:08:34.700
It drifts downwards very slightly,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.561
but now look what happens under George W. Bush and Obama.

00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:41.313
It plummets. Something is going on here.

00:08:41.313 --> 00:08:43.714
The moral electromagnet is turning back on,

00:08:43.714 --> 00:08:45.874
and nowadays, just very recently,

00:08:45.874 --> 00:08:48.114
Democrats really dislike Republicans.

00:08:48.114 --> 00:08:51.630
Republicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.480
It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.205
It's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart,

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:02.161
pulling left and right into their own territories

00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:04.970
like the Bloods and the Crips.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.984
Now, there are many reasons why this is happening to us,

00:09:07.984 --> 00:09:10.904
and many of them we cannot reverse.

00:09:10.904 --> 00:09:13.401
We will never again have a political class

00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:16.960
that was forged by the experience of fighting together

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.704
in World War II against a common enemy.

00:09:19.704 --> 00:09:23.238
We will never again have just three television networks,

00:09:23.238 --> 00:09:26.411
all of which are relatively centrist.

00:09:26.411 --> 00:09:31.251
And we will never again have a large group of conservative southern Democrats

00:09:31.251 --> 00:09:35.042
and liberal northern Republicans making it easy,

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:39.360
making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.008
So for a lot of reasons, those decades after the Second World War

00:09:42.008 --> 00:09:43.811
were an historically anomalous time.

00:09:43.811 --> 00:09:47.528
We will never get back to those low levels of polarization, I believe.

00:09:47.528 --> 00:09:50.126
But there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens

00:09:50.126 --> 00:09:53.272
and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better,

00:09:53.272 --> 00:09:55.696
because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly

00:09:55.696 --> 00:09:59.319
to things that Congress did to itself in the 1990s

00:09:59.319 --> 00:10:04.414
that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution.

00:10:04.414 --> 00:10:06.606
These changes are detailed in many books.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.846
These are two that I strongly recommend,

00:10:08.846 --> 00:10:10.997
and they list a whole bunch of reforms.

00:10:10.997 --> 00:10:13.767
I'm just going to group them into three broad classes here.

00:10:13.767 --> 00:10:16.805
So if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional,

00:10:16.805 --> 00:10:20.149
hyper-polarized institution, well, the first step is,

00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:25.423
do what you can so that fewer hyper-partisans get elected in the first place,

00:10:25.423 --> 00:10:26.817
and when you have closed party primaries,

00:10:26.817 --> 00:10:29.881
and only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting,

00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:33.877
you're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper-partisans.

00:10:33.877 --> 00:10:37.464
So open primaries would make that problem much, much less severe.

00:10:37.464 --> 00:10:42.215
But the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress.

00:10:42.215 --> 00:10:45.615
From my experience, and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders,

00:10:45.615 --> 00:10:48.595
most of the people going to Congress are good, hard-working,

00:10:48.595 --> 00:10:51.256
intelligent people who really want to solve problems,

00:10:51.256 --> 00:10:53.881
but once they get there, they find that they are forced

00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:56.812
to play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship

00:10:56.812 --> 00:10:58.461
and that punishes independent thinking.

00:10:58.461 --> 00:11:01.039
You step out of line, you get punished.

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:02.806
So there are a lot of reforms we could do

00:11:02.806 --> 00:11:03.978
that will counteract this.

00:11:03.978 --> 00:11:07.198
For example, this "Citizens United" ruling is a disaster,

00:11:07.198 --> 00:11:09.397
because it means there's like a money gun aimed at your head,

00:11:09.397 --> 00:11:12.162
and if you step out of line, if you try to reach across the aisle,

00:11:12.162 --> 00:11:14.678
there's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent

00:11:14.678 --> 00:11:20.343
to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising.

00:11:20.343 --> 00:11:22.646
But the third class of reforms is that we've got to change

00:11:22.646 --> 00:11:25.473
the nature of social relationships in Congress.

00:11:25.473 --> 00:11:29.784
The politicians I've met are generally very extroverted,

00:11:29.784 --> 00:11:32.855
friendly, very socially skillful people,

00:11:32.855 --> 00:11:36.209
and that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships,

00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:39.488
make deals, you've got to cajole, please, flatter,

00:11:39.488 --> 00:11:41.873
you've got to use your personal skills,

00:11:41.873 --> 00:11:44.264
and that's the way politics has always worked.

00:11:44.264 --> 00:11:47.344
But beginning in the 1990s, first the House of Representatives

00:11:47.344 --> 00:11:49.729
changed its legislative calendar

00:11:49.729 --> 00:11:53.385
so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week.

00:11:53.385 --> 00:11:55.614
Nowadays, Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning,

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:58.463
they do battle for two days, then they fly home Thursday afternoon.

00:11:58.463 --> 00:12:00.368
They don't move their families to the District.

00:12:00.368 --> 00:12:02.686
They don't meet each other's spouses or children.

00:12:02.686 --> 00:12:05.200
There's no more relationship there.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.996
And trying to run Congress without human relationships

00:12:08.996 --> 00:12:11.823
is like trying to run a car without motor oil.

00:12:11.823 --> 00:12:14.660
Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.493
and descends into paralysis and polarization?

00:12:18.493 --> 00:12:20.244
A simple change to the legislative calendar,

00:12:20.244 --> 00:12:22.571
such as having business stretch out for three weeks

00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:24.134
and then they get a week off to go home,

00:12:24.134 --> 00:12:27.459
that would change the fundamental relationships in Congress.

00:12:27.459 --> 00:12:30.595
So there's a lot we can do, but who's going to push them to do it?

00:12:30.595 --> 00:12:32.979
There are a number of groups that are working on this.

00:12:32.979 --> 00:12:35.131
No Labels and Common Cause, I think,

00:12:35.131 --> 00:12:37.270
have very good ideas for changes we need to do

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.435
to make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective.

00:12:40.435 --> 00:12:42.258
But I'd like to supplement their work

00:12:42.258 --> 00:12:46.322
with a little psychological trick, and the trick is this.

00:12:46.322 --> 00:12:49.372
Nothing pulls people together like a common threat

00:12:49.372 --> 00:12:53.165
or a common attack, especially an attack from a foreign enemy,

00:12:53.165 --> 00:12:58.487
unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology,

00:12:58.487 --> 00:13:01.441
in which case, as I said before, it can actually pull us apart.

00:13:01.441 --> 00:13:04.364
Sometimes a single threat can polarize us, as we saw.

00:13:04.364 --> 00:13:07.474
But what if the situation we face is not a single threat

00:13:07.474 --> 00:13:09.311
but is actually more like this,

00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:10.741
where there's just so much stuff coming in,

00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:12.822
it's just, "Start shooting, come on, everybody,

00:13:12.822 --> 00:13:15.072
we've got to just work together, just start shooting."

00:13:15.072 --> 00:13:17.697
Because actually, we do face this situation.

00:13:17.697 --> 00:13:20.233
This is where we are as a country.

00:13:20.233 --> 00:13:22.427
So here's another asteroid.

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.103
We've all seen versions of this graph, right,

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:27.937
which shows the changes in wealth since 1979,

00:13:27.937 --> 00:13:30.536
and as you can see, almost all the gains in wealth

00:13:30.536 --> 00:13:35.430
have gone to the top 20 percent, and especially the top one percent.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.558
Rising inequality like this is associated

00:13:37.558 --> 00:13:40.231
with so many problems for a democracy.

00:13:40.231 --> 00:13:43.199
Especially, it destroys our ability to trust each other,

00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:46.652
to feel that we're all in the same boat, because it's obvious we're not.

00:13:46.652 --> 00:13:49.610
Some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.200
Other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.252
We're not all in the same boat, and that means

00:13:53.252 --> 00:13:58.161
nobody's willing to sacrifice for the common good.

00:13:58.161 --> 00:14:01.037
The left has been screaming about this asteroid for 30 years now,

00:14:01.037 --> 00:14:05.979
and the right says, "Huh, what? Hmm? No problem. No problem."

00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:08.558
Now,

00:14:08.558 --> 00:14:10.907
why is that happening to us? Why is the inequality rising?

00:14:10.907 --> 00:14:14.525
Well, one of the largest causes, after globalization,

00:14:14.525 --> 00:14:17.371
is actually this fourth asteroid,

00:14:17.371 --> 00:14:19.346
rising non-marital births.

00:14:19.346 --> 00:14:22.282
This graph shows the steady rise of out-of-wedlock births

00:14:22.282 --> 00:14:24.260
since the 1960s.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.539
Most Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers.

00:14:27.539 --> 00:14:29.947
Whites are headed that way too.

00:14:29.947 --> 00:14:32.292
Within a decade or two, most American children

00:14:32.292 --> 00:14:35.161
will be born into homes with no father.

00:14:35.161 --> 00:14:37.515
This means that there's much less money coming into the house.

00:14:37.515 --> 00:14:41.473
But it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos.

00:14:41.473 --> 00:14:43.708
As I know from working with street children in Brazil,

00:14:43.708 --> 00:14:48.770
Mom's boyfriend is often a really, really dangerous person for kids.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.787
Now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s,

00:14:52.787 --> 00:14:56.666
and the left has been saying, "It's not a problem. It's not a problem."

00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:58.372
The left has been very reluctant to say

00:14:58.372 --> 00:15:01.977
that marriage is actually good for women and for children.

00:15:01.977 --> 00:15:03.938
Now let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here.

00:15:03.938 --> 00:15:05.432
I'm actually more critical of the men

00:15:05.432 --> 00:15:07.425
who won't take responsibility for their own children

00:15:07.425 --> 00:15:10.256
and of an economic system that makes it difficult

00:15:10.256 --> 00:15:13.489
for many men to earn enough money to support those children.

00:15:13.489 --> 00:15:17.857
But even if you blame nobody, it still is a national problem,

00:15:17.857 --> 00:15:21.592
and one side has been more concerned about it than the other.

00:15:21.592 --> 00:15:23.825
The New York Times finally noticed this asteroid

00:15:23.825 --> 00:15:26.105
with a front-page story last July

00:15:26.105 --> 00:15:30.319
showing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality.

00:15:30.319 --> 00:15:33.913
We are becoming a nation of just two classes.

00:15:33.913 --> 00:15:36.655
When Americans go to college and marry each other,

00:15:36.655 --> 00:15:39.355
they have very low divorce rates.

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:42.400
They earn a lot of money, they invest that money in their kids,

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.943
some of them become tiger mothers,

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.619
the kids rise to their full potential,

00:15:45.619 --> 00:15:48.042
and the kids go on to become

00:15:48.042 --> 00:15:52.333
the top two lines in this graph.

00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:54.963
And then there's everybody else:

00:15:54.963 --> 00:15:58.207
the children who don't benefit from a stable marriage,

00:15:58.207 --> 00:15:59.910
who don't have as much invested in them,

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.694
who don't grow up in a stable environment,

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:06.652
and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph.

00:16:06.652 --> 00:16:10.217
So once again, we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing.

00:16:10.217 --> 00:16:13.231
As before, we've got a problem, we've got to start working on this,

00:16:13.231 --> 00:16:15.263
we've got to do something,

00:16:15.263 --> 00:16:17.903
and what's wrong with you people that you don't see my threat?

00:16:17.903 --> 00:16:21.705
But if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders,

00:16:21.705 --> 00:16:24.308
we'd see that these two problems actually

00:16:24.308 --> 00:16:27.055
are best addressed together.

00:16:27.055 --> 00:16:28.798
Because if you really care about income inequality,

00:16:28.798 --> 00:16:31.105
you might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups

00:16:31.105 --> 00:16:34.236
that are working on ways to promote marriage.

00:16:34.236 --> 00:16:36.442
But then you're going to run smack into the problem

00:16:36.442 --> 00:16:38.970
that women don't generally want to marry someone

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.322
who doesn't have a job.

00:16:41.322 --> 00:16:43.135
So if you really care about strengthening families,

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:44.796
you might want to talk to some liberal groups

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:48.202
who are working on promoting educational equality,

00:16:48.202 --> 00:16:49.962
who are working on raising the minimum wage,

00:16:49.962 --> 00:16:52.802
who are working on finding ways to stop so many men

00:16:52.802 --> 00:16:54.841
from being sucked into the criminal justice system and

00:16:54.841 --> 00:16:58.195
taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives.

00:16:58.195 --> 00:17:04.043
So to conclude, there are at least four asteroids headed our way.

00:17:04.043 --> 00:17:06.835
How many of you can see all four?

00:17:06.835 --> 00:17:09.450
Please raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.443
that all four of these are national problems.

00:17:12.443 --> 00:17:14.300
Please raise your hands.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.947
Okay, almost all of you.

00:17:15.947 --> 00:17:18.789
Well, congratulations, you guys are the inaugural members

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:22.052
of the Asteroids Club, which is a club

00:17:22.052 --> 00:17:25.293
for all Americans who are willing to admit

00:17:25.293 --> 00:17:28.196
that the other side actually might have a point.

00:17:28.196 --> 00:17:31.227
In the Asteroids Club, we don't start by looking for common ground.

00:17:31.227 --> 00:17:33.121
Common ground is often very hard to find.

00:17:33.121 --> 00:17:35.305
No, we start by looking for common threats

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:38.974
because common threats make common ground.

00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:42.798
Now, am I being naive? Is it naive to think

00:17:42.798 --> 00:17:44.169
that people could ever lay down their swords,

00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:47.775
and left and right could actually work together?

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:50.262
I don't think so, because it happens,

00:17:50.262 --> 00:17:54.126
not all that often, but there are a variety of examples that point the way.

00:17:54.126 --> 00:17:55.565
This is something we can do.

00:17:55.565 --> 00:17:59.600
Because Americans on both sides care about the decline in civility,

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.351
and they've formed dozens of organizations,

00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:03.524
at the national level, such as this one,

00:18:03.524 --> 00:18:05.172
down to many local organizations,

00:18:05.172 --> 00:18:07.530
such as To The Village Square in Tallahassee, Florida,

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.005
which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate

00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:13.451
that sort of working together human relationship

00:18:13.451 --> 00:18:16.491
that's necessary to solve Florida's problems.

00:18:16.491 --> 00:18:20.886
Americans on both sides care about global poverty and AIDS,

00:18:20.886 --> 00:18:23.782
and on so many humanitarian issues,

00:18:23.782 --> 00:18:26.806
liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies,

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:28.689
and at times they really have worked together

00:18:28.689 --> 00:18:30.606
to solve these problems.

00:18:30.606 --> 00:18:33.329
And most surprisingly to me, they sometimes can even see

00:18:33.329 --> 00:18:35.325
eye to eye on criminal justice.

00:18:35.325 --> 00:18:39.278
For example, the incarceration rate, the prison population

00:18:39.278 --> 00:18:43.231
in this country has quadrupled since 1980.

00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:45.815
Now this is a social disaster,

00:18:45.815 --> 00:18:47.867
and liberals are very concerned about this.

00:18:47.867 --> 00:18:50.654
The Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting

00:18:50.654 --> 00:18:53.526
the prison-industrial complex, fighting to prevent a system

00:18:53.526 --> 00:18:56.304
that's just sucking in more and more poor young men.

00:18:56.304 --> 00:18:58.637
But are conservatives happy about this?

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:01.719
Well, Grover Norquist isn't, because this system

00:19:01.719 --> 00:19:04.791
costs an unbelievable amount of money.

00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:07.370
And so, because the prison-industrial complex

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.607
is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls,

00:19:11.607 --> 00:19:15.339
groups of fiscal conservatives and Christian conservatives

00:19:15.339 --> 00:19:19.171
have come together to form a group called Right on Crime.

00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:21.827
And at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.805
to oppose the building of new prisons

00:19:23.805 --> 00:19:27.146
and to work for reforms that will make the justice system

00:19:27.146 --> 00:19:30.267
more efficient and more humane.

00:19:30.267 --> 00:19:33.562
So this is possible. We can do it.

00:19:33.562 --> 00:19:36.643
Let us therefore go to battle stations,

00:19:36.643 --> 00:19:37.902
not to fight each other,

00:19:37.902 --> 00:19:41.228
but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids.

00:19:41.228 --> 00:19:44.299
And let our first mission be to press Congress

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:48.242
to reform itself, before it's too late for our nation.

00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:52.242
Thank you. (Applause)
