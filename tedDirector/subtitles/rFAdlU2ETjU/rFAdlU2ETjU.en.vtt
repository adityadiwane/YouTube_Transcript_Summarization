00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Is there anything unique about human beings?

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
There is.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
We're the only creatures

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
with fully developed moral sentiments.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
We're obsessed with morality as social creatures.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
We need to know why people are doing what they're doing.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And I personally am obsessed with morality.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
It was all due to this woman,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Sister Mary Marastela,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
also known as my mom.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
As an altar boy, I breathed in a lot of incense,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
and I learned to say phrases in Latin,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
but I also had time to think

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
about whether my mother's top-down morality

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
applied to everybody.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
I saw that people who were religious and non-religious

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
were equally obsessed with morality.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
I thought, maybe there's some earthly basis

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
for moral decisions.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
But I wanted to go further

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
than to say our brains make us moral.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I want to know if there's a chemistry of morality.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
I want to know

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
if there was a moral molecule.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
After 10 years of experiments,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
I found it.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Would you like to see it? I brought some with me.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
This little syringe

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
contains the moral molecule.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
(Laughter)

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
It's called oxytocin.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
found only in mammals.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
In rodents, it was known

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
to make mothers care for their offspring,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and in some creatures,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
allowed for toleration of burrowmates.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
But in humans, it was only known

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and is released by both sexes during sex.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
I did what most of us do -- I tried it on some colleagues.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
One of them told me,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
"Paul, that is the world's stupidist idea.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
It is," he said, "only a female molecule.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
It can't be that important."

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
But I countered, "Well men's brains make this too.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
There must be a reason why."

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
But he was right, it was a stupid idea.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
But it was testably stupid.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
In other words, I thought I could design an experiment

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
to see if oxytocin made people moral.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
Turns out it wasn't so easy.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
First of all, oxytocin is a shy molecule.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Baseline levels are near zero,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
without some stimulus to cause its release.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
And when it's produced, it has a three-minute half-life,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and degrades rapidly at room temperature.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
have to grab it fast and keep it cold.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
I think I can do that.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Now luckily, oxytocin is produced

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
both in the brain and in the blood,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Then I had to measure morality.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
So I started smaller.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
I studied one single virtue:

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
trustworthiness.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Why? I had shown in the early 2000s

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
are more prosperous.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So in these countries, more economic transactions occur

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
and more wealth is created,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
alleviating poverty.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
I might help alleviate poverty.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
But I'm also a skeptic.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
I don't want to just ask people, "Are you trustworthy?"

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
So instead I use

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
the Jerry Maguire approach to research.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
If you're so virtuous,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
show me the money.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
So what we do in my lab

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Let me show you how we do that.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So we recruit some people for an experiment.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
They all get $10 if they agree to show up.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
We give them lots of instruction, and we never ever deceive them.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Then we match them in pairs by computer.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And in that pair, one person gets a message saying,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
"Do you want to give up some of your $10

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
you earned for being here

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and ship it to someone else in the lab?"

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
The trick is you can't see them,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
you can't talk to them.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
You only do it one time.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Now whatever you give up

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
gets tripled in the other person's account.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
You're going to make them a lot wealthier.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And they get a message by computer saying

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
person one sent you this amount of money.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Do you want to keep it all,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
or do you want to send some amount back?

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
So think about this experiment for minute.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
You're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and take four tubes of blood.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
So this was the birth of vampire economics.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Make a decision and give me some blood.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
So in fact, experimental economists

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
had run this test around the world,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
and for much higher stakes,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and the consensus view

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
and the transfer from the second person back to the first

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
measured trustworthiness.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
But in fact, economists were flummoxed

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
on why the second person would ever return any money.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
They assumed money is good,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
why not keep it all?

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
That's not what we found.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
We found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and of those who received money,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
95 percent returned some of it.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
But why?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Well by measuring oxytocin

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
we found that the more money the second person received,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
the more their brain produced oxytocin,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
and the more oxytocin on board,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
the more money they returned.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
So we have a biology of trustworthiness.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
But wait. What's wrong with this experiment?

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
Two things.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
but they didn't have any effect.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
But the second is

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
that I still only had this indirect relationship

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
between oxytocin and trustworthiness.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
I didn't know for sure

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
oxytocin caused trustworthiness.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
So to make the experiment,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
I knew I'd have to go into the brain

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and manipulate oxytocin directly.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
I used everything short of a drill

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
to get oxytocin into my own brain.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
And I found I could do it

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
with a nasal inhaler.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
So along with colleagues in Zurich,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
had that same trust test with money,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
we can more than double the number of people

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
who sent all their money to a stranger --

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
all without altering mood or cognition.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.260
So oxytocin is the trust molecule,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
but is it the moral molecule?

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Using the oxytocin inhaler,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
we ran more studies.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
We showed that oxytocin infusion

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
increases generosity

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
in unilateral monetary transfers

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
by 80 percent.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
We showed it increases donations to charity

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
by 50 percent.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
We've also investigated

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
These include massage,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
dancing and praying.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Yes, my mom was happy about that last one.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
And whenever we raise oxytocin,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
people willingly open up their wallets

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and share money with strangers.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
But why do they do this?

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
What does it feel like

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
when your brain is flooded with oxytocin?

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
To investigate this question, we ran an experiment

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
where we had people watch a video

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
of a father and his four year-old son,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and his son has terminal brain cancer.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
After they watched the video, we had them rate their feelings

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
The change in oxytocin

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
predicted their feelings of empathy.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
So it's empathy

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
that makes us connect to other people.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
It's empathy that makes us help other people.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.260
It's empathy that makes us moral.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
Now this idea is not new.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
wrote a book in 1759

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
called "The Theory of Moral Sentiments."

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
In this book, Smith argued

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
that we are moral creatures, not because of a top-down reason,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
but for a bottom-up reason.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
He said we're social creatures,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
so we share the emotions of others.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
So if I do something that hurts you, I feel that pain.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
So I tend to avoid that.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
If I do something that makes you happy, I get to share your joy.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
So I tend to do those things.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Now this is the same Adam Smith who, 17 years later,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
would write a little book called "The Wealth of Nations" --

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
the founding document of economics.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
But he was, in fact, a moral philosopher,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
and he was right on why we're moral.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
I just found the molecule behind it.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
But knowing that molecule is valuable,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
because it tells us how to turn up this behavior

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
and what turns it off.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
In particular, it tells us

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
why we see immorality.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
So to investigate immorality,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
let me bring you back now to 1980.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
I'm working at a gas station

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
on the outskirts of Santa Barbara, California.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
You sit in a gas station all day,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
you see lots of morality and immorality, let me tell you.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
So one Sunday afternoon, a man walks into my cashier's booth

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
with this beautiful jewelry box.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Opens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
And he said, "Hey, I was in the men's room.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
I just found this. What do you think we should do with it?"

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
"I don't know, put it in the lost and found."

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
"Well this is very valuable.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
We have to find the owner for this." I said, "Yea."

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
So we're trying to decide what to do with this,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and the phone rings.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
And a man says very excitedly,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
"I was in your gas station a while ago,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
and I bought this jewelry for my wife, and I can't find it."

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
I said, "Pearl necklace?" "Yeah."

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
"Hey, a guy just found it."

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
"Oh, you're saving my life. Here's my phone number.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
Tell that guy to wait half an hour.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
I'll be there and I'll give him a $200 reward."

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Great, so I tell the guy, "Look, relax.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Get yourself a fat reward. Life's good."

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
He said, "I can't do it.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
I have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
and I need this job, I've got to go."

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
Again he asked me, "What do you think we should do?"

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
I'm in high school. I have no idea.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
So I said, "I'll hold it for you."

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
He said, "You know, you've been so nice, let's split the reward."

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
I'll give you the jewelry, you give me a hundred dollars,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and when the guy comes ... "

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
You see it. I was conned.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
and I was the pigeon.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
So the way many cons work

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
it's that he shows he trusts the victim.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Now we know what happens.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
The victim's brain releases oxytocin,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
and you're opening up your wallet or purse, giving away the money.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
So who are these people

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
who manipulate our oxytocin systems?

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
We found, testing thousands of individuals,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
that five percent of the population

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
don't release oxytocin on stimulus.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
So if you trust them, their brains don't release oxytocin.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
If there's money on the table, they keep it all.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
So there's a technical word for these people in my lab.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
We call them bastards.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
(Laughter)

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
These are not people you want to have a beer with.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
One is through improper nurturing.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
So we've studied sexually abused women,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
You need enough nurturing

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
for this system to develop properly.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Also, high stress inhibits oxytocin.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
So we all know this, when we're really stressed out,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
we're not acting our best.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
There's another way oxytocin is inhibited, which is interesting --

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
through the action of testosterone.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
So we, in experiments, have administered testosterone to men.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And instead of sharing money,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
they become selfish.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
But interestingly,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
high testosterone males are also more likely

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
to use their own money to punish others for being selfish.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
(Laughter)

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Now think about this. It means, within our own biology,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
we have the yin and yang of morality.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
We have oxytocin that connects us to others,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
makes us feel what they feel.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
And we have testosterone.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And men have 10 times the testosterone as women,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
so men do this more than women --

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
we have testosterone that makes us want to punish

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
people who behave immorally.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
We don't need God or government telling us what to do.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
It's all inside of us.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
So you may be wondering:

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
these are beautiful laboratory experiments,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
do they really apply to real life?

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Yeah, I've been worrying about that too.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
So I've gone out of the lab

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
to see if this really holds in our daily lives.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
So last summer, I attended a wedding in Southern England.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
I didn't know a single person.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
and needles and tubes.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
And I took blood from the bride and the groom

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
and the wedding party and the family and the friends

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
before and immediately after the vows.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
(Laughter)

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
And guess what?

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
Weddings cause a release of oxytocin,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
but they do so in a very particular way.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
Who is the center of the wedding solar system?

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
The bride.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride?

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Her mother, that's right.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Her mother was number two.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
Then the groom's father, then the groom,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
then the family, then the friends --

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
arrayed around the bride

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
like planets around the Sun.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
So I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
to connect us to this new couple,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
connect us emotionally.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Why? Because we need them to be successful at reproducing

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
to perpetuate the species.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.260
didn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
So even though I have a fear of heights,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
I recently strapped myself to another human being

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
I took my blood before and after,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
and I had a huge spike of oxytocin.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
And there are so many ways we can connect to people.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
For example, through social media.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
Many people are Tweeting right now.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
So we investigated the role of social media

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and found the using social media

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.260
And they had the reporters and their producers participate.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
And one of these guys, he must have been 22,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
he had 150 percent spike in oxytocin.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
I mean, astounding; no one has this.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
So he was using social media in private.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
When I wrote my report to the Koreans,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
I said, "Look, I don't know what this guy was doing,"

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
They checked.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
He was interacting on his girlfriend's Facebook page.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
There you go. That's connection.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
So there's tons of ways that we can connect to other people,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
and it seems to be universal.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
Two weeks ago,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
I just got back from Papua New Guinea

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
where I went up to the highlands --

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
living as they have lived for millenia.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
There are 800 different languages in the highlands.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
These are the most primitive people in the world.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
And they indeed also release oxytocin.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.260
So oxytocin connects us to other people.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
And it's so easy to cause people's brains

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
to release oxytocin.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
I know how to do it,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
and my favorite way to do it is, in fact, the easiest.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
Let me show it to you.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
Come here. Give me a hug.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
(Laughter)

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
There you go.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:39.260
(Applause)

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
So my penchant for hugging other people

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
has earned me the nickname Dr. Love.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
I'm happy to share a little more love in the world,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
it's great,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
but here's your prescription from Dr. Love:

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
eight hugs a day.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
We have found that people who release more oxytocin

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
are happier.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
And they're happier

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
because they have better relationships of all types.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Eight hugs a day -- you'll be happier

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
and the world will be a better place.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
Of course, if you don't like to touch people, I can always shove this up your nose.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
(Laughter)

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
Thank you.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:28.260
(Applause)
