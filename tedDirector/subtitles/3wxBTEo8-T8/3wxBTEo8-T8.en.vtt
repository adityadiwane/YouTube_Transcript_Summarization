00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.536
In 1987, Tina Lord
found herself in quite the pickle.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.856
See, this gold digger made sure
she married sweet Cord Roberts

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.536
just before he inherited millions.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.776
But when Cord found out
Tina loved his money

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.416
as much as she loved him,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.696
he dumped her.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.616
Cord's mother Maria was thrilled

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.136
until they hooked up again.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.816
So Maria hired Max Holden to romance Tina

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.576
and then made sure Cord didn't find out
Tina was pregnant with his baby.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.496
So Tina, still married
but thinking Cord didn't love her

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.696
flew to Argentina with Max.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.816
Cord finally figured out what was going on

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.360
and rushed after them,
but he was too late.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.416
Tina had already been kidnapped,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.800
strapped to a raft
and sent over a waterfall.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.800
She and her baby were presumed dead.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.336
Cord was sad for a bit,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.816
but then he bounced right back

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.216
with a supersmart
archaeologist named Kate,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.736
and they had a gorgeous wedding

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.056
until Tina, seemingly back from the dead,
ran into the church holding a baby.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.760
"Stop!" she screamed.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.696
"Am I too late?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.800
Cord, I've come so far.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.880
This is your son."

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.896
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.096
is how the soap opera "One Life to Live"
introduced a love story

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.176
that lasted 25 years.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.536
(Laughter)

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.656
Now, if you've ever seen a soap opera,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.576
you know the stories and the characters
can be exaggerated, larger than life,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.856
and if you're a fan,
you find that exaggeration fun,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.080
and if you're not,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.296
maybe you find them
melodramatic or unsophisticated.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.536
Maybe you think watching soap operas

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.816
is a waste of time,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.120
that their bigness means
their lessons are small or nonexistent.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.800
But I believe the opposite to be true.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.000
Soap operas reflect life, just bigger.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.336
So there are real life lessons
we can learn from soap operas,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.176
and those lessons
are as big and adventurous

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.320
as any soap opera storyline.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.896
Now, I've been a fan since I ran home
from the bus stop in second grade

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.616
desperate to catch the end
of Luke and Laura's wedding,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.016
the biggest moment
in "General Hospital" history.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.296
(Applause)

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.656
So you can imagine
how much I loved my eight years

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.656
as the assistant casting director
on "As the World Turns."

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.696
My job was watching soap operas,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.136
reading soap opera scripts

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.936
and auditioning actors
to be on soap operas.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.256
So I know my stuff.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.536
(Laughter)

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.856
And yes, soap operas

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.176
are larger than life,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.896
drama on a grand scale,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.656
but our lives can be filled
with as much intensity,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.440
and the stakes can feel just as dramatic.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.136
We cycle through tragedy and joy

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.096
just like these characters.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.576
We cross thresholds, fight demons
and find salvation unexpectedly,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.576
and we do it again and again and again,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.336
but just like soaps,
we can flip the script,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.616
which means we can learn
from these characters

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.456
that move like bumblebees,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.056
looping and swerving through life.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.336
And we can use those lessons

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.280
to craft our own life stories.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.880
Soap operas teach us to push away doubt

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.776
and believe in our capacity

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.416
for bravery, vulnerability,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.256
adaptability and resilience.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.576
And most importantly, they show us

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.160
it's never too late to change your story.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.096
So with that, let's start
with soap opera lesson one:

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.096
surrender is not an option.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.096
(Laughter)

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.696
"All My Children"'s Erica Kane
was daytime's version of Scarlett O'Hara,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.176
a hyperbolically self-important princess

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200
who deep down was scrappy and daring.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.416
Now, in her 41 years on TV,
perhaps Erica's most famous scene

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.416
is her alone in the woods

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.176
suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.456
She screamed at the bear,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.896
"You may not do this!

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.576
Do you understand me?

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.496
You may not come near me!

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.416
I am Erica Kane

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.056
and you are a filthy beast!"

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.896
(Laughter)

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.576
And of course the bear left,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.416
so what that teaches us

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.496
is obstacles are to be expected

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.240
and we can choose to surrender
or we can stand and fight.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.056
Pandora's Tim Westergren
knows this better than most.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.320
You might even call him
the Erica Kane of Silicon Valley.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.055
Tim and his cofounders
launched the company

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:31.815
with two million dollars in funding.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.560
They were out of cash the next year.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.080
Now, lots of companies fold at that point,
but Tim chose to fight.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.776
He maxed out 11 credit cards
and racked up six figures in personal debt

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.120
and it still wasn't enough.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.536
So every two weeks for two years on payday
he stood in front of his employees

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.280
and he asked them
to sacrifice their salaries,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.496
and it worked.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.336
More than 50 people deferred
two million dollars,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.216
and now, more than a decade later,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.560
Pandora is worth billions.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.816
When you believe that there is a way

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.216
around or through
whatever is in front of you,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.776
that surrender is not an option,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.720
you can overcome enormous obstacles.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.936
Which brings us to soap opera lesson two:

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.000
sacrifice your ego
and drop the superiority complex.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.296
Now, this is scary.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.920
It's an acknowledgment
of need or fallibility.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.896
Maybe it's even an admission

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.600
that we're not as special
as we might like to think.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.536
Stephanie Forrester
of "The Bold and the Beautiful"

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.296
thought she was pretty darn special.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.816
She thought she was so special,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.536
she didn't need to mix
with the riffraff from the valley,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.656
and she made sure
valley girl Brooke knew it.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.856
But after nearly 25 years
of epic fighting,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.760
Stephanie got sick and let Brooke in.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.696
They made amends,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.736
archenemies became soul mates

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.096
and Stephanie died in Brooke's arms,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.640
and here's our takeaway.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.976
Drop your ego.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.896
Life is not about you.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.536
It's about us,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.376
and our ability to experience joy

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.896
and love and to improve our reality

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.936
comes only when we make
ourselves vulnerable

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.096
and we accept responsibility
for our actions

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.496
and our inactions,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.240
kind of like Howard Schultz,
the CEO of Starbucks.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.936
Now, after a great run as CEO,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.256
Howard stepped down in 2000,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.496
and Starbucks quickly overextended itself

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.800
and stock prices fell.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.456
Howard rejoined the team in 2008,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.496
and one of the first things he did

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.680
was apologize to all 180,000 employees.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.240
He apologized.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.776
And then he asked for help,
honesty, and ideas in return.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.376
And now, Starbucks has more than doubled

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.600
its net revenue since Howard came back.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.096
So sacrifice your desire
to be right or safe all the time.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.320
It's not helping anyone, least of all you.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.440
Sacrifice your ego.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.696
Soap opera lesson three:

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.000
evolution is real.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.936
You're not meant to be static characters.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.896
On television, static equals boring
and boring equals fired.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.800
Characters are supposed
to grow and change.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.016
Now, on TV, those dynamic changes

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.296
can make for some rough transitions,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.696
particularly when a character
is played by one person yesterday

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.560
and played by someone new today.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.920
Recasting happens all the time on soaps.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.376
Over the last 20 years,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.256
four different actors
have played the same key role

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.840
of Carly Benson on "General Hospital."

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.856
Each new face triggered a change
in the character's life and personality.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.936
Now, there was always
an essential nugget of Carly in there,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.800
but the character and the story
adapted to whomever was playing her.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.600
And here's what that means for us.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.016
While we may not swap faces
in our own lives,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.936
we can evolve too.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.560
We can choose to draw a circle
around our feet and stay in that spot,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.856
or we can open ourselves to opportunities

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.600
like Carly, who went
from nursing student to hotel owner,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.960
or like Julia Child.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.376
Julia was a World War II spy,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.736
and when the war ended,
she got married, moved to France,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.560
and decided to give
culinary school a shot.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.760
Julia, her books and her TV shows
revolutionized the way America cooks.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.936
We all have the power
to initiate change in our lives,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.920
to evolve and adapt.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.376
We make the choice,

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.976
but sometimes life chooses for us,
and we don't get a heads up.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.176
Surprise slams us in the face.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.336
You're flat on the ground,
the air is gone,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.159
and you need resuscitation.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.135
So thank goodness
for soap opera lesson four:

00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:53.416
resurrection is possible.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.856
(Laughter)

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.720
(Applause)

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.136
In 1983, "Days of Our Lives"'
Stefano DiMera died of a stroke,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.696
but not really, because in 1984

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.456
he died when his car
plunged into the harbor,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.016
and yet he was back in 1985
with a brain tumor.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.056
(Laughter)

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.696
But before the tumor could kill him,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.720
Marlena shot him, and he tumbled
off a catwalk to his death.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.736
And so it went for 30 years.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.256
(Laughter)

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.416
Even when we saw the body,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.656
we knew better.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.280
He's called the Phoenix for a reason.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.976
And here's what that means for us.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.456
As long as the show is still on the air,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.576
or you're still breathing,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.256
nothing is permanent.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.600
Resurrection is possible.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.256
Now, of course, just like life,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.560
soap operas do ultimately
meet the big finale.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.256
CBS canceled my show,
"As The World Turns," in December 2009,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.856
and we shot our final episode

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.080
in June 2010.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.336
It was six months of dying

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.440
and I rode that train
right into the mountain.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.976
And even though we were
in the middle of a huge recession

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.816
and millions of people
were struggling to find work,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.136
I somehow thought everything would be OK.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.856
So I packed up the kids
and the Brooklyn apartment,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.216
and we moved in with my in-laws

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.456
in Alabama.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.560
(Laughter)

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.656
Three months later, nothing was OK.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.896
That was when I watched
the final episode air,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.360
and I realized the show
was not the only fatality.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.240
I was one too.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.696
I was unemployed
and living on the second floor

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.296
of my in-laws' home,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.096
and that's enough
to make anyone feel dead inside.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.016
(Laughter)

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.176
But I knew my story wasn't over,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.416
that it couldn't be over.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.600
I just had to tap into everything
I had ever learned about soap operas.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.896
I had to be brave like Erica
and refuse to surrender,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.120
so every day, I made a decision to fight.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.576
I had to be vulnerable like Stephanie

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.136
and sacrifice my ego.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.200
I had to ask for help
a lot of times across many states.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.216
I had to be adaptable like Carly

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.776
and evolve my skills,
my mindset, and my circumstances,

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.776
and then I had to be
resilient, like Stefano,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.456
and resurrect myself and my career

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.600
like a phoenix from the ashes.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.400
Eventually I got an interview.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.576
After 15 years in news and entertainment,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.536
nine months of unemployment

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.640
and this one interview,

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.040
I had an offer for an entry level job.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.896
I was 37 years old

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.600
and I was back from the dead.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.336
We will all experience
what looks like an ending,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.440
and we can choose to make it a beginning.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.216
Kind of like Tina, who miraculously
survived that waterfall,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.936
and because I hate to leave
a cliffhanger hanging,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.136
Tina and Cord did get divorced,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.920
but they got remarried three times
before the show went off the air in 2012.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.816
So remember,

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.560
as long as there is breath in your body,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.680
it's never too late to change your story.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.696
Thank you.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.520
(Applause)
