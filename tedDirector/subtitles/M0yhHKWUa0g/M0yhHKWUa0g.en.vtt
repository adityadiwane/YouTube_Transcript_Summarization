00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I'm here because I have a very important message:

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
I think we have found

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
the most important factor for success.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.330
And it was found close to here, Stanford.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.330
Psychology professor took kids that were four years old

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.330
and put them in a room all by themselves.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
And he would tell the child, a four-year-old kid,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
"Johnny, I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.330
for 15 minutes.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.330
If, after I come back, this marshmallow is here,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.330
you will get another one. So you will have two."

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
To tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
for something that they like,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.330
is equivalent to telling us, "We'll bring you coffee in two hours."

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.330
(Laughter)

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
Exact equivalent.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.330
So what happened when the professor left the room?

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330
As soon as the door closed...

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
two out of three ate the marshmallow.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
Five seconds, 10 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
two minutes, four minutes, eight minutes.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.330
(Laughter)

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.330
Couldn't do it. Could not wait.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
What's interesting is that one out of three

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.330
would look at the marshmallow and go like this ...

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
Would look at it.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
Put it back.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.330
They would walk around. They would play with their skirts and pants.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
That child already, at four, understood

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
the most important principle for success,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.330
which is the ability to delay gratification.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
Self-discipline:

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
the most important factor for success.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
15 years later, 14 or 15 years later,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
follow-up study.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
What did they find?

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
And they found that 100 percent

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.330
of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
They had good grades. They were doing wonderful.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
They were happy. They had their plans.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
They had good relationships with the teachers, students.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.330
They were doing fine.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.330
they were in trouble.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
They did not make it to university.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
A few were still there with bad grades.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
A few had good grades.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
I had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
react the same way as the American kids?

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
And it was very funny. I used four, five and six years old kids.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
And let me show you what happened.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.330
(Spanish) (Laughter)

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
So what happened in Colombia?

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Hispanic kids, two out of three ate the marshmallow;

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
one out of three did not.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
This little girl was interesting;

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
she ate the inside of the marshmallow.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.330
(Laughter)

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.330
In other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
But she ate it.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.330
So we know she'll be successful. But we have to watch her.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.330
(Laughter)

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
She should not go into banking, for example,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
or work at a cash register.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
But she will be successful.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
And this applies for everything. Even in sales.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.330
The sales person that --

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
the customer says, "I want that." And the person says, "Okay, here you are."

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
That person ate the marshmallow.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
If the sales person says, "Wait a second.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice."

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.330
Then you sell a lot more.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.330
So this has applications in all walks of life.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
I end with -- the Koreans did this.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
You know what? This is so good

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
that we want a marshmallow book for children.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
We did one for children. And now it is all over Korea.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
And we need to learn that principle here in the States,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
because we have a big debt.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
Thank you so much.
