00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Allison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Chris Anderson: No, you can't start the three minutes.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
AH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I mean I'm nervous enough as it is.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Do you know that surgery?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Electric saw, power drill, totally disgusting

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
unless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Anyway, I did have a really big epiphany around the situation,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
so Chris invited me to tell you about it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But first you need to know two things about me.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Just two things.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm Canadian, and I'm the youngest of seven kids.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That means we get our new hips for free.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And being the youngest of seven,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So my hip had been hurting me for years.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I finally went to the doctor, which was free.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That is what free gets you.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and I got a good look at them. And you know,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
even I could tell my hip was bad,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and I actually work in marketing.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So he said, "Allison, we've got to get you on the table.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm going to replace your hip -- it's about an 18-month wait."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
18 more months.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You know, it's such a long wait that I actually

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
started to even think about it in terms of TEDs.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I would not have my new hip for TED2008.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and that's when I had my epiphany.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Oh yeah.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We do not think that way.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
"After you." "Oh, no, no. After you."

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Hey, are you from Canada? "Oh, me too! Hi!"

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
"Great! Excellent!"

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
so he could be back golfing, or gardening.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
No, no. Front of the line.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And I saw a sign.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that said, "Volunteers Needed." Hmm.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Well, they signed me up immediately.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
No reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
They were desperate for volunteers

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Yeah. They needed some young blood.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I worked alone.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I'd casually ask, "What do you do?"

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Then I'd tell them, "Well, I'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
It's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow!"

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
All the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
My next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
right after a shift at the gift shop.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So, naturally, I had my vest and my identification.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And you know, when he walked in,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I could just tell that he saw them.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and a big fat prescription for Percocet.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Now, word on the street was that it was actually

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
my volunteering that got me to the front of the line.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Two reasons.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But also I intend to stick with the volunteering,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Even when a Canadian cheats the system,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
they do it in a way that benefits society.
