00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
So today, I'm going to tell you about some people

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
who didn't move out of their neighborhoods.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
The first one is happening right here in Chicago.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Brenda Palms-Farber was hired

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
to help ex-convicts reenter society

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and keep them from going back into prison.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
Currently, taxpayers spend

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
about 60,000 dollars per year

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
sending a person to jail.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I find it interesting that, for every one dollar

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
we spend, however, on early childhood education,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
like Head Start,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
we save 17 dollars

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
on stuff like incarceration in the future.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
is more than what it costs

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
to send one person to Harvard as well.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
took a look at her challenge

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and came up

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
with a not-so-obvious solution:

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
create a business

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
that produces skin care products from honey.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
that has real potential.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
She hired seemingly unemployable men and women

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
to care for the bees, harvest the honey

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and make value-added products

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
that they marketed themselves,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and that were later sold at Whole Foods.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
She combined employment experience and training

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
with life skills they needed,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
like anger-management and teamwork,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and also how to talk to future employers

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
about how their experiences

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and their eagerness to learn more.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Less than four percent

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
of the folks that went through her program

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
actually go back to jail.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
So these young men and women learned job-readiness

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and life skills through bee keeping

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and became productive citizens in the process.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Talk about a sweet beginning.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Now, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and lots of people know

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
that L.A. has its issues.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
They have not enough water on most days

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and too much to handle when it rains.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Currently, 20 percent

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
of California's energy consumption

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
is used to pump water

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
into mostly Southern California.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Their spending loads, loads,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
to channel that rainwater out into the ocean

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
when it rains and floods as well.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Now Andy Lipkis is working to help

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
L.A. cut infrastructure costs

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
associated with water management and urban heat island --

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
linking trees, people and technology

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
to create a more livable city.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
also helps cool our cities.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Because, come to think about it,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
do you really want air-conditioning,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
or is it a cooler room that you want?

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
So a few years ago,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
L.A. County

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
to repair the city schools.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And Andy and his team discovered

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
on asphalt to surround the schools themselves.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And by presenting a really strong economic case,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
they convinced the L.A. government

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
that replacing that asphalt

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
with trees and other greenery,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
than they spend on horticultural infrastructure.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
was replaced or avoided,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
while employment

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
for people to maintain those grounds went up,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
resulting in a net-savings to the system,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
Now Judy Bonds

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
is a coal miner's daughter.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Her family has eight generations

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
in a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And if anyone should be clinging

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
to the former glory of the coal mining history,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and of the town,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
it should be Judy.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
But the way coal is mined right now is different

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
from the deep mines that her father

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and her father's father would go down into

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Now, two dozen men

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
can tear down a mountain in several months,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
and only for about a few years' worth of coal.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
That kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal."

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
It can make a mountain go from this to this

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
in a few short months.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
Just imagine that the air surrounding these places --

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
this strange little cough

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
after being only there for just a few hours or so --

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
not just miners, but everybody.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and her water poisoned.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
And the coal companies just move on

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
after the mountain was emptied,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
leaving even more unemployment in their wake.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
on an intact mountain,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and one that was reduced in elevation

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
by over 2,000 feet.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
or centuries of clean energy

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
based on technical skills,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and developing local knowledge

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
about how to get the most out of that region's wind.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
She calculated the up-front cost

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and the payback over time,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and it's a net-plus on so many levels

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
for the local, national and global economy.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
but the wind energy actually pays back forever.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
and it gives them a lot of misery.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
The water is turned into goo.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Most people are still unemployed,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
leading to most of the same kinds of social problems

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
that unemployed people in inner cities also experience --

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
drug and alcohol abuse,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Now Judy and I -- I have to say --

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
totally related to each other.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Not quite an obvious alliance.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
I mean, they are not --

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
or anything like that.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
says, "Save the endangered hillbillies."

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
and totally understand that this is what it's all about.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
But just a few months ago,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Judy was diagnosed

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
with stage-three lung cancer.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Yeah.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And it has since moved to her bones and her brain.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
And I just find it so bizarre

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
that she's suffering from the same thing

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
that she tried so hard to protect people from.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
But her dream

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
of Coal River Mountain Wind

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
is her legacy.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
And she might not

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
get to see that mountaintop.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
But rather than writing

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
yet some kind of manifesto or something,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
she's leaving behind

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
a business plan to make it happen.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
That's what my homegirl is doing.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
So I'm so proud of that.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.260
(Applause)

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
But these three people

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
don't know each other,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
but they do have an awful lot in common.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
They're all problem solvers,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and they're just some of the many examples

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
in the examples of the work that I do now.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
I was really lucky to have them all featured

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
called ThePromisedLand.org.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Now they're all very practical visionaries.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
They take a look at the demands that are out there --

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
beauty products, healthy schools, electricity --

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
and how the money's flowing to meet those demands.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
And when the cheapest solutions

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
involve reducing the number of jobs,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
you're left with unemployed people,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
and those people aren't cheap.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and they include generationally impoverished,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
traumatized vets returning from the Middle East,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
people coming out of jail.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And for the veterans in particular,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
the V.A. said there's a six-fold increase

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
I think that number's probably going to go up.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
They're not the largest number of people,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
but they are some of the most expensive --

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
poor performance by their kids in schools

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
and also poor health as a result of stress.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
So these three guys all understand

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
how to productively channel dollars

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
through our local economies

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
to meet existing market demands,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
reduce the social problems that we have now

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and prevent new problems in the future.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And there are plenty of other examples like that.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
One problem: waste handling and unemployment.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Even when we think or talk about recycling,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates --

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
they leave much to be recycled.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models --

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
or you use recycled materials

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
to make goods that you can actually use and sell.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
We can create these local markets and incentives

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
for recycled materials

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
to be used as raw materials for manufacturing.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
And in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
but our mayor decided what he wanted to see

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
was a jail on that same spot.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
Fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs --

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
but after many years,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
the city wanted to build a jail.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
Working-class and poor urban Americans

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
are not benefiting economically

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
from our current food system.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
It relies too much on transportation,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
chemical fertilization, big use of water

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
and also refrigeration.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
Mega agricultural operations

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
that costs us billions in healthcare

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
and lost productivity.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And so we know "urban ag"

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
is a big buzz topic this time of the year,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
but it's mostly gardening,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
which has some value in community building -- lots of it --

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
but it's not in terms of creating jobs

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
or for food production.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
The numbers just aren't there.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
to integrate urban ag and rural food systems

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
in every city,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
that uses regional growing power

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and augments it with indoor growing facilities,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
owned and operated by small growers,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
where now there are only consumers.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
who are losing out because they really can't meet

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
the year-round demand for produce.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
It's not a competition with rural farm;

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
it's actually reinforcements.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
It allies in a really positive

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
and economically viable food system.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
for hospitals,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
senior centers, schools, daycare centers,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
and produce a network of regional jobs, as well.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
This is smart infrastructure.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
And how we manage our built environment

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
affects the health and well-being of people every single day.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Our municipalities, rural and urban,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
play the operational course of infrastructure --

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
things like waste disposal, energy demand,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and the impacts of various public health costs.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
for municipalities to handle

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
both infrastructure and social needs.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
And we want to shift the systems

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
to become part of the tax base.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
And imagine a national business model

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
to improve local economic stability.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
These examples indicate a trend.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
and the good news is that it's growing.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
And we all need to be invested in it.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
And I call it "hometown security."

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
The recession has us reeling and fearful,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
and there's something in the air these days

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
that is also very empowering.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
It's a realization

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
that we are the key

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
to our own recovery.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
Now is the time for us to act in our own communities

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
where we think local and we act local.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
And when we do that, our neighbors --

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
be they next-door, or in the next state,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
or in the next country --

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
will be just fine.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
The sum of the local is the global.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
putting people to work,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
restoring our natural systems.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
Hometown security means creating wealth here at home,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
instead of destroying it overseas.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
Tackling social and environmental problems

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
at the same time with the same solution

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
yields great cost savings,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
wealth generation and national security.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
Many great and inspiring solutions

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
have been generated across America.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
The challenge for us now

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
is to identify and support countless more.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Now, hometown security is about taking care of your own,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
but it's not like the old saying,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
"charity begins at home."

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
I recently read a book called "Love Leadership" by John Hope Bryant.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
And it's about leading in a world

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
And reading that book made me reexamine that theory

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
because I need to explain what I mean by that.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
See, my dad

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
was a great, great man in many ways.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
He grew up in the segregated South,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
escaped lynching and all that

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
during some really hard times,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
But, like all of us, he had some problems.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
(Laughter)

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
And his was gambling,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
compulsively.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
To him that phrase, "Charity begins at home,"

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
meant that my payday -- or someone else's --

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
would just happen to coincide with his lucky day.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
So you need to help him out.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
And sometimes I would loan him money

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
from my after-school or summer jobs,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
and he always had the great intention

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
of paying me back with interest,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
of course, after he hit it big.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
And he did sometimes, believe it or not,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
at a racetrack in Los Angeles --

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
one reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
He made 15,000 dollars cash

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
and bought the house that I grew up in.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
So I'm not that unhappy about that.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
But listen, I did feel obligated to him,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
and I grew up -- then I grew up.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
And I'm a grown woman now,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
and I have learned a few things along the way.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
To me, charity

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
often is just about giving,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
because you're supposed to,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
or because it's what you've always done,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
or it's about giving until it hurts.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
I'm about providing the means

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
to build something that will grow

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
and intensify its original investment

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
and not just require greater giving next year --

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
I'm not trying to feed the habit.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
I spent some years

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
watching how good intentions for community empowerment,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
that were supposed to be there

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
to support the community and empower it,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
actually left people

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
And over the past 20 years,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
on social problems,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
yet educational outcomes,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
malnutrition, incarceration,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
obesity, diabetes, income disparity,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
they've all gone up with some exceptions --

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
in particular, infant mortality

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
among people in poverty --

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
And I know a little bit about these issues,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
because, for many years, I spent a long time

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
in the non-profit industrial complex,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
and I'm a recovering executive director,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
two years clean.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
(Laughter)

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
But during that time, I realized that it was about projects

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
and developing them on the local level

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
that really was going to do the right thing for our communities.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
But I really did struggle for financial support.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
The greater our success,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
the less money came in from foundations.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
And I tell you, being on the TED stage

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
gave everyone the impression that I had arrived.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
And by the time I'd moved on,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
I was actually covering a third

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
And I think because early on, frankly,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
But since then,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
became this little thing.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
But I did in fact get married in it.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
Over here.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
The South Bronx Greenway

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
Since then, we got

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
to come and get here.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
And we love this, because I love construction now,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
because we're watching these things actually happen.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
So I want everyone to understand

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
the critical importance

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
of shifting charity into enterprise.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
I started my firm to help communities across the country

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
realize their own potential

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
to improve everything about the quality of life for their people.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
Hometown security

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
is next on my to-do list.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
What we need are people who see the value

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
in investing in these types of local enterprises,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
who will partner with folks like me

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
as well as understand the growing social costs

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
of business as usual.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
We need to work together

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
to embrace and repair our land,

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
repair our power systems

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
and repair ourselves.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
It's time to stop building

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
the shopping malls, the prisons,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
the stadiums

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
and other tributes to all of our collective failures.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
It is time that we start building

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
living monuments to hope and possibility.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
(Applause)
