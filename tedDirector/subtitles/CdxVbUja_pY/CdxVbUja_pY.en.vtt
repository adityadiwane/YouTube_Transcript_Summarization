00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Well after many years working in trade and economics,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
four years ago,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I found myself working on the front lines

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
of human vulnerability.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And I found myself in the places

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
where people are fighting every day to survive

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and can't even obtain a meal.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
This red cup comes from Rwanda

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
from a child named Fabian.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And I carry this around

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
as a symbol, really, of the challenge

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and also the hope.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Because one cup of food a day

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
changes Fabian's life completely.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
But what I'd like to talk about today

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
is the fact that this morning,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
about a billion people on Earth --

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
or one out of every seven --

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
woke up and didn't even know

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
how to fill this cup.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
One out of every seven people.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
First, I'll ask you: Why should you care?

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Why should we care?

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
For most people,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
if they think about hunger,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
they don't have to go far back on their own family history --

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
maybe in their own lives, or their parents' lives,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
or their grandparents' lives --

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
to remember an experience of hunger.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
I rarely find an audience

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
where people can go back very far without that experience.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Some are driven by compassion,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
feel it's perhaps

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
one of the fundamental acts of humanity.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
As Gandhi said,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.260
"To a hungry man, a piece of bread is the face of God."

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Others worry about peace and security,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
stability in the world.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
We saw the food riots in 2008,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
The destabilizing effects of hunger

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
are known throughout human history.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
One of the most fundamental acts of civilization

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
is to ensure people can get enough food.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Others think about Malthusian nightmares.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Will we be able to feed a population

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
that will be nine billion in just a few decades?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
This is not a negotiable thing, hunger.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
People have to eat.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
There's going to be a lot of people.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.260
This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
But I actually came to this issue

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
in a different way.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
This is a picture of me and my three children.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
In 1987, I was a new mother

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
with my first child

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and was holding her and feeding her

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
when an image very similar to this

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
came on the television.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
One two years earlier

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
had killed more than a million people.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
But it never struck me as it did that moment,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
because on that image

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
was a woman trying to nurse her baby,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.260
and she had no milk to nurse.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And the baby's cry really penetrated me,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
as a mother.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
And I thought, there's nothing more haunting

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
than the cry of a child

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.260
that cannot be returned with food --

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
the most fundamental expectation of every human being.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And it was at that moment

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
that I just was filled

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
with the challenge and the outrage

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that actually we know how to fix this problem.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
This isn't one of those rare diseases

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
that we don't have the solution for.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
We know how to fix hunger.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
A hundred years ago, we didn't.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
We actually have the technology and systems.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
And I was just struck

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
that this is out of place.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
At our time in history, these images are out of place.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Well guess what?

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
This is last week in northern Kenya.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Yet again,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
the face of starvation

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
at large scale

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
with more than nine million people

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
wondering if they can make it to the next day.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
In fact,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
what we know now

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
is that every 10 seconds

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
we lose a child to hunger.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
This is more

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
than HIV/AIDS,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
malaria and tuberculosis combined.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And we know that the issue

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
is not just production of food.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
One of my mentors in life

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
was Norman Borlaug, my hero.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
But today I'm going to talk about access to food,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
because actually this year and last year

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
and during the 2008 food crisis,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
there was enough food on Earth

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
So why is it

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
that we have a billion people

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
who can't find food?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And I also want to talk about

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
what I call our new burden of knowledge.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
In 2008,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Lancet compiled all the research

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.260
and put forward the compelling evidence

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
that if a child in its first thousand days --

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
from conception to two years old --

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
does not have adequate nutrition,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
the damage is irreversible.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Their brains and bodies will be stunted.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And here you see a brain scan of two children --

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
one who had adequate nutrition,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
another, neglected

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and who was deeply malnourished.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And we can see brain volumes

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
up to 40 percent less

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
in these children.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And in this slide

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
don't form.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And what we know now is this has huge impact on economies,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
which I'll talk about later.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
But also the earning potential of these children

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
is cut in half in their lifetime

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
due to the stunting

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
that happens in early years.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
So this burden of knowledge drives me.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
Because actually we know how to fix it

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
very simply.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And yet, in many places,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
a third of the children,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
by the time they're three

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
already are facing a life of hardship

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
due to this.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
I'd like to talk about

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
some of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
some of the things I've learned

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
in bringing my economic and trade knowledge

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and my experience in the private sector.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
I'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
Well first, I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
breastfeeding.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
You may be surprised to know

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
that a child could be saved every 22 seconds

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
But in Niger, for example,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
less than seven percent of the children

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
are breastfed

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
for the first six months of life, exclusively.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.260
In Mauritania, less than three percent.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.260
This is something that can be transformed with knowledge.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
This message, this word, can come out

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
that this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business;

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
it's a brilliant way

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
of saving your child's life.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And so today we focus on not just passing out food,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and teaching them about breastfeeding.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
The second thing I'd like to talk about:

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
If you were living in a remote village somewhere,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
your child was limp,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
and you were in a drought, or you were in floods,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
what would you do?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
Do you think you could go to the store

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and get a choice of power bars, like we can,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
and pick the right one to match?

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Well I find parents out on the front lines

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
very aware their children are going down for the count.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
And I go to those shops, if there are any,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
or out to the fields to see what they can get,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
and they cannot obtain the nutrition.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Even if they know what they need to do, it's not available.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And I'm very excited about this,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
because one thing we're working on

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
is transforming the technologies

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
that are very available

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
in the food industry

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
to be available for traditional crops.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
And this is made with chickpeas, dried milk

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and a host of vitamins,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
matched to exactly what the brain needs.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
It costs 17 cents for us to produce this

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
as, what I call, food for humanity.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
We did this with food technologists

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
in India and Pakistan --

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
really about three of them.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
But this is transforming

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
99 percent of the kids who get this.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
One package, 17 cents a day --

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
their malnutrition is overcome.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
So I am convinced

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
that if we can unlock the technologies

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
that are commonplace in the richer world

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
to be able to transform foods.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And this is climate-proof.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
It doesn't need to be refrigerated, it doesn't need water,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
which is often lacking.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
And these types of technologies,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
I see, have the potential

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
to transform the face of hunger and nutrition, malnutrition

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
out on the front lines.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Eighty percent of the people in the world

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
have no food safety net.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
When disaster strikes --

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
the economy gets blown, people lose a job,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
floods, war, conflict,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
bad governance, all of those things --

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
there is nothing to fall back on.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
And usually the institutions --

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
churches, temples, other things --

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
do not have the resources

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
to provide a safety net.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
What we have found working with the World Bank

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
is that the poor man's safety net,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
the best investment, is school feeding.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
And if you fill the cup

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
with local agriculture from small farmers,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
you have a transformative effect.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Many kids in the world can't go to school

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
because they have to go beg and find a meal.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
But when that food is there,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
it's transformative.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
It costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
But what is most amazing is the effect on girls.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.260
In countries where girls don't go to school

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and you offer a meal to girls in school,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
we see enrollment rates

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
about 50 percent girls and boys.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
We see a transformation in attendance by girls.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
And there was no argument,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
because it's incentive.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
Families need the help.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
And we find that if we keep girls in school later,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
they'll stay in school until they're 16,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
and won't get married if there's food in school.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Or if they get an extra ration of food

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
at the end of the week --

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
it costs about 50 cents --

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
will keep a girl in school,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and they'll give birth to a healthier child,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
because the malnutrition is sent

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
generation to generation.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
We know that there's boom and bust cycles of hunger.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
We know this.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Right now on the Horn of Africa, we've been through this before.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
So is this a hopeless cause?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Absolutely not.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
I'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
Cameroon, northern Cameroon, boom and bust cycles of hunger

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
every year for decades.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
Food aid coming in every year

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.260
when people are starving during the lean seasons.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Well two years ago,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.260
we decided, let's transform the model of fighting hunger,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
and instead of giving out the food aid, we put it into food banks.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
And we said, listen,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
during the lean season, take the food out.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
You manage, the village manages these warehouses.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
And during harvest, put it back with interest,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
food interest.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.260
So add in five percent, 10 percent more food.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
For the past two years,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
500 of these villages where these are

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
have not needed any food aid -- they're self-sufficient.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
And the food banks are growing.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
And they're starting school feeding programs for their children

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
by the people in the village.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
But they've never had the ability

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
to build even the basic infrastructure

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
or the resources.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
I love this idea that came from the village level:

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
three keys to unlock that warehouse.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
Food is gold there.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
And simple ideas can transform the face,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
not of small areas,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
of big areas of the world.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.260
I'd like to talk about what I call digital food.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Technology is transforming

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
the face of food vulnerability

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
in places where you see classic famine.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Amartya Sen won his Nobel Prize

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.260
for saying, "Guess what, famines happen in the presence of food

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
because people have no ability to buy it."

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
We certainly saw that in 2008.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
over last year.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Food can be there and people can't buy it.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Well this picture -- I was in Hebron in a small shop, this shop,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
where instead of bringing in food,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
we provide digital food, a card.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
It says "bon appetit" in Arabic.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And the women can go in and swipe

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
and get nine food items.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
They have to be nutritious,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
and they have to be locally produced.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
And what's happened in the past year alone

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
is the dairy industry --

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
where this card's used for milk and yogurt

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
and eggs and hummus --

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
the dairy industry has gone up 30 percent.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
The shopkeepers are hiring more people.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
It is a win-win-win situation

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
that starts the food economy moving.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
We now deliver food in over 30 countries

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
over cell phones,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.260
transforming even the presence of refugees in countries,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
and other ways.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
Perhaps most exciting to me

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
is an idea that Bill Gates, Howard Buffett and others

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
have supported boldly,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
which is to ask the question:

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
What if, instead of looking at the hungry as victims --

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
and most of them are small farmers

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
who cannot raise enough food or sell food

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
to even support their own families --

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
what if we view them as the solution,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
as the value chain to fight hunger?

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:13.260
What if from the women in Africa

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
who cannot sell any food --

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
there's no roads, there's no warehouses,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
there's not even a tarp to pick the food up with --

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
what if we give the enabling environment

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
for them to provide the food

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
to feed the hungry children elsewhere?

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
And Purchasing for Progress today is in 21 countries.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
And guess what?

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
In virtually every case,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market --

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
if you say, "We will buy 300 metric tons of this.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
We'll pick it up. We'll make sure it's stored properly." --

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
their yields have gone up two-, three-, fourfold

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
and they figure it out,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
because it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
And we're seeing people transform their lives.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
Today, food aid, our food aid --

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
huge engine --

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
80 percent of it is bought in the developing world.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
Total transformation

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.260
that can actually transform the very lives that need the food.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
Now you'd ask, can this be done at scale?

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
These are great ideas, village-level ideas.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
Well I'd like to talk about Brazil,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
faster than any nation on Earth right now.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
And what I've found is,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
rather than investing their money in food subsidies

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
and other things,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
they invested in a school feeding program.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
And they require that a third of that food

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
And they're doing this at huge scale

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
after President Lula declared his goal

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
of ensuring everyone had three meals a day.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.260
And this zero hunger program

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
costs .5 percent of GDP

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.260
and has lifted many millions of people

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
out of hunger and poverty.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
and it's at scale, and it's creating opportunities.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
I've gone out there; I've met with the small farmers

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
who have built their livelihoods

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
on the opportunity and platform

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
provided by this.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
Now if we look at the economic imperative here,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
this isn't just about compassion.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
The fact is studies show

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
that the cost of malnutrition and hunger --

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
the cost to society,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
the burden it has to bear --

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
is on average six percent,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
and in some countries up to 11 percent,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
of GDP a year.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
And if you look at the 36 countries

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
with the highest burden of malnutrition,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
that's 260 billion lost from a productive economy

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
every year.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
Well, the World Bank estimates

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
it would take about 10 billion dollars --

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
10.3 --

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
to address malnutrition in those countries.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
You look at the cost-benefit analysis,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
and my dream is to take this issue,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
not just from the compassion argument,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
but to the finance ministers of the world,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
and say we cannot afford

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
to not invest

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
in the access to adequate, affordable nutrition

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
for all of humanity.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
The amazing thing I've found

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
is nothing can change on a big scale

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
without the determination of a leader.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
When a leader says, "Not under my watch,"

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
everything begins to change.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
And the world can come in

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260
with enabling environments and opportunities to do this.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
And the fact that France

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
has put food at the center of the G20

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
is really important.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
Because food is one issue

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
that cannot be solved person by person, nation by nation.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
We have to stand together.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
And we're seeing nations in Africa.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
WFP's been able to leave 30 nations

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
because they have transformed

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
the face of hunger in their nations.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.260
What I would like to offer here is a challenge.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
I believe we're living at a time in human history

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
where it's just simply unacceptable

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
that children wake up

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
and don't know where to find a cup of food.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
Not only that,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
transforming hunger

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
is an opportunity,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
but I think we have to change our mindsets.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
I am so honored to be here

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.260
with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.260
And I would like you to join with all of humanity

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
to draw a line in the sand

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
and say, "No more.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.260
No more are we going to accept this."

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
And we want to tell our grandchildren

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
that there was a terrible time in history

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
where up to a third of the children

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
had brains and bodies that were stunted,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
but that exists no more.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
Thank you.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:19:03.260
(Applause)
