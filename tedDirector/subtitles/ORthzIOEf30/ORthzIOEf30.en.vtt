Chris Anderson: So Robert
spent the last few years

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.636
think about how weird human behavior is,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.876
and how inadequate most
of our language trying to explain it is.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.276
And it's very exciting to hear him
explain some of the thinking behind it

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.956
in public for the first time.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.076
Over to you now, Robert Sapolsky.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.060
(Applause)

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.476
Robert Sapolsky: Thank you.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.980
The fantasy always runs
something like this.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.956
I've overpowered his elite guard,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.915
burst into his secret bunker

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:45.756
with my machine gun ready.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.676
He lunges for his Luger.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.516
I knock it out of his hand.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.876
He lunges for his cyanide pill.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.636
I knock that out of his hand.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.956
He snarls,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.196
comes at me with otherworldly strength.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.916
We grapple, we fight,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.836
I manage to pin him down

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.420
and put on handcuffs.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.316
"Adolf Hitler," I say,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.180
"I arrest you for crimes
against humanity."

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.796
Here's where the Medal of Honor
version of the fantasy ends

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.676
and the imagery darkens.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.419
What would I do if I had Hitler?

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.740
It's not hard to imagine
once I allow myself.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.676
Sever his spine at the neck.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.076
Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.876
Puncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.036
Leave him alive on a respirator,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.356
tube-fed, not able to speak
or move or see or hear, just to feel,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.636
and then inject him
with something cancerous

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.916
that's going to fester and pustulate

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.876
until every cell in his body
is screaming in agony,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.140
until every second
feels like an eternity in hell.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.340
That's what I would do to Hitler.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.756
I've had this fantasy since I was a kid,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.276
still do sometimes,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.956
and when I do, my heart speeds up --

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.860
all these plans for the most evil,
wicked soul in history.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.916
But there's a problem,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.836
which is I don't actually believe
in souls or evil,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.396
and I think wicked belongs in a musical.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.836
But there's some people
I would like to see killed,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.676
but I'm against the death penalty.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.796
But I like schlocky violent movies,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.596
but I'm for strict gun control.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.676
But then there was a time
I was at a laser tag place,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.580
and I had such a good time
hiding in a corner shooting at people.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.980
In other words, I'm your basic
confused human when it comes to violence.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.916
Now, as a species, we obviously
have problems with violence.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.996
We use shower heads to deliver poison gas,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.116
letters with anthrax,
airplanes as weapons,

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.996
mass rape as a military strategy.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.300
We're a miserably violent species.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.236
But there's a complication,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.636
which is we don't hate violence,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.516
we hate the wrong kind.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.996
And when it's the right kind,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.516
we cheer it on, we hand out medals,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.676
we vote for, we mate with
our champions of it.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.516
When it's the right kind of violence,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.740
we love it.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.996
And there's another complication,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.076
which is, in addition to us
being this miserably violent species,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.900
we're also this extraordinarily
altruistic, compassionate one.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.636
So how do you make sense
of the biology of our best behaviors,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.676
our worst ones and all of those
ambiguously in between?

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.956
Now, for starters,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.276
what's totally boring is understanding
the motoric aspects of the behavior.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.476
Your brain tells your spine,
tells your muscles

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.756
to do something or other,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.716
and hooray, you've behaved.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.396
What's hard is understanding
the meaning of the behavior,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.236
because in some settings,
pulling a trigger is an appalling act;

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.236
in others, it's heroically
self-sacrificial.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.196
In some settings, putting your hand
one someone else's

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.676
is deeply compassionate.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.596
In others, it's a deep betrayal.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.156
The challenge is to understand

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.436
the biology of the context
of our behaviors,

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.060
and that's real tough.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.036
One thing that's clear, though,
is you're not going to get anywhere

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.476
if you think there's going to be
the brain region or the hormone

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.236
or the gene or the childhood experience

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.340
or the evolutionary mechanism
that explains everything.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.980
Instead, every bit of behavior
has multiple levels of causality.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.020
Let's look at an example.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.860
You have a gun.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.116
There's a crisis going on:

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.716
rioting, violence, people running around.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.916
A stranger is running at you
in an agitated state --

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.036
you can't quite tell if the expression
is frightened, threatening, angry --

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.276
holding something
that kind of looks like a handgun.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.516
You're not sure.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.436
The stranger comes running at you

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.196
and you pull the trigger.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.156
And it turns out
that thing in this person's hand

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.380
was a cell phone.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.236
So we asked this biological question:

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.436
what was going on
that caused this behavior?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.356
What caused this behavior?

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.676
And this is a multitude of questions.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.916
We start.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.356
What was going on in your brain
one second before you pulled that trigger?

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.076
And this brings us into the realm
of a brain region called the amygdala.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.036
The amygdala, which is
central to violence, central to fear,

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.756
initiates volleys of cascades

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.036
that produce pulling of a trigger.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.740
What was the level of activity
in your amygdala one second before?

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.076
But to understand that,
we have to step back a little bit.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.676
What was going on in the environment
seconds to minutes before

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.436
that impacted the amygdala?

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.556
Now, obviously, the sights,
the sounds of the rioting,

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.796
that was pertinent.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.036
But in addition,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.516
you're more likely to mistake
a cell phone for a handgun

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.796
if that stranger was male

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.420
and large and of a different race.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.316
Furthermore, if you're in pain,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.516
if you're hungry, if you're exhausted,

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.076
your frontal cortex
is not going to work as well,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.756
part of the brain whose job it is
to get to the amygdala in time

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.060
saying, "Are you really sure
that's a gun there?"

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.756
But we need to step further back.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.956
Now we have to look
at hours to days before,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.956
and with this, we have entered
the realm of hormones.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.116
For example, testosterone,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.876
where regardless of your sex,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.756
if you have elevated
testosterone levels in your blood,

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.156
you're more likely to think
a face with a neutral expression

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.236
is instead looking threatening.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.116
Elevated testosterone levels,
elevated levels of stress hormones,

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.436
and your amygdala
is going to be more active

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.940
and your frontal cortex
will be more sluggish.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.876
Pushing back further,
weeks to months before,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.356
where's the relevance there?

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.916
This is the realm of neural plasticity,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.876
the fact that your brain
can change in response to experience,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.076
and if your previous months
have been filled with stress and trauma,

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.956
your amygdala will have enlarged.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.196
The neurons will have become
more excitable,

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.556
your frontal cortex would have atrophied,

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.380
all relevant to what happens
in that one second.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.796
But we push back even more, back years,

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.316
back, for example, to your adolescence.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.836
Now, the central fact
of the adolescent brain

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.596
is all of it is going full blast

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.316
except the frontal cortex,

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.076
which is still half-baked.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.276
It doesn't fully mature
until you're around 25.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.516
And thus, adolescence and early adulthood

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.676
are the years where environment
and experience sculpt your frontal cortex

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.500
into the version you're going to have
as an adult in that critical moment.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.396
But pushing back even further,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.876
even further back
to childhood and fetal life

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.716
and all the different versions
that that could come in.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.996
Now, obviously, that's the time
that your brain is being constructed,

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.236
and that's important,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.556
but in addition,
experience during those times

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.556
produce what are called
epigenetic changes,

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.236
permanent, in some cases,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.596
permanently activating
certain genes, turning off others.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.116
And as an example of this,

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.156
if as a fetus you were exposed to a lot
of stress hormones through your mother,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.596
epigenetics is going to produce
your amygdala in adulthood

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.556
as a more excitable form,

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.220
and you're going to have
elevated stress hormone levels.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.676
But pushing even further back,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.396
back to when you were just a fetus,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.236
back to when all you were
was a collection of genes.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.636
Now, genes are really
important to all of this,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.396
but critically, genes don't
determine anything,

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.060
because genes work differently
in different environments.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.716
Key example here:

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.876
there's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.556
and if you have that variant,

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:31.236
you are far more likely
to commit antisocial violence

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.236
if, and only if,
you were abused as a child.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.636
Genes and environment interact,

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.276
and what's happening in that one second
before you pull that trigger

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.540
reflects your lifetime
of those gene-environment interactions.

00:08:46.499 --> 00:08:50.116
Now, remarkably enough,
we've got to push even further back now,

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.516
back centuries.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.876
What were your ancestors up to.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.076
And if, for example,
they were nomadic pastoralists,

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.356
they were pastoralists,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.956
people living in deserts or grasslands

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.636
with their herds of camels, cows, goats,

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.716
odds are they would have invented
what's called a culture of honor

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.956
filled with warrior classes,

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.676
retributive violence, clan vendettas,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.956
and amazingly, centuries later,

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.660
that would still be influencing
the values with which you were raised.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.756
But we've got to push even further back,

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.516
back millions of years,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.596
because if we're talking about genes,

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.276
implicitly we're now talking
about the evolution of genes.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.516
And what you see is, for example,

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.036
patterns across different primate species.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:38.476
Some of them have evolved
for extremely low levels of aggression,

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.036
others have evolved
in the opposite direction,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.956
and floating there in between
by every measure are humans,

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.876
once again this confused,
barely defined species

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.140
that has all these potentials
to go one way or the other.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.196
So what has this gotten us to?

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.196
Basically, what we're seeing here is,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.116
if you want to understand a behavior,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.996
whether it's an appalling one,
a wondrous one,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.756
or confusedly in between,

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.316
if you want to understand that,

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.796
you've got take into account
what happened a second before

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.276
to a million years before,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.956
everything in between.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.956
So what can we conclude at this point?

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.276
Officially, it's complicated.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.916
Wow, that's really helpful.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.196
It's complicated,

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.796
and you'd better be
real careful, real cautious

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.156
before you conclude
you know what causes a behavior,

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.940
especially if it's a behavior
you're judging harshly.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.396
Now, to me, the single most important
point about all of this

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.796
is one having to do with change.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:43.196
Every bit of biology I have mentioned here
can change in different circumstances.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.036
For example, ecosystems change.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.476
Thousands of years ago,
the Sahara was a lush grassland.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.116
Cultures change.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.476
In the 17th century, the most terrifying
people in Europe were the Swedes,

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.236
rampaging all over the place.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.436
This is what the Swedish
military does now.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.300
They haven't had a war in 200 years.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.556
Most importantly,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.196
brains change.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.236
Neurons grow new processes.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.716
Circuits disconnect.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.396
Everything in the brain changes,

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:16.620
and out of this come extraordinary
examples of human change.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.836
First one:

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.556
this is a man named John Newton,

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.916
a British theologian

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.676
who played a central role in the abolition
of slavery from the British Empire

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.716
in the early 1800s.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.476
And amazingly, this man
spent decades as a younger man

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.636
as the captain of a slave ship,

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.596
and then as an investor in slavery,

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.756
growing rich from this.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.436
And then something changed.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.996
Something changed in him,

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.276
something that Newton himself celebrated
in the thing that he's most famous for,

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.916
a hymn that he wrote:

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.340
"Amazing Grace."

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.756
This is a man named Zenji Abe
on the morning of December 6, 1941,

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.756
about to lead a squadron of Japanese
bombers to attack Pearl Harbor.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.316
And this is the same man
50 years later to the day

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.916
hugging a man who survived
the attack on the ground.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.356
And as an old man,

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.796
Zenji Abe came to a collection
of Pearl Harbor survivors

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.236
at a ceremony there

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.580
and in halting English apologized
for what he had done as a young man.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.476
Now, it doesn't always require decades.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.196
Sometimes, extraordinary change
could happen in just hours.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.596
Consider the World War I
Christmas truce of 1914.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.756
The powers that be
had negotiated a brief truce

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.396
so that soldiers could go out,

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.316
collect bodies from no-man's-land
in between the trench lines.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.276
And soon British and German soldiers

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.756
were doing that,

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.236
and then helping each other carry bodies,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.916
and then helping each other
dig graves in the frozen ground,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.196
and then praying together,

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.036
and then having Christmas together
and exchanging gifts,

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.276
and by the next day,
they were playing soccer together

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.676
and exchanging addresses
so they could meet after the war.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.676
That truce kept going
until the officers had to arrive

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.196
and said, "We will shoot you

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.716
unless you go back
to trying to kill each other."

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.876
And all it took here was hours

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.236
for these men to develop
a completely new category of "us,"

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.156
all of us in the trenches here

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.956
on both sides, dying for no damn reason,

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.636
and who is a "them,"
those faceless powers behind the lines

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.260
who were using them as pawns.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.700
And sometimes,
change can occur in seconds.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.876
Probably the most horrifying event
in the Vietnam War

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.796
was the My Lai Massacre.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.836
A brigade of American soldiers

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.876
went into an undefended
village full of civilians

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.436
and killed between 350 and 500 of them,

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.316
mass-raped women and children,

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.916
mutilated bodies.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.156
It was appalling.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.436
It was appalling because it occurred,
because the government denied it,

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.836
because the US government eventually
did nothing more than a slap on the wrist,

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:07.116
and appalling because it almost certainly
was not a singular event.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.236
This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man
who stopped the My Lai Massacre.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.876
He was piloting a helicopter gunship,

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.716
landed there, got out

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.796
and saw American soldiers shooting babies,

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.196
shooting old women,

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.116
figured out what was going on,

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.236
and he then took his helicopter

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.236
and did something that undid
his lifetime of conditioning

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.316
as to who is an "us" and who is a "them."

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.196
He landed his helicopter

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.836
in between some surviving villagers
and American soldiers

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.516
and he trained his machine guns
on his fellow Americans,

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.420
and said, "If you don't stop the killing,
I will mow you down."

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.356
Now, these people
are no more special than any of us.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.956
Same neurons, same neurochemicals,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.300
same biology.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.596
What we're left with here
is this inevitable cliche:

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.356
"Those who don't study history
are destined to repeat it."

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.556
What we have here is the opposite of it.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.836
Those who don't study the history
of extraordinary human change,

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.396
those who don't study the biology
of what can transform us

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.916
from our worst to our best behaviors,

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.996
those who don't do this
are destined not to be able

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.900
to repeat these incandescent,
magnificent moments.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.500
So thank you.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.940
(Applause)

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.356
CA: Talks that really give you
a new mental model about something,

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.316
those are some of my favorite TED Talks,

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.060
and we just got one.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.636
Robert, thank you so much for that.
Good luck with the book.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.916
That was amazing,

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.116
and we're going to try and get you
to come here in person one year.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.356
Thank you so much.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.860
RS: Thank you. Thank you all.
