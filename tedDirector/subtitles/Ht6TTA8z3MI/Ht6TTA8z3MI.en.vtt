Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
about the African wilderness

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and protecting the African wilderness,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and so what we've done

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
is we've focused on iconic cats.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And I know,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
in the light of human suffering and poverty

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and even climate change,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
one would wonder,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
why worry about a few cats?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Well today we're here

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
to share with you a message that we have learned

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
from a very important and special character --

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
this leopard.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
like a super long episode of "CSI" --

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
something like 28 years.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
In essence, what we've done

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
we've seen over 2,000 kills

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
by these amazing animals.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
But one of the things that science really lets us down on

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
is that personality,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that individual personality that these animals have.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And here's a prime example.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
baobab tree in Africa,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
the same tree that we found her mother in

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and her grandmother.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And she took us on a journey

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and revealed something very special to us --

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
her own daughter, eight days old.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
And the minute we found this leopard,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
we realized that we needed to move in,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and so we basically stayed with this leopard

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
for the next four-and-a-half years --

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
following her every day,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
getting to know her,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
that individual personality of hers,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and really coming to know her.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Now I'm destined

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
to spend a lot of time

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
with some unique,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
very, very special,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
individualistic

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and often seductive female characters.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
(Laughter)

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Beverly's clearly one of them,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and this little leopard, Legadema, is another,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and she changed our lives.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
BJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her --

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
in fact, more time than even her mother did.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
When her mother would go off hunting,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
we would stay and film.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
20 paces away from us.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
It was frightening,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And of course, we were stunned for a while,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
but when we managed to get our wits about us,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
we looked at it and said, "My gosh,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
what's going to happen with that little cub?

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
She's probably going to forever associate

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
that deafening crash with us."

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Well, we needn't have worried.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
sat next to us, shivering,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
with her back towards Dereck, and looking out.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And actually from that day on,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
she's been comfortable with us.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
So we felt that that day

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
was the day that she really earned her name.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
We called her Legadema,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
which means, "light from the sky."

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
DJ: Now we've found these individualisms

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
in all sorts of animals,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
in particular in the cats.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
"he who greets with fire,"

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
But only by getting up close to these animals

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and spending time with them

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
can we actually even reach out

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and dig out these personal characters that they have.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
BJ: But through our investigation,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
we have to seek the wildest places in Africa.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And right now this is in the Okavango Delta

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
in Botswana.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
But also, our hearts are in our throats

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
a huge amount of the time,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
because we're driving through water,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and it's an unknown territory.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
But we're really there

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
DJ: Now one of the big things, of course,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
everybody knows that cats hate water,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
and so this was a real revelation for us.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
by going where no sane person should go --

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly --

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and just pushing the envelope,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
But we've managed to find that these lions

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
are 15 percent bigger than any others,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
BJ: And then of course, the challenge

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
is knowing when to turn around.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
We don't always get that right,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and on this particular day,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
we seriously underestimated the depth.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
We got deeper and deeper,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
until it was at Dereck's chest-height.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Well then we hit a deep depression,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and we seriously submerged the vehicle.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
We actually managed to drown

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
two million dollars' worth of camera gear.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
We drowned our pride, I must tell you,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
which was really serious,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and we seized the engine.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
is that he who drowns the vehicle

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
gets to swim with the crocodiles.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
(Laughter)

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
You will notice also that all of these images here

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
are taken from the top angle by Beverly --

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
the dry top angle, by the way.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
(Laughter)

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
But all the places we get stuck in really have great views.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and Beverly was able to get a great photograph.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
BJ: But we truly do

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
spend day and night

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
trying to capture unique footage.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And 20 years ago,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
we did a film called "Eternal Enemies"

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
where we managed to capture

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
this unusual disturbing behavior across two species --

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
lions and hyenas.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
And surprisingly, it became a cult film.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And we can only work that out

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
as people were seeing parallels

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
between the thuggish side of nature

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
and gang warfare.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
is doing exactly what his name,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Eetwidomayloh, represents.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
He's focused on this hyena,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
and he is going to get it.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.260
(Animal sounds)

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
But that's, I think, what this is all about,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
is that these individuals have these personalities and characters.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
but we live by certain rules of engagement,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
which mean we can't interfere.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
This sort of behavior has been going on

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
for three, four, five million years,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and we can't step in and say, "That's wrong, and that's right."

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
But that's not always easy for us.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
BJ: So, as Dereck says,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
we have to work through extremes --

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Sleep deprivation is extreme.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
We're on the edge

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
through a large part of the time.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
But, for 10 years, we tried to capture

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
lions and elephants together --

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
and never ever managed

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
until this particular night.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
And I have to tell you

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
that it was a disturbing night for me.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
I had tears rolling down my cheeks.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
I was shaking with anxiety,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
but I knew that [I had] to capture something

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
that had never been seen before, had never been documented.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And I do believe you should stay with us.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
DJ: The amazing thing about these moments --

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
and this is probably a highlight of our career --

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
is that you never know how it's going to end.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Many people believe, in fact,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
not in the lungs,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
and that's when people give up hope,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
or when any life form gives up hope.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
And you can see the start of it here.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
This elephant, against overwhelming odds,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
simply gives up hope.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
But by the same token,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
you can get your hope back again.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
So just when you think it's all over, something else happens,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
some spark gets into you,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
some sort of will to fight --

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
that iron will that we all have,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
that this elephant has,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
that conservation has, that big cats have.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Everything has that will to survive,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
to fight, to push through that mental barrier

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and to keep going.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And for us, in many ways,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
this elephant has become

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
a symbol of inspiration for us,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:51.260
(Applause)

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
Now back to the leopard.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
We were spending so much time with this leopard

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and getting to understand her individualism,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
her personal character,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
that maybe we were taking it a little bit far.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
We were perhaps taking her for granted,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and maybe she didn't like that that much.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
This is about couples working together,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
and so I do need to say that within the vehicle

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Beverly sits on the one side

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
where all her camera gear is,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and I'm on the other side where my space is.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
These are precious to us, these divides.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
BJ: But when this little cub saw

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
that I had vacated my seat

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
and climbed to the back to get some camera gear,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
she came in like a curious cat

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
to come and investigate.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
that she trusted us to that extent.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
But at the same time, we were concerned

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
that if she created this as a habit

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
and jumped into somebody else's car,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
it might not turn out the same way --

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
she might get shot for that.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
So we knew we had to react quickly.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
And the only way we thought we could

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
without scaring her

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make --

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
a hiss and a sound.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car --

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
very innovative.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
(Laughter)

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
But really and truly, this was how

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
this little leopard was displaying

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
her individual personality.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
But nothing prepared us

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
for what happened next in our relationship with her,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
when she started hunting.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
It was like watching a graduation ceremony.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
We felt like we were surrogate parents.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
And of course, we knew now

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
that she was going to survive.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
clinging to the mother's fur

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
did we realize that something very unique

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
was taking place here with Legadema.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
it didn't turn and run.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
So what we watched

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
over the next couple of hours

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
was very unique.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
It was absolutely amazing

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
when she picked it up to safety,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
protecting it from the hyena.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
And over the next five hours,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
she took care of it.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
We realized that we actually don't know everything,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.260
and that nature is so unpredictable,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
we have to be open at all times.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.260
(Laughter)

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
But in fact,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
what we were seeing here was interesting.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
Because she is a cub wanting to play,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
but she was also a predator needing to kill,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
and yet conflicted in some way,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
because she was also an emerging mother.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
She had this maternal instinct,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
much like a young girl on her way to womanhood,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and so this really took us to this new level

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
of understanding that personality.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
They ended up sleeping for hours.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
But I have to tell you --

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
everybody always asks, "What happened to the baby baboon?"

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
It did die,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
DJ: So at this stage, I guess,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
we had very, very firm ideas

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
on what conservation meant.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
We had to deal with these individual personalities.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
We had to deal with them with respect

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and celebrate them.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
to march forward into conservation,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
taking care of the big cats that we loved --

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
to see how well we had all collectively been doing.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
So when Beverly and I were born,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
there were 450,000 lions,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
and today there are 20,000.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Tigers haven't fared any better --

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
45,000

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
down to maybe 3,000.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
all the way down to 12,000.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Leopards have plummeted

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
from 700,000

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
down to a mere 50,000.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Now in the extraordinary time

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
that we have worked with Legadema --

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
which is really over a five-year period --

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
10,000 leopards were legally shot

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
by safari hunters.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And that's not the only leopards

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
that were being killed through that period.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
There's an immense amount of poaching as well,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
and so possibly the same amount.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
It's simply not sustainable.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
We admire them,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and we fear them,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
and yet, as man, we want to steal their power.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
It used to be the time

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
where only kings wore a leopard skin,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
but now throughout rituals and ceremonies,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
traditional healers and ministers.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
And of course, looking at this lion paw

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
that has been skinned,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
it eerily reminds me

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
of a human hand,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
is going to wipe out all the tigers.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
So we have a real problem here,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
no more so than the lions do, the male lions.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
is actually a red herring,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
and they all are actually

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
infected with the same disease.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
I call it complacency --

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
our complacency.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
that we're all aware of, that we condone.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
And that's probably because we haven't seen it

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
like we are today.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
BJ: And you have to know

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
that, when a male lion is killed,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
it completely disrupts the whole pride.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
A new male comes into the area

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
and takes over the pride,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
So we've estimated

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
when one lion is hanging on a wall

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
somewhere in a far-off place.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
DJ: So what our investigations have shown

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
is that these lions are essential.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
They're essential to the habitat.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
If they disappear,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
whole ecosystems in Africa disappear.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
ecotourism revenue stream into Africa.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
So this is not just a concern about lions;

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
it's a concern about communities in Africa as well.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
If they disappear, all of that goes away.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
But what I'm more concerned about in many ways

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
as we de-link ourselves spiritually

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
from these animals,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
we lose hope,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
we lose that spiritual connection,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
our dignity, that thing within us

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
that keeps us connected to the planet.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
of lions and leopards right now,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
it is all about critical awareness.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
And so what we are doing,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
in February, we're bringing out a film called "The Last Lion,"

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
and "The Last Lion" is exactly

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
what is happening right now.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
That is the situation we're in --

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
the last lions.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
That is, if we don't take action and do something,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
these plains will be completely devoid

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
of big cats,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
and then, in turn, everything else will disappear.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
And simply, if we can't protect them,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
and designed our lives by --

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
that conservation was all about respect

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
and celebration --

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
is probably true. That's really what it needs.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
We need it. We respect and celebrate each other

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
as a man and a woman, as a community

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
and as part of this planet,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
and we need to continue that.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
And Legadema?

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
Well we can report, in fact,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
that we're grandparents.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
(Laughter)

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
BJ/DJ: Thank you very much.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:13.260
(Applause)
