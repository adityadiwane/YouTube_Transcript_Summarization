00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.596
Most of us go through life trying
to do our best at whatever we do,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.196
whether it's our job, family, school

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.420
or anything else.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.860
I feel that way. I try my best.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.636
But some time ago, I came to a realization

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.436
that I wasn't getting much better
at the things I cared most about,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.636
whether it was being a husband or a friend

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.876
or a professional or teammate,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.916
and I wasn't improving
much at those things

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.476
even though I was spending a lot of time

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.700
working hard at them.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.396
I've since realized from conversations
I've had and from research

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.076
that this stagnation, despite hard work,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.836
turns out to be pretty common.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.716
So I'd like to share with you
some insights into why that is

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.264
and what we can all do about it.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.476
What I've learned
is that the most effective people

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.476
and teams in any domain

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.140
do something we can all emulate.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.876
They go through life deliberately
alternating between two zones:

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.980
the learning zone
and the performance zone.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.636
The learning zone
is when our goal is to improve.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.756
Then we do activities
designed for improvement,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.236
concentrating on what
we haven't mastered yet,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.716
which means we have to expect
to make mistakes,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.540
knowing that we will learn from them.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.716
That is very different from what we do
when we're in our performance zone,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.036
which is when our goal is to do something
as best as we can, to execute.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.676
Then we concentrate
on what we have already mastered

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.460
and we try to minimize mistakes.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.076
Both of these zones
should be part of our lives,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.356
but being clear about
when we want to be in each of them,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.676
with what goal, focus and expectations,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.516
helps us better perform
and better improve.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.476
The performance zone maximizes
our immediate performance,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.596
while the learning zone
maximizes our growth

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.906
and our future performance.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.196
The reason many of us don't improve much

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.956
despite our hard work

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.980
is that we tend to spend almost
all of our time in the performance zone.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.076
This hinders our growth,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.180
and ironically, over the long term,
also our performance.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.820
So what does the learning zone look like?

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.596
Take Demosthenes, a political leader

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.460
and the greatest orator
and lawyer in ancient Greece.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.715
To become great,
he didn't spend all his time

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.156
just being an orator or a lawyer,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.356
which would be his performance zone.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.000
But instead, he did activities
designed for improvement.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.796
Of course, he studied a lot.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.636
He studied law and philosophy
with guidance from mentors,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.196
but he also realized that being a lawyer
involved persuading other people,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.596
so he also studied great speeches

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.820
and acting.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.756
To get rid of an odd habit he had
of involuntarily lifting his shoulder,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.196
he practiced his speeches
in front of a mirror,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.196
and he suspended a sword from the ceiling

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.956
so that if he raised his shoulder,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.196
it would hurt.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.836
(Laughter)

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.996
To speak more clearly despite a lisp,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.860
he went through his speeches
with stones in his mouth.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.036
He built an underground room

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.196
where he could practice
without interruptions

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.636
and not disturb other people.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.796
And since courts at the time
were very noisy,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.676
he also practiced by the ocean,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.260
projecting his voice
above the roar of the waves.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.916
His activities in the learning zone

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.436
were very different
from his activities in court,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.740
his performance zone.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.796
In the learning zone,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.596
he did what Dr. Anders Ericsson
calls deliberate practice.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.156
This involves breaking down
abilities into component skills,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.076
being clear about what subskill
we're working to improve,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.076
like keeping our shoulders down,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.956
giving full concentration
to a high level of challenge

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.396
outside our comfort zone,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.756
just beyond what we can currently do,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.996
using frequent feedback
with repetition and adjustments,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.996
and ideally engaging the guidance
of a skilled coach,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.076
because activities
designed for improvement

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.356
are domain-specific,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.276
and great teachers and coaches
know what those activities are

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.180
and can also give us expert feedback.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.476
It is this type of practice
in the learning zone

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.396
which leads to substantial improvement,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.780
not just time on task performing.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.956
For example, research shows
that after the first couple of years

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.236
working in a profession,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.596
performance usually plateaus.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.676
This has been shown to be true
in teaching, general medicine,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.396
nursing and other fields,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.156
and it happens because once we think
we have become good enough,

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.396
adequate,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.676
then we stop spending time
in the learning zone.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.876
We focus all our time
on just doing our job,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.116
performing,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.460
which turns out not to be
a great way to improve.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.916
But the people who continue
to spend time in the learning zone

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.076
do continue to always improve.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.516
The best salespeople at least once a week

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.156
do activities with
the goal of improvement.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.956
They read to extend their knowledge,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.396
consult with colleagues or domain experts,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.420
try out new strategies,
solicit feedback and reflect.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.796
The best chess players

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.356
spend a lot of time
not playing games of chess,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.316
which would be their performance zone,

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.820
but trying to predict the moves
grand masters made and analyzing them.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.836
Each of us has probably spent
many, many, many hours

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.396
typing on a computer

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.996
without getting faster,

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.436
but if we spent 10 to 20 minutes each day

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.636
fully concentrating
on typing 10 to 20 percent faster

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.236
than our current reliable speed,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.516
we would get faster,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.556
especially if we also identified
what mistakes we're making

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.540
and practiced typing those words.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.620
That's deliberate practice.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.836
In what other parts of our lives,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.556
perhaps that we care more about,

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.116
are we working hard but not improving much

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.460
because we're always
in the performance zone?

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.356
Now, this is not to say
that the performance zone has no value.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.596
It very much does.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.276
When I needed a knee surgery,
I didn't tell the surgeon,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.956
"Poke around in there
and focus on what you don't know."

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.996
(Laughter)

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.620
"We'll learn from your mistakes!"

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.756
I looked for a surgeon
who I felt would do a good job,

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.420
and I wanted her to do a good job.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.396
Being in the performance zone

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.060
allows us to get things done
as best as we can.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.996
It can also be motivating,

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.596
and it provides us with information
to identify what to focus on next

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.916
when we go back to the learning zone.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.636
So the way to high performance

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.356
is to alternate between the learning zone
and the performance zone,

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.916
purposefully building our skills
in the learning zone,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.340
then applying those skills
in the performance zone.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.396
When Beyoncé is on tour,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.596
during the concert,
she's in her performance zone,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.116
but every night when she
gets back to the hotel room,

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.356
she goes right back
into her learning zone.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.156
She watches a video
of the show that just ended.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.316
She identifies opportunities
for improvement,

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.956
for herself, her dancers
and her camera staff.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.236
And the next morning,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.316
everyone receives pages of notes
with what to adjust,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.316
which they then work on during the day
before the next performance.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.556
It's a spiral

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.156
to ever-increasing capabilities,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.796
but we need to know when we seek to learn,
and when we seek to perform,

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.876
and while we want
to spend time doing both,

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.996
the more time we spend
in the learning zone,

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.260
the more we'll improve.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.580
So how can we spend
more time in the learning zone?

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.036
First, we must believe and understand

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.396
that we can improve,

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.940
what we call a growth mindset.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.916
Second, we must want
to improve at that particular skill.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.876
There has to be a purpose we care about,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.500
because it takes time and effort.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.196
Third, we must have an idea
about how to improve,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.916
what we can do to improve,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.516
not how I used to practice
the guitar as a teenager,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.636
performing songs over and over again,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.140
but doing deliberate practice.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.380
And fourth, we must be
in a low-stakes situation,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.196
because if mistakes are to be expected,

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.236
then the consequence of making them
must not be catastrophic,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.500
or even very significant.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.756
A tightrope walker doesn't practice
new tricks without a net underneath,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.396
and an athlete wouldn't set out
to first try a new move

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.754
during a championship match.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.596
One reason that in our lives

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.076
we spend so much time
in the performance zone

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.180
is that our environments
often are, unnecessarily, high stakes.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.236
We create social risks for one another,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.116
even in schools which are supposed
to be all about learning,

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.276
and I'm not talking
about standardized tests.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.516
I mean that every minute of every day,

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.236
many students in elementary
schools through colleges

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.676
feel that if they make a mistake,
others will think less of them.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.636
No wonder they're always stressed out

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.900
and not taking the risks
necessary for learning.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.836
But they learn
that mistakes are undesirable

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.116
inadvertently

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.636
when teachers or parents
are eager to hear just correct answers

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.316
and reject mistakes
rather than welcome and examine them

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.596
to learn from them,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.356
or when we look for narrow responses

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.596
rather than encourage
more exploratory thinking

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.956
that we can all learn from.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.076
When all homework or student work
has a number or a letter on it,

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.836
and counts towards a final grade,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.436
rather than being used for practice,
mistakes, feedback and revision,

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.660
we send the message
that school is a performance zone.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.116
The same is true in our workplaces.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.156
In the companies I consult with,
I often see flawless execution cultures

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.756
which leaders foster
to encourage great work.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.316
But that leads employees
to stay within what they know

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.596
and not try new things,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.956
so companies struggle
to innovate and improve,

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.180
and they fall behind.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.076
We can create more spaces for growth

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.156
by starting conversations with one another

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.460
about when we want to be in each zone.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.756
What do we want to get better at and how?

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.780
And when do we want
to execute and minimize mistakes?

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.516
That way, we gain clarity
about what success is,

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.620
when, and how to best support one another.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.916
But what if we find ourselves
in a chronic high-stakes setting

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.660
and we feel we can't
start those conversations yet?

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.636
Then here are three things
that we can still do as individuals.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.940
First, we can create low-stakes islands
in an otherwise high-stakes sea.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.196
These are spaces where mistakes
have little consequence.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.676
For example, we might find
a mentor or a trusted colleague

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.876
with whom we can exchange ideas
or have vulnerable conversations

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.276
or even role-play.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.916
Or we can ask for feedback-oriented
meetings as projects progress.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.076
Or we can set aside time to read
or watch videos or take online courses.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.500
Those are just some examples.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.356
Second, we can execute
and perform as we're expected,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.956
but then reflect on what
we could do better next time,

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.236
like Beyoncé does,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.396
and we can observe and emulate experts.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.940
The observation, reflection
and adjustment is a learning zone.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.900
And finally, we can lead

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.156
and lower the stakes for others
by sharing what we want to get better at,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.676
by asking questions
about what we don't know,

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.196
by soliciting feedback
and by sharing our mistakes

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.836
and what we've learned from them,

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.940
so that others
can feel safe to do the same.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.100
Real confidence is about
modeling ongoing learning.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.156
What if, instead of spending
our lives doing, doing, doing,

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.276
performing, performing, performing,

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.580
we spent more time exploring,

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.876
asking,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.196
listening,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.316
experimenting, reflecting,

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.820
striving and becoming?

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.956
What if we each always had something

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.500
we were working to improve?

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.996
What if we created more low-stakes islands

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.220
and waters?

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.116
And what if we got clear,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.516
within ourselves and with our teammates,

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.076
about when we seek to learn
and when we seek to perform,

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.156
so that our efforts
can become more consequential,

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.836
our improvement never-ending

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.140
and our best even better?

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.020
Thank you.
