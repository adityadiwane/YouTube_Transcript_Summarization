00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.307
I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.

00:00:21.323 --> 00:00:26.359
Imagine yourself standing
outside the front door of your home.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.028
I'd like you to notice
the color of the door,

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:32.033
the material that it's made out of.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:40.296
Now visualize a pack
of overweight nudists on bicycles.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.751
(Laughter)

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.449
They are competing
in a naked bicycle race,

00:00:44.473 --> 00:00:47.694
and they are headed straight
for your front door.

00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:49.559
I need you to actually see this.

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:53.320
They are pedaling
really hard, they're sweaty,

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.640
they're bouncing around a lot.

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.691
And they crash straight
into the front door of your home.

00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:04.007
Bicycles fly everywhere,
wheels roll past you,

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.649
spokes end up in awkward places.

00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:12.135
Step over the threshold of your door
into your foyer, your hallway,

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.738
whatever's on the other side,

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:16.975
and appreciate the quality of the light.

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:22.620
The light is shining
down on Cookie Monster.

00:01:24.097 --> 00:01:28.732
Cookie Monster is waving at you
from his perch on top of a tan horse.

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:30.540
It's a talking horse.

00:01:30.564 --> 00:01:35.380
You can practically feel
his blue fur tickling your nose.

00:01:35.404 --> 00:01:39.350
You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie
that he's about to shovel into his mouth.

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:40.976
Walk past him.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.911
Walk past him into your living room.

00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:46.577
In your living room,
in full imaginative broadband,

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:48.879
picture Britney Spears.

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:54.732
She is scantily clad, she's dancing
on your coffee table,

00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:57.045
and she's singing
"Hit Me Baby One More Time."

00:01:57.621 --> 00:01:59.967
And then, follow me into your kitchen.

00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:04.621
In your kitchen, the floor has been
paved over with a yellow brick road,

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:10.028
and out of your oven are coming
towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man,

00:02:10.052 --> 00:02:12.973
the Scarecrow and the Lion
from "The Wizard of Oz,"

00:02:12.997 --> 00:02:15.236
hand-in-hand, skipping
straight towards you.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.806
Okay. Open your eyes.

00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:23.449
I want to tell you
about a very bizarre contest

00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:26.111
that is held every spring
in New York City.

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:29.758
It's called the United States
Memory Championship.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:32.496
And I had gone to cover
this contest a few years back

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.385
as a science journalist,

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.857
expecting, I guess, that this was going
to be like the Superbowl of savants.

00:02:40.648 --> 00:02:43.892
This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,

00:02:43.916 --> 00:02:47.381
widely varying in both age
and hygienic upkeep.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.386
(Laughter)

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.595
They were memorizing
hundreds of random numbers,

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:56.007
looking at them just once.

00:02:56.031 --> 00:03:00.594
They were memorizing the names of dozens
and dozens and dozens of strangers.

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.078
They were memorizing
entire poems in just a few minutes.

00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:06.640
They were competing
to see who could memorize

00:03:06.664 --> 00:03:09.720
the order of a shuffled pack
of playing cards the fastest.

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:12.109
I was like, this is unbelievable.

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:15.085
These people must be freaks of nature.

00:03:15.664 --> 00:03:18.554
And I started talking
to a few of the competitors.

00:03:18.578 --> 00:03:21.918
This is a guy called Ed Cook,
who had come over from England,

00:03:21.942 --> 00:03:24.156
where he had one
of the best-trained memories.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.760
And I said to him,
"Ed, when did you realize

00:03:27.784 --> 00:03:29.442
that you were a savant?"

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.556
And Ed was like, "I'm not a savant.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.888
In fact, I have just an average memory.

00:03:34.912 --> 00:03:37.921
Everybody who competes
in this contest will tell you

00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:40.065
that they have just an average memory.

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:46.958
We've all trained ourselves to perform
these utterly miraculous feats of memory

00:03:46.982 --> 00:03:48.949
using a set of ancient techniques,

00:03:48.973 --> 00:03:51.771
techniques invented
2,500 years ago in Greece,

00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:56.763
the same techniques that Cicero
had used to memorize his speeches,

00:03:56.787 --> 00:04:00.560
that medieval scholars had used
to memorize entire books."

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.673
And I said, "Whoa. How come
I never heard of this before?"

00:04:05.465 --> 00:04:07.901
And we were standing
outside the competition hall,

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:14.291
and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant,
but somewhat eccentric English guy,

00:04:14.315 --> 00:04:18.782
says to me, "Josh, you're
an American journalist.

00:04:18.806 --> 00:04:20.742
Do you know Britney Spears?"

00:04:21.283 --> 00:04:25.372
I'm like, "What? No. Why?"

00:04:26.023 --> 00:04:28.453
"Because I really want
to teach Britney Spears

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:31.357
how to memorize the order
of a shuffled pack of playing cards

00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:33.167
on U.S. national television.

00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:36.270
It will prove to the world
that anybody can do this."

00:04:36.294 --> 00:04:39.670
(Laughter)

00:04:41.523 --> 00:04:44.976
I was like, "Well, I'm not Britney Spears,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.969
but maybe you could teach me.

00:04:47.715 --> 00:04:49.976
I mean, you've got to start
somewhere, right?"

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.611
And that was the beginning
of a very strange journey for me.

00:04:54.005 --> 00:04:56.949
I ended up spending
the better part of the next year

00:04:56.973 --> 00:04:58.767
not only training my memory,

00:04:58.791 --> 00:05:00.727
but also investigating it,

00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:02.735
trying to understand how it works,

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.738
why it sometimes doesn't work,

00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:07.412
and what its potential might be.

00:05:07.436 --> 00:05:09.629
And I met a host
of really interesting people.

00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:11.523
This is a guy called E.P.

00:05:11.547 --> 00:05:13.819
He's an amnesic who had, very possibly,

00:05:13.843 --> 00:05:16.528
the worst memory in the world.

00:05:16.552 --> 00:05:18.321
His memory was so bad,

00:05:18.345 --> 00:05:21.266
that he didn't even remember
he had a memory problem,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.824
which is amazing.

00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:24.802
And he was this incredibly tragic figure,

00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:30.338
but he was a window into the extent
to which our memories make us who we are.

00:05:31.306 --> 00:05:33.933
At the other end
of the spectrum, I met this guy.

00:05:33.957 --> 00:05:37.584
This is Kim Peek, he was the basis
for Dustin Hoffman's character

00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:38.885
in the movie "Rain Man."

00:05:39.282 --> 00:05:43.448
We spent an afternoon together
in the Salt Lake City Public Library

00:05:43.472 --> 00:05:45.603
memorizing phone books,

00:05:45.627 --> 00:05:48.206
which was scintillating.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.963
(Laughter)

00:05:50.987 --> 00:05:55.145
And I went back and I read
a whole host of memory treatises,

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.557
treatises written 2,000-plus
years ago in Latin,

00:05:59.581 --> 00:06:02.255
in antiquity, and then later,
in the Middle Ages.

00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:05.430
And I learned a whole bunch
of really interesting stuff.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.476
One of the really interesting
things that I learned

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.750
is that once upon a time,

00:06:10.774 --> 00:06:17.042
this idea of having a trained,
disciplined, cultivated memory

00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:21.661
was not nearly so alien
as it would seem to us to be today.

00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:26.307
Once upon a time,
people invested in their memories,

00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:30.555
in laboriously furnishing their minds.

00:06:31.976 --> 00:06:33.455
Over the last few millenia,

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.201
we've invented a series of technologies --

00:06:36.225 --> 00:06:38.611
from the alphabet, to the scroll,

00:06:38.635 --> 00:06:40.930
to the codex, the printing
press, photography,

00:06:40.954 --> 00:06:43.221
the computer, the smartphone --

00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:45.776
that have made it progressively
easier and easier

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.606
for us to externalize our memories,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.950
for us to essentially outsource
this fundamental human capacity.

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:58.252
These technologies have made
our modern world possible,

00:06:58.276 --> 00:06:59.713
but they've also changed us.

00:07:00.307 --> 00:07:01.994
They've changed us culturally,

00:07:02.018 --> 00:07:05.152
and I would argue that they've
changed us cognitively.

00:07:05.176 --> 00:07:07.882
Having little need to remember anymore,

00:07:07.906 --> 00:07:10.121
it sometimes seems
like we've forgotten how.

00:07:10.994 --> 00:07:13.549
One of the last places on Earth
where you still find

00:07:13.573 --> 00:07:18.966
people passionate about this idea of
a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory,

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.613
is at this totally singular
memory contest.

00:07:21.637 --> 00:07:23.281
It's actually not that singular,

00:07:23.305 --> 00:07:25.326
there are contests held
all over the world.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.151
And I was fascinated,
I wanted to know how do these guys do it.

00:07:30.264 --> 00:07:34.295
A few years back a group of researchers
at University College London

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:37.045
brought a bunch of memory
champions into the lab.

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:38.325
They wanted to know:

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:41.284
Do these guys have brains
that are somehow structurally,

00:07:41.308 --> 00:07:44.006
anatomically different
from the rest of ours?

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.426
The answer was no.

00:07:47.821 --> 00:07:50.242
Are they smarter than the rest of us?

00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:54.305
They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests,
and the answer was: not really.

00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:57.551
There was, however, one really
interesting and telling difference

00:07:57.575 --> 00:07:59.659
between the brains of the memory champions

00:07:59.683 --> 00:08:02.445
and the control subjects
that they were comparing them to.

00:08:02.942 --> 00:08:05.935
When they put these guys
in an fMRI machine,

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:09.296
scanned their brains
while they were memorizing numbers

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.953
and people's faces
and pictures of snowflakes,

00:08:11.977 --> 00:08:16.833
they found that the memory champions were
lighting up different parts of the brain

00:08:16.857 --> 00:08:18.142
than everyone else.

00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:21.809
Of note, they were using,
or they seemed to be using,

00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:25.933
a part of the brain that's involved
in spatial memory and navigation.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:27.949
Why?

00:08:27.973 --> 00:08:31.628
And is there something
that the rest of us can learn from this?

00:08:33.107 --> 00:08:39.806
The sport of competitive memorizing
is driven by a kind of arms race where,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.889
every year, somebody comes up with a new
way to remember more stuff more quickly,

00:08:44.913 --> 00:08:47.365
and then the rest of the field
has to play catch-up.

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:49.008
This is my friend Ben Pridmore,

00:08:49.032 --> 00:08:51.174
three-time world memory champion.

00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:56.356
On his desk in front of him
are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.444
that he is about to try
to memorize in one hour,

00:08:59.468 --> 00:09:03.523
using a technique that he invented
and he alone has mastered.

00:09:03.547 --> 00:09:06.268
He used a similar technique

00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:13.090
to memorize the precise order
of 4,140 random binary digits

00:09:13.114 --> 00:09:15.165
in half an hour.

00:09:15.189 --> 00:09:16.713
(Laughter)

00:09:16.737 --> 00:09:17.952
Yeah.

00:09:18.833 --> 00:09:21.659
And while there are a whole host of ways

00:09:21.683 --> 00:09:25.694
of remembering stuff
in these competitions,

00:09:25.718 --> 00:09:28.376
everything, all of the techniques
that are being used,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.736
ultimately come down to a concept

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.093
that psychologists refer to
as "elaborative encoding."

00:09:34.577 --> 00:09:37.065
And it's well-illustrated
by a nifty paradox

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:40.673
known as the Baker/baker paradox,
which goes like this:

00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:43.569
If I tell two people
to remember the same word,

00:09:43.593 --> 00:09:45.136
if I say to you,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.763
"Remember that
there is a guy named Baker."

00:09:48.787 --> 00:09:50.269
That's his name.

00:09:50.293 --> 00:09:55.057
And I say to you, "Remember
that there is a guy who is a baker."

00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:56.246
Okay?

00:09:56.714 --> 00:09:59.896
And I come back to you
at some point later on,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.615
and I say, "Do you remember that word
that I told you a while back?

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:05.511
Do you remember what it was?"

00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:08.778
The person who was told his name is Baker

00:10:08.802 --> 00:10:11.863
is less likely to remember the same word

00:10:11.887 --> 00:10:15.165
than the person was told
his job is a baker.

00:10:15.498 --> 00:10:18.585
Same word, different amount
of remembering; that's weird.

00:10:18.609 --> 00:10:20.252
What's going on here?

00:10:20.276 --> 00:10:25.270
Well, the name Baker
doesn't actually mean anything to you.

00:10:25.294 --> 00:10:29.507
It is entirely untethered
from all of the other memories

00:10:29.531 --> 00:10:31.022
floating around in your skull.

00:10:31.046 --> 00:10:34.200
But the common noun "baker" --
we know bakers.

00:10:34.558 --> 00:10:36.359
Bakers wear funny white hats.

00:10:36.383 --> 00:10:37.986
Bakers have flour on their hands.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.296
Bakers smell good
when they come home from work.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.325
Maybe we even know a baker.

00:10:42.349 --> 00:10:44.078
And when we first hear that word,

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:46.618
we start putting these
associational hooks into it,

00:10:46.642 --> 00:10:50.157
that make it easier to fish it
back out at some later date.

00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:55.588
The entire art of what is going on
in these memory contests,

00:10:55.612 --> 00:10:59.424
and the entire art of remembering
stuff better in everyday life,

00:10:59.448 --> 00:11:03.209
is figuring out ways
to transform capital B Bakers

00:11:03.233 --> 00:11:05.098
into lower-case B bakers --

00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:08.410
to take information
that is lacking in context,

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:10.490
in significance, in meaning,

00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:12.040
and transform it in some way,

00:11:12.064 --> 00:11:16.262
so that it becomes meaningful
in the light of all the other things

00:11:16.286 --> 00:11:18.245
that you have in your mind.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.123
One of the more elaborate
techniques for doing this

00:11:23.147 --> 00:11:26.348
dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.840
It came to be known as the memory palace.

00:11:29.228 --> 00:11:31.439
The story behind its creation
goes like this:

00:11:32.687 --> 00:11:37.094
There was a poet called Simonides,
who was attending a banquet.

00:11:37.118 --> 00:11:39.182
He was actually the hired entertainment,

00:11:39.206 --> 00:11:42.302
because back then, if you wanted
to throw a really slamming party,

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:44.934
you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.

00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:50.932
And he stands up, delivers his poem
from memory, walks out the door,

00:11:50.956 --> 00:11:53.060
and at the moment he does,

00:11:53.084 --> 00:11:54.757
the banquet hall collapses.

00:11:56.155 --> 00:11:58.069
Kills everybody inside.

00:11:59.013 --> 00:12:00.935
It doesn't just kill everybody,

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:03.941
it mangles the bodies
beyond all recognition.

00:12:05.053 --> 00:12:07.402
Nobody can say who was inside,

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:09.990
nobody can say where they were sitting.

00:12:10.014 --> 00:12:12.229
The bodies can't be properly buried.

00:12:12.253 --> 00:12:15.516
It's one tragedy compounding another.

00:12:16.873 --> 00:12:18.776
Simonides, standing outside,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.907
the sole survivor amid the wreckage,

00:12:20.931 --> 00:12:25.324
closes his eyes and has this realization,

00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:27.289
which is that in his mind's eye,

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:32.004
he can see where each of the guests
at the banquet had been sitting.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.822
And he takes the relatives by the hand,

00:12:34.846 --> 00:12:37.634
and guides them each
to their loved ones amid the wreckage.

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:42.256
What Simonides figured out at that moment,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.479
is something that I think
we all kind of intuitively know,

00:12:45.503 --> 00:12:50.630
which is that, as bad as we are
at remembering names and phone numbers,

00:12:50.654 --> 00:12:53.653
and word-for-word instructions
from our colleagues,

00:12:53.677 --> 00:12:58.040
we have really exceptional
visual and spatial memories.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.843
If I asked you to recount
the first 10 words of the story

00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:05.469
that I just told you about Simonides,

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.063
chances are you would have
a tough time with it.

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:12.506
But, I would wager
that if I asked you to recall

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:17.227
who is sitting on top
of a talking tan horse

00:13:17.251 --> 00:13:19.267
in your foyer right now,

00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:20.806
you would be able to see that.

00:13:21.758 --> 00:13:23.934
The idea behind the memory palace

00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.521
is to create this imagined edifice
in your mind's eye,

00:13:28.545 --> 00:13:32.608
and populate it with images
of the things that you want to remember --

00:13:32.632 --> 00:13:35.877
the crazier, weirder, more bizarre,

00:13:35.901 --> 00:13:39.748
funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,

00:13:39.772 --> 00:13:42.415
the more unforgettable it's likely to be.

00:13:42.439 --> 00:13:45.185
This is advice that goes
back 2,000-plus years

00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:47.384
to the earliest Latin memory treatises.

00:13:47.766 --> 00:13:48.987
So how does this work?

00:13:49.733 --> 00:13:56.516
Let's say that you've been invited
to TED center stage to give a speech,

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.178
and you want to do it from memory,

00:13:59.202 --> 00:14:03.786
and you want to do it the way
that Cicero would have done it,

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.325
if he had been invited
to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:08.920
(Laughter)

00:14:08.944 --> 00:14:10.715
What you might do

00:14:10.739 --> 00:14:15.269
is picture yourself
at the front door of your house.

00:14:16.344 --> 00:14:21.569
And you'd come up with some sort
of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image,

00:14:21.593 --> 00:14:24.361
to remind you that the first thing
you want to talk about

00:14:24.385 --> 00:14:26.643
is this totally bizarre contest.

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:27.801
(Laughter)

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:29.790
And then you'd go inside your house,

00:14:29.814 --> 00:14:34.529
and you would see an image
of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.

00:14:34.553 --> 00:14:35.798
And that would remind you

00:14:35.822 --> 00:14:38.699
that you would want to then
introduce your friend Ed Cook.

00:14:39.193 --> 00:14:41.636
And then you'd see
an image of Britney Spears

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.448
to remind you of this funny
anecdote you want to tell.

00:14:44.472 --> 00:14:45.977
And you'd go into your kitchen,

00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:48.333
and the fourth topic
you were going to talk about

00:14:48.357 --> 00:14:50.903
was this strange journey
that you went on for a year,

00:14:50.927 --> 00:14:54.236
and you'd have some friends
to help you remember that.

00:14:56.308 --> 00:15:00.086
This is how Roman orators
memorized their speeches --

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.407
not word-for-word, which is just
going to screw you up,

00:15:03.431 --> 00:15:05.494
but topic-for-topic.

00:15:06.137 --> 00:15:08.422
In fact, the phrase "topic sentence" --

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:12.438
that comes from the Greek word "topos,"

00:15:12.462 --> 00:15:13.819
which means "place."

00:15:13.843 --> 00:15:18.030
That's a vestige of when people used
to think about oratory and rhetoric

00:15:18.054 --> 00:15:19.944
in these sorts of spatial terms.

00:15:19.968 --> 00:15:22.274
The phrase "in the first place,"

00:15:22.298 --> 00:15:24.999
that's like "in the first place
of your memory palace."

00:15:25.871 --> 00:15:27.593
I thought this was just fascinating,

00:15:27.617 --> 00:15:29.150
and I got really into it.

00:15:29.174 --> 00:15:31.932
And I went to a few more
of these memory contests,

00:15:31.956 --> 00:15:34.671
and I had this notion
that I might write something longer

00:15:34.695 --> 00:15:37.552
about this subculture
of competitive memorizers.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.290
But there was a problem.

00:15:39.837 --> 00:15:42.885
The problem was that a memory contest

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:46.141
is a pathologically boring event.

00:15:46.165 --> 00:15:49.324
(Laughter)

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:53.317
Truly, it is like a bunch of people
sitting around taking the SATs --

00:15:53.893 --> 00:15:55.600
I mean, the most dramatic it gets

00:15:55.624 --> 00:15:57.933
is when somebody
starts massaging their temples.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.504
And I'm a journalist,
I need something to write about.

00:16:00.528 --> 00:16:03.956
I know that there's incredible stuff
happening in these people's minds,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.725
but I don't have access to it.

00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:08.900
And I realized, if I was going
to tell this story,

00:16:08.924 --> 00:16:11.082
I needed to walk
in their shoes a little bit.

00:16:11.742 --> 00:16:14.833
And so I started trying
to spend 15 or 20 minutes

00:16:14.857 --> 00:16:17.595
every morning, before I sat
down with my New York Times,

00:16:17.619 --> 00:16:19.769
just trying to remember something.

00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:21.790
Maybe it was a poem,

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:25.522
maybe it was names from an old yearbook
that I bought at a flea market.

00:16:26.504 --> 00:16:31.301
And I found that this was shockingly fun.

00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:33.579
I never would have expected that.

00:16:33.912 --> 00:16:37.135
It was fun because this is actually
not about training your memory.

00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:40.155
What you're doing, is you're trying
to get better and better

00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:42.211
at creating, at dreaming up,

00:16:42.235 --> 00:16:45.621
these utterly ludicrous,
raunchy, hilarious,

00:16:45.645 --> 00:16:48.722
and hopefully unforgettable
images in your mind's eye.

00:16:49.254 --> 00:16:50.813
And I got pretty into it.

00:16:50.837 --> 00:16:56.774
This is me wearing my standard
competitive memorizer's training kit.

00:16:56.798 --> 00:16:58.011
(Laughter)

00:16:58.035 --> 00:16:59.436
It's a pair of earmuffs

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:03.412
and a set of safety goggles
that have been masked over

00:17:03.436 --> 00:17:05.518
except for two small pinholes,

00:17:05.542 --> 00:17:10.730
because distraction is the competitive
memorizer's greatest enemy.

00:17:11.944 --> 00:17:14.909
I ended up coming back
to that same contest

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:16.774
that I had covered a year earlier,

00:17:16.798 --> 00:17:18.924
and I had this notion
that I might enter it,

00:17:18.948 --> 00:17:22.249
sort of as an experiment
in participatory journalism.

00:17:22.797 --> 00:17:25.915
It'd make, I thought, maybe
a nice epilogue to all my research.

00:17:26.365 --> 00:17:29.754
Problem was, the experiment went haywire.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:31.683
I won the contest --

00:17:31.707 --> 00:17:32.811
(Laughter)

00:17:32.835 --> 00:17:35.707
which really wasn't supposed to happen.

00:17:35.731 --> 00:17:41.967
(Applause)

00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:46.499
Now, it is nice to be able
to memorize speeches

00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:50.622
and phone numbers and shopping lists,

00:17:50.646 --> 00:17:52.725
but it's actually kind
of beside the point.

00:17:53.162 --> 00:17:54.333
These are just tricks.

00:17:55.006 --> 00:17:59.752
They work because they're based
on some pretty basic principles

00:17:59.776 --> 00:18:01.528
about how our brains work.

00:18:02.063 --> 00:18:05.480
And you don't have to be
building memory palaces

00:18:05.504 --> 00:18:07.742
or memorizing packs of playing cards

00:18:07.766 --> 00:18:12.143
to benefit from a little bit of insight
about how your mind works.

00:18:12.167 --> 00:18:14.358
We often talk about people
with great memories

00:18:14.382 --> 00:18:16.531
as though it were some sort
of an innate gift,

00:18:16.555 --> 00:18:17.834
but that is not the case.

00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:20.841
Great memories are learned.

00:18:22.095 --> 00:18:25.363
At the most basic level,
we remember when we pay attention.

00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:28.695
We remember when we are deeply engaged.

00:18:28.719 --> 00:18:32.861
We remember when we are able to take
a piece of information and experience,

00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:34.967
and figure out why it is meaningful to us,

00:18:34.991 --> 00:18:37.405
why it is significant, why it's colorful,

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:41.393
when we're able to transform it
in some way that makes sense

00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:44.757
in the light of all of the other
things floating around in our minds,

00:18:44.781 --> 00:18:48.558
when we're able to transform
Bakers into bakers.

00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:52.519
The memory palace,
these memory techniques --

00:18:52.543 --> 00:18:53.955
they're just shortcuts.

00:18:53.979 --> 00:18:56.539
In fact, they're not
even really shortcuts.

00:18:56.944 --> 00:18:59.459
They work because they make you work.

00:19:00.277 --> 00:19:03.519
They force a kind of depth of processing,

00:19:03.543 --> 00:19:05.040
a kind of mindfulness,

00:19:05.064 --> 00:19:08.944
that most of us don't normally
walk around exercising.

00:19:09.754 --> 00:19:11.555
But there actually are no shortcuts.

00:19:12.508 --> 00:19:14.540
This is how stuff is made memorable.

00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:18.991
And I think if there's one thing
that I want to leave you with,

00:19:19.015 --> 00:19:25.543
it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't
even remember he had a memory problem,

00:19:25.567 --> 00:19:26.764
left me with,

00:19:26.788 --> 00:19:33.304
which is the notion that our lives
are the sum of our memories.

00:19:34.123 --> 00:19:40.089
How much are we willing to lose

00:19:40.113 --> 00:19:43.762
from our already short lives,

00:19:43.786 --> 00:19:49.358
by losing ourselves
in our Blackberries, our iPhones,

00:19:49.382 --> 00:19:54.244
by not paying attention
to the human being across from us

00:19:54.268 --> 00:19:55.819
who is talking with us,

00:19:55.843 --> 00:20:00.525
by being so lazy that we're not
willing to process deeply?

00:20:02.723 --> 00:20:04.443
I learned firsthand

00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:07.936
that there are incredible
memory capacities

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.976
latent in all of us.

00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:13.442
But if you want to live a memorable life,

00:20:13.466 --> 00:20:15.775
you have to be the kind of person

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:18.172
who remembers to remember.

00:20:18.196 --> 00:20:19.348
Thank you.

00:20:19.372 --> 00:20:23.056
(Applause)
