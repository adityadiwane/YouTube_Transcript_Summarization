00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
we don't understand as much as we think we do.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
I'd like to begin with four questions.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
That's an in-joke, by the way.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
But these four questions, actually,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.330
And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
of audiences of science educators --

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
so that's science teachers -- and also of seven-year-olds,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
and I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
than the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
So the first question, and you might want to write this down,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
either on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paper

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
in your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.330
A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right?

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.330
I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
right? Where does all this stuff come from?

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.330
(Knocks)

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.330
And your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.330
with a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire?

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
And would you be able to, kind of, draw a -- you don't have to draw

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
if you had to do it? Or would you just say,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
that's actually not possible?

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.330
The third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.330
I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.330
but why? And finally, would you be able to --

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
and you can sort of scribble it, if you like --

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
scribble a plan diagram of the solar system,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.330
showing the shape of the planets' orbits?

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.330
Would you be able to do that?

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.330
And if you can, just scribble a pattern.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.330
OK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
as teachers often think, but actually from common sense,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
from experience of the world around them,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.330
from all the things that go on between them and their peers,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.330
and their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.330
And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.330
Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right?

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
(Laughter)

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
I'm not quite sure how he died, actually.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
Was he beheaded in the end, or hung?

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.330
(Laughter)

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
Now, those questions, which, of course, you've got right,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
and you haven't been conferring, and so on.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
And I -- you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
but maybe not in this instance.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.330
A little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.330
Now, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
probably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
and say that actually, it comes out of the ground.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
Now, if that was true, we'd have trucks going round the country,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
filling people's gardens in with soil, it'd be a fantastic business.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
But, actually, we don't do that.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
The mass of this comes out of the air.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.330
Now, I passed all my biology exams in Britain.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
I passed them really well, but I still came out of school

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
thinking that that stuff came out of the ground.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.330
Second one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire?

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
Yes, you can, and I'll show you in a second how to do that.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
Now, I have some rather bad news,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
which unfortunately -- the sound doesn't work in this room,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
so I'm going to describe to you, in true "Monty Python" fashion,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.330
what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
go to MIT on graduation day.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
We chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
from here, and you wouldn't mind too much,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
but it sort of works the same way in Britain

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
and in the West Coast of the USA.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.330
And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
of science graduates, and they couldn't answer them.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
And so, there's a whole lot of people saying,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
"I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.330
That's very surprising to me." And those are science graduates.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
And we intercut it with, "We are the premier science university in the world,"

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
because of British-like hubris.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.330
(Laughter)

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
And when we gave graduate engineers that question,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
they said it couldn't be done.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.330
And when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.330
and said, "Can you do it?" They couldn't do it. Right?

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
And that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.330
it's not some sort of anti-American thing going on.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.330
As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
for teaching people -- we might as well get it right.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
And there are also some societal reasons

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.330
why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
in photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.330
is how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew,

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.330
is how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
That's what plants actually do for a living.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
And, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun:

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.330
we are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
if we don't understand that kind of thing.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
Now, here's how you do the battery and the bulb.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.330
It's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
if you've only seen a circuit diagram,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.330
you might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
So, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
We learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
and it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
and it happens pretty early on.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
By extension, we think to ourselves, "Why it's hotter in summer than in winter

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
must be because we're closer to the Sun."

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
I promise you that most of you will have got that.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.330
Oh, you're all shaking your heads,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
Other ones are kind of going like this. All right.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.330
are spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.330
The Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right?

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.330
It makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.330
we're further from the Sun in summer,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
as it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.330
OK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
If you believe, as most of you probably do,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
that it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
you must have drawn an ellipse.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
Right? That would explain it, right?

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.330
Except, in your -- you're nodding -- now, in your ellipse,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
have you thought, "Well, what happens during the night?"

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.330
Between Australia and here, right, they've got summer

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
and we've got winter, and what --

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
and then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.330
and we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.330
and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.330
So, here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.330
That's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right?

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
And this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
I hope you notice the coincidence here.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.330
What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
right, in their heads, of elliptical orbits

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
caused by our experiences as children?

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
to show that it's not really like that?

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
You'd show them something like this, wouldn't you?

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.330
It's a plan, looking down from above.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
But, no, look what I found in the textbooks.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
That's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
from websites, educational websites --

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
and almost anything you pick up is like that.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
to have a load of concentric circles,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
whereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
isn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
if you've got that misconception in your head, then that

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:08.330
two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.330
So you've -- it's crap, isn't it really? As we say.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
So, these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.330
We do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
and we do it in science as well. So we look, just look --

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.330
and scientists do it, constantly -- we look for evidence

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
that reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.330
So, being I'm in the United States, I'll have a dig at the Europeans.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.330
and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.330
And, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:53.330
there's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional --

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
in that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
from under the sheets in that scene in "Annie Hall,"

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
and said, "God, that's so professional." And that you don't --

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
there's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
and, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation --

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.330
I'll use an example from nearby -- is San Francisco Exploratorium,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
where all the things that -- the demonstrations, and so on,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
are made out of everyday objects that children can understand,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
it's very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
And I know that if the graduates at MIT

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.330
and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
and the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.330
they would have learned how it actually works,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.330
rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
So good interpretation is more about

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.330
things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right?

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
And things that -- where there isn't an extra barrier

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
of a piece of glass or machined titanium,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
and it all looks fantastic, OK?

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
And the Exploratorium does that really, really well.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
And it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:00.330
in other words, the root of the word being of love and passion.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
So, children are not empty vessels, OK?

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
So, as "Monty Python" would have it,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.330
but this is -- children are not empty vessels.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
They come with their own ideas and their own theories,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.330
and unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
right? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
of how the world and universe operates, either.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.330
But this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.330
For example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
of the whole population into digital technology [for television].

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
And it's one of the difficult things

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
it's quite difficult to shift those.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.330
So we're not empty vessels; the mental models that we have

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
as children persist into adulthood.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
Poor teaching actually does more harm than good.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.330
In this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
by children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK?

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.330
Same for gravity, two concepts, so it's -- which is quite humbling,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
as a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after,

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.330
that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
And we collude. We design tests,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
or at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right?

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.330
OK? We collude, and actually if you --

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
if someone had designed a test for me

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
when I was doing my biology exams,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
to really understand, to see whether I'd understood

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
and seeing it go blue,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:30.330
then I might have done better at science.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.330
So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:40.330
Your homework is -- you know, how does an aircraft's wing create lift?

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.330
An obvious question, and you'll have an answer now in your heads.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
And the second question to that then is,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.330
ensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.330
Ah ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right?

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.330
And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.330
So, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
(Laughter)

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
I've always wanted to say that in this country.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
(Laughter)

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.330
Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.330
and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
because it's by fiddling with things that you, you know,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
it's just part of learning that's important.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.330
Thank you very much.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
Now -- oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.330
(Applause)
