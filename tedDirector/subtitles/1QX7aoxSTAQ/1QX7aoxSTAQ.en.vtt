00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I've been in Afghanistan for 21 years.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I work for the Red Cross

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and I'm a physical therapist.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
My job is to make arms and legs --

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
well it's not completely true.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
We do more than that.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
We provide the patients,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
the Afghan disabled,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
first with the physical rehabilitation

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
then with the social reintegration.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
It's a very logical plan,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
but it was not always like this.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
For many years, we were just providing them

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
with artificial limbs.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
It took quite many years

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.260
for the program to become what it is now.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Today, I would like to tell you a story,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
the story of a big change,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and the story of the people

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
who made this change possible.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
I arrived in Afghanistan

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.260
in 1990

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
to work in a hospital

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
for war victims.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And then, not only for war victims,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
but it was for any kind of patient.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
I was also working

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
in the orthopedic center, we call it.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
This is the place where we make the legs.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
At that time

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
I found myself

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
in a strange situation.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
I felt not quite ready

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
for that job.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
There was so much to learn.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
There were so many things new to me.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
But it was a terrific job.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
But as soon as the fighting intensified,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
the physical rehabilitation was suspended.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
There were many other things to do.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
So the orthopedic center was closed

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
because physical rehabilitation

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.260
was not considered a priority.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
It was a strange sensation.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Anyway, you know every time I make this speech --

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
It's something that comes out from the past.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
It's 21 years,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
but they are still all there.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Anyway, in 1992,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
the Mujahideen took all Afghanistan.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And the orthopedic center was closed.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
I was assigned to work for the homeless,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
for the internally displaced people.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
But one day, something happened.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
I was coming back

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
from a big food distribution in a mosque

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.260
where tens and tens of people

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
were squatting in terrible conditions.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
I wanted to go home. I was driving.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
You know, when you want to forget,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
you don't want to see things,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
so you just want to go to your room, to lock yourself inside

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and say, "That's enough."

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
A bomb fell not far from my car --

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
well, far enough, but big noise.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And everybody disappeared from the street.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
The cars disappeared as well.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
I ducked.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And only one figure

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
remained in the middle of the road.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
It was a man in a wheelchair

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
desperately trying to move away.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Well I'm not a particularly brave person,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
I have to confess it,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.260
but I could not just ignore him.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
So I stopped the car

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and I went to help.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
The man was without legs

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and only with one arm.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Behind him there was a child, his son,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
red in the face

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.260
in an effort to push the father.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
So I took him into a safe place.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.260
And I ask, "What are you doing out in the street

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
in this situation?"

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
"I work," he said.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
I wondered, what work?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And then I ask an even more stupid question:

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
"Why don't you have the prostheses?

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
Why don't you have the artificial legs?"

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.260
And he said, "The Red Cross has closed."

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Well without thinking, I told him

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
"Come tomorrow.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
We will provide you with a pair of legs."

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
The man, his name was Mahmoud,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and the child, whose name was Rafi, left.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And then I said, "Oh, my God. What did I say?

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
The center is closed,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
no staff around.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Maybe the machinery is broken.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Who is going to make the legs for him?"

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.260
So I hoped that he would not come.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
This is the streets of Kabul

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
in those days.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
So I said, "Well I will give him some money."

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And so the following day,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
I went to the orthopedic center.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.260
And I spoke with a gatekeeper.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
I was ready to tell him,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
"Listen, if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
please tell him that it was a mistake.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Nothing can be done.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Give him some money."

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
But Mahmoud and his son were already there.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And they were not alone.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.260
There were 15, maybe 20, people like him waiting.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And there was some staff too.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Among them there was my right-hand man,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Najmuddin.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
And the gatekeeper told me,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.260
"They come everyday to see if the center will open."

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
I said, "No.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
We have to go away. We cannot stay here."

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
They were bombing -- not very close -- but you could hear the noise of the bombs.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
So, "We cannot stay here, it's dangerous.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
It's not a priority."

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.260
But Najmuddin told me, "Listen now, we're here."

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
At least we can start repairing the prostheses, the broken prostheses of the people

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and maybe try to do something

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
for people like Mahmoud."

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
I said, "No, please. We cannot do that.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
It's really dangerous.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
We have other things to do."

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
But they insisted.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
When you have 20 people

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
in front of you, looking at you

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and you are the one who has to decide ...

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
So we started doing some repairs.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Also one of the physical therapists

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
reported that Mahmoud

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
could be provided with a leg,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
but not immediately.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
The legs were swollen

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
and the knees were stiff,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
so he needed a long preparation.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Believe me, I was worried

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
because I was breaking the rules.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
I was doing something

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
that I was not supposed to do.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
In the evening,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
I went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
and I told them -- I lied --

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
I told them, "Listen, we are going to start

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
a couple of hours per day,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
just a few repairs."

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Maybe some of them are here now.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
(Laughter)

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
So we started.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
I was working, I was going everyday

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
to work for the homeless.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And Najmuddin was staying there,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
doing everything and reporting on the patients.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
He was telling me, "Patients are coming."

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
We knew that many more patients

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
could not come, prevented by the fighting.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
But people were coming.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And Mahmoud was coming every day.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
And slowly, slowly

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
week after week

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
his legs were improving.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.260
The stump or cast prosthesis was made,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
and he was starting

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
the real physical rehabilitation.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
He was coming every day,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
crossing the front line.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
A couple of times I crossed the front line

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
in the very place where Mahmoud and his son were crossing.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
I tell you, it was something so sinister

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:24.260
that I was astonished he could do it every day.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.260
But finally, the great day arrived.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Mahmoud was going to be discharged

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
with his new legs.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
It was April, I remember,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
a very beautiful day.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
April in Kabul is beautiful,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
full of roses, full of flowers.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
We could not possibly stay indoors,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
with all these sandbags at the windows.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
Very sad, dark.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
So we chose a small spot in the garden.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
And Mahmoud put on his prostheses,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
the other patients did the same,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
and they started practicing

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
for the last time before being discharged.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Suddenly, they started fighting.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
We could hear in the air

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
the bullets passing.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
So we dashed, all of us,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
towards the shelter.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Mahmoud grabbed his son, I grabbed someone else.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
Everybody was grabbing something.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
And we ran.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
You know, 50 meters can be a long distance

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
if you are totally exposed,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.260
but we managed to reach the shelter.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
Inside, all of us panting,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.260
I sat a moment and I heard Rafi telling his father,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
"Father, you can run faster than me."

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
(Laughter)

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
And Mahmoud, "Of course I can.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
I can run, and now you can go to school.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
No need of staying with me all the day

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
pushing my wheelchair."

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
Later on, we took them home.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
And I will never forget

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Mahmoud and his son walking together

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
pushing the empty wheelchair.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
And then I understood,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.260
physical rehabilitation is a priority.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.260
Dignity cannot wait for better times.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.260
From that day on, we never closed a single day.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
Well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
but we never, we never closed it again.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
I met Mahmoud one year later.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.260
He was in good shape --

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
a bit thinner.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
He needed to change his prostheses --

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
a new pair of prostheses.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
I asked about his son.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
He told me, "He's at school. He'd doing quite well."

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.260
But I understood he wanted to tell me something.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.260
So I asked him, "What is that?"

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
He was sweating.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.260
He was clearly embarrassed.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
And he was standing in front of me,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
his head down.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.260
He said, "You have taught me to walk.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
Thank you very much.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.260
Now help me not to be a beggar anymore."

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
That was the job.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
"My children are growing.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
I feel ashamed.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
I don't want them to be teased at school

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
by the other students."

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
I said, "Okay."

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
I thought, how much money do I have in my pocket?

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Just to give him some money.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
It was the easiest way.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
He read my mind,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and he said, "I ask for a job."

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
And then he added something

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.260
I will never forget for the rest of my life.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:03.260
He said, "I am a scrap of a man,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
but if you help me,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
I'm ready to do anything,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.260
even if I have to crawl on the ground."

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
And then he sat down.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.260
I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Legless, with only one arm,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
illiterate,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
unskilled --

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.260
what job for him?

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
Najmuddin told me, "Well we have a vacancy

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
in the carpentry shop."

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:47.260
"What?" I said, "Stop."

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.260
"Well yes, we need to increase the production of feet.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
We need to employ someone

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.260
to glue and to screw the sole of the feet.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
We need to increase the production."

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
"Excuse me?"

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.260
I could not believe.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And then he said,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
"No, we can modify the workbench

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
maybe to put a special stool,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.260
a special anvil, special vice,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
and maybe an electric screwdriver."

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
I said, "Listen, it's insane.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
And it's even cruel to think of anything like this.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
That's a production line and a very fast one.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
It's cruel

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
to offer him a job

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:40.260
knowing that he's going to fail."

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.260
But with Najmuddin, we cannot discuss.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:50.260
So the only things I could manage to obtain

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.260
was a kind of a compromise.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
Only one week --

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
one week try and not a single day more.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
One week later,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Mahmoud was the fastest in the production line.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
I told Najmuddin, "That's a trick.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
I can't believe it."

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
The production was up 20 percent.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
"It's a trick, it's a trick," I said.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
And then I asked for verification.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
It was true.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
The comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
I understood

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
that I was wrong again.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
Mahmoud had looked taller.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:36.260
I remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
He was a new man,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
taller again.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Of course, I understood

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.260
that what made him stand tall --

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
yeah they were the legs, thank you very much --

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
but as a first step,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
it was the dignity.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
He has regained his full dignity

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
thanks to that job.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
So of course, I understood.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
And then we started a new policy --

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
a new policy completely different.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
We decided to employ

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
as many disabled as possible

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
to train them in any possible job.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
It became a policy of "positive discrimination,"

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
we call it now.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
And you know what?

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
It's good for everybody.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
Everybody benefits from that --

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
those employed, of course,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
because they get a job

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
and dignity.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
But also for the newcomers.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
They are 7,000 every year --

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
people coming for the first time.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
And you should see the faces of these people

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
when they realize that those assisting them are like them.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Sometimes you see them,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
they look, "Oh."

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
And you see the faces.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.260
And then the surprise turns into hope.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
And it's easy for me as well to train someone

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
who has already passed through the experience of disability.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.260
Poof, they learn much faster -- the motivation,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
the empathy they can establish with the patient

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
is completely different, completely.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
Scraps of men do not exist.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
People like Mahmoud

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
are agents of change.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
And when you start changing, you cannot stop.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
So employing people, yes,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
but also we started programming projects

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
of microfinance, education.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
And when you start, you cannot stop.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
So you do vocational training,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
home education for those who cannot go to school.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
Physical therapies can be done, not only in the orthopedic center,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
but also in the houses of the people.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.260
There is always a better way to do things.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
That's Najmuddin, the one with the white coat.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
Terrible Najmuddin, is that one.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
I have learned a lot

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
from people like Najmuddin, Mahmoud, Rafi.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
They are my teachers.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
I have a wish, a big wish,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
that this way of working, this way of thinking,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
is going to be implemented in other countries.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:12.260
There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
It is possible and it is not difficult.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
All we have to do

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
is to listen to the people

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
that we are supposed assist,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
to make them part

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
of the decision-making process

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
and then, of course, to adapt.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
This is my big wish.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
Well don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over;

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
not at all. We are going on.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
Recently we have just started a program,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
a sport program --

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
basketball for wheelchair users.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
We transport the wheelchairs everywhere.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
We have several teams in the main part of Afghanistan.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
At the beginning,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.260
when Anajulina told me,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
"We would like to start it,"

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
I hesitated.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
I said, "No," you can imagine.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
I said, "No, no, no, no, we can't."

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
And then I asked the usual question:

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
"Is it a priority?

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
Is it really necessary?"

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
Well now you should see me.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.260
I never miss a single training session.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.260
The night before a match I'm very nervous.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.260
And you should see me during the match.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.260
I shout like a true Italian.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.260
(Laughter)

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.260
What's next? What is going to be the next change?

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
Well I don't know yet,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
but I'm sure Najmuddin and his friends,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
they have it already in mind.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.260
That was my story. Thank you very much.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:56.260
(Applause)
