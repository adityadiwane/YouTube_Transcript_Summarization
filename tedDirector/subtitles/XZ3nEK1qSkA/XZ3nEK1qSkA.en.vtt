00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:19.630
There's currently over a thousand
TED Talks on the TED website.

00:00:19.654 --> 00:00:24.650
And I guess many of you here
think that this is quite fantastic,

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:26.548
except for me, I don't agree with this.

00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:28.157
I think we have a situation here.

00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:31.548
Because if you think about it,
1,000 TED Talks,

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:35.089
that's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading.

00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:38.702
How on earth are you going
to spread a thousand ideas?

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:41.594
Even if you just try
to get all of those ideas into your head

00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:43.639
by watching all those thousand TED videos,

00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:47.402
it would actually currently take you
over 250 hours to do so.

00:00:47.823 --> 00:00:50.387
And I did a little calculation of this.

00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:54.573
The damage to the economy for each one
who does this is around $15,000.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.473
So having seen this danger to the economy,

00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:01.600
I thought, we need to find
a solution to this problem.

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:03.382
Here's my approach to it all.

00:01:03.406 --> 00:01:06.612
If you look at the current situation,
you have a thousand TED Talks.

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:11.511
Each of those TED Talks has
an average length of about 2,300 words.

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:16.235
Now take this together, and you end up
with 2.3 million words of TED Talks,

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.945
which is about
three Bibles-worth of content.

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:19.970
(Laughter)

00:01:19.994 --> 00:01:24.450
The obvious question here is,
does a TED Talk really need 2,300 words?

00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:25.939
Isn't there something shorter?

00:01:25.963 --> 00:01:28.043
I mean, if you have
an idea worth spreading,

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:31.525
surely you can put it
into something shorter than 2,300 words.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.243
The only question is,
how short can you get?

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:37.555
What's the minimum amount of words
you would need to do a TED Talk?

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:39.927
While I was pondering this question,

00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:43.148
I came across this urban legend
about Ernest Hemingway,

00:01:43.172 --> 00:01:46.244
who allegedly said
that these six words here:

00:01:46.268 --> 00:01:49.120
"For sale: baby shoes, never worn,"

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:51.477
were the best novel he had ever written.

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:54.508
And I also encountered a project
called Six-Word Memoirs

00:01:54.532 --> 00:01:56.652
where people were asked,
take your whole life

00:01:56.676 --> 00:01:59.412
and please sum this up
into six words, such as these here:

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:01.447
"Found true love, married someone else."

00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:03.846
Or "Living in existential
vacuum; it sucks."

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.236
I actually like that one.

00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:08.348
So if a novel can be put into six words

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:11.850
and a whole memoir can be put
into six words,

00:02:11.978 --> 00:02:14.899
you don't need more than six
words for a TED Talk.

00:02:14.923 --> 00:02:18.141
We could have been done by lunch here.

00:02:18.165 --> 00:02:19.648
(Laughter)

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.882
And if you did this
for all thousand TED Talks,

00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:25.234
you would get from 2.3 million
words down to 6,000.

00:02:25.258 --> 00:02:27.131
So I thought this was quite worthwhile.

00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:28.913
So I started asking all my friends,

00:02:28.937 --> 00:02:31.935
please take your favorite TED Talk
and put that into six words.

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.203
So here are some of the results
that I received.

00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:35.575
I think they're quite nice.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.699
For example, Dan Pink's talk
on motivation, which was pretty good,

00:02:38.723 --> 00:02:41.829
if you haven't seen it:
"Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."

00:02:41.853 --> 00:02:44.725
It's what he's basically talking about
in those 18,5 minutes.

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.043
Or some even included references
to the speakers,

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:50.271
such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style,
or the one of Tim Ferriss,

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.704
which might be considered
a bit strenuous at times.

00:02:52.728 --> 00:02:55.449
The challenge here is,
if I try to systematically do this,

00:02:55.473 --> 00:02:57.798
I would probably end up
with a lot of summaries,

00:02:57.822 --> 00:02:59.594
but not with many friends in the end.

00:02:59.618 --> 00:03:03.113
So I had to find a different method,
preferably involving total strangers.

00:03:03.137 --> 00:03:06.473
And luckily, there's a website for that,
called Mechanical Turk,

00:03:06.497 --> 00:03:08.665
which is a website
where you can post tasks

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.379
that you don't want to do yourself,

00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:13.408
such as "Please summarize this text
for me in six words."

00:03:13.432 --> 00:03:16.267
And I didn't allow any low-cost
countries to work on this,

00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:19.991
but I found out I could get
a six-word summary for just 10 cents,

00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:22.261
which I think is a pretty good price.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.985
Even then, unfortunately,

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.854
it's not possible to summarize
each TED Talk individually.

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:29.632
Because if you do the math,
you have a thousand TED Talks,

00:03:29.656 --> 00:03:30.822
you pay 10 cents each;

00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:33.791
you have to do more than one summary
for each of those talks,

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:36.602
because some of them will probably
be, or are, really bad.

00:03:36.626 --> 00:03:39.436
So I would end up paying
hundreds of dollars.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.236
So I thought of a different way,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.634
by thinking, well, the talks
revolve around certain themes.

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:49.319
So what if I don't let people summarize
individual TED Talks to six words,

00:03:49.343 --> 00:03:51.359
but give them 10 TED Talks
at the same time

00:03:51.383 --> 00:03:54.004
and say, "Please do a six-word
summary for that one."

00:03:54.028 --> 00:03:56.191
I would cut my costs by 90 percent.

00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:58.745
So for $60,

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.760
I could summarize a thousand TED Talks
into just 600 summaries,

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.782
which would actually be quite nice.

00:04:04.806 --> 00:04:07.099
Some of you might actually
right now be thinking,

00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:10.621
it's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks
summarized into just six words.

00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:11.925
But it's actually not,

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.078
because there's an example
by statistics professor Hans Rosling.

00:04:15.102 --> 00:04:17.688
I guess many of you have seen
one or more of his talks.

00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:19.048
He's got eight talks online,

00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:21.788
and those can basically be summed up
into just four words,

00:04:21.812 --> 00:04:26.055
because that's all he's basically
showing us, our intuition is really bad.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.806
He always proves us wrong.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.393
So people on the Internet,
some didn't do so well.

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:33.810
And when I asked them to summarize
the 10 TED Talks at the same time,

00:04:33.834 --> 00:04:35.314
some took the easy route out.

00:04:35.338 --> 00:04:37.659
They just had some general comment.

00:04:37.773 --> 00:04:40.809
There were others --
and I found this quite cheeky --

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:43.243
They used their six words
to talk back to me

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:45.576
and ask me if I'd been too much
on Google lately.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.759
(Laughter)

00:04:46.783 --> 00:04:49.876
And finally also, I never understood this,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.034
some people really came up
with their own version of the truth.

00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:55.867
I don't know any TED Talk
that contains this.

00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:57.441
But, oh well.

00:04:57.465 --> 00:04:59.801
In the end, however,
and this is really amazing,

00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:02.665
for each of those 10 TED Talk
clusters that I submitted,

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.651
I actually received meaningful summaries.

00:05:04.675 --> 00:05:06.118
Here are some of my favorites.

00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:08.422
For example, for the TED Talks about food,

00:05:08.446 --> 00:05:11.905
someone summed this up into: "Food shaping
body, brains and environment,"

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:13.317
which I think is pretty good.

00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:16.631
Or happiness: "Striving toward happiness =
moving toward unhappiness."

00:05:16.655 --> 00:05:17.808
So here I was.

00:05:17.832 --> 00:05:19.842
I had started out
with a thousand TED Talks

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:22.591
and I had 600 six-word
summaries for those.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.293
Actually, it sounded nice
in the beginning,

00:05:25.317 --> 00:05:28.715
but when you look at 600 summaries,
it's quite a lot, it's a huge list.

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:29.754
(Laughter)

00:05:29.778 --> 00:05:32.836
So I thought, I probably have
to take this one step further here

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.488
and create summaries of the summaries,
and this is exactly what I did.

00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:39.782
So I took the 600 summaries that I had,
put them into nine groups

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:43.694
according to the ratings that the talks
had originally received on TED.com

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:46.603
and asked people to do summaries of those.

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.011
Again, there were some misunderstandings.

00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:52.000
For example, when I had a cluster
of all the "Beautiful" talks,

00:05:52.024 --> 00:05:55.243
someone thought I was just trying
to find the ultimate pick-up line.

00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:57.444
But in the end, amazingly,

00:05:57.468 --> 00:05:59.049
again, people were able to do it.

00:05:59.073 --> 00:06:01.127
For example, all the courageous TED Talks:

00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:03.590
"People dying" or "People
suffering" was also one,

00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:05.011
"with easy solutions around."

00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:07.520
Or the recipe for the ultimate
jaw-dropping TED Talk:

00:06:07.544 --> 00:06:10.075
"Flickr photos of intergalactic
classical composer."

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.457
I mean that's the essence of it all.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:17.944
Now I had my nine groups, but, I mean,
it's already quite a reduction.

00:06:17.968 --> 00:06:21.403
But of course, once you are that far,
you're not really satisfied.

00:06:21.427 --> 00:06:24.252
I wanted to go all the way,
all the way down the distillery,

00:06:24.276 --> 00:06:26.166
starting out with a thousand TED Talks.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.554
I wanted to have a thousand TED Talks
summarized into just six words --

00:06:29.578 --> 00:06:33.056
which would be a 99.9997 percent
reduction in content.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.717
And I would only pay $99.50 --

00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:38.892
so stay even below $100 for it.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.563
So I had 50 overall summaries done.

00:06:41.587 --> 00:06:42.995
This time I paid 25 cents

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:45.123
because I thought the task
was a bit harder.

00:06:45.147 --> 00:06:48.575
And unfortunately,
when I first received the answers --

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.817
and here, you'll see six of the answers --
I was a bit disappointed.

00:06:51.841 --> 00:06:55.065
Because I think you'll agree,
they all summarize some aspect of TED,

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:57.013
but to me, they felt a bit bland,

00:06:57.037 --> 00:07:00.306
or they just had
a certain aspect of TED in them.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.094
So I was almost ready to give up

00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:05.217
when one night, I played around
with these sentences

00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:09.164
and found out that there's actually
a beautiful solution in here.

00:07:09.188 --> 00:07:11.552
So here it is,

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:15.558
a crowd-sourced, six-word
summary of a thousand TED Talks

00:07:15.582 --> 00:07:17.941
at the value of $99.50:

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.432
"Why the worry? I'd rather wonder."

00:07:21.456 --> 00:07:22.719
Thank you very much.

00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:28.728
(Applause)
