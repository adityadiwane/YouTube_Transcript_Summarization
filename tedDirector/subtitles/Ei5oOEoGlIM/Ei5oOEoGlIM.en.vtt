00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Many of you could ask the question, you know,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
a roadable aircraft, possible at this time?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
A number of years ago,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
Mr. Ford predicted that flying cars

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
of some form would be available.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
Now, 60 years later,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
I'm here to tell you why it's possible.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
When I was about five years old,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
not very much -- about a year after

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
Mr. Ford made his predictions,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
I was living in a rural part of Canada,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160
on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
Getting to school, for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
through the Canadian winter, was not a pleasant experience.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
It was a trying and scary thing

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
for a young kid to be going through.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
At the end of my first year in school, in the summer of that year,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
I discovered a couple hummingbirds

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
that were caught in a shed near my home.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
They'd worn themselves out,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
beating themselves against the window,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
and, well, they were easy to capture.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.160
I took them outside and as I let them go, that split second, even though they were very tired,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
that second I let them go they hovered for a second,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
then zipped off into the distance.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
I thought, what a great way to get to school.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
(Laughter)

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
For a kid at that age, this was like infinite speed, disappearing,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
and I was very inspired by that.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
And so the next -- over the next

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
six decades, believe it or not,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
I've built a number of aircraft,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
with the goal of creating something that could do for you, or me,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
what the hummingbird does,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
and give you that flexibility.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.160
I've called this vehicle, generically, a volantor,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
after the Latin word "volant," meaning,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
to fly in a light, nimble manner.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
Volantor-like helicopter, perhaps.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
The FAA, the controlling body above all,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
calls it a "powered lift aircraft."

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
And they've actually issued a pilot's license --

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
a powerlift pilot's license -- for this type of aircraft.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
It's closer than you think. It's kind of remarkable when you consider that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
there are no operational powered lift aircraft.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
So for once, perhaps, the government is ahead of itself.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.160
The press calls my particular volantor a "Skycar."

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
This is a little bit earlier version of it,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
that's why it's given the X designation,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
but it's a four-passenger aircraft

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
that could take off vertically, like a helicopter --

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
therefore it doesn't need an airfield.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
On the ground, it's powered electrically.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
It's actually classified as a motorcycle

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
because of the three wheels, which is a great asset

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
because it allows you, theoretically, to use this on the highways

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
in most states, and actually in all cities.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
So that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
of the automobile, forget it -- you're never going to fly it.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
(Laughter)

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
One could say that a helicopter

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
does pretty much what the hummingbird does,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
and gets around in much the same way, and it's true,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.160
but a helicopter is a very complex device.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
It's expensive --

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
so expensive that very few people could own or use it.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.160
It's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
as a series of parts -- a large number of parts --

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
flying in formation.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160
(Laughter)

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
Another difference, and I have to describe this,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
because it's very personal,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
another great difference between the helicopter

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
and the volantor --

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
in my case the Skycar volantor --

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
is the experience that I've had

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
in flying both of those.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
In a helicopter you feel -- and it's still a remarkable sensation --

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
you feel like you're being hauled up from above

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
by a vibrating crane.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
When you get in the Skycar -- and I can tell you,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
there's only one other person that's flown it, but he had the same sensation --

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
you really feel like you're being lifted up

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
by a magic carpet,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
without any vibration whatsoever. The sensation is unbelievable.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
And it's been a great motivator.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
and only when I can persuade my stockholders

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
to let me do so,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
but it's still one of those wonderful experiences

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
that reward you for all that time.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
What we really need is something to replace the automobile

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
for those 50-plus mile trips.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
Very few people realize that 50 mile-plus trips

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
make up 85 percent of the miles traveled in America.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
If we can get rid of that,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
then the highways will now be useful to you,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
as contrasted by what's happening

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
in many parts of the world today.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.160
On this next slide, is an interesting history

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.160
of what we really have seen in infrastructure,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
because whether I give you a perfect Skycar,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
the perfect vehicle for use, it's going to have very little value to you

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
unless you've got a system to use it in.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
I'm sure any of you have asked the question,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
yeah, are there great things up there -- what am I going to do, get up there?

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
It's bad enough on a highway, what's it going to be like to be in the air?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
This world that you're going to be talking about tomorrow

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
is going to be completely integrated. You're not going to be a pilot,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
you're going to be a passenger.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
And it's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
I can tell you, technically we can build Skycars --

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
my God, we went to the moon!

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.160
The technology there was much more difficult than what I'm dealing with here.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
But we have to have these priority changes,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
we have to have infrastructure to go with this.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
Historically you see that we got around

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
200 years ago by canals,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
and as that system disappeared, were replaced by railroads.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
As that disappeared we came in with highways.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
But if you look at that top corner -- the highway system --

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
you see where we are today. Highways are no longer being built,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
and that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
in the next 10 years.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
However, the next 10 years, if like the last 10 years,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
we're going to see 30 percent more traffic.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
And where is that going to lead you to?

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
So the issue then, I've often asked, is

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
when is it going to happen?

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
When are we going to be able to have these vehicles?

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
And of course, if you ask me, I'm going to give you a really optimistic view.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
After all, I've been spending 60 years here believing it's going to happen tomorrow.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.160
So, I'm not going to quote myself on this.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
I'd prefer to quote someone else,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
who testified with me before Congress,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.160
and in his position as head of NASA

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
put forward this particular vision

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
of the future of this type of aircraft.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
Now I would argue, actually, if you look at the fact that on the highways today,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160
you're only averaging about 30 miles per hour --

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
on average, according to the DOT --

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
the Skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
up to 25,000 feet.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And so, in effect, you could see perhaps a tenfold increase

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
in the ability to get around

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
as far as speed is concerned.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
Unbeknownst to many of you,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
the highway in the sky that I'm talking about here

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
has been under construction for 10 years.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
It makes use of the GPS -- you're familiar with GPS in your automobile,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
but you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S.,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
there's a Russian GPS,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
and there's a new GPS system

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
going to Europe, called Galileo.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
With those three systems,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
you have what is always necessary --

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
a level of redundancy that says,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
if one system fails, you'll still have a way

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
to make sure that you're being controlled.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
Because if you're in this world, where computers are controlling what you're doing,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
How would a trip in a Skycar work?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
Well, you can't right now

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
take off from your home because it's too noisy.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
I mean to be able to take off from your home, you'd have to be extremely quiet.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
But it's still fairly quiet.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.160
You'd motor, electrically, to a vertiport,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
which may be a few blocks, maybe even a few miles away.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
This is clearly, as I said earlier, a roadable aircraft,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
and you're not going to spend that much time on the road.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
After all, if you can fly like that,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
why are you going to drive around on a highway?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
Go to a local vertiport,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
plug in your destination,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.160
delivered almost like a passenger.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
You can play computer games, you can sleep, you can read on the way.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
This is the world -- there won't be you as a pilot. And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that --

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
and I've had a lot of bad feedback

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160
from people who want to be up there, flying around

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
and experiencing that.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
And of course, I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.160
But the vehicle itself is going to be a very, very controlled environment.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.160
Or it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
We flew the first vehicle for the international press 

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
in 1965, when I really got it started.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
I was a professor at the U.C. Davis System,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
and I got a lot of excitement around this,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.160
and I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
And then through the various years

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
we invented various vehicles.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
Actually the critical point was in 1989,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle --

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
how completely stable it was in all circumstances,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
which is of course very critical.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
Still not a practical vehicle during all of this,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
but moving in the right direction, we believe.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160
Finally, in the early part of --

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.160
or actually the middle of 2002,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.160
we flew the 400 -- M400, which was the four-passenger vehicle.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.160
In this case here, we're flying it remotely, as we always did at the beginning.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
And we had very small power plants in it at this time.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
We are now installing larger powerplants,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
which will make it possible for me to get back on board.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
A vertical-takeoff aircraft

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.160
is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.160
There's an old adage that applied for the years

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
between 1950s and 1970s,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
when every aeronautical company

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
was working on vertical-takeoff aircraft.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.160
A vertical-takeoff aircraft

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
needs an artificial stabilization system --

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
that's essential.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
At least for the hover,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
and the low-speed flight.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
If that single-stability system,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.160
that brain that flies that aircraft, fails, or if the engine fails,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
that vehicle crashes. There is no option to that.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
And the adage that I'm referring to,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
that applied at that time,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
was that nothing comes down faster

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
than a VTOL aircraft upside down.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
(Laughter)

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
That's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
In fact, the aircraft companies gave up on

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
vertical-takeoff aircraft

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.160
more or less for a number of years.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160
And there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
that's a vertical-takeoff aircraft -- as distinct from a helicopter --

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
and that's the Hawker Harrier jump jet.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
A vertical-takeoff aircraft,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
like the hummingbird,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
has a very high metabolism,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
which means it requires a lot of energy.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
Getting that energy is very, very difficult. It all comes down

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.160
to that power plant -- how to get a large amount of power in a small package.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
Fortunately, Dr. Felix Wankel

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
invented the rotary engine.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
A very unique engine -- it's round,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
it's small, it's vibration-free.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
It fits exactly where we need to fit it,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system --

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160
very critical. In fact that engine --

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
for those who are into the automobile --

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
know that it recently is applied to the RX8 --

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
the Mazda.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.160
And that sportscar won Sports Car of the Year.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
Wonderful engine.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
In that application, it generates one horsepower per pound,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.160
which is twice as good as your car engine today,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
but only half of what we need.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
My company has spent 35 years

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
which was invented in the late '50s, and getting it to the point that we get

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
over two horsepower per pound, reliably, and critical.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160
We actually get 175 horsepower

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
into one cubic foot.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
We have eight engines in this vehicle.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
We have four computers. We have two parachutes.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
Redundancy is the critical issue here.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
And we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.160
and continued to hover.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
The computers back up each other. There's a voting system --

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160
if one computer is not agreeing with the other three,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.160
it's kicked out of the system.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
And then you have three -- you still have the triple redundancy.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
If one of those fails, you still have a second chance.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
If you stick around, then good luck.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
There won't be a third chance.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
The parachutes are there -- hopefully,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
more for psychological than real reasons, but

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.160
(Laughter)

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
I'd like to show you an animation in this next one,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
which is one element

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
of the Skycar's use,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
You could think of it personally in your own terms,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
of how you might use it.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.160
Video: Skycar dispatched, launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
Paul Moller: I believe that personal transportation

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
in something like the Skycar,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
probably in another volantor form as well,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
will be a significant part of our lives,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160
as Dr. Goldin says, within the next 10 years.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
And it's going to change the demographics in a very significant way.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.160
If you can live 75 miles from San Francisco and get there in 15 minutes,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.160
you're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
buy a Skycar,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
which I think would be priced at that time perhaps

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
in the area of 100,000 dollars, put money in the bank ...

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.160
But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.160
(Laughter)

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
Developing the Skycar has been a real challenge.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160
Obviously I'm dependent on a lot of other people

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
believing in what I'm doing -- both financially and in technical help.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
And that has --

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.160
you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.160
I characterized this emerging technology

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
in an aphorism,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
as it's described,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
which really talks about what I've experienced,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.160
and I'm sure what other people may have experienced

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.160
in emerging technologies.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.160
There's an interesting poll that came out recently

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
under NAS --

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
I think it's MSNBC --

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
in which they asked the question,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
"Are you in the market for a volantor?"

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.160
Twenty-three percent said, "Yes, as soon as possible."

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
Forty-seven percent -- yes, as soon as they could -- price could come down.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
Twenty-three percent said, "As soon as it's proven safe."

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
Only seven percent said

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.160
that they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160
I'm encouraged by that. At least it makes me feel like,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
to some extent, it is becoming self-evident.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
That we need an alternative to the automobile,

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
at least for those 50-mile trips and more,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
so that the highways become usable in today's world.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
Thank you.
