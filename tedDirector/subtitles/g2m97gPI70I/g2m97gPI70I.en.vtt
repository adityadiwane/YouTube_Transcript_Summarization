00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.501
I'll never forget the sound

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:17.587
of laughing with my friends.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.796
I'll never forget the sound

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.275
of my mother's voice
right before I fell asleep.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:30.689
And I'll never forget
the comforting sound of water

00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:32.731
trickling down a stream.

00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:37.969
Imagine my fear, pure fear,

00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:40.386
when, at the age of 10,

00:00:40.992 --> 00:00:43.569
I was told I was going to lose my hearing.

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:47.450
And over the next five years,

00:00:47.474 --> 00:00:52.004
it progressed until I was classified
as profoundly deaf.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.685
But I believe that losing my hearing

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:01.162
was one of the greatest gifts
I've ever received.

00:01:02.278 --> 00:01:05.924
You see, I get to experience
the world in a unique way.

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:10.929
And I believe that
these unique experiences

00:01:10.953 --> 00:01:13.340
that people with disabilities have

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:18.384
is what's going to help us
make and design a better world

00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:23.748
for everyone -- both for people
with and without disabilities.

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:27.419
I used to be a disability rights lawyer,

00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:31.093
and I spent a lot of my time
focused on enforcing the law,

00:01:31.117 --> 00:01:33.268
ensuring that accommodations were made.

00:01:33.998 --> 00:01:38.360
And then I had to quickly
learn international policy,

00:01:38.384 --> 00:01:42.266
because I was asked to work
on the UN Convention

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.593
that protects people with disabilities.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.391
As the leader of the NGO there,

00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:53.073
I spent most of my energy
trying to convince people

00:01:53.097 --> 00:01:56.341
about the capabilities
of people with disabilities.

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:00.260
But somewhere along the way,

00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:03.087
and after many career transitions

00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:05.158
that my parents weren't so happy about --

00:02:05.182 --> 00:02:06.768
(Laughter)

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:09.899
I stumbled upon a solution

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:15.283
that I believe may be
an even more powerful tool

00:02:15.307 --> 00:02:18.617
to solve some of the world's
greatest problems,

00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:20.321
disability or not.

00:02:22.207 --> 00:02:26.003
And that tool is called design thinking.

00:02:27.853 --> 00:02:32.842
Design thinking is a process
for innovation and problem solving.

00:02:33.773 --> 00:02:35.549
There are five steps.

00:02:35.573 --> 00:02:38.148
The first is defining the problem

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.427
and understanding its constraints.

00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:46.497
The second is observing people
in real-life situations

00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:48.821
and empathizing with them.

00:02:48.845 --> 00:02:52.815
Third, throwing out hundreds of ideas --
the more the better,

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.373
the wilder the better.

00:02:55.186 --> 00:02:59.720
Fourth, prototyping:
gathering whatever you can,

00:02:59.744 --> 00:03:01.196
whatever you can find,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.819
to mimic your solution, to test it

00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:05.275
and to refine it.

00:03:05.968 --> 00:03:08.409
And finally, implementation:

00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:13.491
ensuring that the solution
you came up with is sustainable.

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:21.575
Warren Berger says that design thinking
teaches us to look sideways,

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.599
to reframe, to refine, to experiment

00:03:25.623 --> 00:03:27.970
and, probably most importantly,

00:03:27.994 --> 00:03:30.551
ask those stupid questions.

00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:34.686
Design thinkers believe
that everyone is creative.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.428
They believe in bringing people
from multiple disciplines together,

00:03:41.452 --> 00:03:44.667
because they want to share
multiple perspectives

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.107
and bring them together
and ultimately merge them

00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:49.384
to form something new.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.610
Design thinking is such a successful
and versatile tool

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:58.705
that it has been applied
in almost every industry.

00:04:00.586 --> 00:04:04.961
I saw the potential that it had
for the issues I faced,

00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:08.217
so I decided to go back to school

00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:11.111
and get my master's in social design.

00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:16.971
This looks at how to use design
to create positive change in the world.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.630
While I was there,

00:04:19.654 --> 00:04:21.471
I fell in love with woodworking.

00:04:22.217 --> 00:04:24.914
But what I quickly realized

00:04:24.938 --> 00:04:27.382
was that I was missing out on something.

00:04:28.058 --> 00:04:30.997
As you're working with a tool,

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:33.450
right before it's about
to kick back at you --

00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:36.733
which means the piece or the tool
jumps back at you --

00:04:36.757 --> 00:04:37.923
it makes a sound.

00:04:38.992 --> 00:04:40.582
And I couldn't hear this sound.

00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:43.268
So I decided,

00:04:43.873 --> 00:04:45.323
why not try and solve it?

00:04:46.363 --> 00:04:49.847
My solution was a pair of safety glasses

00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:53.663
that were engineered
to visually alert the user

00:04:53.687 --> 00:04:56.279
to pitch changes in the tool,

00:04:56.303 --> 00:04:59.175
before the human ear could pick it up.

00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:04.668
Why hadn't tool designers
thought of this before?

00:05:04.692 --> 00:05:06.595
(Laughter)

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:10.410
Two reasons: one, I was a beginner.

00:05:10.856 --> 00:05:15.411
I wasn't weighed down by expertise
or conventional wisdom.

00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:18.729
The second is: I was Deaf.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.013
My unique experience of the world
helped inform my solution.

00:05:25.886 --> 00:05:29.839
And as I went on, I kept running into
more and more solutions

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:33.435
that were originally made
for people with disabilities,

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:36.765
and that ended up being picked up,

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.711
embraced and loved by the mainstream,

00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:40.940
disability or not.

00:05:41.448 --> 00:05:43.862
This is an OXO potato peeler.

00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:47.508
It was originally designed
for people with arthritis,

00:05:47.532 --> 00:05:49.959
but it was so comfortable,
everybody loved it.

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:56.198
Text messaging: that was originally
designed for people who are Deaf.

00:05:56.817 --> 00:05:59.067
And as you know,
everybody loves that, too.

00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:01.009
(Laughter)

00:06:01.033 --> 00:06:02.746
I started thinking:

00:06:03.492 --> 00:06:06.618
What if we changed our mindset?

00:06:07.578 --> 00:06:12.706
What if we started designing
for disability first --

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.007
not the norm?

00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:18.511
As you see, when we design
for disability first,

00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:23.356
we often stumble upon
solutions that are not only inclusive,

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.216
but also are often better
than when we design for the norm.

00:06:30.398 --> 00:06:31.953
And this excites me,

00:06:31.977 --> 00:06:38.301
because this means that the energy
it takes to accommodate someone

00:06:38.325 --> 00:06:39.926
with a disability

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.813
can be leveraged, molded and played with

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:48.860
as a force for creativity and innovation.

00:06:49.712 --> 00:06:55.245
This moves us from the mindset
of trying to change the hearts

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:58.392
and the deficiency mindset of tolerance,

00:06:58.416 --> 00:07:01.134
to becoming an alchemist,

00:07:01.158 --> 00:07:05.128
the type of magician that this world
so desperately needs

00:07:05.152 --> 00:07:07.475
to solve some of its greatest problems.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.894
Now, I also believe

00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:15.437
that people with disabilities
have great potential to be designers

00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:17.809
within this design-thinking process.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.343
Without knowing it, from a very early age,

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:24.622
I've been a design thinker,
fine-tuning my skills.

00:07:25.621 --> 00:07:31.029
Design thinkers are, by nature,
problem solvers.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.885
So imagine listening to a conversation

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:39.902
and only understanding
50 percent of what is said.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.538
You can't ask them to repeat
every single word.

00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:47.476
They would just get frustrated with you.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.240
So without even realizing it,

00:07:50.264 --> 00:07:55.176
my solution was to take
the muffled sound I heard,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.352
that was the beat,

00:07:56.376 --> 00:08:00.886
and turn it into a rhythm
and place it with the lips I read.

00:08:01.908 --> 00:08:07.581
Years later, someone commented
that my writing had a rhythm to it.

00:08:08.105 --> 00:08:13.066
Well, this is because I experience
conversations as rhythms.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:19.444
I also became really,
really good at failing.

00:08:19.468 --> 00:08:20.702
(Laughter)

00:08:20.726 --> 00:08:22.300
Quite literally.

00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:25.882
My first semester in Spanish, I got a D.

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:30.383
But what I learned
was that when I picked myself up

00:08:30.407 --> 00:08:32.707
and changed a few things around,

00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:35.546
eventually, I succeeded.

00:08:37.187 --> 00:08:41.807
Similarly, design thinking
encourages people to fail

00:08:41.831 --> 00:08:43.467
and fail often,

00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:46.722
because eventually, you will succeed.

00:08:47.404 --> 00:08:51.284
Very few great innovations in this world

00:08:51.308 --> 00:08:55.126
have come from someone succeeding
on the first try.

00:08:56.906 --> 00:08:59.778
I also experienced this lesson in sports.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.421
I'll never forget my coach
saying to my mom,

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:08.623
"If she just didn't have her hearing loss,

00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:10.331
she would be on the national team."

00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:16.242
But what my coach, and what I
didn't even know at the time,

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:21.723
was that my hearing loss
actually helped me excel at sports.

00:09:22.704 --> 00:09:27.771
You see, when you lose your hearing,
not only do you adapt your behavior,

00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:31.577
but you also adapt your physical senses.

00:09:32.785 --> 00:09:34.435
One example of this

00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:38.962
is that my visual
attention span increased.

00:09:39.543 --> 00:09:44.001
Imagine a soccer player,
coming down the left flank.

00:09:44.025 --> 00:09:46.828
Imagine being goalkeeper, like I was,

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.000
and the ball is coming
down the left flank.

00:09:49.024 --> 00:09:53.808
A person with normal hearing
would have the visual perspective of this.

00:09:54.872 --> 00:09:58.863
I had the benefit of a spectrum this wide.

00:09:58.887 --> 00:10:01.324
So I picked up the players over here,

00:10:01.348 --> 00:10:03.862
that were moving about
and coming down the field.

00:10:03.886 --> 00:10:07.560
And I picked them up quicker,
so that if the ball was passed,

00:10:07.584 --> 00:10:11.177
I could reposition myself
and be ready for that shot.

00:10:12.955 --> 00:10:14.472
So as you can see,

00:10:14.496 --> 00:10:17.162
I've been a design thinker
for nearly all my life.

00:10:18.788 --> 00:10:23.346
My observation skills have been honed
so that I pick up on things

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.353
that others would never pick up on.

00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:31.197
My constant need to adapt
has made me a great ideator

00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:32.538
and problem solver.

00:10:33.392 --> 00:10:37.664
And I've often had to do this
within limitations and constraints.

00:10:38.164 --> 00:10:42.439
This is something that designers
also have to deal with frequently.

00:10:44.638 --> 00:10:47.527
My work most recently took me to Haiti.

00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:52.238
Design thinkers often seek out
extreme situations,

00:10:52.262 --> 00:10:56.517
because that often informs
some of their best designs.

00:10:56.541 --> 00:10:59.580
And Haiti -- it was like a perfect storm.

00:11:00.415 --> 00:11:04.822
I lived and worked
with 300 Deaf individuals

00:11:05.656 --> 00:11:08.775
that were relocated
after the 2010 earthquake.

00:11:09.805 --> 00:11:12.971
But five and a half years later,

00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:15.698
there still was no electricity;

00:11:15.722 --> 00:11:18.208
there still was no safe drinking water;

00:11:18.232 --> 00:11:20.373
there were still no job opportunities;

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.429
there was still rampant crime,
and it went unpunished.

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:28.540
International aid organizations
came one by one.

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:30.351
But they came

00:11:30.375 --> 00:11:33.071
with pre-determined solutions.

00:11:33.095 --> 00:11:37.482
They didn't come ready
to observe and to adapt

00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:41.511
based on the community's needs.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.789
One organization gave them
goats and chickens.

00:11:47.484 --> 00:11:48.793
But they didn't realize

00:11:48.817 --> 00:11:52.736
that there was so much hunger
in that community,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.586
that when the Deaf went to sleep
at night and couldn't hear,

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.874
people broke into their yards
and their homes

00:11:59.898 --> 00:12:02.779
and stole these chickens and goats,

00:12:02.803 --> 00:12:05.344
and eventually they were all gone.

00:12:06.896 --> 00:12:11.425
Now, if that organization
had taken the time

00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:16.186
to observe Deaf people,
to observe the community,

00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:19.249
they would have realized their problem

00:12:19.273 --> 00:12:23.669
and perhaps they would have
come up with a solution,

00:12:23.693 --> 00:12:26.771
something like a solar light,

00:12:26.795 --> 00:12:30.976
lighting up a secure pen
to put them in at night

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.380
to ensure their safety.

00:12:34.018 --> 00:12:37.989
You don't have to be a design thinker

00:12:38.013 --> 00:12:41.218
to insert the ideas
I've shared with you today.

00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:46.051
You are creative.

00:12:46.793 --> 00:12:49.295
You are a designer --

00:12:49.319 --> 00:12:50.765
everyone is.

00:12:52.152 --> 00:12:55.371
Let people like me help you.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:00.855
Let people with disabilities
help you look sideways,

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:02.441
and in the process,

00:13:02.465 --> 00:13:05.074
solve some of the greatest problems.

00:13:05.605 --> 00:13:06.952
That's it. Thank you.

00:13:06.976 --> 00:13:12.492
