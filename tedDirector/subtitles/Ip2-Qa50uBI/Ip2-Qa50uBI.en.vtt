00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
The first half of the 20th century

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
was an absolute disaster in human affairs,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
a cataclysm.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
We had the First World War,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
the Great Depression,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
the Second World War

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
and the rise of the communist nations.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
And each one of these forces

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
split the world, tore the world apart,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
divided the world.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
And they threw up walls --

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
political walls, trade walls,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
transportation walls,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
communication walls, iron curtains --

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
which divided peoples and nations.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.160
It was only in the second half of the 20th century

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
that we slowly began to pull ourselves

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
out of this abyss.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
Trade walls began to come tumbling down.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
Here are some data on tariffs:

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
starting at 40 percent, coming down to less than 5 percent.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
We globalized the world. And what does that mean?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
It means that we extended cooperation

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
across national boundaries;

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
we made the world more cooperative.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
Transportation walls came tumbling down.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
You know in 1950 the typical ship carried

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.160
5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.160
Today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons;

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
it can be manned with a smaller crew;

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
and unloaded faster than ever before.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
Communication walls, I don't have to tell you -- the Internet --

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
have come tumbling down.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
And of course the iron curtains,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.160
political walls have come tumbling down.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.160
Now all of this has been tremendous for the world.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
Trade has increased.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
Here is just a little bit of data.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
In 1990, exports from China to the United States:

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
15 billion dollars.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
By 2007: over 300 billion dollars.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
And perhaps most remarkably,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
at the beginning of the 21st century,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
really for the first time in modern history,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.160
growth extended to almost all parts of the world.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
So China, I've already mentioned,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
beginning around 1978, around the time of the death of Mao,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
growth -- ten percent a year.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
Year after year after year,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
absolutely incredible.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Never before in human history

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
have so many people been raised out of

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
such great poverty as happened in China.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
China is the world's greatest anti-poverty program

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
over the last three decades.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
India, starting a little bit later,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
but in 1990, begetting tremendous growth.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
Incomes at that time

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
less than $1,000 per year.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
And over the next 18 years

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
have almost tripled.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
Growth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
Now Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa --

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
Sub-Saharan Africa

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160
has been the area of the world

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160
most resistant to growth.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
And we can see the tragedy of Africa

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
in the first few bars here.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
Growth was negative.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
People were actually getting poorer than their parents,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160
and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
But at the end of the 20th century,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
the beginning of the 21st century,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
we saw growth in Africa.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
And I think, as you'll see, there's reasons for optimism,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
because I believe that the best is yet to come.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
Now why.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
On the cutting edge today

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
it's new ideas which are driving growth.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
And by that I mean it's

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
products for which the research and development costs

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
are really high, and the manufacturing costs are low.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
More than ever before it is these types of ideas

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
which are driving growth on the cutting edge.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
Now ideas have this amazing property.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
Thomas Jefferson, I think, really expressed this quite well.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.160
He said, "He who receives an idea from me

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
receives instruction himself, without lessening mine.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
As he who lights his candle at mine

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
receives light without darkening me."

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
Or to put it slightly differently:

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
one apple feeds one man,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
but an idea can feed the world.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
Now this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
This is practically the model of TED.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160
But what is new is that the greater function of ideas

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.160
is going to drive growth even more than ever before.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
This provides a reason why

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
trade and globalization

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
are even more important, more powerful than ever before,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
and are going to increase growth more than ever before.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
And to explain why this is so, I have a question.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
Suppose that there are two diseases:

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
one of them is rare, the other one is common,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
but if they are not treated they are equally severe.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
If you had to choose, which would you rather have:

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.160
the common disease or the rare disease?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
Common, the common -- I think that's absolutely right,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.160
and why? Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
than there are to treat rare diseases.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
The reason for this is incentives.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
It costs about the same to produce a new drug

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
whether that drug treats 1,000 people,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
100,000 people, or a million people.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
So the incentives are much larger

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.160
to produce drugs which treat more people.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.160
To put this differently: larger markets save lives.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.160
In this case misery truly does love company.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
Now think about the following:

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.160
if China and India were as rich as the United States is today,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.160
the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
Now we are not there yet, but it is happening.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
As other countries become richer

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
the demand for these pharmaceuticals

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
is going to increase tremendously.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.160
And that means an increase incentive to do research and development,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160
which benefits everyone in the world.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
Larger markets increase the incentive

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
to produce all kinds of ideas,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
whether it's software, whether it's a computer chip,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
whether it's a new design.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
For the Hollywood people in the audience,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
this even explains why action movies

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
have larger budgets than comedies:

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
it's because action movies translate easier

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
into other languages and other cultures,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
so the market for those movies is larger.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
People are willing to invest more,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
and the budgets are larger.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
Alright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
to produce new ideas,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160
how do we maximize that incentive?

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.160
It's by having one world market, by globalizing the world.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
The way I like to put this is:

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
one idea. Ideas are meant to be shared,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.160
so one idea can serve one world, one market.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
One idea, one world, one market.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Well how else can we create new ideas?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
That's one reason.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
Globalize trade.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
How else can we create new ideas?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
Well, more idea creators.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Now idea creators, they come from all walks of life.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
Artists and innovators -- many of the people you've seen on this stage.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160
I'm going to focus on scientists and engineers

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.160
because I have some data on that, and I'm a data person.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.160
Now, today, less than one-tenth of one percent

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
of the world's population are scientists and engineers.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
(Laughter)

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
The United States has been an idea leader.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.160
A large fraction of those people are in the United States.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.160
But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
And for that I am very grateful.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
That is a good thing.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
because for too long the United States,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
and a handful of other developed countries,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
have shouldered the entire burden

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
of research and development.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
But consider the following:

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.160
there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.160
contributing to ideas which benefit everyone,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
which are shared by everyone.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.160
I think of the great Indian mathematician, Ramanujan.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.160
How many Ramanujans are there in India today

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
toiling in the fields, barely able to feed themselves,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
when they could be feeding the world?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
Now we're not there yet.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.160
But it is going to happen in this century.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:40.160
The real tragedy of the last century is this:

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.160
if you think about the world's population

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
as a giant computer, a massively parallel processor,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
then the great tragedy has been

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.160
that billions of our processors have been off line.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
But in this century China is coming on line.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
India is coming on line.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
Africa is coming on line.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.160
We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
Here is just some data. This is China.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
1996: less than one million

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
new university students in China per year;

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.160
2006: over five million.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
Now think what this means.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.160
This means we all benefit when another country gets rich.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.160
We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
That is something that we should embrace --

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
a wealthy China, a wealthy India, a wealthy Africa.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
We need a greater demand for ideas --

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
those larger markets I was talking about earlier --

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.160
and a greater supply of ideas for the world.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.160
Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
Globalization is increasing the demand

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
for ideas, the incentive to create new ideas.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:57.160
Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
In fact if you look at world history

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
you can see some reasons for optimism.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
From about the beginnings of humanity

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
to 1500: zero economic growth, nothing.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.160
1500 to 1800: maybe a little bit of economic growth,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
but less in a century

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160
than you expect to see in a year today.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
1900s: maybe one percent.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
Twentieth century: a little bit over two percent.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.160
Twenty-first century could easily be 3.3, even higher percent.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160
Even at that rate,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
by 2100 average GDP per capita

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.160
in the world will be $200,000.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.160
That's not U.S. GDP per capita, which will be over a million,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
but world GDP per capita -- $200,000.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
That's not that far.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
We won't make it.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
But some of our grandchildren probably will.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
And I should say,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
I think this is a rather modest prediction.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.160
In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.160
In Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
(Laughter)

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
Alright what about problems?

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
What about a great depression?

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.160
Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
Here is GDP per capita

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
from 1900 to 1929.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.160
Now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
trying to forecast future growth for the United States,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
not knowing that we were about to enter

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.160
the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
What would you have predicted, not knowing this?

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
If you had based your prediction, your forecast

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
on 1900 to 1929

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
you'd have predicted something like this.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
If you'd been a little more optimistic --

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
say, based upon the Roaring Twenties -- you'd have said this.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
So what actually happened?

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.160
We went off a cliff but we recovered.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
In fact in the second half of the 20th century

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.160
growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
based upon the first half of the 20th century.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
So growth can wash away

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
even what appears to be a great depression.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
Alright. What else?

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
Oil. Oil. This was a big topic.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:19.160
When I was writing up my notes oil was $140 per barrel.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.160
So people were asking a question. They were saying,

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.160
"Is China drinking our milkshake?"

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.160
(Laughter)

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.160
And there is some truth to this,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.160
in the sense that we have something of a finite resource,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
and increased growth is going to push up demand for that.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
But I think I don't have to tell this audience

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.160
that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
Moreover, as everyone knows,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.160
look -- it's energy, not oil, which counts.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
And higher oil prices mean

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
a greater incentive to invest in energy R&amp;D.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
You can see this in the data.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
As oil prices go up, energy patents go up.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
The world is much better equipped

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.160
to overcome an increase in the price of oil

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
today, than ever in the past,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
because of what I'm talking about.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.160
One idea, one world, one market.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
So I'm optimistic

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
so long as we hew to these two ideas:

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
to keep globalizing world markets,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.160
keep extending cooperation across national boundaries,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.160
and keep investing in education.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
Now the United States has a particularly important role

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
to play in this:

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
to keep our education system globalized,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.160
to keep our education system open to students from all over the world,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
because our education system

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
is the candle

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.160
that other students come to light their own candles.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
Now remember here what Jefferson said.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
Jefferson said, "When they come

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
and light their candles at ours,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.160
they gain light, and we are not darkened."

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
But Jefferson wasn't quite right, was he?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
Because the truth is,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.160
when they light their candles at ours,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.160
there is twice as much light available for everyone.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.160
So my view is: Be optimistic.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.160
Spread the ideas. Spread the light.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
Thank you.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.160
(Applause)
