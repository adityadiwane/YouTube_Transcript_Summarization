00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:15.656
It's 1878.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.067
Sir Francis Galton
gives a remarkable talk.

00:00:21.138 --> 00:00:25.276
He's speaking to the anthropologic
institute of Great Britain and Ireland.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.016
Known for his pioneering work
in human intelligence,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.028
Galton is a brilliant polymath.

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:35.090
He's an explorer,

00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:36.867
an anthropologist,

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:38.421
a sociologist,

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:40.014
a psychologist

00:00:40.038 --> 00:00:41.512
and a statistician.

00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:45.489
He's also a eugenist.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.666
In this talk,

00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:53.380
he presents a new technique
by which he can combine photographs

00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:55.663
and produce composite portraits.

00:00:56.483 --> 00:01:01.497
This technique could be used
to characterize different types of people.

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:07.871
Galton thinks that if he combines
photographs of violent criminals,

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:11.021
he will discover the face of criminality.

00:01:12.073 --> 00:01:14.060
But to his surprise,

00:01:14.084 --> 00:01:16.948
the composite portrait that he produces

00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:19.027
is beautiful.

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:24.874
Galton's surprising finding
raises deep questions:

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:26.920
What is beauty?

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.709
Why do certain configurations of line
and color and form excite us so?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:37.720
For most of human history,

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:43.299
these questions have been approached
using logic and speculation.

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:45.452
But in the last few decades,

00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:48.354
scientists have addressed
the question of beauty

00:01:48.378 --> 00:01:53.447
using ideas from evolutionary psychology
and tools of neuroscience.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:58.185
We're beginning to glimpse
the why and the how of beauty,

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:02.089
at least in terms of what it means
for the human face and form.

00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:04.577
And in the process,

00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:06.953
we're stumbling upon some surprises.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.788
When it comes to seeing
beauty in each other,

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.924
while this decision is certainly
subjective for the individual,

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:20.131
it's sculpted by factors that contribute
to the survival of the group.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.278
Many experiments have shown

00:02:23.302 --> 00:02:27.303
that a few basic parameters contribute
to what makes a face attractive.

00:02:28.135 --> 00:02:33.811
These include averaging, symmetry
and the effects of hormones.

00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:36.245
Let's take each one of these in turn.

00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:39.825
Galton's finding

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.132
that composite or average faces
are typically more attractive

00:02:45.156 --> 00:02:48.713
than each individual face
that contributes to the average

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:50.666
has been replicated many times.

00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:55.942
This laboratory finding fits
with many people's intuitions.

00:02:56.574 --> 00:03:00.785
Average faces represent
the central tendencies of a group.

00:03:01.544 --> 00:03:05.863
People with mixed features
represent different populations,

00:03:05.887 --> 00:03:09.235
and presumably harbor
greater genetic diversity

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:11.457
and adaptability to the environment.

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:16.561
Many people find mixed-race
individuals attractive

00:03:16.585 --> 00:03:18.759
and inbred families less so.

00:03:20.447 --> 00:03:24.630
The second factor that contributes
to beauty is symmetry.

00:03:25.294 --> 00:03:29.620
People generally find symmetric faces
more attractive than asymmetric ones.

00:03:30.578 --> 00:03:35.830
Developmental abnormalities
are often associated with asymmetries.

00:03:35.854 --> 00:03:39.119
And in plants, animals and humans,

00:03:39.143 --> 00:03:42.449
asymmetries often arise
from parasitic infections.

00:03:43.193 --> 00:03:45.411
Symmetry, it turns out,

00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:48.938
is also an indicator of health.

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:51.883
In the 1930s,

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.499
a man named Maksymilian Faktorowicz

00:03:55.523 --> 00:03:58.700
recognized the importance
of symmetry for beauty

00:03:58.724 --> 00:04:00.879
when he designed the beauty micrometer.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.268
With this device,

00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:06.347
he could measure minor asymmetric flaws

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.920
which he could then make up for
with products he sold from his company,

00:04:10.944 --> 00:04:14.768
named brilliantly
after himself, Max Factor,

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:17.803
which, as you know,
is one of the world's most famous brands

00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:18.995
for "make up."

00:04:20.335 --> 00:04:24.293
The third factor that contributes
to facial attractiveness

00:04:24.317 --> 00:04:26.030
is the effect of hormones.

00:04:27.353 --> 00:04:31.407
And here, I need to apologize
for confining my comments

00:04:32.102 --> 00:04:33.669
to heterosexual norms.

00:04:35.438 --> 00:04:39.908
But estrogen and testosterone
play important roles

00:04:39.932 --> 00:04:42.530
in shaping features
that we find attractive.

00:04:43.463 --> 00:04:47.320
Estrogen produces features
that signal fertility.

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:51.104
Men typically find women attractive

00:04:51.128 --> 00:04:55.429
who have elements
of both youth and maturity.

00:04:56.003 --> 00:04:59.976
A face that's too baby-like might
mean that the girl is not yet fertile,

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:02.912
so men find women attractive

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:07.172
who have large eyes,
full lips and narrow chins

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:08.705
as indicators of youth,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.903
and high cheekbones
as an indicator of maturity.

00:05:14.384 --> 00:05:19.667
Testosterone produces features
that we regard as typically masculine.

00:05:20.597 --> 00:05:22.617
These include heavier brows,

00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:23.946
thinner cheeks

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.222
and bigger, squared-off jaws.

00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:28.036
But here's a fascinating irony.

00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:30.666
In many species,

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.071
if anything,

00:05:32.095 --> 00:05:35.787
testosterone suppresses the immune system.

00:05:36.822 --> 00:05:40.996
So the idea that testosterone-infused
features are a fitness indicator

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.245
doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.

00:05:44.003 --> 00:05:46.502
Here, the logic is turned on its head.

00:05:47.478 --> 00:05:49.627
Instead of a fitness indicator,

00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:53.058
scientists invoke a handicap principle.

00:05:54.609 --> 00:05:58.141
The most commonly cited
example of a handicap

00:05:58.165 --> 00:05:59.656
is the peacock's tail.

00:06:00.362 --> 00:06:04.758
This beautiful but cumbersome tail
doesn't exactly help the peacock

00:06:04.782 --> 00:06:06.044
avoid predators

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.187
and approach peahens.

00:06:09.008 --> 00:06:12.460
Why should such an extravagant
appendage evolve?

00:06:13.767 --> 00:06:15.362
Even Charles Darwin,

00:06:16.228 --> 00:06:19.627
in an 1860 letter to Asa Gray wrote

00:06:19.651 --> 00:06:23.423
that the sight of the peacock's tail
made him physically ill.

00:06:23.964 --> 00:06:26.862
He couldn't explain it
with his theory of natural selection,

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.785
and out of this frustration,

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:31.993
he developed the theory
of sexual selection.

00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:34.471
On this account,

00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:38.878
the display of the peacock's tail
is about sexual enticement,

00:06:38.902 --> 00:06:45.124
and this enticement means
it's more likely the peacock will mate

00:06:45.148 --> 00:06:46.482
and have offspring.

00:06:47.638 --> 00:06:50.627
Now, the modern twist
on this display argument

00:06:51.292 --> 00:06:56.262
is that the peacock is also
advertising its health to the peahen.

00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:02.948
Only especially fit organisms
can afford to divert resources

00:07:02.972 --> 00:07:05.670
to maintaining such
an extravagant appendage.

00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:11.305
Only especially fit men can afford
the price that testosterone levies

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:12.598
on their immune system.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.038
And by analogy, think of the fact

00:07:16.062 --> 00:07:23.027
that only very rich men can afford
to pay more than $10,000 for a watch

00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:25.301
as a display of their financial fitness.

00:07:26.933 --> 00:07:29.735
Now, many people hear these kinds
of evolutionary claims

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:35.489
and think they mean that we somehow
are unconsciously seeking mates

00:07:35.513 --> 00:07:37.428
who are healthy.

00:07:37.452 --> 00:07:40.395
And I think this idea
is probably not right.

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:46.951
Teenagers and young adults are not exactly
known for making decisions

00:07:46.975 --> 00:07:49.163
that are predicated on health concerns.

00:07:50.364 --> 00:07:51.965
But they don't have to be,

00:07:51.989 --> 00:07:53.472
and let me explain why.

00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:56.322
Imagine a population

00:07:57.028 --> 00:08:01.206
in which people have three different
kinds of preferences:

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.555
for green, for orange and for red.

00:08:05.742 --> 00:08:06.933
From their point of view,

00:08:06.957 --> 00:08:09.320
these preferences have
nothing to do with health;

00:08:09.344 --> 00:08:10.836
they just like what they like.

00:08:11.948 --> 00:08:15.989
But if it were also the case
that these preferences are associated

00:08:16.013 --> 00:08:19.011
with the different likelihood
of producing offspring --

00:08:19.035 --> 00:08:21.897
let's say in a ratio of 3:2:1 --

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.324
then in the first generation,

00:08:24.348 --> 00:08:27.620
there would be 3 greens
to 2 oranges to 1 red,

00:08:27.644 --> 00:08:29.830
and in each subsequent generation,

00:08:29.854 --> 00:08:32.560
the proportion of greens increase,

00:08:33.887 --> 00:08:35.598
so that in 10 generations,

00:08:35.622 --> 00:08:39.395
98 percent of this population
has a green preference.

00:08:39.783 --> 00:08:42.904
Now, a scientist coming in
and sampling this population

00:08:42.928 --> 00:08:46.577
discovers that green
preferences are universal.

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:51.298
So the point about this little
abstract example

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:55.982
is that while preferences
for specific physical features

00:08:56.006 --> 00:08:58.569
can be arbitrary for the individual,

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.680
if those features are heritable

00:09:05.052 --> 00:09:09.211
and they are associated
with a reproductive advantage,

00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:10.449
over time,

00:09:10.473 --> 00:09:12.400
they become universal for the group.

00:09:14.992 --> 00:09:20.193
So what happens in the brain
when we see beautiful people?

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.368
Attractive faces activate
parts of our visual cortex

00:09:26.392 --> 00:09:28.337
in the back of the brain,

00:09:28.361 --> 00:09:30.303
an area called the fusiform gyrus,

00:09:30.327 --> 00:09:33.129
that is especially tuned
to processing faces,

00:09:33.153 --> 00:09:37.167
and an adjacent area called
the lateral occipital complex,

00:09:37.191 --> 00:09:39.947
that is especially attuned
to processing objects.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.916
In addition,

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:47.018
attractive faces activate parts
of our reward and pleasure centers

00:09:47.042 --> 00:09:49.307
in the front and deep in the brain,

00:09:49.999 --> 00:09:53.123
and these include areas
that have complicated names,

00:09:53.147 --> 00:09:55.011
like the ventral striatum,

00:09:55.035 --> 00:09:56.954
the orbitofrontal cortex

00:09:56.978 --> 00:09:59.572
and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

00:10:00.552 --> 00:10:04.536
Our visual brain that is tuned
to processing faces

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.197
interacts with our pleasure centers

00:10:07.221 --> 00:10:09.668
to underpin the experience of beauty.

00:10:11.539 --> 00:10:15.631
Amazingly, while we all
engage with beauty,

00:10:15.655 --> 00:10:17.252
without our knowledge,

00:10:17.276 --> 00:10:19.034
beauty also engages us.

00:10:20.298 --> 00:10:22.797
Our brains respond to attractive faces

00:10:22.821 --> 00:10:25.175
even when we're not thinking about beauty.

00:10:26.457 --> 00:10:30.746
We conducted an experiment
in which people saw a series of faces,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.473
and in one condition,

00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:38.073
they had to decide if a pair of faces
were the same or a different person.

00:10:39.727 --> 00:10:42.220
Even in this condition,

00:10:42.244 --> 00:10:48.386
attractive faces drove neural activity
robustly in their visual cortex,

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.923
despite the fact that they were thinking
about a person's identity

00:10:51.947 --> 00:10:53.248
and not their beauty.

00:10:54.947 --> 00:10:59.258
Another group similarly found
automatic responses to beauty

00:10:59.282 --> 00:11:01.445
within our pleasure centers.

00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:05.160
Taken together, these studies suggest

00:11:05.853 --> 00:11:10.364
that our brain automatically
responds to beauty

00:11:10.388 --> 00:11:12.403
by linking vision and pleasure.

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:16.054
These beauty detectors, it seems,

00:11:16.078 --> 00:11:17.916
ping every time we see beauty,

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.634
regardless of whatever else
we might be thinking.

00:11:22.842 --> 00:11:28.331
We also have a "beauty is good"
stereotype embedded in the brain.

00:11:29.532 --> 00:11:31.759
Within the orbitofrontal cortex,

00:11:31.783 --> 00:11:33.558
there's overlapping neural activity

00:11:33.582 --> 00:11:37.366
in response to beauty and to goodness,

00:11:39.005 --> 00:11:42.527
and this happens even when people
aren't explicitly thinking

00:11:42.551 --> 00:11:44.154
about beauty or goodness.

00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:49.685
Our brains seem to reflexively
associate beauty and good.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.488
And this reflexive association
may be the biologic trigger

00:11:54.512 --> 00:11:57.194
for the many social effects of beauty.

00:11:57.877 --> 00:12:02.271
Attractive people receive
all kinds of advantages in life.

00:12:03.376 --> 00:12:06.130
They're regarded as more intelligent,

00:12:06.154 --> 00:12:07.757
more trustworthy,

00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:11.326
they're given higher pay
and lesser punishments,

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.072
even when such judgments
are not warranted.

00:12:15.392 --> 00:12:18.732
These kinds of observations
reveal beauty's ugly side.

00:12:19.616 --> 00:12:21.689
In my lab, we recently found

00:12:21.713 --> 00:12:26.635
that people with minor facial
anomalies and disfigurements

00:12:26.659 --> 00:12:30.443
are regarded as less good, less kind,

00:12:30.467 --> 00:12:34.898
less intelligent, less competent
and less hardworking.

00:12:35.674 --> 00:12:40.958
Unfortunately, we also have
a "disfigured is bad" stereotype.

00:12:42.218 --> 00:12:48.876
This stereotype is probably
exploited and magnified

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.313
by images in popular media,

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:55.233
in which facial disfigurement
is often used as a shorthand

00:12:55.257 --> 00:12:57.915
to depict someone of villainous character.

00:12:59.198 --> 00:13:02.652
We need to understand
these kinds of implicit biases

00:13:02.676 --> 00:13:04.413
if we are to overcome them

00:13:04.437 --> 00:13:08.118
and aim for a society
in which we treat people fairly,

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:12.557
based on their behavior and not
on the happenstance of their looks.

00:13:16.578 --> 00:13:19.823
Let me leave you with one final thought.

00:13:20.864 --> 00:13:22.912
Beauty is a work in progress.

00:13:24.347 --> 00:13:27.554
The so-called universal
attributes of beauty

00:13:27.578 --> 00:13:33.066
were selected for during the almost
two million years of the Pleistocene.

00:13:33.764 --> 00:13:38.656
Life was nasty, brutish
and a very long time ago.

00:13:39.834 --> 00:13:45.158
The selection criteria
for reproductive success from that time

00:13:45.182 --> 00:13:47.047
doesn't really apply today.

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.276
For example,

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.367
death by parasite is not one
of the top ways that people die,

00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:56.282
at least not in the technologically
developed world.

00:13:57.817 --> 00:14:00.177
From antibiotics to surgery,

00:14:00.201 --> 00:14:03.693
birth control to in vitro fertilization,

00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:07.107
the filters for reproductive success
are being relaxed.

00:14:07.776 --> 00:14:10.431
And under these relaxed conditions,

00:14:10.455 --> 00:14:14.689
preference and trait combinations
are free to drift

00:14:14.713 --> 00:14:16.482
and become more variable.

00:14:17.236 --> 00:14:21.422
Even as we are profoundly
affecting our environment,

00:14:22.805 --> 00:14:26.118
modern medicine
and technological innovation

00:14:26.142 --> 00:14:27.895
is profoundly affecting

00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:31.641
the very essence of what it means
to look beautiful.

00:14:33.017 --> 00:14:35.567
The universal nature of beauty is changing

00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:38.512
even as we're changing the universe.

00:14:40.683 --> 00:14:41.868
Thank you.

00:14:41.892 --> 00:14:45.478
