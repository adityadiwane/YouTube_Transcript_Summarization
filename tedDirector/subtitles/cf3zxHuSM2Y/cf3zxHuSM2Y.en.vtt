00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I love the Internet.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
It's true.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Think about everything it has brought us.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Think about all the services we use,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
all the connectivity,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
all the entertainment,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
all the business, all the commerce.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And it's happening during our lifetimes.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
I'm pretty sure that one day

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
we'll be writing history books

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
hundreds of years from now. This time

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
our generation will be remembered

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
as the generation that got online,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
the generation

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
that built something really and truly global.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
But yes, it's also true

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that the Internet has problems, very serious problems,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
problems with security

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and problems with privacy.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I've spent my career

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
fighting these problems.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
So let me show you something.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
This here

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
is Brain.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
This is a floppy disk

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
-- five and a quarter-inch floppy disk

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
infected by Brain.A.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
It's the first virus we ever found

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
for PC computers.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
And we actually know

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
where Brain came from.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
We know because it says so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
inside the code.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Let's take a look.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
All right.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
That's the boot sector of an infected floppy,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and if we take a closer look inside,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
we'll see that right there,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
it says, "Welcome to the dungeon."

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And then it continues,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
saying, 1986, Basit and Amjad.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And Basit and Amjad are first names,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Pakistani first names.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
In fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.260
(Laughter)

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Now, 1986.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Now it's 2011.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
That's 25 years ago.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.260
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
So half a year ago,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
I decided to go to Pakistan myself.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
So let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
This is from the city of Lahore,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
which is around 300 kilometers south

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
from Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Here's a typical street view.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And here's the street or road leading to this building,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.260
which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And I knocked on the door.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
(Laughter)

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
You want to guess who opened the door?

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Basit and Amjad; they are still there.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
(Laughter)

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.260
(Applause)

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
So here standing up is Basit.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Sitting down is his brother Amjad.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
I asked them why.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
I asked them how they feel about what they started.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And I got some sort of satisfaction

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
from learning that both Basit and Amjad

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
had had their computers infected dozens of times

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
by completely unrelated other viruses

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
over these years.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
So there is some sort of justice

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
in the world after all.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
Now, the viruses that we used to see

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
in the 1980s and 1990s

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
obviously are not a problem any more.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
So let me just show you a couple of examples

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
of what they used to look like.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
What I'm running here

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
is a system that enables me

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
to run age-old programs on a modern computer.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
So let me just mount some drives. Go over there.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
What we have here is a list of old viruses.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
So let me just run some viruses on my computer.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
For example,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
let's go with the Centipede virus first.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And you can see at the top of the screen,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
there's a centipede scrolling across your computer

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
when you get infected by this one.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
You know that you're infected

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
because it actually shows up.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
invented in Russia in 1992.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.260
(Siren noise)

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And the last example,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
guess what the Walker virus does?

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
once you get infected.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
So it used to be fairly easy to know

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
that you're infected by a virus,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
when the viruses were written by hobbyists

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
and teenagers.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Today, they are no longer being written

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
by hobbyists and teenagers.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Today, viruses are a global problem.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
What we have here in the background

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
is an example of our systems that we run in our labs,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
where we track virus infections worldwide.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
So we can actually see in real time

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and Russia and elsewhere.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
through the Web,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
we can see in real time

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
just some kind of idea of how many viruses,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
how many new examples of malware we find every single day.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Here's the latest virus we've found,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
in a file called Server.exe.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And we found it right over here three seconds ago --

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
the previous one, six seconds ago.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
And if we just scroll around,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
it's just massive.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
And that's the last 20 minutes of malware

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
every single day.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
So where are all these coming from then?

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.260
Well today, it's the organized criminal gangs

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
writing these viruses

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
because they make money with their viruses.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
It's gangs like --

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
let's go to GangstaBucks.com.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
This is a website operating in Moscow

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.260
where these guys are buying infected computers.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
So if you are a virus writer

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and you're capable of infecting Windows computers,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
but you don't know what to do with them,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
you can sell those infected computers --

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
somebody else's computers -- to these guys.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And they'll actually pay you money for those computers.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
So how do these guys then monetize

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
those infected computers?

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Well there's multiple different ways,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
when you do online banking,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
or keyloggers.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.260
Keyloggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and they record everything you type.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Every single Google search you type

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
is saved and sent to the criminals.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Same thing with every single password and so on.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
But the thing that they're actually looking for most

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
are sessions where you go online

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
and do online purchases in any online store.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
Because when you do purchases in online stores,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
you will be typing in your name, the delivery address,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
your credit card number and the credit card security codes.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And here's an example of a file

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
we found from a server a couple of weeks ago.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
That's the credit card number,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
that's the expiration date, that's the security code,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and that's the name of the owner of the card.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
Once you gain access to other people's credit card information,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
you can just go online and buy whatever you want

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
with this information.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And that, obviously, is a problem.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.260
We now have a whole underground marketplace

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
and business ecosystem

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
built around online crime.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
One example of how these guys

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
actually are capable of monetizing their operations:

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
and search for wanted persons.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and his partner in crime,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
a U.S. citizen.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
These guys were running an operation called I.M.U.,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
They are both right now on the run.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Nobody knows where they are.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
froze a Swiss bank account

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
belonging to Mr. Jain,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
So the amount of money online crime generates

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
is significant.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And that means that the online criminals

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
can actually afford to invest into their attacks.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
We know that online criminals

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
are hiring programmers, hiring testing people,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
testing their code,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
having back-end systems with SQL databases.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
And they can afford to watch how we work --

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
like how security people work --

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and try to work their way around

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
any security precautions we can build.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
They also use the global nature of Internet

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
to their advantage.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
I mean, the Internet is international.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
That's why we call it the Internet.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
And if you just go and take a look

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
at what's happening in the online world,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
here's a video built by Clarified Networks,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.260
which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
moves around from one country to another

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
as soon as the website is tried to shut down.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
So you just can't shut these guys down.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
They will switch from one country to another,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
from one jurisdiction to another --

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
moving around the world,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
using the fact that we don't have the capability

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
to globally police operations like this.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
So the Internet is as if

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
someone would have given free plane tickets

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
to all the online criminals of the world.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Now, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
can reach us.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals?

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
How do you actually track them down?

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Let me give you an example.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
What we have here is one exploit file.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
which contains an exploit.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
it actually takes over your computer and runs code.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
Now, if you'll take a look at this image file --

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
well there's the image header,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and there the actual code of the attack starts.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
And that code has been encrypted,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
so let's decrypt it.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
You just have to believe me,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
it is, it is.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And we can go here

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
and actually start decrypting it.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
But just keep staring at it.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
You'll actually see that down here

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
you can see a Web address:

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:59.260
unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
And when you view this image on your computer

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
it actually is going to download and run that program.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
But even more interestingly,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
if we continue decrypting,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
we'll find this mysterious string,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:17.260
which says O600KO78RUS.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
That code is there underneath the encryption

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
as some sort of a signature.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
It's not used for anything.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
And I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
So obviously I Googled for it.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
I got zero hits; wasn't there.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
So I spoke with the guys at the lab.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
and one of them mentioned,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
well, it ends in RUS like Russia.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And 78 is the city code

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
for the city of St. Petersburg.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
For example, you can find it from some phone numbers

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
and car license plates and stuff like that.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
and through a long road,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.260
we eventually found this one particular website.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
who runs his own website,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And on this blog, he blogs about his life,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
about his life in St. Petersburg --

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
he's in his early 20s --

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
about his cat,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
about his girlfriend.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
And he drives a very nice car.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
In fact, this guy drives

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
a Mercedes-Benz S600

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
V12

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
with a six-liter engine

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
with more than 400 horsepower.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
How do I know about this car?

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
Because he blogged about the car.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
He actually had a car accident.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
In downtown St. Petersburg,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
he actually crashed his car into another car.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And he put blogged images about the car accident --

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
that's his Mercedes --

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.260
right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
ends in 78RUS.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
And if you actually take a look at the scene picture,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
you can see that the plate of the Mercedes

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:05.260
is O600KO78RUS.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
Now I'm not a lawyer,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
but if I would be,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
this is where I would say, "I rest my case."

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
(Laughter)

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
So what happens when online criminals are caught?

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
Well in most cases it never gets this far.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
The vast majority of the online crime cases,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
And even if we are able to find online criminals,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
quite often there is no outcome.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
or for some reason we can't take them down.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
I wish it would be easier;

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
unfortunately it isn't.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
But things are also changing

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
at a very rapid pace.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
You've all heard about things like Stuxnet.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
So if you look at what Stuxnet did

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
is that it infected these.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
That's a Siemens S7-400 PLC,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
programmable logic [controller].

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
And this is what runs our infrastructure.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
This is what runs everything around us.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
PLC's, these small boxes which have no display,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
no keyboard,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
For example, the elevators in this building

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.260
most likely are controlled by one of these.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
And when Stuxnet infects one of these,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
that's a massive revolution

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
on the kinds of risks we have to worry about.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
Because everything around us is being run by these.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
I mean, we have critical infrastructure.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
You go to any factory, any power plant,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
any chemical plant, any food processing plant,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
you look around --

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
everything is being run by computers.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
Everything is being run by computers.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Everything is reliant on these computers working.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
We have become very reliant

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
on Internet,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
on basic things like electricity, obviously,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
on computers working.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
And this really is something

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
which creates completely new problems for us.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
We must have some way

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
of continuing to work

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
even if computers fail.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
(Laughter)

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:24.260
(Applause)

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
So preparedness means that we can do stuff

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
even when the things we take for granted

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
aren't there.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
It's actually very basic stuff --

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
thinking about continuity, thinking about backups,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
thinking about the things that actually matter.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
Now I told you --

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
(Laughter)

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.260
I love the Internet. I do.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
Think about all the services we have online.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
Think about if they are taken away from you,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
if one day you don't actually have them

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
for some reason or another.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
I see beauty in the future of the Internet,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
but I'm worried

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
that we might not see that.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
I'm worried that we are running into problems

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
because of online crime.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
Online crime is the one thing

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
that might take these things away from us.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
(Laughter)

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
I've spent my life

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
defending the Net,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.260
we are running a risk of losing it all.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
We have to do this globally,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
and we have to do it right now.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
What we need

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
is more global, international law enforcement work

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
to find online criminal gangs --

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
these organized gangs

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
that are making millions out of their attacks.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
That's much more important

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
than running anti-viruses or running firewalls.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
What actually matters

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
is actually finding the people behind these attacks,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
and even more importantly,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
we have to find the people

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
who are about to become

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
part of this online world of crime,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
but haven't yet done it.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
We have to find the people with the skills,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
but without the opportunities

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
and give them the opportunities

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
to use their skills for good.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:28.260
(Applause)
