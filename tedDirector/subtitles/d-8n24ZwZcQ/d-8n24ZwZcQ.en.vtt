00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.452
It's easy to forget that last night,

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:19.682
one billion people went to sleep
without access to electricity.

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:21.424
One billion people.

00:00:22.298 --> 00:00:27.037
Two and a half billion people
did not have access to clean cooking fuels

00:00:27.553 --> 00:00:28.885
or clean heating fuels.

00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:32.596
Those are the problems
in the developing world.

00:00:32.982 --> 00:00:35.618
And it's easy for us not to be empathetic

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:37.955
with those people
who seem so distanced from us.

00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:41.106
But even in our own world,
the developed world,

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:44.630
we see the tension of stagnant economies

00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:47.849
impacting the lives of people around us.

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.345
We see it in whole pieces of the economy,

00:00:51.813 --> 00:00:54.912
where the people involved
have lost hope about the future

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.942
and despair about the present.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.005
We see that in the Brexit vote.

00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:02.985
We see that in the Sanders/Trump
campaigns in my own country.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:08.195
But even in countries as recently
turning the corner

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.439
towards being in the developed world,

00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:11.703
in China,

00:01:11.727 --> 00:01:14.303
we see the difficulty
that President Xi has

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.666
as he begins to un-employ so many people
in his coal and mining industries

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:22.145
who see no future for themselves.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:26.186
As we as a society
figure out how to manage

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.163
the problems of the developed world

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:30.235
and the problems of the developing world,

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.107
we have to look at how we move forward

00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:36.841
and manage the environmental impact
of those decisions.

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:40.967
We've been working on this problem
for 25 years, since Rio,

00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:42.674
the Kyoto Protocols.

00:01:43.223 --> 00:01:45.797
Our most recent move is the Paris treaty,

00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:49.088
and the resulting climate agreements

00:01:49.112 --> 00:01:52.021
that are being ratified
by nations around the world.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:54.232
I think we can be very hopeful

00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:57.394
that those agreements,
which are bottom-up agreements,

00:01:57.418 --> 00:02:00.279
where nations have said
what they think they can do,

00:02:00.303 --> 00:02:04.381
are genuine and forthcoming
for the vast majority of the parties.

00:02:04.977 --> 00:02:06.545
The unfortunate thing

00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:10.732
is that now, as we look
at the independent analyses

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:13.955
of what those climate treaties
are liable to yield,

00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:17.992
the magnitude of the problem
before us becomes clear.

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:23.038
This is the United States
Energy Information Agency's assessment

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:28.313
of what will happen if the countries
implement the climate commitments

00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:30.373
that they've made in Paris

00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:32.348
between now and 2040.

00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:37.441
It shows basically CO2 emissions
around the world

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:39.146
over the next 30 years.

00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:43.752
There are three things that you need
to look at and appreciate.

00:02:44.177 --> 00:02:48.348
One, CO2 emissions are expected
to continue to grow

00:02:48.372 --> 00:02:49.831
for the next 30 years.

00:02:51.265 --> 00:02:53.531
In order to control climate,

00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:57.040
CO2 emissions have to literally go to zero

00:02:57.564 --> 00:03:01.718
because it's the cumulative emissions
that drive heating on the planet.

00:03:02.445 --> 00:03:06.560
This should tell you that we are losing
the race to fossil fuels.

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:09.430
The second thing you should notice

00:03:09.454 --> 00:03:13.747
is that the bulk of the growth
comes from the developing countries,

00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:16.836
from China, from India,
from the rest of the world,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.099
which includes South Africa
and Indonesia and Brazil,

00:03:21.024 --> 00:03:23.853
as most of these countries
move their people

00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:27.264
into the lower range of lifestyles

00:03:27.288 --> 00:03:31.054
that we literally take for granted
in the developed world.

00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:34.878
The final thing that you should notice

00:03:34.902 --> 00:03:36.561
is that each year,

00:03:37.394 --> 00:03:44.354
about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting
added to the planet's atmosphere,

00:03:44.994 --> 00:03:47.626
and then diffusing into the ocean
and into the land.

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:53.321
That's on top of the 550 gigatons
that are in place today.

00:03:54.062 --> 00:03:55.896
At the end of 30 years,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.473
we will have put 850 gigatons
of carbon into the air,

00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:03.422
and that probably goes a long way

00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:09.607
towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase
in global mean surface temperatures,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.826
locking in ocean acidification

00:04:13.227 --> 00:04:15.204
and locking in sea level rise.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:19.205
Now, this is a projection made by men

00:04:20.197 --> 00:04:22.125
by the actions of society,

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:25.339
and it's ours to change, not to accept.

00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:29.790
But the magnitude of the problem
is something we need to appreciate.

00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:33.091
Different nations make
different energy choices.

00:04:33.115 --> 00:04:35.442
It's a function
of their natural resources.

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:37.475
It's a function of their climate.

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:41.981
It's a function of the development path
that they've followed as a society.

00:04:42.664 --> 00:04:46.167
It's a function of where
on the surface of the planet they are.

00:04:46.191 --> 00:04:48.691
Are they where it's dark
a lot of the time,

00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:50.576
or are they at the mid-latitudes?

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:54.708
Many, many, many things
go into the choices of countries,

00:04:55.185 --> 00:04:57.362
and they each make a different choice.

00:04:58.878 --> 00:05:02.040
The overwhelming thing
that we need to appreciate

00:05:02.064 --> 00:05:03.981
is the choice that China has made.

00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:07.289
China has made the choice,

00:05:07.313 --> 00:05:09.818
and will make the choice, to run on coal.

00:05:10.358 --> 00:05:12.377
The United States has an alternative.

00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:14.158
It can run on natural gas

00:05:14.182 --> 00:05:18.007
as a result of the inventions
of fracking and shale gas,

00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:19.502
which we have here.

00:05:19.526 --> 00:05:21.091
They provide an alternative.

00:05:22.662 --> 00:05:25.373
The OECD Europe has a choice.

00:05:25.881 --> 00:05:28.950
It has renewables that it can afford
to deploy in Germany

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:31.591
because it's rich enough
to afford to do it.

00:05:31.615 --> 00:05:37.103
The French and the British
show interest in nuclear power.

00:05:37.702 --> 00:05:42.307
Eastern Europe, still very heavily
committed to natural gas and to coal,

00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:45.059
and with natural gas
that comes from Russia,

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:46.853
with all of its entanglements.

00:05:47.558 --> 00:05:50.015
China has many fewer choices

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.289
and a much harder row to hoe.

00:05:53.557 --> 00:05:56.589
If you look at China, and you ask yourself

00:05:56.613 --> 00:05:58.817
why has coal been important to it,

00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:01.053
you have to remember what China's done.

00:06:01.534 --> 00:06:04.841
China brought people to power,
not power to people.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.830
It didn't do rural electrification.

00:06:08.427 --> 00:06:09.601
It urbanized.

00:06:09.954 --> 00:06:14.158
It urbanized by taking low-cost labor
and low-cost energy,

00:06:14.182 --> 00:06:16.099
creating export industries

00:06:16.123 --> 00:06:18.630
that could fund a tremendous
amount of growth.

00:06:19.535 --> 00:06:21.739
If we look at China's path,

00:06:21.763 --> 00:06:25.896
all of us know that prosperity in China
has dramatically increased.

00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:31.259
In 1980, 80 percent of China's population

00:06:31.283 --> 00:06:33.717
lived below the extreme poverty level,

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:38.253
below the level of having
$1.90 per person per day.

00:06:38.658 --> 00:06:44.130
By the year 2000, only 20 percent
of China's population

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.688
lived below the extreme poverty level --

00:06:47.498 --> 00:06:49.192
a remarkable feat,

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:52.344
admittedly, with some costs
in civil liberties

00:06:52.368 --> 00:06:55.324
that would be tough to accept
in the Western world.

00:06:56.548 --> 00:06:59.455
But the impact of all that wealth

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:02.992
allowed people to get
massively better nutrition.

00:07:03.484 --> 00:07:06.199
It allowed water pipes to be placed.

00:07:06.223 --> 00:07:08.682
It allowed sewage pipes to be placed,

00:07:08.706 --> 00:07:11.678
dramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases,

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.213
at the cost of some outdoor air pollution.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.350
But in 1980, and even today,

00:07:18.374 --> 00:07:22.381
the number one killer in China
is indoor air pollution,

00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:27.602
because people do not have access
to clean cooking and heating fuels.

00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:30.174
In fact, in 2040,

00:07:31.794 --> 00:07:36.569
it's still estimated
that 200 million people in China

00:07:36.593 --> 00:07:40.144
will not have access
to clean cooking fuels.

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:43.489
They have a remarkable path to follow.

00:07:44.854 --> 00:07:49.602
India also needs to meet the needs
of its own people,

00:07:49.626 --> 00:07:51.800
and it's going to do that by burning coal.

00:07:52.475 --> 00:07:57.953
When we look at the EIA's projections
of coal burning in India,

00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:03.494
India will supply nearly four times
as much of its energy from coal

00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:05.557
as it will from renewables.

00:08:06.962 --> 00:08:09.815
It's not because they don't know
the alternatives;

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:13.584
it's because rich countries
can do what they choose,

00:08:14.162 --> 00:08:16.309
poor countries do what they must.

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:21.883
So what can we do to stop
coal's emissions in time?

00:08:22.899 --> 00:08:27.511
What can we do that changes
this forecast that's in front of us?

00:08:27.535 --> 00:08:31.602
Because it's a forecast that we can change
if we have the will to do it.

00:08:33.094 --> 00:08:36.513
First of all, we have to think
about the magnitude of the problem.

00:08:36.537 --> 00:08:38.581
Between now and 2040,

00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:44.847
800 to 1,600 new coal plants
are going to be built around the world.

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:50.694
This week, between one and three
one-gigawatt coal plants

00:08:50.718 --> 00:08:52.929
are being turned on around the world.

00:08:53.817 --> 00:08:57.867
That's happening regardless
of what we want,

00:08:57.891 --> 00:09:00.399
because the people
that rule their countries,

00:09:00.423 --> 00:09:02.793
assessing the interests of their citizens,

00:09:02.817 --> 00:09:06.232
have decided it's in the interest
of their citizens to do that.

00:09:07.335 --> 00:09:11.302
And that's going to happen
unless they have a better alternative.

00:09:11.726 --> 00:09:15.483
And every 100 of those plants will use up

00:09:15.507 --> 00:09:18.638
between one percent and three percent

00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:20.280
of the Earth's climate budget.

00:09:21.264 --> 00:09:24.755
So every day that you go home
thinking that you should do something

00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:26.055
about global warming,

00:09:26.594 --> 00:09:28.526
at the end of that week, remember:

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:32.943
somebody fired up a coal plant
that's going to run for 50 years

00:09:32.967 --> 00:09:36.043
and take away your ability to change it.

00:09:37.972 --> 00:09:41.566
What we've forgotten is something
that Vinod Khosla used to talk about,

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.712
a man of Indian ethnicity
but an American venture capitalist.

00:09:45.339 --> 00:09:48.164
And he said, back in the early 2000s,

00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:52.195
that if you needed to get
China and India off of fossil fuels,

00:09:52.219 --> 00:09:55.815
you had to create a technology
that passed the "Chindia test,"

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.099
"Chindia" being the appending
of the two words.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.259
It had to be first of all viable,

00:10:02.283 --> 00:10:05.877
meaning that technically, they could
implement it in their country,

00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:08.905
and that it would be accepted
by the people in the country.

00:10:10.191 --> 00:10:16.764
Two, it had to be a technology
that was scalable,

00:10:16.788 --> 00:10:19.806
that it could deliver the same benefits

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.907
on the same timetable as fossil fuels,

00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:27.179
so that they can enjoy the kind of life,
again, that we take for granted.

00:10:27.766 --> 00:10:30.275
And third, it had to be cost-effective

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:32.985
without subsidy or without mandate.

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:36.146
It had to stand on its own two feet;

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.049
it could not be maintained
for that many people

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:42.529
if in fact, those countries
had to go begging

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:46.828
or had some foreign country say,
"I won't trade with you,"

00:10:47.328 --> 00:10:50.611
in order to get
the technology shift to occur.

00:10:52.168 --> 00:10:53.854
If you look at the Chindia test,

00:10:53.878 --> 00:10:58.503
we simply have not come up
with alternatives that meet that test.

00:10:58.984 --> 00:11:01.828
That's what the EIA forecast tells us.

00:11:02.765 --> 00:11:06.115
China's building 800 gigawatts of coal,

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:09.050
400 gigawatts of hydro,

00:11:09.772 --> 00:11:12.144
about 200 gigawatts of nuclear,

00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:16.562
and on an energy-equivalent basis,
adjusting for intermittency,

00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:18.877
about 100 gigawatts of renewables.

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:21.462
800 gigawatts of coal.

00:11:21.805 --> 00:11:25.357
They're doing that, knowing the costs
better than any other country,

00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.933
knowing the need better
than any other country.

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:31.081
But that's what they're aiming for in 2040

00:11:31.105 --> 00:11:33.429
unless we give them a better choice.

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:35.639
To give them a better choice,

00:11:35.663 --> 00:11:38.224
it's going to have to meet
the Chindia test.

00:11:38.248 --> 00:11:40.906
If you look at all the alternatives
that are out there,

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.430
there are really two
that come near to meeting it.

00:11:43.865 --> 00:11:47.750
First is this area of new nuclear
that I'll talk about in just a second.

00:11:48.107 --> 00:11:51.407
It's a new generation of nuclear plants
that are on the drawing boards

00:11:51.431 --> 00:11:52.707
around the world,

00:11:52.731 --> 00:11:55.069
and the people who are
developing these say

00:11:55.093 --> 00:11:58.634
we can get them
in position to demo by 2025

00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:02.525
and to scale by 2030,
if you will just let us.

00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:06.080
The second alternative
that could be there in time

00:12:06.771 --> 00:12:10.476
is utility-scale solar
backed up with natural gas,

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.224
which we can use today,

00:12:12.248 --> 00:12:15.182
versus the batteries
which are still under development.

00:12:16.589 --> 00:12:18.924
So what's holding new nuclear back?

00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:23.361
Outdated regulations
and yesterday's mindsets.

00:12:23.972 --> 00:12:28.167
We have not used our latest
scientific thinking on radiological health

00:12:28.191 --> 00:12:30.879
to think how we communicate
with the public

00:12:30.903 --> 00:12:33.281
and govern the testing
of new nuclear reactors.

00:12:33.729 --> 00:12:37.926
We have new scientific knowledge
that we need to use

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.489
in order to improve the way
we regulate nuclear industry.

00:12:42.872 --> 00:12:45.321
The second thing is we've got a mindset

00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:48.154
that it takes 25 years
and 2 to 5 billion dollars

00:12:48.178 --> 00:12:49.913
to develop a nuclear power plant.

00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:53.866
That comes from the historical,
military mindset

00:12:54.443 --> 00:12:56.851
of the places nuclear power came from.

00:12:57.356 --> 00:12:59.567
These new nuclear ventures are saying

00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:02.496
that they can deliver power
for 5 cents a kilowatt hour;

00:13:03.212 --> 00:13:05.813
they can deliver it
for 100 gigawatts a year;

00:13:06.543 --> 00:13:08.772
they can demo it by 2025;

00:13:09.168 --> 00:13:12.173
and they can deliver it in scale by 2030,

00:13:12.634 --> 00:13:14.833
if only we give them a chance.

00:13:16.064 --> 00:13:18.967
Right now, we're basically
waiting for a miracle.

00:13:19.888 --> 00:13:21.472
What we need is a choice.

00:13:21.952 --> 00:13:24.756
If they can't make it safe,
if they can't make it cheap,

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.597
it should not be deployed.

00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:30.675
But what I want you to do
is not carry an idea forward,

00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:32.350
but write your leaders,

00:13:32.374 --> 00:13:34.752
write the head of the NGOs you support,

00:13:34.776 --> 00:13:37.719
and tell them to give you the choice,

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.441
not the past.

00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:40.649
Thank you very much.

00:13:40.673 --> 00:13:45.465
(Applause)
