00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I have a studio in Berlin --

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
let me cue on here --

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.330
which is down there in this snow, just last weekend.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
In the studio we do a lot of experiments.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
I would consider the studio more like a laboratory.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
I have occasional meetings with scientists.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.330
And I have an academy, a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
We have an annual gathering of people,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
and that is called Life in Space.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.330
Life in Space is really not necessarily about

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
how we do things, but why we do things.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
Do you mind looking, with me, at that little cross in the center there?

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
So just keep looking. Don't mind me.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.330
So you will have a yellow circle, and we will do an after-image experiment.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.330
When the circle goes away you will have another color, the complementary color.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.330
I am saying something. And your eyes and your brain are saying something back.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
This whole idea of sharing, the idea of constituting reality

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330
by overlapping what I say and what you say --

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
think of a movie.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
Since two years now, with some stipends from the science ministry in Berlin,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.330
I've been working on these films

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
where we produce the film together.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
Obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
But nevertheless, what the potential is --

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
and just keep looking there --

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
what the potential is, obviously,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
is to kind of move the border of who is the author,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
and who is the receiver.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
Who is the consumer, if you want,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
and who has responsibility for what one sees?

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
I think there is a socializing dimension

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
in, kind of, moving that border.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
Who decides what reality is?

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
This is the Tate Modern in London.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
The show was, in a sense, about that.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.330
It was about a space in which I put half a semi-circular yellow disk.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
I also put a mirror in the ceiling, and some fog, some haze.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
And my idea was to make the space tangible.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
With such a big space, the problem is

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
obviously that there is a discrepancy

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
between what your body can embrace,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
and what the space, in that sense, is.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.330
So here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
if you want -- some fog -- I could make the space tangible.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
And what happens is that people, they start to see themselves in this space.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
So look at this. Look at the girl.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
Of course they have to look through a bloody camera

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
in a museum. Right? That's how museums are working today.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
But look at her face there,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
as she's checking out, looking at herself in the mirror.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
"Oh! That was my foot there!"

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
She wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.330
And in that whole idea,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.330
how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space?

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
How do we reconfigure it?

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
How do we know that being in a space makes a difference?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
Do you see when I said in the beginning, it's about

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
why, rather than how?

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
The why meant really,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
"What consequences does it have when I take a step?"

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
"What does it matter?"

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
"Does it matter if I am in the world or not?"

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
"And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
filter into a sense of responsibility?"

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
Is art about that?

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
I would say yes. It is obviously about

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
not just about decorating the world, and making it look even better,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
or even worse, if you ask me.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
It's obviously also about taking responsibility,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
like I did here when throwing some green dye in the river

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.330
in L.A., Stockholm, Norway and Tokyo,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
among other places.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
The green dye is not environmentally dangerous,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
but it obviously looks really rather frightening.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330
And it's on the other side also, I think, quite beautiful,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.330
as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
in these different places of the world.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.330
The "Green river," as a kind of activist idea, not a part of an exhibition,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
it was really about showing people,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
in this city, as they walk by,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.330
that space has dimensions. A space has time.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.330
And the water flows through the city with time.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
The water has an ability to make

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
the city negotiable, tangible.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
Negotiable meaning that it makes a difference

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
whether you do something or not.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
It makes a difference whether you say, "I'm a part of this city.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
And if I vote it makes a difference.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
If I take a stand, it makes a difference."

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.330
This whole idea of a city not being a picture is,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
I think, something that art, in a sense,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
always was working with.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
The idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.330
between what it means to be in a picture,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
and what it means to be in a space. What is the difference?

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
The difference between thinking and doing.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
So these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.330
Iceland, lower right corner, my favorite place.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.330
These kinds of experiments, they filter into architectural models.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
These are ongoing experiments.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
One is an experiment I did for BMW,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
an attempt to make a car.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
It's made out of ice.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
A crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
which I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
A sort of a run track, or a walk track,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
on the top of a museum in Denmark,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.330
which is made of colored glass, going all around.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
So the movement with your legs

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
will change the color of your horizon.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
And two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
with the Serpentine Gallery:

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
a kind of a temporal pavilion where

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.330
moving was the only way you could see the pavilion.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
This summer, in New York:

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
there is one thing about falling water which is very much about

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
the time it takes for water to fall.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
It's quite simple and fundamental.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330
I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
And as you come to a new valley,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
as you come to a new landscape, you have a certain view.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
If you stand still, the landscape

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.330
doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
The moment you start to move, the mountain starts to move.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
The big mountains far away, they move less.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
The small mountains in the foreground, they move more.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
And if you stop again, you wonder,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
"Is that a one-hour valley?

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.330
Or is that a three-hour hike, or is that a whole day I'm looking at?"

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
If you have a waterfall in there,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
right out there at the horizon; you look at the waterfall

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.330
and you go, "Oh, the water is falling really slowly."

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
And you go, "My god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall."

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
If a waterfall is falling faster,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
it's a smaller waterfall which is closer by --

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.330
because the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
And your body somehow knows that.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.330
So this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.330
Of course being an iconic city like New York,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
that has had an interest in somehow

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
playing around with the sense of space, you could say that New York

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
wants to seem as big as possible.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
Adding a measurement

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
to that is interesting:

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.330
the falling water suddenly gives you a sense

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.330
of, "Oh, Brooklyn is exactly this much --

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.330
the distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan, in this case

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
the lower East River is this big."

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
And why would we want to do that?

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
Because I think it makes a difference

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
whether you have a body

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
that feels a part of a space,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
And "Ha-ha, there is a picture and here is I. And what does it matter?"

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
Is there a sense of consequences?

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
So if I have a sense of the space,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
if I feel that the space is tangible,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.330
if I feel there is time,

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
if there is a dimension I could call time,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
I also feel that I can change the space.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.330
And suddenly it makes a difference

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
in terms of making space accessible.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
One could say this is about

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
community, collectivity.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
It's about being together.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
How do we create public space?

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
What does the word "public" mean today anyway?

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
So, asked in that way,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
I think it raises great things about

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
parliamentary ideas, democracy, public space,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
being together, being individual.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
How do we create

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
an idea which is both tolerant to individuality,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
and also to collectivity,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
without polarizing the two

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
into two different opposites?

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.330
Of course the political agendas in the world

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
has been very obsessed, polarizing the two against each other

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
into different, very normative ideas.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
I would claim that art and culture,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
and this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
in the times we're living in now,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
have proven that one can

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.330
create a kind of a space

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
which is both sensitive to individuality

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
and to collectivity.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.330
It's very much about this causality, consequences.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.330
It's very much about the way we link

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
thinking and doing.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
So what is between thinking and doing?

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
And right in-between thinking and doing,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
I would say, there is experience.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
And experience is not just

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.330
a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
Experience is about responsibility.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.330
Having an experience is taking part in the world.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.330
Taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
So art, in that sense,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
I think holds an incredible relevance

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
in the world in which we're moving into,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
particularly right now.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
That's all I have. Thank you very much.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
(Applause)
