00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.543
Living in Africa is to be on the edge,

00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:18.297
metaphorically, and quite literally

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:21.929
when you think about connectivity before 2008.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.641
Though many human intellectual and technological leaps

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.665
had happened in Europe and the rest of the world,

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:31.254
but Africa was sort of cut off.

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:33.881
And that changed, first with ships

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:37.158
when we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution

00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:39.259
and also the Industrial Revolution.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:42.286
And now we've got the digital revolution.

00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:45.286
These revolutions have not been evenly distributed

00:00:45.286 --> 00:00:47.619
across continents and nations.

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:50.349
Never have been.

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:54.114
Now, this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables

00:00:54.114 --> 00:00:57.018
that connect Africa to the rest of the world.

00:00:57.018 --> 00:00:59.058
What I find amazing is that Africa

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.868
is transcending its geography problem.

00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:03.682
Africa is connecting to the rest of the world

00:01:03.682 --> 00:01:05.518
and within itself.

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:08.794
The connectivity situation has improved greatly,

00:01:08.794 --> 00:01:10.995
but some barriers remain.

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:14.683
It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be.

00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:19.219
In 2008, one of the problems that we faced

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.757
was lack of information flow.

00:01:21.757 --> 00:01:24.053
There was a media blackout in 2008,

00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:26.429
when there was post-election violence in Kenya.

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.253
It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time.

00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:32.003
So we came together and we created software

00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:33.569
called Ushahidi.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.169
And Ushahidi means "testimony" or "witness" in Swahili.

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:40.339
I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators.

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:42.445
This is David and Erik.

00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:44.517
I call them brothers from another mother.

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:47.529
Clearly I have a German mother somewhere.

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:50.118
And we worked together first with building

00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:51.566
and growing Ushahidi.

00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:54.565
And the idea of the software was to gather information

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:57.338
from SMS, email and web, and put a map

00:01:57.338 --> 00:02:00.253
so that you could see what was happening where,

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.357
and you could visualize that data.

00:02:02.357 --> 00:02:04.613
And after that initial prototype,

00:02:04.613 --> 00:02:07.108
we set out to make free and open-source software

00:02:07.108 --> 00:02:11.959
so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.930
All the while, we also wanted to give back

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.162
to the local tech community that helped us

00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:19.667
grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:22.250
And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.274
an actual physical space

00:02:24.274 --> 00:02:26.740
where we could collaborate,

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.297
and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya.

00:02:31.297 --> 00:02:34.067
We did that with the support of different organizations

00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:37.072
like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network.

00:02:37.072 --> 00:02:40.249
And we were able to grow this software footprint,

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.015
and a few years later it became

00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:45.712
very useful software,

00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:48.939
and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.008
where citizens could indicate where they are

00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:53.402
and what their needs were,

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:56.699
and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.738
and the tsunami in Japan.

00:02:58.738 --> 00:03:02.132
Now, this year the Internet turns 20,

00:03:02.132 --> 00:03:04.414
and Ushahidi turned five.

00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:07.215
Ushahidi is not only the software that we made.

00:03:07.215 --> 00:03:10.272
It is the team, and it's also the community

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:14.557
that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee.

00:03:14.557 --> 00:03:17.877
We did not imagine that there would be this many maps

00:03:17.877 --> 00:03:19.388
around the world.

00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:22.910
There are crisis maps, election maps, corruption maps,

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.437
and even environmental monitoring crowd maps.

00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:29.893
We are humbled that this has roots in Kenya

00:03:29.893 --> 00:03:32.609
and that it has some use to people around the world

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.960
trying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.831
There is more that we're doing to explore this idea

00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:41.446
of collective intelligence, that I, as a citizen,

00:03:41.446 --> 00:03:44.382
if I share the information with whatever device that I have,

00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:46.925
could inform you about what is going on,

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:49.783
and that if you do the same, we can have a bigger picture

00:03:49.783 --> 00:03:51.627
of what's going on.

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:53.688
I moved back to Kenya in 2011.

00:03:53.688 --> 00:03:55.836
Erik moved in 2010.

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.983
Very different reality. I used to live in Chicago

00:03:57.983 --> 00:04:00.133
where there was abundant Internet access.

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.965
I had never had to deal with a blackout.

00:04:02.965 --> 00:04:05.849
And in Kenya, it's a very different reality,

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.946
and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress

00:04:08.946 --> 00:04:12.730
and the digital revolution is the electricity problem.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.501
The day-to-day frustrations of dealing with this

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:18.737
can be, let's just say very annoying.

00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:20.702
Blackouts are not fun.

00:04:20.702 --> 00:04:23.615
Imagine sitting down to start working, and all of a sudden

00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:25.295
the power goes out,

00:04:25.295 --> 00:04:27.970
your Internet connection goes down with it,

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.618
so you have to figure out, okay, now, where's the modem,

00:04:31.618 --> 00:04:33.607
how do I switch back?

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:36.325
And then, guess what? You have to deal with it again.

00:04:36.325 --> 00:04:39.517
Now, this is the reality of Kenya, where we live now,

00:04:39.517 --> 00:04:41.882
and other parts of Africa.

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:43.838
The other problem that we're facing

00:04:43.838 --> 00:04:48.125
is that communication costs are also still a challenge.

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:50.289
It costs me five Kenyan shillings,

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:56.342
or .06 USD to call the U.S., Canada or China.

00:04:56.342 --> 00:05:00.912
Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria?

00:05:00.912 --> 00:05:04.186
Thirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost

00:05:04.186 --> 00:05:06.296
to connect within Africa.

00:05:06.296 --> 00:05:08.430
And also, when traveling within Africa,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.696
you've got different settings for different mobile providers.

00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:14.405
This is the reality that we deal with.

00:05:14.405 --> 00:05:17.020
So we've got a joke in Ushahidi

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.818
where we say, "If it works in Africa, it'll work anywhere."

00:05:21.818 --> 00:05:23.970
[Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.]

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.216
What if we could overcome the problem

00:05:26.216 --> 00:05:30.081
of unreliable Internet and electricity

00:05:30.081 --> 00:05:32.106
and reduce the cost of connection?

00:05:32.106 --> 00:05:34.072
Could we leverage the cloud?

00:05:34.072 --> 00:05:35.903
We've built a crowd map, we've built Ushahidi.

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:38.328
Could we leverage these technologies

00:05:38.328 --> 00:05:43.393
to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country?

00:05:43.393 --> 00:05:44.691
So we looked at the modem,

00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:47.970
an important part of the infrastructure of the Internet,

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.481
and asked ourselves why

00:05:50.481 --> 00:05:52.436
the modems that we are using right now

00:05:52.436 --> 00:05:54.660
are built for a different context, where you've got

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.615
ubiquitous internet, you've got ubiquitous electricity,

00:05:58.615 --> 00:06:03.652
yet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury.

00:06:03.652 --> 00:06:06.149
We wanted to redesign the modem

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.196
for the developing world, for our context,

00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:11.107
and for our reality.

00:06:11.107 --> 00:06:14.784
What if we could have connectivity with less friction?

00:06:14.784 --> 00:06:18.313
This is the BRCK.

00:06:18.313 --> 00:06:21.217
It acts as a backup to the Internet

00:06:21.217 --> 00:06:24.994
so that, when the power goes out,

00:06:24.994 --> 00:06:31.142
it fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network.

00:06:31.142 --> 00:06:33.983
Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive.

00:06:33.983 --> 00:06:36.323
It's actually everywhere.

00:06:36.323 --> 00:06:39.251
Most towns at least have a 3G connection.

00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:42.160
So why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.358
The other reason that we built this

00:06:44.358 --> 00:06:46.944
is when electricity goes down, this has eight hours

00:06:46.944 --> 00:06:48.958
of battery left, so you can continue working,

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.046
you can continue being productive,

00:06:51.046 --> 00:06:55.268
and let's just say you are less stressed.

00:06:55.268 --> 00:06:57.598
And for rural areas, it can be

00:06:57.598 --> 00:06:59.701
the primary means of connection.

00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:02.437
The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play

00:07:02.437 --> 00:07:05.496
when we wondered how can we use the cloud

00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:07.438
to be more intelligent so that

00:07:07.438 --> 00:07:09.823
you can analyze the different networks,

00:07:09.823 --> 00:07:12.962
and whenever you switch on the backup,

00:07:12.962 --> 00:07:15.471
you pick on the fastest network,

00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:17.870
so we'll have multi-SIM capability

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.966
so that you can put multiple SIMs,

00:07:19.966 --> 00:07:23.380
and if one network is faster, that's the one you hop on,

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.729
and if the up time on that is not very good,

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.144
then you hop onto the next one.

00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:32.881
The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere.

00:07:32.881 --> 00:07:35.769
With load balancing, this can be possible.

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:39.622
The other interesting thing for us -- we like sensors --

00:07:39.622 --> 00:07:43.050
is this idea that you could have an on-ramp

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.977
for the Internet of things.

00:07:44.977 --> 00:07:48.597
Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this.

00:07:48.597 --> 00:07:51.336
It's built in a modular way so that you can also attach

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:53.106
a satellite module so that you could have

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:56.631
Internet connectivity even in very remote areas.

00:07:56.631 --> 00:07:59.376
Out of adversity can come innovation,

00:07:59.376 --> 00:08:03.415
and how can we help the ambitious coders and makers

00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:07.494
in Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure?

00:08:07.494 --> 00:08:09.750
And for us, we begin with solving the problem

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.694
in our own backyard in Kenya.

00:08:12.694 --> 00:08:15.094
It is not without challenge.

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:17.847
Our team has basically been mules carrying components

00:08:17.847 --> 00:08:21.041
from the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations

00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:22.969
with customs border agents.

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.767
"What are you carrying?"

00:08:24.767 --> 00:08:27.537
And the local financing is not

00:08:27.537 --> 00:08:32.888
part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects.

00:08:32.888 --> 00:08:35.607
So we put it on Kickstarter, and I'm happy to say that,

00:08:35.607 --> 00:08:37.848
through the support of many people,

00:08:37.848 --> 00:08:39.847
not only here but online,

00:08:39.847 --> 00:08:42.102
the BRCK has been Kickstarted,

00:08:42.102 --> 00:08:46.192
and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:49.086
I will close by saying that, if we solve this

00:08:49.086 --> 00:08:51.646
for the local market, it could be impactful

00:08:51.646 --> 00:08:54.096
not only for the coders in Nairobi

00:08:54.096 --> 00:08:56.448
but also for small business owners

00:08:56.448 --> 00:08:59.112
who need reliable connectivity,

00:08:59.112 --> 00:09:01.312
and it can reduce the cost of connecting,

00:09:01.312 --> 00:09:05.992
and hopefully collaboration within African countries.

00:09:05.992 --> 00:09:10.964
The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy

00:09:10.964 --> 00:09:14.483
are connectivity and entrepreneurship.

00:09:14.483 --> 00:09:16.923
The BRCK is our part

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:19.507
to keep Africans connected,

00:09:19.507 --> 00:09:23.291
and to help them drive the global digital revolution.

00:09:23.291 --> 00:09:24.505
Thank you.

00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:28.744
(Applause)
