00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
What we're really here to talk about is the "how."

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
Okay, so how exactly do we create this

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
world-shattering, if you will, innovation?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
Now, I want to tell you a quick story.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
We'll go back a little more than a year.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
In fact, the date -- I'm curious to know

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
if any of you know what happened on this momentous date?

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
It was February 3rd, 2008.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
Anyone remember what happened,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
February 3rd, 2008?

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
And the reason that this date was so momentous

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
is that what my colleagues, John King

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
is that it seemed to us

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
that across the United States,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
if you will, tribal councils had convened.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.160
And they had discussed things of great national importance.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
and, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?"

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
And if you go back in time to February 3rd,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.160
it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
But when we talked to people,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
it appeared that a funnel effect had happened

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
in these tribes all across the United States.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
Now what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
about 20 -- so kind of more than a team --

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
20 to about 150 people.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
But not just work. It's within these tribes

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
that societies get built,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
that important things happen.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
from various tribal councils that met,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
also known as Super Bowl parties,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
We said, "The tribes that we're in

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
are saying it's going to be Obama."

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
Now, the reason we knew that

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
was because we spent the previous 10 years

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.160
studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
All of you are members of tribes.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
In walking around at the break,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.160
And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
which is to find someone

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
who is a member of a tribe,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
and make introductions.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
So here is the bottom line.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
If you focus in on a group like this --

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
this happens to be a USC game --

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.160
and do magnification factors so you could see individual people,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
you would in fact see not a single crowd,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
just like there is not a single crowd here,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160
And from a distance it appears that it's a single group.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
And so people form tribes.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
They always have. They always will.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
Just as fish swim and birds fly,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
people form tribes. It's just what we do.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
But here's the rub.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
Not all tribes are the same,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
and what makes the difference is the culture.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
Now here is the net out of this.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
You're all a member of tribes.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
and nudge them forward,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
along these tribal stages

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
But we're going to start with what we call Stage One.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
Now, this is the lowest of the stages.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
You don't want this. Okay?

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
But it's one that I think we need to learn from.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
Stage One produces people

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
who do horrible things.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
Stage One is a group where people

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
systematically sever relationships from functional tribes,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
and then pool together

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
with people who think like they do.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
Stage One is literally the culture of gangs

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
and it is the culture of prisons.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
And I want to make the point

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
that as members of society, we need to.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
It's not enough to simply write people off.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
But let's move on to Stage Two.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160
Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks."

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
So, this other book that Steve mentioned,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
that just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance,"

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160
argue that as people see the world, so they behave.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
then their behavior will follow automatically from that.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
It will be despairing hostility.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
They'll do whatever it takes to survive,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
even if that means undermining other people.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
Now, my birthday is coming up shortly,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
and my driver's license expires.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
I will be walking into what we call

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
a Stage Two tribe,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
which looks like this.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.160
(Laughter)

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
across the land, you find a Stage Two culture?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
No. But in the one near me,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
where I have to go in just a few days,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
what I will say when I'm standing in line is,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
(Laughter)

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
Actually, no, I'm not.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.160
But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
So in a Stage Two culture --

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
and we find these in all sorts of different places --

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.160
you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
You find them in all places in society.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
I've come across them at the organizations

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
that everybody raves about as being best in class.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
But here is the point. If you believe and you say

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
to people in your tribe, in effect,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
"My life sucks.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does."

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.160
If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
What kind of innovation would get done?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
In fact it would be basically nil.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
that hits closest to home for many of us.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
And we park. And we stay.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.160
(Laughter)

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
I'm great and you're not.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
Now imagine having a whole room of people

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
saying, in effect, "I'm great and you're not."

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
Or, "I'm going to find some way to compete with you

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
and come out on top as a result of that."

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.160
A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160
I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
And one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
in the New England Journal of Medicine?"

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
And the other said, "No. That's great. Congratulations!"

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
"Well while you were, you know, doing your research," --

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
notice the condescending tone --

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
And the third one got the same wry smile and said,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
"Well, while you were off doing your research,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
that eventually we'll train monkeys to do,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
I was off running the future of the residency program,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
which is really the future of medicine."

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.160
Now, we find these in places

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
where really smart, successful people show up.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160
(Laughter)

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
It is moving from Stage Three

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
to Stage Four.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
Let's take a look at a quick video snippet.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
And my question on the other side is just going to be,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
"What do you think they value?"

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.160
It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
This is their lobby.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160
Notice people are applauding for us.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
they probably wouldn't applaud.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
But you'll notice the level of excitement.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
Notice, again, how they decorate their office.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
Now, what's important to people at Zappos,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
these may not be the things that are important to you.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
But they value things like fun. And they value creativity.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
One of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.160
And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
So when individuals come together

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
and find something that unites them

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
that's greater than their individual competence,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
then something very important happens.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
The group gels. And it changes

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
from a group of highly motivated

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
but fairly individually-centric people

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
into something larger,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.160
into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
There is, in fact, another stage.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160
Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.160
And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great,"

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.160
this may seem a little incongruous.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
This is a scene or snippet

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
Now think about that. South Africa,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
terrible atrocities had happened in the society.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
And people came together

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.160
focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
There was no road map. No one had ever done

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.160
anything like this before.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.160
And in this atmosphere, where the only guidance

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
was people's values and their noble cause,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
what this group accomplished was historic.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
And people, at the time, feared that South Africa

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160
descending into one skirmish after another

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
in a civil war that seems to have no end.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
Largely because people like Desmond Tutu

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
set up a Stage Five process

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
to involve the thousands and perhaps millions

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
So, people hear this and they conclude the following,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
as did we in doing the study.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
That's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way?

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
I don't want to talk like they do

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
I really don't want to just say "I'm great,"

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
Saying, "We're great" -- that sounds pretty good.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.160
But I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great."

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.160
Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
that come out of all this.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
and actually read it,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160
the phrase that sticks in many of our minds

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
is things about inalienable rights.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
oriented only by our values,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
no other guidance.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160
also known as King George.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
We're great! Who is not great? England!"

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.160
Sorry. (Laughter)

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160
Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi?

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
What about Martin Luther King?

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
I mean, surely these were just people who preached, "Life is great," right?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.160
Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.160
In fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160
He didn't say "We have a dream." He said, "I have a dream."

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
Why did he do that? Because most people

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
are not at Stage Five.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
Two percent are at Stage One.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.160
About 25 percent are at Stage Two,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
saying, in effect, "My life sucks."

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.160
48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
say, "I'm great and you're not."

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
Only about 22 percent of tribes

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
are at Stage Four,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
oriented by our values, saying "We're great.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
And our values are beginning to unite us."

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
Only two percent, only two percent of tribes

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
get to Stage Five.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160
And those are the ones that change the world.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
So the first little finding from this

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.160
so that you can touch every person in society.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.160
Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
So we have to have the ability to talk

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
all the levels, to go to where they are.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
And then leaders nudge people

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
within their tribes to the next level.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
I'd like to show you some examples of this.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160
former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
he was Chief of Police in San Francisco.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
And he grew up essentially in Stage One.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
And you know what changed his life? It was walking into

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
one of these, a Boys and Girls Club.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.160
Now here is what happened to this person

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
He went from being alive and passionate

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
at Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.160
despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" --

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
to walking into a Boys and Girls Club,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.160
folding his arms, sitting down in a chair,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160
I don't know anybody.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160
I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything."

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.160
In fact, that's progress.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.160
We move people from Stage One to Stage Two

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
by getting them in a new tribe

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
and then, over time, getting them connected.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
So, what about moving

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
from Stage Three to Stage Four?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160
I want to argue that we're doing that right here.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160
TED represents a set of values,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
and as we unite around these values,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
something really interesting begins to emerge.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
If you want this experience to live on

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
as something historic,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
beyond what people normally do

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
and call networking.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
Which is not just to meet new people

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
and extend your reach, extend your influence,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
but instead, find someone you don't know,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160
and find someone else you don't know,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
and introduce them.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
That's called a triadic relationship.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
See, people who build world-changing tribes do that.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.160
They extend the reach of their tribes

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
by connecting them, not just to myself,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.160
so that my following is greater,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160
but I connect people who don't know each other

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
to something greater than themselves.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.160
And ultimately that adds to their values.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.160
But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
which is great, to Stage Five?

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
a place called the Gallup Organization.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
You know they do polls, right?

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
Pretty much everybody else who does polls.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160
people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.160
So, they were bored.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
"How could we,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
instead of just polling what Asia thinks

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
or what the United States thinks,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
or who thinks what about Obama

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
versus McCain or something like that,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.160
what does the entire world think?"

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.160
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
They had people involved who were Nobel laureates

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.160
in economics, who reported being bored.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.160
And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
and were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the population

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
of Sub-Saharan Africa?

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.160
How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.160
and speak languages we don't speak,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
to achieve on this great mission,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
we have to be able to do it.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
Incidentally, they did pull it off.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.160
And they released the first-ever world poll.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.160
So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
First of all: we all form tribes, all of us.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160
You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.160
of the tribes that you have.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.160
But the question on the table is this:

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.160
What kind of an impact are the tribes

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
that you are in making?

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
You're hearing one presentation after another,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
often representing a group of people, a tribe,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
about how they have changed the world.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
If you do what we've talked about, you listen

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.160
for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
You remember to talk all five culture stages.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160
Because we've got people in all five, around us.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160
Will your tribes change the world?

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.160
Thank you very much.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.160
(Applause)
