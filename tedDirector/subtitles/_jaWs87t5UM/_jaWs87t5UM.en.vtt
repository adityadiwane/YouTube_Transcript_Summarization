00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.056
So when I was a kid ...

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.376
this was my team.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.576
(Laughter)

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.616
I stunk at sports.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.856
I didn't like to play them,
I didn't like to watch them.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.136
So this is what I did. I went fishing.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.656
And for all of my growing up
I fished on the shores of Connecticut,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.880
and these are the creatures
that I saw on a regular basis.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.216
But after I grew up and went to college,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.896
and I came home in the early 90's,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.616
this is what I found.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.256
My team had shrunk.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.375
It was like literally having
your roster devastated.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.416
And as I sort of looked into that,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.816
from a very personal
point of view as a fisherman,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.416
I started to kind of figure out,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.016
well, what was the rest of the world
thinking about it?

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.256
First place I started to look
was fish markets.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.056
And when I went to fish markets,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.336
in spite of where I was --

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.416
whether I was in North Carolina,
or Paris, or London, or wherever --

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.616
I kept seeing this weirdly
repeating trope of four creatures,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.856
again and again --

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.456
on the menus, on ice --

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.336
shrimp, tuna, salmon and cod.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.736
And I thought this was pretty strange,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.776
and as I looked at it, I was wondering,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.416
did anyone else notice
this sort of shrinking of the market?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.816
Well, when I looked into it,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.736
I realized that people
didn't look at it as their team.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.416
Ordinary people, the way they looked
at seafood was like this.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.896
It's not an unusual human characteristic

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.616
to reduce the natural world
down to very few elements.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.936
We did it before, 10,000 years ago,
when we came out of our caves.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.496
If you look at fire pits
from 10,000 years ago,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.096
you'll see raccoons,
you'll see, you know, wolves,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.176
you'll see all kinds
of different creatures.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.856
But if you telescope to the age of --
you know, 2,000 years ago,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.776
you'll see these four mammals:

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.216
pigs, cows, sheep and goats.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.456
It's true of birds, too.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.296
You look at the menus
in New York City restaurants

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.216
150 years ago, 200 years ago,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.976
you'll see snipe, woodcock, grouse,
dozens of ducks, dozens of geese.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.936
But telescope ahead to the age
of modern animal husbandry,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.336
and you'll see four:

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.400
turkeys, ducks, chicken and geese.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.056
So it makes sense
that we've headed in this direction.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.033
But how have we headed in this direction?

00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:18.256
Well ...

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.136
first it's a very, very new problem.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.896
This is the way we've been fishing
the oceans over the last 50 years.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.136
World War II was a tremendous incentive
to arm ourselves in a war against fish.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.416
All of the technology
that we perfected during World War II --

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.096
sonar, lightweight polymers --

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.416
all these things
were redirected towards fish.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.856
And so you see this tremendous buildup
in fishing capacity,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.536
quadrupling in the course of time,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.456
from the end of World War II
to the present time.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.856
And right now that means

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.536
we're taking between 80 and 90 million
metric tons out of the sea every year.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.776
That's the equivalent
of the human weight of China

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.336
taken out of the sea every year.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.976
And it's no coincidence
that I use China as the example

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.016
because China is now
the largest fishing nation in the world.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.656
Well, that's only half the story.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.056
The other half of the story

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.136
is this incredible boom
in fish farming and aquaculture,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.376
which is now, only
in the last year or two,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.776
starting to exceed the amount
of wild fish that we produce.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.816
So that if you add wild fish
and farmed fish together,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.296
you get the equivalent
of two Chinas created from the ocean

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.576
each and every year.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.736
And again, it's not a coincidence
that I use China as the example,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.816
because China, in addition
to being the biggest catcher of fish,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.920
is also the biggest farmer of fish.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.376
So let's look though at the four choices
we are making right now.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.616
The first one --

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.336
by far the most consumed seafood
in America and in much of the West,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.576
is shrimp.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.056
Shrimp in the wild --
as a wild product --

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.416
is a terrible product.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.896
5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fish
are regularly killed

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.336
to bring one pound of shrimp
to the market.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.456
They're also incredibly fuel inefficient
to bring to the market.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.576
In a recent study that was produced
out of Dalhousie University,

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.416
it was found that dragging for shrimp

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.280
is one of the most carbon-intensive
ways of fishing that you can find.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.296
So you can farm them,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.576
and people do farm them,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.616
and they farm them a lot
in this very area.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.856
Problem is ...

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.096
the place where you farm shrimp
is in these wild habitats --

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.336
in mangrove forests.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.416
Now look at those lovely
roots coming down.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.536
Those are the things
that hold soil together,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.336
protect coasts, create habitats
for all sorts of young fish, young shrimp,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.137
all sorts of things
that are important to this environment.

00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:29.161
Well, this is what happens
to a lot of coastal mangrove forests.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.495
We've lost millions of acres
of coastal mangroves

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:32.935
over the last 30 or 40 years.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:35.416
That rate of destruction has slowed,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.040
but we're still
in a major mangrove deficit.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.496
The other thing that's going on here

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.080
is a phenomenon that the filmmaker
Mark Benjamin called "Grinding Nemo."

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.176
This phenomenon is very, very relevant

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.696
to anything that you've ever seen
on a tropical reef.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.376
Because what's going on right now,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.576
we have shrimp draggers
dragging for shrimp,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.456
catching a huge amount of bycatch,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.576
that bycatch in turn gets ground up
and turned into shrimp food.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.736
And sometimes, many of these vessels --

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.136
manned by slaves --

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.856
are catching these so-called "trash fish,"

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.833
fish that we would love to see on a reef,

00:05:07.857 --> 00:05:09.056
grinding them up

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.830
and turning them into shrimp feed --

00:05:10.864 --> 00:05:14.334
an ecosystem literally eating itself
and spitting out shrimp.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.296
The next most consumed seafood in America,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.016
and also throughout the West,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.256
is tuna.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.336
So tuna is this ultimate global fish.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.376
These huge management areas
have to be observed

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.336
in order for tuna to be well managed.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.136
Our own management area,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.616
called a Regional Fisheries
Management Organization,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.856
is called ICCAT,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.096
the International Commission
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.816
The great naturalist
Carl Safina once called it,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.096
"The International Conspiracy
to Catch all the Tunas."

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.176
Of course we've seen
incredible improvement

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.696
in ICCAT in the last few years,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.456
there is total room for improvement,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.376
but it remains to be said
that tuna is a global fish,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.216
and to manage it,
we have to manage the globe.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.176
Well, we could also try to grow tuna

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.360
but tuna is a spectacularly bad
animal for aquaculture.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.936
Many people don't know this
but tuna are warm-blooded.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.376
They can heat their bodies 20 degrees
above ambient temperature,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.496
they can swim at over 40 miles an hour.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.256
So that pretty much eliminates

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.376
all the advantages
of farming a fish, right?

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.616
A farmed fish is --

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.069
or a fish is cold-blooded,
it doesn't move too much.

00:06:16.093 --> 00:06:18.096
That's a great thing for growing protein.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.456
But if you've got
this crazy, wild creature

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.976
that swims at 40 miles an hour
and heats its blood --

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.320
not a great candidate for aquaculture.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.976
The next creature --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.976
most consumed seafood in America
and throughout the West --

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.216
is salmon.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.416
Now salmon got its plundering, too,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.576
but it didn't really necessarily
happen through fishing.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.376
This is my home state of Connecticut.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.456
Connecticut used to be home
to a lot of wild salmon.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.536
But if you look
at this map of Connecticut,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.560
every dot on that map is a dam.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.256
There are over 3,000 dams
in the state of Connecticut.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.816
I often say this is why people
in Connecticut are so uptight --

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.416
(Laughter)

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.976
If somebody could just
unblock Connecticut's chi,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.496
I feel that we could have
an infinitely better world.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.256
But I made this particular comment

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.936
at a convention once
of national parks officers,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.696
and this guy from North Carolina
sidled up to me, he says,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.016
"You know, you oughtn't be so hard
on your Connecticut,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.856
cause we here in North Carolina,
we got 35,000 dams."

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.736
So it's a national epidemic,
it's an international epidemic.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.216
And there are dams everywhere,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.896
and these are precisely the things

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.696
that stop wild salmon
from reaching their spawning grounds.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.816
So as a result,
we've turned to aquaculture,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.496
and salmon is one the most successful,
at least from a numbers point of view.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.736
When they first started farming salmon,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.696
it could take as many
as six pounds of wild fish

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.896
to make a single pound of salmon.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.576
The industry has, to its credit,
greatly improved.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.267
They've gotten it below two to one,

00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:46.576
although it's a little bit of a cheat

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.416
because if you look at the way
aquaculture feed is produced,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.896
they're measuring pellets --

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.176
pounds of pellets per pound of salmon.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.856
Those pellets are in turn reduced fish.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.376
So the actual -- what's called the FIFO,
the fish in and the fish out --

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.736
kind of hard to say.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.976
But in any case,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.216
credit to the industry,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.816
it has lowered the amount of fish
per pound of salmon.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.016
Problem is we've also gone crazy

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.256
with the amount of salmon
that we're producing.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.896
Aquaculture is the fastest growing
food system on the planet.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.896
It's growing at something
like seven percent per year.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.936
And so even though
we're doing less per fish

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.256
to bring it to the market,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.016
we're still killing
a lot of these little fish.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.216
And it's not just fish
that we're feeding fish to,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.840
we're also feeding fish
to chickens and pigs.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.536
So we've got chickens
and they're eating fish,

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.816
but weirdly, we also have fish
that are eating chickens.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.936
Because the byproducts of chickens --
feathers, blood, bone --

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.256
get ground up and fed to fish.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.496
So I often wonder,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.760
is there a fish that ate
a chicken that ate a fish?

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.376
It's sort of a reworking
of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway --

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.496
(Laughter)

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.296
All together, though,
it results in a terrible mess.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.696
What you're talking about

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:03.376
is something between 20 and 30 million
metric tons of wild creatures

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.376
that are taken from the ocean
and used and ground up.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.456
That's the equivalent
of a third of a China,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.536
or of an entire United States of humans

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.960
that's taken out of the sea
each and every year.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.696
The last of the four
is a kind of amorphous thing.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.216
It's what the industry calls "whitefish."

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.216
There are many fish that get cycled
into this whitefish thing

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.456
but the way to kind of tell
the story, I think,

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.416
is through that classic piece
of American culinary innovation,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.816
the Filet-O-Fish sandwich.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.816
So the Filet-O-Fish sandwich
actually started as halibut.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.176
And it started because
a local franchise owner

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.736
found that when he served
his McDonald's on Friday, nobody came.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.296
Because it was a Catholic
community, they needed fish.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.176
So he went to Ray Kroc and he said,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.696
"I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich,
going to be made out of halibut."

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.016
Ray Kroc said, "I don't think
it's going to work.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.336
I want to do a Hula Burger,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.884
and there's going to be
a slice of pineapple on a bun.

00:09:54.908 --> 00:09:56.644
But let's do this, let's have a bet.

00:09:56.668 --> 00:10:00.176
Whosever sandwich sells more,
that will be the winning sandwich."

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.536
Well, it's kind of sad for the ocean
that the Hula Burger didn't win.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.696
So he made his halibut sandwich.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.056
Unfortunately though,
the sandwich came in at 30 cents.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.616
Ray wanted the sandwich
to come in at 25 cents,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.576
so he turned to Atlantic cod.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.376
We all know what happened to
Atlantic cod in New England.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.896
So now the Filet-O-Fish sandwich
is made out of Alaska pollock,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.656
it's the largest fin fish fishery
in the United States,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.056
2 to 3 billion pounds of fish
taken out of the sea every single year.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.616
If we go through the pollock,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.096
the next choice is probably
going to be tilapia.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.096
Tilapia is one of those fish
nobody ever heard of 20 years ago.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.376
It's actually a very efficient converter
of plant protein into animal protein,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.456
and it's been a godsend
to the third world.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.856
It's actually a tremendously
sustainable solution,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.096
it goes from an egg
to an adult in nine months.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.456
The problem is that when you
look about the West,

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.496
it doesn't do what the West
wants it to do.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.256
It really doesn't have what's called
an oily fish profile.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.656
It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.976
that we all think are going
to make us live forever.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.496
So what do we do?

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.696
I mean, first of all,
what about this poor fish, the clupeids?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.160
The fish that represent a huge part
of that 20 to 30 million metric tons.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.816
Well, one possibility
that a lot of conservationists have raised

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.456
is could we eat them?

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.376
Could we eat them directly
instead of feeding them to salmon?

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.736
There are arguments for it.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.380
They are tremendously fuel efficient
to bring to market,

00:11:20.404 --> 00:11:22.496
a fraction of the fuel cost
of say, shrimp,

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.856
and at the very top
of the carbon efficiency scale.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.016
They also are omega-3 rich,
a great source for EPA and DHA.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.496
So that is a potential.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.216
And if we were to go down that route
what I would say is,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.056
instead of paying a few bucks a pound --
or a few bucks a ton, really --

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.056
and making it into aquafeed,

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.376
could we halve the catch
and double the price for the fishermen

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.520
and make that our way
of treating these particular fish?

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.896
Other possibility though,
which is much more interesting,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.296
is looking at bivalves,
particularly mussels.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.256
Now, mussels are very high in EPA and DHA,
they're similar to canned tuna.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.216
They're also extremely fuel efficient.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.056
To bring a pound of mussels to market

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.696
is about a thirtieth of the carbon
as required to bring beef to market.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.296
They require no forage fish,

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.576
they actually get their omega-3s
by filtering the water of microalgae.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.816
In fact, that's where omega-3s come from,
they don't come from fish.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.896
Microalgae make the omega-3s,
they're only bioconcentrated in fish.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.176
Mussels and other bivalves

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.200
do tremendous amounts of water filtration.

00:12:23.224 --> 00:12:26.776
A single mussel can filter
dozens of gallons every single day.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.576
And this is incredibly important
when we look at the world.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.176
Right now, nitrification,
overuse of phosphates in our waterways

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.536
are causing tremendous algal blooms.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.816
Over 400 new dead zones
have been created in the last 20 years,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.440
tremendous sources of marine life death.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.496
We also could look at not a fish at all.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.936
We could look at a vegetable.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.696
We could look at seaweed, the kelps,

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.056
all these different varieties of things
that can be high in omega-3s,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.376
can be high in proteins,

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.016
tremendously good things.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.696
They filter the water
just like mussels do.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.976
And weirdly enough,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.616
it turns out that you
can actually feed this to cows.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.856
Now, I'm not a big fan of cattle.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.816
But if you wanted to keep growing cattle

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.656
in a time and place
where water resources are limited,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.776
you're growing seaweed in the water,
you don't have to water it --

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.456
major consideration.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.216
And the last fish is a question mark.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:21.096
We have the ability
to create aquacultured fish

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.536
that creates a net gain
of marine protein for us.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.696
This creature would have to be vegetarian,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.496
it would have to be fast growing,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.176
it would have to be adaptable
to a changing climate

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.536
and it would have to have
that oily fish profile,

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.456
that EPA, DHA, omega-3
fatty acid profile that we're looking for.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.416
This exists kind of on paper.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.056
I have been reporting
on these subjects for 15 years.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.976
Every time I do a new story,
somebody tells me,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.856
"We can do all that. We can do it.
We've figured it all out.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.096
We can produce a fish

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.696
that's a net gain of marine protein
and has omega-3s."

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.936
Great.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.096
It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.856
It is time to scale this up.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.096
If we do,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.616
30 million metric tons of seafood,
a third of the world catch,

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.840
stays in the water.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.176
So I guess what I'm saying is
this is what we've been going with.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.376
We tend to go with our appetites
rather than our minds.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.896
But if we went with this,
or some configuration of it,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.635
we might have a little more of this.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.336
Thank you.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.840
(Applause)
