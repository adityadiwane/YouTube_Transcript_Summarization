Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:19.754
In my previous life, I was an artist.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:22.227
I still paint. I love art.

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:27.826
I love the joy that color can give to our lives

00:00:27.826 --> 00:00:30.474
and to our communities,

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:35.753
and I try to bring something of the artist in me

00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:37.874
in my politics,

00:00:37.874 --> 00:00:41.802
and I see

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:46.986
part of my job today, the reason for being here,

00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:51.913
not just to campaign for my party,

00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:56.618
but for politics, and the role it can play

00:00:56.618 --> 00:01:00.434
for the better in our lives.

00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:06.306
For 11 years, I was mayor of Tirana, our capital.

00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:08.998
We faced many challenges.

00:01:08.998 --> 00:01:11.482
Art was part of the answer,

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:14.100
and my name, in the very beginning,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.515
was linked with two things:

00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:20.608
demolition of illegal constructions

00:01:20.608 --> 00:01:24.688
in order to get public space back,

00:01:24.688 --> 00:01:28.366
and use of colors in order to revive the hope

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:31.685
that had been lost in my city.

00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:37.546
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act.

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:41.662
Rather, it was a form of political action

00:01:41.662 --> 00:01:46.764
in a context when the city budget I had available

00:01:46.764 --> 00:01:53.471
after being elected amounted to zero comma something.

00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:56.462
When we painted the first building,

00:01:56.462 --> 00:02:01.014
by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray

00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:03.278
of a facade,

00:02:03.278 --> 00:02:07.502
something unimaginable happened.

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.572
There was a traffic jam

00:02:09.572 --> 00:02:12.577
and a crowd of people gathered

00:02:12.577 --> 00:02:17.495
as if it were the location of some spectacular accident,

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:22.214
or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star.

00:02:22.214 --> 00:02:27.016
The French E.U. official in charge of the funding

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:30.110
rushed to block the painting.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.856
He screeched that he would block the financing.

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:38.486
"But why?" I asked him.

00:02:38.486 --> 00:02:41.278
"Because the colors you have ordered

00:02:41.278 --> 00:02:45.990
do not meet European standards," he replied.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.919
"Well," I told him,

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.107
"the surroundings do not meet European standards,

00:02:52.107 --> 00:02:57.402
even though this is not what we want,

00:02:57.402 --> 00:03:00.573
but we will choose the colors ourselves,

00:03:00.573 --> 00:03:04.243
because this is exactly what we want.

00:03:04.243 --> 00:03:08.126
And if you do not let us continue with our work,

00:03:08.126 --> 00:03:10.800
I will hold a press conference here,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.076
right now, right in this road,

00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:17.326
and we will tell people that you look to me

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:23.200
just like the censors of the socialist realism era."

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.855
Then he was kind of troubled,

00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:28.447
and asked me for a compromise.

00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:30.767
But I told him no, I'm sorry,

00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:35.269
compromise in colors is gray,

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.357
and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime.

00:03:40.357 --> 00:03:41.574
(Applause)

00:03:41.574 --> 00:03:46.693
So it's time for change.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:48.863
The rehabilitation of public spaces

00:03:48.863 --> 00:03:51.597
revived the feeling of belonging

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:56.466
to a city that people lost.

00:03:56.466 --> 00:04:02.906
The pride of people about their own place of living,

00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:06.325
and there were feelings that had been buried

00:04:06.325 --> 00:04:10.980
deep for years under the fury of the illegal,

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.454
barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space.

00:04:16.454 --> 00:04:19.498
And when colors came out everywhere,

00:04:19.498 --> 00:04:23.986
a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people.

00:04:23.986 --> 00:04:26.933
Big noise raised up: "What is this? What is happening?

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.894
What are colors doing to us?"

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:29.949
And we made a poll,

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.351
the most fascinating poll I've seen in my life.

00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:39.608
We asked people, "Do you want this action,

00:04:39.608 --> 00:04:44.098
and to have buildings painted like that?"

00:04:44.098 --> 00:04:46.469
And then the second question was,

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:49.473
"Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"

00:04:49.473 --> 00:04:51.157
To the first question,

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:55.063
63 percent of people said yes, we like it.

00:04:55.063 --> 00:04:57.423
Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it.

00:04:57.423 --> 00:05:01.095
But to the second question, half of them that didn't like it,

00:05:01.095 --> 00:05:04.174
they wanted it to continue. (Laughter)

00:05:04.174 --> 00:05:07.301
So we noticed change.

00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:11.696
People started to drop less litter in the streets, for example,

00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:14.326
started to pay taxes,

00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:18.775
started to feel something they had forgotten,

00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:23.839
and beauty was acting as a guardsman

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:30.381
where municipal police, or the state itself, were missing.

00:05:30.381 --> 00:05:34.082
One day I remember walking along a street

00:05:34.082 --> 00:05:36.678
that had just been colored,

00:05:36.678 --> 00:05:40.457
and where we were in the process of planting trees,

00:05:40.457 --> 00:05:43.702
when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife

00:05:43.702 --> 00:05:47.669
putting a glass facade to their shop.

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.966
They had thrown the old shutter

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:52.958
in the garbage collection place.

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.518
"Why did you throw away the shutters?" I asked him.

00:05:56.518 --> 00:06:01.750
"Well, because the street is safer now," they answered.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.318
"Safer? Why? They have posted more policemen here?"

00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:10.142
"Come on, man! What policemen?

00:06:10.142 --> 00:06:13.234
You can see it for yourself. There are colors,

00:06:13.234 --> 00:06:19.054
streetlights, new pavement with no potholes,

00:06:19.054 --> 00:06:23.846
trees. So it's beautiful; it's safe."

00:06:23.846 --> 00:06:27.790
And indeed, it was beauty that was giving people

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.217
this feeling of being protected.

00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:35.719
And this was not a misplaced feeling.

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:40.476
Crime did fall.

00:06:40.476 --> 00:06:43.822
The freedom that was won in 1990

00:06:43.822 --> 00:06:47.959
brought about a state of anarchy in the city,

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:50.870
while the barbarism of the '90s

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.352
brought about a loss of hope for the city.

00:06:54.352 --> 00:06:58.622
The paint on the walls did not feed children,

00:06:58.622 --> 00:07:02.686
nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant,

00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:06.127
but it gave hope and light,

00:07:06.127 --> 00:07:08.567
and helped to make people see

00:07:08.567 --> 00:07:11.670
there could be a different way of doing things,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.581
a different spirit, a different feel to our lives,

00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:21.800
and that if we brought the same energy and hope

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.088
to our politics, we could build a better life

00:07:26.088 --> 00:07:31.283
for each other and for our country.

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:38.133
We removed 123,000 tons of concrete

00:07:38.133 --> 00:07:40.740
only from the riverbanks.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.890
We demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.872
all over the city,

00:07:48.872 --> 00:07:53.341
up to eight stories high, the tallest of them.

00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:59.870
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.953
We established a green tax,

00:08:02.953 --> 00:08:06.983
and then everybody accepted it

00:08:06.983 --> 00:08:11.977
and all businessmen paid it regularly.

00:08:11.977 --> 00:08:14.364
By means of open competitions,

00:08:14.364 --> 00:08:17.357
we managed to recruit in our administration

00:08:17.357 --> 00:08:19.352
many young people,

00:08:19.352 --> 00:08:21.214
and we thus managed to build

00:08:21.214 --> 00:08:24.485
a de-politicized public institution

00:08:24.485 --> 00:08:29.005
where men and women were equally represented.

00:08:29.005 --> 00:08:31.547
International organizations

00:08:31.547 --> 00:08:34.925
have invested a lot in Albania during these 20 years,

00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:38.157
not all of it well spent.

00:08:38.157 --> 00:08:41.285
When I told the World Bank directors

00:08:41.285 --> 00:08:46.198
that I wanted them to finance a project to build

00:08:46.198 --> 00:08:49.093
a model reception hall for citizens

00:08:49.093 --> 00:08:53.253
precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption,

00:08:53.253 --> 00:08:55.503
they did not understand me.

00:08:55.503 --> 00:08:58.781
But people were waiting in long queues

00:08:58.781 --> 00:09:01.704
under sun and under rain

00:09:01.704 --> 00:09:05.929
in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer

00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:13.367
from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks.

00:09:13.367 --> 00:09:17.551
They were paying in order to skip the queue,

00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:19.907
the long queue.

00:09:19.907 --> 00:09:23.870
The reply to their requests was met

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.571
by a voice coming from this dark hole,

00:09:28.571 --> 00:09:32.813
and, on the other hand,

00:09:32.813 --> 00:09:38.255
a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents

00:09:38.255 --> 00:09:44.063
while searching through old documents for the bribe.

00:09:44.063 --> 00:09:48.370
We could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks,

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:54.009
every week, but we could not change this corrupt practice.

00:09:54.009 --> 00:09:57.783
"I'm convinced," I told a German official

00:09:57.783 --> 00:10:00.559
with the World Bank,

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:04.401
"that it would be impossible for them to be bribed

00:10:04.401 --> 00:10:06.855
if they worked in Germany,

00:10:06.855 --> 00:10:08.806
in a German administration,

00:10:08.806 --> 00:10:13.212
just as I am convinced that if you put German officials

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:16.435
from the German administration in those holes,

00:10:16.435 --> 00:10:20.583
they would be bribed just the same."

00:10:20.583 --> 00:10:27.287
(Applause)

00:10:27.287 --> 00:10:29.119
It's not about genes.

00:10:29.119 --> 00:10:34.853
It's not about some being with a high conscience

00:10:34.853 --> 00:10:37.295
and some others having not a conscience.

00:10:37.295 --> 00:10:40.067
It's about system, it's about organization.

00:10:40.067 --> 00:10:43.327
It's also about environment and respect.

00:10:43.327 --> 00:10:46.210
We removed the kiosks.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.906
We built the bright new reception hall

00:10:49.906 --> 00:10:53.477
that made people, Tirana citizens,

00:10:53.477 --> 00:10:57.163
think they had traveled abroad when they entered

00:10:57.163 --> 00:10:59.587
to make their requests.

00:10:59.587 --> 00:11:03.031
We created an online system of control

00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:06.947
and so speeded up all the processes.

00:11:06.947 --> 00:11:11.603
We put the citizen first, and not the clerks.

00:11:11.603 --> 00:11:15.807
The corruption in the state administration

00:11:15.807 --> 00:11:18.507
of countries like Albania --

00:11:18.507 --> 00:11:22.683
it's not up to me to say also like Greece --

00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:28.063
can be fought only by modernization.

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:32.815
Reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself

00:11:32.815 --> 00:11:36.334
is the answer, and not reinventing people

00:11:36.334 --> 00:11:38.982
based on a ready-made formula

00:11:38.982 --> 00:11:43.238
that the developed world often tries in vain to impose

00:11:43.238 --> 00:11:45.344
to people like us.

00:11:45.344 --> 00:11:48.051
(Applause)

00:11:48.051 --> 00:11:50.035
Things have come to this point

00:11:50.035 --> 00:11:52.527
because politicians in general,

00:11:52.527 --> 00:11:55.423
but especially in our countries, let's face it,

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.886
think people are stupid.

00:11:57.886 --> 00:12:01.430
They take it for granted that, come what may,

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.642
people have to follow them,

00:12:03.642 --> 00:12:07.736
while politics, more and more, fails to offer answers

00:12:07.736 --> 00:12:11.759
for their public concerns

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:16.430
or the exigencies of the common people.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.232
Politics has come to resemble

00:12:19.232 --> 00:12:22.718
a cynical team game played by politicians,

00:12:22.718 --> 00:12:26.647
while the public has been pushed aside

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:30.534
as if sitting on the seats of a stadium

00:12:30.534 --> 00:12:32.384
in which passion for politics

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:37.993
is gradually making room for blindness and desperation.

00:12:37.993 --> 00:12:42.887
Seen from those stairs, all politicians today

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.850
seem the same,

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:49.487
and politics has come to resemble

00:12:49.487 --> 00:12:54.088
a sport that inspires more aggressiveness

00:12:54.088 --> 00:12:57.400
and pessimism than social cohesion

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.673
and the desire for civic protaganism.

00:13:01.673 --> 00:13:03.699
Barack Obama won

00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:09.976
— (Applause) —

00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:13.539
because he mobilized people as never before

00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:16.072
through the use of social networks.

00:13:16.072 --> 00:13:19.185
He did not know each and every one of them,

00:13:19.185 --> 00:13:23.055
but with an admirable ingenuity,

00:13:23.055 --> 00:13:26.435
he managed to transform them into activists

00:13:26.435 --> 00:13:30.564
by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands

00:13:30.564 --> 00:13:34.158
the arguments and the instruments that each would need

00:13:34.158 --> 00:13:38.951
to campaign in his name by making his own campaign.

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:41.006
I tweet. I love it.

00:13:41.006 --> 00:13:46.375
I love it because it lets me get the message out,

00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:50.642
but it also lets people get their messages to me.

00:13:50.642 --> 00:13:53.634
This is politics, not from top down,

00:13:53.634 --> 00:13:56.858
but from the bottom up, and sideways,

00:13:56.858 --> 00:13:59.850
and allowing everybody's voice to be heard

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.810
is exactly what we need.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.864
Politics is not just about leaders.

00:14:03.864 --> 00:14:06.625
It's not just about politicians and laws.

00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:08.593
It is about how people think,

00:14:08.593 --> 00:14:10.928
how they view the world around them,

00:14:10.928 --> 00:14:13.454
how they use their time and their energy.

00:14:13.454 --> 00:14:15.970
When people say all politicians are the same,

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.250
ask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush,

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.825
if François Hollande is the same as Sarkozy.

00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:27.529
They are not. They are human beings with different views

00:14:27.529 --> 00:14:30.111
and different visions for the world.

00:14:30.111 --> 00:14:33.009
When people say nothing can change,

00:14:33.009 --> 00:14:37.073
just stop and think what the world was like

00:14:37.073 --> 00:14:41.705
10, 20, 50, 100 years ago.

00:14:41.705 --> 00:14:44.821
Our world is defined by the pace of change.

00:14:44.821 --> 00:14:47.625
We can all change the world.

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:50.501
I gave you a very small example

00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:54.002
of how one thing, the use of color,

00:14:54.002 --> 00:14:56.513
can make change happen.

00:14:56.513 --> 00:14:57.876
I want to make more change

00:14:57.876 --> 00:15:00.664
as Prime Minister of my country,

00:15:00.664 --> 00:15:04.986
but every single one of you can make change happen

00:15:04.986 --> 00:15:06.579
if you want to.

00:15:06.579 --> 00:15:09.704
President Roosevelt, he said,

00:15:09.704 --> 00:15:13.377
"Believe you can, and you are halfway there."

00:15:13.377 --> 00:15:16.444
Efharisto and kalinihta.

00:15:16.444 --> 00:15:36.147
(Applause)
