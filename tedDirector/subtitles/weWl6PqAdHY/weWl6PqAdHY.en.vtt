00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:15.436
I am from the South Side of Chicago,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.556
and in seventh grade,
I had a best friend named Jenny

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.380
who lived on the Southwest
Side of Chicago.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.156
Jenny was white,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.156
and if you know anything about
the segregated demographics of Chicago,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.316
you know that there are
not too many black people

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.396
who live on the Southwest Side of Chicago.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.676
But Jenny was my girl

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.596
and so we would hang out every so often
after school and on the weekends.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.915
And so one day we were
hanging out in her living room,

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:47.196
talking about 13-year-old things,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.436
and Jenny's little sister Rosie
was in the room with us,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.516
and she was sitting behind me
just kind of playing in my hair,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.620
and I wasn't thinking too much
about what she was doing.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.436
But at a pause in the conversation,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.956
Rosie tapped me on the shoulder.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.340
She said, "Can I ask you a question?"

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.700
I said, "Yeah, Rosie. Sure."

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.036
"Are you black?"

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.276
(Laughter)

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.196
The room froze.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.420
Silence.

00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:18.956
Jenny and Rosie's mom
was not too far away.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.876
She was in the kitchen
and she overheard the conversation,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.420
and she was mortified.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.700
She said, "Rosie! You can't
ask people questions like that."

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.036
And Jenny was my friend,
and I know she was really embarrassed.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.396
I felt kind of bad for her,
but actually I was not offended.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.476
I figured it wasn't Rosie's fault
that in her 10 short years on this earth,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.956
living on the Southwest Side of Chicago,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.860
she wasn't 100 percent sure
what a black person looked like.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.676
That's fair.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.076
But what was more surprising to me was,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.596
in all of this time I had spent
with Jenny and Rosie's family --

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.956
hanging out with them,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.236
playing with them,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.036
even physically interacting with them --

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.556
it was not until Rosie
put her hands in my hair

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.100
that she thought to ask me if I was black.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.076
That was the first time I would realize

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.036
how big of a role the texture of my hair
played in confirming my ethnicity,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.660
but also that it would play a key role
in how I'm viewed by others in society.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.436
Garrett A. Morgan
and Madame CJ Walker were pioneers

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.980
of the black hair-care and beauty
industry in the early 1900s.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.276
They're best known as the inventors
of chemically-based hair creams

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.836
and heat straightening tools

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.436
designed to permanently,
or semipermanently,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.100
alter the texture of black hair.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.956
Oftentimes when we think
about the history of blacks in America,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.876
we think about the heinous acts

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.396
and numerous injustices
that we experienced as people of color

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.156
because of the color of our skin,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.836
when in fact, in post-Civil War America,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.036
it was the hair of an
African-American male or female

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.916
that was known as the most
"telling feature" of Negro status,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.860
more so than the color of the skin.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.276
And so before they were staples

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.236
of the multibillion-dollar
hair-care industry,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.036
our dependency on tools and products,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.356
like the hair relaxer
and the pressing comb,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.796
were more about our survival
and advancement as a race

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.020
in postslavery America.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.076
Over the years,
we grew accustomed to this idea

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.220
that straighter and longer
hair meant better and more beautiful.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.756
We became culturally obsessed

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.980
with this idea of having
what we like to call ...

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.860
"good hair."

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.076
This essentially means:

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.660
the looser the curl pattern,
the better the hair.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.996
And we let these institutionalized ideas
form a false sense of hierarchy

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.596
that would determine
what was considered a good grade of hair

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.980
and what was not.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.436
What's worse is that
we let these false ideologies

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.196
invade our perception of ourselves,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.556
and they still continue
to infect our cultural identity

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.020
as African-American women today.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.036
So what did we do?

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.076
We went to the hair salon
every six to eight weeks,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.476
without fail,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.836
to subject our scalps
to harsh straightening chemicals

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.796
beginning at a very young age --

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.876
sometimes eight, 10 --

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.116
that would result in hair loss,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.356
bald spots,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.580
sometimes even burns on the scalp.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.036
We fry our hair at temperatures
of 450 degrees Fahrenheit or higher

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.316
almost daily,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.340
to maintain the straight look.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.156
Or we simply cover our hair up
with wigs and weaves,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.836
only to let our roots breathe in private

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.980
where no one knows
what's really going on under there.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.636
We adopted these practices
in our own communities,

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.996
and so it's no wonder
why today the typical ideal vision

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.756
of a professional black woman,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.676
especially in corporate America,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.020
tends to look like this,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.700
rather than like this.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.980
And she certainly doesn't look like this.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.116
In September of this year,

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.636
a federal court ruled it lawful

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.996
for a company to discriminate
against hiring an employee

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.100
based on if she or he wears dreadlocks.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.596
In the case,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.876
the hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.620
is on record as saying,

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.620
"I'm not saying yours are messy,

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.796
but ...

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.392
you know what I'm talking about."

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.500
Well, what was she talking about?

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.300
Did she think that they were ugly?

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.196
Or maybe they were
just a little too Afrocentric

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.500
and pro-black-looking for her taste.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.236
Or maybe it's not about Afrocentricity,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.796
and it's more just about
it being a little too "urban"

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.220
for the professional setting.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.356
Perhaps she had a genuine concern
in that they looked "scary"

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.900
and that they would intimidate
the clients and their customer base.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.596
All of these words are ones
that are too often associated

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.060
with the stigma
attached to natural hairstyles.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.020
And this ...

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.500
this has got to change.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.356
In 2013,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.876
a white paper published by the Deloitte
Leadership Center for Inclusion,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.316
studied 3,000 individuals
in executive leadership roles

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.956
on the concept
of covering in the workplace

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.060
based on appearance,
advocacy, affiliation and association.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.196
When thinking about
appearance-based covering,

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.476
the study showed

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.556
that 67 percent of women
of color cover in the workplace

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.860
based on their appearance.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.636
Of the total respondents who
admitted to appearance-based covering,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.916
82 percent said that it was
somewhat to extremely important

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.940
for them to do so
for their professional advancement.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.860
Now, this is Ursula Burns.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.476
She is the first African-American
female CEO of a Fortune 500 company --

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.700
of Xerox.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.236
She's known by her signature look,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.956
the one that you see here.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.260
A short, nicely trimmed,
well-manicured Afro.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.260
Ms. Burns is what
we like to call a "natural girl."

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.436
And she is paving the way
and showing what's possible

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.196
for African-American women
seeking to climb the corporate ladder,

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.060
but still wishing
to wear natural hairstyles.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.796
But today the majority
of African-American women

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.516
who we still look to as leaders,
icons and role models,

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.836
still opt for a straight-hair look.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.076
Now,

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.796
maybe it's because they want to --

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.116
this is authentically
how they feel best --

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.636
but maybe --

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.276
and I bet --

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.556
a part of them felt like they had to

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.060
in order to reach the level of success
that they have attained today.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.356
There is a natural hair movement
that is sweeping the country

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.660
and also in some places in Europe.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.676
Millions of women are exploring what
it means to transition to natural hair,

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.715
and they're cutting off
years and years of dry, damaged ends

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:53.931
in order to restore
their natural curl pattern.

00:08:54.739 --> 00:08:59.076
I know because I have been an advocate
and an ambassador for this movement

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.900
for roughly the last three years.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:07.196
After 27 years of excessive heat
and harsh chemicals,

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.700
my hair was beginning to show
extreme signs of wear and tear.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.836
It was breaking off,

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.236
it was thinning,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.316
looking just extremely dry and brittle.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.716
All those years of chasing
that conventional image of beauty

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.956
that we saw earlier

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.940
was finally beginning to take its toll.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.836
I wanted to do something about it,

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.356
and so I started what I called
the "No Heat Challenge,"

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.236
where I would refrain
from using heat styling tools on my hair

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.540
for six months.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.596
And like a good millennial,

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.836
I documented it on social media.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.116
(Laughter)

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.196
I documented as I reluctantly cut off

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.980
three to four inches of my beloved hair.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:01.396
I documented as I struggled
to master these natural hairstyles,

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.436
and also as I struggled to embrace them

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.700
and think that they actually looked good.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:15.060
And I documented as my hair texture
slowly began to change.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.716
By sharing this journey openly,

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.516
I learned that I was not
the only woman going through this

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.316
and that in fact there were thousands
and thousands of other women

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.060
who were longing to do the same.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.116
So they would reach out to me
and they would say,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.396
"Cheyenne, how did you do
that natural hairstyle

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.356
that I saw you with the other day?

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.396
What new products have you started using

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.756
that might be a little better
for my hair texture

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.220
as it begins to change?"

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.596
Or, "What are some
of the natural hair routines

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.740
that I should begin to adopt
to slowly restore the health of my hair?"

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.676
But I also found that there were
a large number of women

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.500
who were extremely hesitant
to take that first step

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.060
because they were paralyzed by fear.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.956
Fear of the unknown --

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.580
what would they now look like?

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.596
How would they feel about themselves
with these natural hairstyles?

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.036
And most importantly to them,

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.060
how would others view them?

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.036
Over the last three years

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.956
of having numerous conversations
with friends of mine

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.916
and also complete strangers
from around the world,

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.636
I learned some really important things

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.380
about how African-American women
identify with their hair.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.596
And so when I think back

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.156
to that hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama,

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.916
I'd say, "Actually, no.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.396
We don't know what you're talking about."

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.380
But here are some things that we do know.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.516
We know that when black women
embrace their love for their natural hair,

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.996
it helps to undo generations of teaching

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.316
that black in its natural state
is not beautiful,

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.260
or something to be hidden or covered up.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.556
We know that black women
express their individuality

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.676
and experience feelings of empowerment

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.740
by experimenting with different
hairstyles regularly.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.316
And we also know

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.236
that when we're invited
to wear our natural hair in the workplace,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.636
it reinforces that we are uniquely valued

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.420
and thus helps us to flourish
and advance professionally.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.540
I leave you with this.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.340
In a time of racial and social tension,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.196
embracing this movement

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.996
and others like this

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.540
help us to rise above
the confines of the status quo.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:52.596
So when you see a woman with braids
or locks draping down her back,

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.156
or you notice your colleague

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.260
who has stopped
straightening her hair to work,

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.756
do not simply approach her and admire

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.596
and ask her if you can touch it --

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.876
(Laughter)

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.740
Really appreciate her.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.956
Applaud her.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.700
Heck, even high-five her
if that's what you feel so inclined to do.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.916
Because this --

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.700
this is more than about a hairstyle.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.620
It's about self-love and self-worth.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.636
It's about being brave enough

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.700
not to fold under the pressure
of others' expectations.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.196
And about knowing that making
the decision to stray from the norm

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.676
does not define who we are,

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.020
but it simply reveals who we are.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.596
And finally,

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.476
being brave is easier

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.940
when we can count
on the compassion of others.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.356
So after today,

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.700
I certainly hope that we can count on you.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.396
Thank you.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.472
(Applause)
