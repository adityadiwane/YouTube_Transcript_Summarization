00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.376
When I was six years old,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.640
I received my gifts.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.776
My first grade teacher
had this brilliant idea.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.136
She wanted us to experience
receiving gifts

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.160
but also learning the virtue
of complimenting each other.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.536
So she had all of us
come to the front of the classroom,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.536
and she bought all of us gifts
and stacked them in the corner.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.776
And she said,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.456
"Why don't we just stand here
and compliment each other?

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.056
If you hear your name called,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.280
go and pick up your gift and sit down."

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.000
What a wonderful idea, right?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.096
What could go wrong?

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.640
(Laughter)

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.456
Well, there were 40 of us to start with,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.936
and every time I heard
someone's name called,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.760
I would give out the heartiest cheer.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.776
And then there were 20 people left,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.576
and 10 people left,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.960
and five left ...

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.936
and three left.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.160
And I was one of them.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.320
And the compliments stopped.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.600
Well, at that moment, I was crying.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.616
And the teacher was freaking out.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.296
She was like, "Hey, would anyone
say anything nice about these people?"

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:17.536
(Laughter)

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.536
"No one? OK, why don't you
go get your gift and sit down.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.816
So behave next year --

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.936
someone might say
something nice about you."

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.720
(Laughter)

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.136
Well, as I'm describing this you,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.536
you probably know
I remember this really well.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.160
(Laughter)

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.896
But I don't know who felt worse that day.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.096
Was it me or the teacher?

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.256
She must have realized
that she turned a team-building event

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.080
into a public roast
for three six-year-olds.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.056
And without the humor.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.416
You know, when you see
people get roasted on TV,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.656
it was funny.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.538
There was nothing funny about that day.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.336
So that was one version of me,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.856
and I would die to avoid
being in that situation again --

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.760
to get rejected in public again.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.896
That's one version.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.376
Then fast-forward eight years.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.376
Bill Gates came to my hometown --

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.616
Beijing, China --

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.856
to speak,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.616
and I saw his message.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.936
I fell in love with that guy.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.856
I thought, wow,
I know what I want to do now.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.016
That night I wrote a letter to my family

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.336
telling them: "By age 25,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.976
I will build the biggest
company in the world,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.936
and that company will buy Microsoft."

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.856
(Laughter)

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.496
I totally embraced this idea
of conquering the world --

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.720
domination, right?

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.976
And I didn't make this up,
I did write that letter.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.336
And here it is --

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.336
(Laughter)

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.176
You don't have to read this through --

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.976
(Laughter)

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.240
This is also bad handwriting,
but I did highlight some key words.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.816
You get the idea.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.616
(Laughter)

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.840
So ...

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.296
that was another version of me:

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.000
one who will conquer the world.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.336
Well, then two years later,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.296
I was presented with the opportunity
to come to the United States.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.896
I jumped on it,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.136
because that was
where Bill Gates lived, right?

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.376
(Laughter)

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.040
I thought that was the start
of my entrepreneur journey.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.856
Then, fast-forward another 14 years.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.296
I was 30.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.696
Nope, I didn't build that company.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.256
I didn't even start.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.256
I was actually a marketing manager
for a Fortune 500 company.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.896
And I felt I was stuck;

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.120
I was stagnant.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.296
Why is that?

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.560
Where is that 14-year-old
who wrote that letter?

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.957
It's not because he didn't try.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.536
It's because every time I had a new idea,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.536
every time I wanted to try something new,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.776
even at work --

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.536
I wanted to make a proposal,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.096
I wanted to speak up
in front of people in a group --

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.936
I felt there was this constant battle

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.736
between the 14-year-old
and the six-year-old.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.896
One wanted to conquer the world --

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.136
make a difference --

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.280
another was afraid of rejection.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.480
And every time that six-year-old won.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.736
And this fear even persisted
after I started my own company.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.896
I mean, I started
my own company when I was 30 --

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.336
if you want to be Bill Gates,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.400
you've got to start
sooner or later, right?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.616
When I was an entrepreneur,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.536
I was presented
with an investment opportunity,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.360
and then I was turned down.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.776
And that rejection hurt me.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.400
It hurt me so bad
that I wanted to quit right there.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.496
But then I thought,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.360
hey, would Bill Gates quit
after a simple investment rejection?

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.776
Would any successful
entrepreneur quit like that?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.176
No way.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.176
And this is where it clicked for me.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.016
OK, I can build a better company.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.256
I can build a better
team or better product,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.816
but one thing for sure:

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.696
I've got to be a better leader.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.240
I've got to be a better person.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.096
I cannot let that six-year-old
keep dictating my life anymore.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.200
I have to put him back in his place.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.416
So this is where I went online
and looked for help.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.696
Google was my friend.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.856
(Laughter)

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.440
I searched, "How do I overcome
the fear of rejection?"

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.816
I came up with a bunch
of psychology articles

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.696
about where the fear
and pain are coming from.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.016
Then I came up with a bunch
of "rah-rah" inspirational articles

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.421
about "Don't take it personally,
just overcome it."

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.856
Who doesn't know that?

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.456
(Laughter)

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.616
But why was I still so scared?

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.656
Then I found this website by luck.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.056
It's called rejectiontherapy.com.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.616
(Laughter)

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.576
"Rejection Therapy" was this game
invented by this Canadian entrepreneur.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.296
His name is Jason Comely.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.416
And basically the idea is for 30 days
you go out and look for rejection,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.696
and every day get rejected at something,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.240
and then by the end,
you desensitize yourself from the pain.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.896
And I loved that idea.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.456
(Laughter)

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.616
I said, "You know what?
I'm going to do this.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.656
And I'll feel myself
getting rejected 100 days."

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.096
And I came up with my own rejection ideas,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.600
and I made a video blog out of it.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.536
And so here's what I did.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.176
This is what the blog looked like.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.400
Day One ...

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.296
(Laughter)

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.560
Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.456
So this is where I went
to where I was working.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.216
I came downstairs

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.456
and I saw this big guy
sitting behind a desk.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.216
He looked like a security guard.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.776
So I just approached him.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.536
And I was just walking

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.896
and that was the longest
walk of my life --

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.056
hair on the back
of my neck standing up,

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.536
I was sweating and my heart was pounding.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.776
And I got there and said,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.456
"Hey, sir, can I borrow
100 dollars from you?"

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.816
(Laughter)

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.640
And he looked up, he's like, "No."

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.840
"Why?"

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.496
And I just said, "No? I'm sorry."

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.235
Then I turned around,
and I just ran.

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.619
(Laughter)

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.696
I felt so embarrassed.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.176
But because I filmed myself --

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.336
so that night I was watching
myself getting rejected,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.456
I just saw how scared I was.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.936
I looked like this kid
in "The Sixth Sense."

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.376
I saw dead people.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.016
(Laughter)

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.576
But then I saw this guy.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.496
You know, he wasn't that menacing.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.896
He was a chubby, loveable guy,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.376
and he even asked me, "Why?"

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.816
In fact, he invited me to explain myself.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.416
And I could've said many things.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.736
I could've explained,
I could've negotiated.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.200
I didn't do any of that.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.200
All I did was run.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.320
I felt, wow, this is like
a microcosm of my life.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.456
Every time I felt the slightest rejection,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.616
I would just run as fast as I could.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.896
And you know what?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.736
The next day, no matter what happens,

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.256
I'm not going to run.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.480
I'll stay engaged.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.136
Day Two: Request a "burger refill."

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.136
(Laughter)

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.456
It's when I went to a burger joint,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.976
I finished lunch,
and I went to the cashier and said,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.576
"Hi, can I get a burger refill?"

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.776
(Laughter)

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.256
He was all confused,
like, "What's a burger refill?"

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.536
(Laughter)

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.216
I said, "Well, it's just like
a drink refill but with a burger."

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.736
And he said, "Sorry,
we don't do burger refill, man."

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.096
(Laughter)

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.176
So this is where rejection happened
and I could have run, but I stayed.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.336
I said, "Well, I love your burgers,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.776
I love your joint,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.896
and if you guys do a burger refill,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.256
I will love you guys more."

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.536
(Laughter)

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.176
And he said, "Well, OK,
I'll tell my manager about it,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.176
and maybe we'll do it,
but sorry, we can't do this today."

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.616
Then I left.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.496
And by the way,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.776
I don't think they've
ever done burger refill.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.016
(Laughter)

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.600
I think they're still there.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.456
But the life and death feeling
I was feeling the first time

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.816
was no longer there,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.576
just because I stayed engaged --

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.216
because I didn't run.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.600
I said, "Wow, great,
I'm already learning things.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.736
Great."

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.960
And then Day Three:
Getting Olympic Doughnuts.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.280
This is where my life
was turned upside down.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.736
I went to a Krispy Kreme.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.976
It's a doughnut shop

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.616
in mainly the Southeastern part
of the United States.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.496
I'm sure they have some here, too.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.775
And I went in,

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:53.936
I said, "Can you make me doughnuts
that look like Olympic symbols?

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.856
Basically, you interlink
five doughnuts together ... "

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.120
I mean there's no way
they could say yes, right?

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.016
The doughnut maker took me so seriously.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.256
(Laughter)

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.496
So she put out paper,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.696
started jotting down
the colors and the rings,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.736
and is like, "How can I make this?"

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.656
And then 15 minutes later,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.096
she came out with a box
that looked like Olympic rings.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.776
And I was so touched.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.936
I just couldn't believe it.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.720
And that video got
over five million views on Youtube.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.536
The world couldn't believe that either.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.080
(Laughter)

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.656
You know, because of that
I was in newspapers,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.096
in talk shows, in everything.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.616
And I became famous.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.776
A lot of people
started writing emails to me

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.336
and saying, "What you're
doing is awesome."

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.896
But you know, fame and notoriety
did not do anything to me.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.736
What I really wanted to do was learn,

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.976
and to change myself.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.616
So I turned the rest
of my 100 days of rejection

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.536
into this playground --

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.696
into this research project.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.800
I wanted to see what I could learn.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.016
And then I learned a lot of things.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.616
I discovered so many secrets.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.536
For example, I found if I just don't run,

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.816
if I got rejected,

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.896
I could actually turn a "no" into a "yes,"

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.536
and the magic word is, "why."

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.656
So one day I went to a stranger's house,
I had this flower in my hand,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.096
knocked on the door and said,

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.376
"Hey, can I plant this flower
in your backyard?"

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.936
(Laughter)

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.680
And he said, "No."

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.376
But before he could leave I said,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.336
"Hey, can I know why?"

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.416
And he said, "Well, I have this dog

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.776
that would dig up
anything I put in the backyard.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.456
I don't want to waste your flower.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.656
If you want to do this,
go across the street and talk to Connie.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.896
She loves flowers."

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.136
So that's what I did.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.216
I went across and knocked
on Connie's door.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.096
And she was so happy to see me.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.816
(Laughter)

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.216
And then half an hour later,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.296
there was this flower
in Connie's backyard.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.736
I'm sure it looks better now.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.056
(Laughter)

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.016
But had I left
after the initial rejection,

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.256
I would've thought,

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.336
well, it's because
the guy didn't trust me,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.576
it's because I was crazy,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.016
because I didn't dress up well,
I didn't look good.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.256
It was none of those.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.976
It was because what I offered
did not fit what he wanted.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.256
And he trusted me enough
to offer me a referral,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.936
using a sales term.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.480
I converted a referral.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.776
Then one day --

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.696
and I also learned that I can
actually say certain things

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.656
and maximize my chance to get a yes.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.896
So for example,
one day I went to a Starbucks,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.496
and asked the manager,
"Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?"

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.896
He was like, "What's a Starbucks greeter?"

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.016
I said, "Do you know
those Walmart greeters?

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.456
You know, those people who say
'hi' to you before you walk in the store,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.696
and make sure you
don't steal stuff, basically?

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.856
I want to give a Walmart experience
to Starbucks customers."

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.336
(Laughter)

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.360
Well, I'm not sure
that's a good thing, actually --

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.096
Actually, I'm pretty sure
it's a bad thing.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.176
And he was like, "Oh" --

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.456
yeah, this is how he looked,
his name is Eric --

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.056
and he was like, "I'm not sure."

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.136
This is how he was hearing me. "Not sure."

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.816
Then I ask him, "Is that weird?"

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.880
He's like, "Yeah, it's really weird, man."

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.656
But as soon as he said that,
his whole demeanor changed.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.616
It's as if he's putting
all the doubt on the floor.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.376
And he said, "Yeah, you can do this,

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.656
just don't get too weird."

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.096
(Laughter)

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.496
So for the next hour
I was the Starbucks greeter.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.656
I said "hi" to every customer
that walked in,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.056
and gave them holiday cheers.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.736
By the way, I don't know
what your career trajectory is,

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.976
don't be a greeter.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.216
(Laughter)

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.440
It was really boring.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.136
But then I found I could do this
because I mentioned, "Is that weird?"

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.296
I mentioned the doubt that he was having.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.856
And because I mentioned, "Is that weird?",
that means I wasn't weird.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.416
That means I was actually
thinking just like him,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.816
seeing this as a weird thing.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.096
And again, and again,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.256
I learned that if I mention
some doubt people might have

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.096
before I ask the question,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.376
I gained their trust.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.360
People were more likely to say yes to me.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.136
And then I learned
I could fulfill my life dream ...

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.576
by asking.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.696
You know, I came
from four generations of teachers,

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.536
and my grandma has always told me,

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.856
"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.936
but it'd be great
if you became a teacher."

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.376
(Laughter)

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.656
But I wanted to be
an entrepreneur, so I didn't.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.056
But it has always been my dream
to actually teach something.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.896
So I said, "What if I just ask

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.536
and teach a college class?"

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.016
I lived in Austin at the time,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.096
so I went to University
of Texas at Austin

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.336
and knocked on professors' doors
and said, "Can I teach your class?"

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.856
I didn't get anywhere
the first couple of times.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.376
But because I didn't run --
I kept doing it --

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.736
and on the third try
the professor was very impressed.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.816
He was like, "No one
has done this before."

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.856
And I came in prepared
with powerpoints and my lesson.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.936
He said, "Wow, I can use this.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.296
Why don't you come back in two months?
I'll fit you in my curriculum."

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.416
And two months later
I was teaching a class.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.696
This is me -- you probably can't see,
this is a bad picture.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.496
You know, sometimes you get
rejected by lighting, you know?

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.720
(Laughter)

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.896
But wow --

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.656
when I finished teaching that class,
I walked out crying,

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.456
because I thought

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.776
I could fulfill my life dream
just by simply asking.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.456
I used to think I have to accomplish
all these things --

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.096
have to be a great entrepreneur,
or get a PhD to teach --

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.656
but no, I just asked,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.880
and I could teach.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.776
And in that picture,
which you can't see,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.096
I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.656
Why? Because in my research I found
that people who really change the world,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.616
who change the way we live
and the way we think,

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.736
are the people who were met
with initial and often violent rejections.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.816
People like Martin Luther King, Jr.,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.896
like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.456
or even Jesus Christ.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.856
These people did not
let rejection define them.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.040
They let their own reaction
after rejection define themselves.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.480
And they embraced rejection.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.576
And we don't have to be those people
to learn about rejection,

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.856
and in my case,

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.896
rejection was my curse,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.176
was my boogeyman.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.376
It has bothered me my whole life
because I was running away from it.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.120
Then I started embracing it.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.520
I turned that into
the biggest gift in my life.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.776
I started teaching people
how to turn rejections into opportunities.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.816
I use my blog, I use my talk,

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.736
I use the book I just published,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.320
and I'm even building technology to help
people overcome their fear of rejection.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.936
When you get rejected in life,

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.176
when you are facing the next obstacle

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.216
or next failure,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.056
consider the possibilities.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.296
Don't run.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.536
If you just embrace them,

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.640
they might become your gifts as well.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.376
Thank you.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.744
(Applause)
