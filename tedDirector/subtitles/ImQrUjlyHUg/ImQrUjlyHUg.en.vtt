00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Each of you possesses

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
that natural selection has ever devised.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
It's a piece of neural audio technology

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
for rewiring other people's minds.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I'm talking about your language, of course,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
directly into someone else's mind,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
and they can attempt to do the same to you,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
without either of you having to perform surgery.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Instead, when you speak,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
you're actually using a form of telemetry

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
not so different

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
from the remote control device for your television.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
It's just that, whereas that device

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
relies on pulses of infrared light,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
your language relies on pulses,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
discrete pulses, of sound.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And just as you use the remote control device

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
to alter the internal settings of your television

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
to suit your mood,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
you use your language

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
to alter the settings inside someone else's brain

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
to suit your interests.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Languages are genes talking,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
getting things that they want.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
when it first discovers that, merely by uttering a sound,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
it can get objects to move across a room

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
as if by magic,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and maybe even into its mouth.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Now language's subversive power

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
has been recognized throughout the ages

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
in censorship, in books you can't read,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
phrases you can't use

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and words you can't say.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
In fact, the Tower of Babel story in the Bible

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
is a fable and warning

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
about the power of language.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
According to that story, early humans developed the conceit

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
that, by using their language to work together,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
they could build a tower

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
that would take them all the way to heaven.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Now God, angered at this attempt to usurp his power,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
destroyed the tower,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
and then to ensure

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
that it would never be rebuilt,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
he scattered the people by giving them different languages --

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
confused them by giving them different languages.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And this leads to the wonderful irony

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Even today,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
we know that there are words we cannot use,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
phrases we cannot say,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
because if we do so,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
we might be accosted, jailed,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
or even killed.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And all of this from a puff of air

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
emanating from our mouths.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Now all this fuss about a single one of our traits

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
tells us there's something worth explaining.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And that is how and why

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
did this remarkable trait evolve,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and why did it evolve

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
only in our species?

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Now it's a little bit of a surprise

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
that to get an answer to that question,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
we have to go to tool use

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
in the chimpanzees.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Now these chimpanzees are using tools,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and we take that as a sign of their intelligence.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
But if they really were intelligent,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
rather than a shovel?

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And if they really were intelligent,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
why would they crack open nuts with a rock?

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Why wouldn't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
that somebody else had already cracked open for them?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Why not? I mean, that's what we do.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Now the reason the chimpanzees don't do that

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
social learning.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
They seem to lack the ability

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
to learn from others

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
by copying or imitating

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
or simply watching.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
As a result,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
they can't improve on others' ideas

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
or learn from others' mistakes --

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
benefit from others' wisdom.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And so they just do the same thing

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
over and over and over again.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.260
In fact, we could go away for a million years and come back

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
with the same sticks for the termites

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and the same rocks to crack open the nuts.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Now this may sound arrogant, or even full of hubris.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
How do we know this?

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Because this is exactly what our ancestors, the Homo erectus, did.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
These upright apes

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
evolved on the African savanna

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
about two million years ago,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and they made these splendid hand axes

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
that fit wonderfully into your hands.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
But if we look at the fossil record,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
we see that they made the same hand axe

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
over and over and over again

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
for one million years.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
You can follow it through the fossil record.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Now if we make some guesses about how long Homo erectus lived,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
what their generation time was,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
that's about 40,000 generations

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
of parents to offspring, and other individuals watching,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
in which that hand axe didn't change.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
It's not even clear

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
that our very close genetic relatives, the Neanderthals,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
had social learning.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Sure enough, their tools were more complicated

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
than those of Homo erectus,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
but they too showed very little change

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
over the 300,000 years or so

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
that those species, the Neanderthals,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
lived in Eurasia.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Okay, so what this tells us

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
is that, contrary to the old adage,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
"monkey see, monkey do,"

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
the surprise really is

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
that all of the other animals

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
really cannot do that -- at least not very much.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And even this picture

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it --

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
something from a Barnum &amp; Bailey circus.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
But by comparison,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
we can learn.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
We can learn by watching other people

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and copying or imitating

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
what they can do.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
We can then choose, from among a range of options,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
the best one.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
We can benefit from others' ideas.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
We can build on their wisdom.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
And as a result, our ideas do accumulate,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and our technology progresses.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.260
And this cumulative cultural adaptation,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
as anthropologists call

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
this accumulation of ideas,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
is responsible for everything around you

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
in your bustling and teeming everyday lives.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
I mean the world has changed out of all proportion

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
to what we would recognize

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
even 1,000 or 2,000 years ago.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
The chairs you're sitting in, the lights in this auditorium,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
my microphone, the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you --

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
all are a result

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
of cumulative cultural adaptation.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Now to many commentators,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
cumulative cultural adaptation, or social learning,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
is job done, end of story.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
Our species can make stuff,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
therefore we prospered in a way that no other species has.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
In fact, we can even make the "stuff of life" --

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
as I just said, all the stuff around us.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
But in fact, it turns out

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
that some time around 200,000 years ago,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
when our species first arose

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
and acquired social learning,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
that this was really the beginning of our story,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
not the end of our story.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Because our acquisition of social learning

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
would create a social and evolutionary dilemma,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
the resolution of which, it's fair to say,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.260
would determine not only the future course of our psychology,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
but the future course of the entire world.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And most importantly for this,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
it'll tell us why we have language.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
And the reason that dilemma arose

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
is, it turns out, that social learning is visual theft.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
If I can learn by watching you,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
I can steal your best ideas,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and I can benefit from your efforts,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
without having to put in the time and energy that you did

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
into developing them.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
If I can watch which lure you use to catch a fish,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
or I can watch how you flake your hand axe

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
to make it better,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
or if I follow you secretly to your mushroom patch,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
I can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
and maybe even catch that fish

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
before you do.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Social learning really is visual theft.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And in any species that acquired it,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
it would behoove you

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
to hide your best ideas,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
lest somebody steal them from you.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
And so some time around 200,000 years ago,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
our species confronted this crisis.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
And we really had only two options

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
for dealing with the conflicts

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
that visual theft would bring.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
One of those options

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
was that we could have retreated

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
into small family groups.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
would flow just to our relatives.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
Had we chosen this option,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
sometime around 200,000 years ago,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
we would probably still be living like the Neanderthals were

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
when we first entered Europe 40,000 years ago.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And this is because in small groups

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
there are fewer ideas, there are fewer innovations.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
And small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
So if we'd chosen that path,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
our evolutionary path would have led into the forest --

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
and been a short one indeed.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
The other option we could choose

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
was to develop the systems of communication

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
that would allow us to share ideas

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and to cooperate amongst others.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Choosing this option would mean

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
that a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
would become available to any one individual

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
than would ever arise from within an individual family

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
or an individual person on their own.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
Well, we chose the second option,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and language is the result.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Language evolved to solve the crisis

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
of visual theft.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
Language is a piece of social technology

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
for enhancing the benefits of cooperation --

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
for reaching agreements, for striking deals

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.260
and for coordinating our activities.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
And you can see that, in a developing society

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
that was beginning to acquire language,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
not having language

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
would be a like a bird without wings.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Just as wings open up this sphere of air

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
for birds to exploit,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
language opened up the sphere of cooperation

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
for humans to exploit.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
And we take this utterly for granted,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
because we're a species that is so at home with language,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
but you have to realize

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
are utterly dependent upon language.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
And to see why, consider two scenarios

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
from early in our evolution.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Let's imagine that you are really good

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
at making arrowheads,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
but you're hopeless at making the wooden shafts

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
with the flight feathers attached.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
but they're hopeless at making the arrowheads.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
So what you do is --

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
one of those people has not really acquired language yet.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And let's pretend the other one is good at language skills.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
and you walk up to the one that can't speak very well,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and you put the arrowheads down in front of him,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
hoping that he'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
for finished arrows.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
But he looks at the pile of arrowheads, thinks they're a gift,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
picks them up, smiles and walks off.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Now you pursue this guy, gesticulating.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
A scuffle ensues and you get stabbed

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
with one of your own arrowheads.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Okay, now replay this scene now, and you're approaching the one who has language.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
You put down your arrowheads and say,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
"I'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows. I'll split you 50/50."

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
The other one says, "Fine. Looks good to me.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
We'll do that."

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Now the job is done.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Once we have language,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
we can put our ideas together and cooperate

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
to have a prosperity

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
that we couldn't have before we acquired it.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
And this is why our species

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
has prospered around the world

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
while the rest of the animals

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
sit behind bars in zoos, languishing.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
That's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
to extract termites.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
All right, if this view of language

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
and its value

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
in solving the crisis of visual theft is true,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
any species that acquires it

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
And this is exactly what the archeological record shows.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
If you look at our ancestors,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
the Neanderthals and the Homo erectus, our immediate ancestors,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
they're confined to small regions of the world.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
But when our species arose

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
about 200,000 years ago,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
sometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
and spread around the entire world,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
occupying nearly every habitat on Earth.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Now whereas other species are confined

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
to places that their genes adapt them to,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
with social learning and language,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
we could transform the environment

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
to suit our needs.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
And so we prospered in a way

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
that no other animal has.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Language really is

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
the most potent trait that has ever evolved.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
It is the most valuable trait we have

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
for converting new lands and resources

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
into more people and their genes

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
that natural selection has ever devised.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Language really is

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
the voice of our genes.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Now having evolved language, though,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
we did something peculiar,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
even bizarre.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
As we spread out around the world,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
we developed thousands of different languages.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Currently, there are about seven or 8,000

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
different languages spoken on Earth.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Now you might say, well, this is just natural.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
As we diverge, our languages are naturally going to diverge.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
But the real puzzle and irony

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
is that the greatest density of different languages on Earth

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.260
is found where people are most tightly packed together.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
If we go to the island of Papua New Guinea,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
we can find about 800 to 1,000

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
distinct human languages,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
different human languages,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
spoken on that island alone.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
There are places on that island

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
where you can encounter a new language

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
every two or three miles.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
Now, incredible as this sounds,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
I once met a Papuan man, and I asked him if this could possibly be true.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
And he said to me, "Oh no.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
They're far closer together than that."

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
And it's true; there are places on that island

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
where you can encounter a new language in under a mile.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
And so it seems that we use our language,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
not just to cooperate,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
but to draw rings around our cooperative groups

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
and to establish identities,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
from eavesdropping from outside.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
And we know this

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
because when we study different language groups

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
and associate them with their cultures,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
we see that different languages

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
slow the flow of ideas between groups.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
They slow the flow of technologies.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
And they even slow the flow of genes.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
Now I can't speak for you,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
but it seems to be the case

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
that we don't have sex with people we can't talk to.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
(Laughter)

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
Now we have to counter that, though,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
against the evidence we've heard

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
(Laughter)

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
Okay, this tendency we have,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
this seemingly natural tendency we have,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
towards isolation, towards keeping to ourselves,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
crashes head first into our modern world.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
This remarkable image

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
is not a map of the world.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.260
In fact, it's a map of Facebook friendship links.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
And when you plot those friendship links

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
by their latitude and longitude,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
it literally draws a map of the world.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
Our modern world is communicating

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
with itself and with each other

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
more than it has

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
at any time in its past.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
And that communication, that connectivity around the world,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
that globalization

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
now raises a burden.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
Because these different languages

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
impose a barrier, as we've just seen,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
to the transfer of goods and ideas

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
and technologies and wisdom.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
And they impose a barrier to cooperation.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
And nowhere do we see that more clearly

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
than in the European Union,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
whose 27 member countries

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
speak 23 official languages.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
The European Union

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.260
is now spending over one billion euros annually

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
translating among their 23 official languages.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
That's something on the order

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
of 1.45 billion U.S. dollars

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
on translation costs alone.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
Now think of the absurdity of this situation.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
If 27 individuals

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
from those 27 member states

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
sat around table, speaking their 23 languages,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
some very simple mathematics will tell you

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.260
that you need an army of 253 translators

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.260
to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
The European Union employs a permanent staff

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
of about 2,500 translators.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
And in 2007 alone --

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
and I'm sure there are more recent figures --

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
something on the order of 1.3 million pages

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
were translated into English alone.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
And so if language really is

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
the solution to the crisis of visual theft,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
if language really is

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
the conduit of our cooperation,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
the technology that our species derived

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.260
to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
in our modern world,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
we confront a question.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
And that question is whether

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
in this modern, globalized world

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
we can really afford to have all these different languages.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
To put it this way, nature knows no other circumstance

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:25.260
in which functionally equivalent traits coexist.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
One of them always drives the other extinct.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
And we see this in the inexorable march

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
towards standardization.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
There are lots and lots of ways of measuring things --

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
weighing them and measuring their length --

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
but the metric system is winning.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
There are lots and lots of ways of measuring time,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.260
but a really bizarre base 60 system

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
known as hours and minutes and seconds

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
is nearly universal around the world.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
There are many, many ways

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
of imprinting CDs or DVDs,

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
but those are all being standardized as well.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260
And you can probably think of many, many more

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
in your own everyday lives.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260
And so our modern world now

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
is confronting us with a dilemma.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
And it's the dilemma

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
that this Chinese man faces,

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
who's language is spoken

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
by more people in the world

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
than any other single language,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.260
and yet he is sitting at his blackboard,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
converting Chinese phrases

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
into English language phrases.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.260
And what this does is it raises the possibility to us

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.260
that in a world in which we want to promote

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
cooperation and exchange,

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.260
and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
on cooperation

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.260
to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity,

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
his actions suggest to us

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
it might be inevitable

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
that we have to confront the idea

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.260
that our destiny is to be one world with one language.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
Thank you.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:19:01.260
(Applause)

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.260
Matt Ridley: Mark, one question.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.260
Svante found that the FOXP2 gene,

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.260
which seems to be associated with language,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
was also shared in the same form

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
in Neanderthals as us.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.260
Do we have any idea

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.260
how we could have defeated Neanderthals

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
if they also had language?

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
Mark Pagel: This is a very good question.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.260
So many of you will be familiar with the idea that there's this gene called FOXP2

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.260
that seems to be implicated in some ways

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.260
in the fine motor control that's associated with language.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
The reason why I don't believe that tells us

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.260
that the Neanderthals had language

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.260
is -- here's a simple analogy:

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.260
Ferraris are cars that have engines.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.260
My car has an engine,

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260
but it's not a Ferrari.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
Now the simple answer then

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.260
is that genes alone don't, all by themselves,

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.260
determine the outcome

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.260
of very complicated things like language.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.260
What we know about this FOXP2 and Neanderthals

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:57.260
is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths -- who knows.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.260
But that doesn't tell us they necessarily had language.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.260
MR: Thank you very much indeed.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.260
