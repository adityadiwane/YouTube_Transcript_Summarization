00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:15.166
I'm turning 44 next month,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.670
and I have the sense that 44
is going to be a very good year,

00:00:19.694 --> 00:00:22.595
a year of fulfillment, realization.

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:24.895
I have that sense,

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.966
not because of anything
particular in store for me,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.750
but because I read it would be a good year

00:00:30.774 --> 00:00:33.775
in a 1968 book by Norman Mailer.

00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:37.449
"He felt his own age, forty-four ..."

00:00:37.473 --> 00:00:40.391
wrote Mailer in "The Armies of the Night,"

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.877
"... felt as if he were a solid embodiment

00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:46.671
of bone, muscle, heart, mind,
and sentiment to be a man,

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:48.534
as if he had arrived."

00:00:49.207 --> 00:00:51.711
Yes, I know Mailer
wasn't writing about me.

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:54.083
But I also know that he was;

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:58.591
for all of us -- you, me,
the subject of his book,

00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:00.825
age more or less in step,

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:03.814
proceed from birth
along the same great sequence:

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:07.782
through the wonders
and confinements of childhood;

00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:11.761
the emancipations
and frustrations of adolescence;

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.499
the empowerments
and millstones of adulthood;

00:01:16.188 --> 00:01:19.714
the recognitions
and resignations of old age.

00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:22.293
There are patterns to life,

00:01:22.317 --> 00:01:23.651
and they are shared.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.029
As Thomas Mann wrote:
"It will happen to me as to them."

00:01:29.772 --> 00:01:31.989
We don't simply live these patterns.

00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:33.742
We record them, too.

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.973
We write them down in books,
where they become narratives

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:39.191
that we can then read and recognize.

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:41.960
Books tell us who we've been,

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:44.826
who we are, who we will be, too.

00:01:45.492 --> 00:01:47.455
So they have for millennia.

00:01:48.162 --> 00:01:49.805
As James Salter wrote,

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.756
"Life passes into pages
if it passes into anything."

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.348
And so six years ago,
a thought leapt to mind:

00:01:58.372 --> 00:02:02.303
if life passed into pages,
there were, somewhere,

00:02:02.327 --> 00:02:04.687
passages written about every age.

00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:08.291
If I could find them, I could
assemble them into a narrative.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.353
I could assemble them into a life,

00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:13.123
a long life, a hundred-year life,

00:02:13.147 --> 00:02:15.440
the entirety of that same great sequence

00:02:15.464 --> 00:02:18.028
through which the luckiest among us pass.

00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:21.797
I was then 37 years old,

00:02:22.613 --> 00:02:25.469
"an age of discretion,"
wrote William Trevor.

00:02:27.074 --> 00:02:30.298
I was prone to meditating on time and age.

00:02:30.322 --> 00:02:33.165
An illness in the family
and later an injury to me

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.474
had long made clear that growing old
could not be assumed.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:40.691
And besides, growing old
only postponed the inevitable,

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:43.392
time seeing through
what circumstance did not.

00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:45.755
It was all a bit disheartening.

00:02:46.413 --> 00:02:48.834
A list, though, would last.

00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:52.479
To chronicle a life
year by vulnerable year

00:02:52.503 --> 00:02:55.740
would be to clasp and to ground
what was fleeting,

00:02:55.764 --> 00:02:59.107
would be to provide myself and others
a glimpse into the future,

00:02:59.131 --> 00:03:00.909
whether we made it there or not.

00:03:01.574 --> 00:03:05.661
And when I then began to compile my list,
I was quickly obsessed,

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.878
searching pages and pages
for ages and ages.

00:03:09.702 --> 00:03:13.937
Here we were at every annual step
through our first hundred years.

00:03:14.624 --> 00:03:17.636
"Twenty-seven ... a time
of sudden revelations,"

00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:22.616
"sixty-two, ... of subtle diminishments."

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.889
I was mindful, of course,
that such insights were relative.

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:32.460
For starters, we now live longer,
and so age more slowly.

00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:36.311
Christopher Isherwood used
the phrase "the yellow leaf"

00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:38.486
to describe a man at 53,

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.829
only one century after Lord Byron
used it to describe himself at 36.

00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:45.130
(Laughter)

00:03:45.154 --> 00:03:48.773
I was mindful, too, that life
can swing wildly and unpredictably

00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:50.585
from one year to the next,

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.384
and that people may experience
the same age differently.

00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:57.619
But even so, as the list coalesced,

00:03:57.643 --> 00:04:01.032
so, too, on the page, clear
as the reflection in the mirror,

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:02.972
did the life that I had been living:

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.129
finding at 20 that "... one is less
and less sure of who one is;"

00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:12.517
emerging at 30 from the "... wasteland
of preparation into active life;"

00:04:13.057 --> 00:04:17.173
learning at 40 "... to close softly
the doors to rooms

00:04:17.197 --> 00:04:19.326
[I would] not be coming back to."

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.315
There I was.

00:04:23.885 --> 00:04:26.143
Of course, there we all are.

00:04:26.762 --> 00:04:29.200
Milton Glaser, the great graphic designer

00:04:29.224 --> 00:04:32.035
whose beautiful
visualizations you see here,

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:34.379
and who today is 85 --

00:04:34.403 --> 00:04:38.503
all those years "... a ripening
and an apotheosis," wrote Nabokov --

00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:42.669
noted to me that, like art and like color,

00:04:43.455 --> 00:04:46.307
literature helps us to remember
what we've experienced.

00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:50.833
And indeed, when I shared
the list with my grandfather,

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.593
he nodded in recognition.

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:56.581
He was then 95 and soon to die,

00:04:57.234 --> 00:04:59.355
which, wrote Roberto BolaÃ±o,

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.700
"... is the same as never dying."

00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:06.196
And looking back, he said to me that, yes,

00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:11.849
Proust was right that at 22,
we are sure we will not die,

00:05:13.873 --> 00:05:16.654
just as a thanatologist
named Edwin Shneidman was right

00:05:16.678 --> 00:05:19.443
that at 90, we are sure we will.

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:22.621
It had happened to him,

00:05:23.234 --> 00:05:24.439
as to them.

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:28.932
Now the list is done:

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.189
a hundred years.

00:05:33.443 --> 00:05:35.067
And looking back over it,

00:05:36.298 --> 00:05:38.204
I know that I am not done.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.895
I still have my life to live,

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.419
still have many more pages to pass into.

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:46.398
And mindful of Mailer,

00:05:46.422 --> 00:05:48.032
I await 44.

00:05:48.746 --> 00:05:49.924
Thank you.

00:05:49.948 --> 00:06:00.810
(Applause)
