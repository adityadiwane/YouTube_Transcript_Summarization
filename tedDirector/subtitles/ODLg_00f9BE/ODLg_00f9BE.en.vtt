00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:15.190
I want to introduce you
to an amazing woman.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.698
Her name is Davinia.

00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:22.849
Davinia was born in Jamaica,
emigrated to the US at the age of 18,

00:00:22.873 --> 00:00:25.604
and now lives just outside
of Washington, DC.

00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:29.064
She's not a high-powered
political staffer,

00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:30.261
nor a lobbyist.

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:33.605
She'd probably tell you
she's quite unremarkable,

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.154
but she's having
the most remarkable impact.

00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:37.991
What's incredible about Davinia

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:40.878
is that she's willing to spend
time every single week

00:00:40.902 --> 00:00:43.307
focused on people who are not her:

00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:47.710
people not her in her neighborhood,
her state, nor even in her country --

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:49.967
people she'd likely never meet.

00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:51.931
Davinia's impact started a few years ago

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:54.699
when she reached out
to all of her friends on Facebook,

00:00:54.723 --> 00:00:56.906
and asked them to donate their pennies

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.373
so she could fund girls' education.

00:00:59.397 --> 00:01:01.804
She wasn't expecting a huge response,

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.611
but 700,000 pennies later,

00:01:04.635 --> 00:01:07.951
she's now sent over 120 girls to school.

00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:09.162
When we spoke last week,

00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:12.224
she told me she's become
a little infamous at the local bank

00:01:12.248 --> 00:01:16.526
every time she rocks up
with a shopping cart full of pennies.

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.608
Now -- Davinia is not alone.

00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:21.314
Far from it.

00:01:21.717 --> 00:01:24.003
She's part of a growing movement.

00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:26.060
And there's a name
for people like Davinia:

00:01:26.663 --> 00:01:28.100
global citizens.

00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:33.406
A global citizen is someone
who self-identifies first and foremost

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.232
not as a member of a state,
a tribe or a nation,

00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:39.443
but as a member of the human race,

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:44.307
and someone who is prepared
to act on that belief,

00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:47.226
to tackle our world's greatest challenges.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.703
Our work is focused on finding,

00:01:49.727 --> 00:01:52.610
supporting and activating global citizens.

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:54.532
They exist in every country

00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:56.459
and among every demographic.

00:01:57.008 --> 00:01:58.770
I want to make the case to you today

00:01:58.794 --> 00:02:01.872
that the world's future depends
on global citizens.

00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:06.198
I'm convinced that if we had
more global citizens active in our world,

00:02:06.222 --> 00:02:08.957
then every single one
of the major challenges we face --

00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:12.579
from poverty, climate change,
gender inequality --

00:02:12.603 --> 00:02:14.787
these issues become solvable.

00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:17.407
They are ultimately global issues,

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:19.312
and they can ultimately only be solved

00:02:19.336 --> 00:02:23.731
by global citizens demanding
global solutions from their leaders.

00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:27.232
Now, some people's immediate
reaction to this idea

00:02:27.256 --> 00:02:31.124
is that it's either a bit utopian
or even threatening.

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:34.616
So I'd like to share with you
a little of my story today,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.351
how I ended up here,

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:38.163
how it connects with Davinia

00:02:38.187 --> 00:02:39.628
and, hopefully, with you.

00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:42.072
Growing up in Melbourne, Australia,

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:45.435
I was one of those seriously
irritating little kids

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.783
that never, ever stopped asking, "Why?"

00:02:47.807 --> 00:02:49.402
You might have been one yourself.

00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:52.798
I used to ask my mum
the most annoying questions.

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:55.621
I'd ask her questions like,
"Mum, why I can't I dress up

00:02:55.645 --> 00:02:57.572
and play with puppets all day?"

00:02:57.596 --> 00:02:59.596
"Why do you want fries with that?"

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:01.126
"What is a shrimp,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.822
and why do we have to keep
throwing them on the barbie?"

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:04.847
(Laughter)

00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:06.679
"And mum -- this haircut.

00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:07.876
Why?"

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.328
(Laughter)

00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:11.880
The worst haircut, I think.

00:03:13.364 --> 00:03:14.515
Still terrible.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.341
As a "why" kid, I thought
I could change the world,

00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:19.965
and it was impossible
to convince me otherwise.

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.576
And when I was 12
and in my first year of high school,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.837
I started raising money
for communities in the developing world.

00:03:25.861 --> 00:03:28.056
We were a really
enthusiastic group of kids,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.341
and we raised more money
than any other school in Australia.

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:34.953
And so I was awarded the chance
to go to the Philippines to learn more.

00:03:34.977 --> 00:03:36.891
It was 1998.

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:40.602
We were taken into a slum
in the outskirts of Manila.

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:44.356
It was there I became friends
with Sonny Boy,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.919
who lived on what was literally
a pile of steaming garbage.

00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:50.626
"Smoky Mountain" was what they called it.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.935
But don't let the romance
of that name fool you,

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.320
because it was nothing more
than a rancid landfill

00:03:55.344 --> 00:03:59.685
that kids like Sonny Boy spent hours
rummaging through every single day

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.645
to find something, anything of value.

00:04:03.304 --> 00:04:06.580
That night with Sonny Boy and his family
changed my life forever,

00:04:06.604 --> 00:04:08.627
because when it came time to go to sleep,

00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:12.398
we simply laid down on this concrete
slab the size of half my bedroom

00:04:12.422 --> 00:04:15.328
with myself, Sonny Boy,
and the rest of his family,

00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:16.963
seven of us in this long line,

00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:19.381
with the smell of rubbish all around us

00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:21.539
and cockroaches crawling all around.

00:04:21.952 --> 00:04:23.231
And I didn't sleep a wink,

00:04:23.255 --> 00:04:24.964
but I lay awake thinking to myself,

00:04:24.988 --> 00:04:27.470
"Why should anyone have to live like this

00:04:27.494 --> 00:04:28.846
when I have so much?

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.036
Why should Sonny Boy's ability
to live out his dreams

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.106
be determined by where he's born,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.891
or what Warren Buffett called
'the ovarian lottery?'"

00:04:37.197 --> 00:04:38.954
I just didn't get it,

00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:40.844
and I needed to understand why.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:44.002
Now, I only later came to understand

00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:46.454
that the poverty I'd seen
in the Philippines

00:04:46.478 --> 00:04:50.787
was the result of decisions made
or not made, man-made,

00:04:50.811 --> 00:04:54.216
by a succession of colonial powers
and corrupt governments

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.405
who had anything but the interests
of Sonny Boy at heart.

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:01.229
Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain,
but they may as well have.

00:05:01.253 --> 00:05:03.854
And if we're to try to help
kids like Sonny Boy,

00:05:03.878 --> 00:05:06.570
it wouldn't work just to try
to send him a few dollars

00:05:06.594 --> 00:05:09.682
or to try to clean up
the garbage dump on which he lived,

00:05:09.706 --> 00:05:12.190
because the core
of the problem lay elsewhere.

00:05:12.214 --> 00:05:15.873
And as I worked on community
development projects over the coming years

00:05:15.897 --> 00:05:17.739
trying to help build schools,

00:05:17.763 --> 00:05:20.804
train teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS,

00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:23.265
I came to see that community development

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.845
should be driven
by communities themselves,

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:29.622
and that although charity is necessary,
it's not sufficient.

00:05:29.646 --> 00:05:31.507
We need to confront these challenges

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:34.197
on a global scale and in a systemic way.

00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:35.666
And the best thing I could do

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.197
is try to mobilize a large group
of citizens back home

00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:42.784
to insist that our leaders engage
in that systemic change.

00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:45.315
That's why, a few years later,

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:47.608
I joined with a group of college friends

00:05:47.632 --> 00:05:51.010
in bringing the Make Poverty History
campaign to Australia.

00:05:51.447 --> 00:05:54.825
We had this dream of staging
this small concert

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.722
around the time of the G20
with local Aussie artists,

00:05:58.746 --> 00:06:00.398
and it suddenly exploded one day

00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:04.024
when we got a phone call from Bono,
the Edge and Pearl Jam,

00:06:04.048 --> 00:06:07.317
who all agreed to headline our concert.

00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:09.942
I got a little bit excited
that day, as you can see.

00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:11.904
(Laughter)

00:06:11.928 --> 00:06:13.207
But to our amazement,

00:06:13.231 --> 00:06:16.323
the Australian government
heard our collective voices,

00:06:16.347 --> 00:06:20.041
and they agreed to double investment
into global health and development --

00:06:20.065 --> 00:06:22.780
an additional 6.2 billion dollars.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.455
It felt like --

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.938
(Applause)

00:06:28.962 --> 00:06:31.555
It felt like this incredible validation.

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:34.945
By rallying citizens together,
we helped persuade our government

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:36.455
to do the unthinkable,

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.124
and act to fix a problem
miles outside of our borders.

00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:42.267
But here's the thing:

00:06:43.156 --> 00:06:44.457
it didn't last.

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:46.895
See, there was a change in government,

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.607
and six years later, all that new money

00:06:49.631 --> 00:06:50.797
disappeared.

00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:52.774
What did we learn?

00:06:53.703 --> 00:06:56.780
We learned that one-off spikes
are not enough.

00:06:57.225 --> 00:06:59.685
We needed a sustainable movement,

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:03.693
not one that is susceptible
to the fluctuating moods of a politician

00:07:03.717 --> 00:07:05.994
or the hint of an economic downturn.

00:07:06.018 --> 00:07:08.120
And it needed to happen everywhere;

00:07:08.144 --> 00:07:12.049
otherwise, every individual government
would have this built-in excuse mechanism

00:07:12.073 --> 00:07:16.182
that they couldn't possibly carry
the burden of global action alone.

00:07:17.405 --> 00:07:19.500
And so this is what we embarked upon.

00:07:20.103 --> 00:07:23.080
And as we embarked upon
this challenge, we asked ourselves,

00:07:23.104 --> 00:07:26.601
how do we gain enough pressure
and build a broad enough army

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:28.713
to win these fights for the long term?

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.386
We could only think of one way.

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:34.745
We needed to somehow turn
that short-term excitement

00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:37.666
of people involved with
the Make Poverty History campaign

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.292
into long-term passion.

00:07:39.822 --> 00:07:41.819
It had to be part of their identity.

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:47.241
So in 2012, we cofounded an organization
that had exactly that as its goal.

00:07:47.836 --> 00:07:49.725
And there was only one name for it:

00:07:50.359 --> 00:07:51.558
Global Citizen.

00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:54.748
But this is not about
any one organization.

00:07:55.295 --> 00:07:57.618
This is about citizens taking action.

00:07:58.041 --> 00:07:59.802
And research data tells us

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:04.057
that of the total population
who even care about global issues,

00:08:04.081 --> 00:08:07.586
only 18 percent have done
anything about it.

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:10.571
It's not that people don't want to act.

00:08:10.595 --> 00:08:13.026
It's often that they don't
know how to take action,

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.151
or that they believe that their actions
will have no effect.

00:08:16.175 --> 00:08:19.700
So we had to somehow recruit
and activate millions of citizens

00:08:19.724 --> 00:08:21.385
in dozens of countries

00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:24.708
to put pressure on their leaders
to behave altruistically.

00:08:24.732 --> 00:08:27.753
And as we did so, we discovered
something really thrilling,

00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:31.213
that when you make
global citizenship your mission,

00:08:31.237 --> 00:08:34.719
you suddenly find yourself
with some extraordinary allies.

00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:38.608
See, extreme poverty isn't the only issue
that's fundamentally global.

00:08:38.632 --> 00:08:40.496
So, too, is climate change,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.096
human rights, gender equality,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.706
even conflict.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.322
We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder

00:08:47.346 --> 00:08:50.991
with people who are passionate about
targeting all these interrelated issues.

00:08:51.316 --> 00:08:53.353
But how did we actually
go about recruiting

00:08:53.377 --> 00:08:55.303
and engaging those global citizens?

00:08:55.327 --> 00:08:58.598
Well, we used the universal language:

00:08:59.034 --> 00:09:00.263
music.

00:09:00.287 --> 00:09:02.550
We launched the Global Citizen Festival

00:09:02.574 --> 00:09:05.424
in the heart of New York City
in Central Park,

00:09:05.448 --> 00:09:09.216
and we persuaded some of the world's
biggest artists to participate.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.556
We made sure that
these festivals coincided

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.721
with the UN General Assembly meeting,

00:09:13.745 --> 00:09:16.199
so that leaders who need
to hear our voices

00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:17.952
couldn't possible ignore them.

00:09:18.828 --> 00:09:20.169
But there was a twist:

00:09:20.884 --> 00:09:22.539
you couldn't buy a ticket.

00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:23.753
You had to earn it.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.197
You had to take action
on behalf of a global cause,

00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:30.813
and only once you'd done that
could you earn enough points to qualify.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.463
Activism is the currency.

00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:38.479
I had no interest in citizenship
purely as some sort of feel-good thing.

00:09:38.503 --> 00:09:42.780
For me, citizenship means you have to act,
and that's what we required.

00:09:42.804 --> 00:09:44.765
And amazingly, it worked.

00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:49.496
Last year, more than 155,000 citizens
in the New York area alone

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.423
earned enough points to qualify.

00:09:51.447 --> 00:09:55.811
Globally, we've now signed up citizens
in over 150 countries around the world.

00:09:55.835 --> 00:09:59.247
And last year, we signed up
more than 100,000 new members

00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:01.224
each and every week of the whole year.

00:10:01.708 --> 00:10:05.811
See, we don't need to create
global citizens from nothing.

00:10:05.835 --> 00:10:07.764
We're already everywhere.

00:10:07.788 --> 00:10:09.967
We just need to be organized

00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:11.639
and motivated to start acting.

00:10:12.229 --> 00:10:15.324
And this is where I believe
we can learn a lot from Davinia,

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:19.298
who started taking action
as a global citizen back in 2012.

00:10:19.925 --> 00:10:21.147
Here's what she did.

00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:23.131
It wasn't rocket science.

00:10:23.537 --> 00:10:25.813
She started writing letters,

00:10:25.837 --> 00:10:28.123
emailing politicians' offices.

00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:31.142
She volunteered her time
in her local community.

00:10:31.166 --> 00:10:33.778
That's when she got active on social media

00:10:33.802 --> 00:10:36.032
and started to collect pennies --

00:10:36.056 --> 00:10:37.357
a lot of pennies.

00:10:38.264 --> 00:10:41.542
Now, maybe that doesn't sound
like a lot to you.

00:10:42.252 --> 00:10:43.748
How will that achieve anything?

00:10:44.502 --> 00:10:47.617
Well, it achieved a lot
because she wasn't alone.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.650
Her actions, alongside 142,000
other global citizens',

00:10:52.674 --> 00:10:55.315
led the US government
to double their investment

00:10:55.339 --> 00:10:57.170
into Global Partnership for Education.

00:10:57.194 --> 00:10:58.733
And here's Dr. Raj Shah,

00:10:58.757 --> 00:11:01.259
the head of USAID,
making that announcement.

00:11:01.283 --> 00:11:05.122
See, when thousands of global citizens
find inspiration from each other,

00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:07.825
it's amazing to see
their collective power.

00:11:07.849 --> 00:11:11.261
Global citizens like Davinia
helped persuade the World Bank

00:11:11.285 --> 00:11:13.960
to boost their investment
into water and sanitation.

00:11:13.984 --> 00:11:18.024
Here's the Bank's president Jim Kim
announcing 15 billion dollars onstage

00:11:18.048 --> 00:11:19.310
at Global Citizen,

00:11:19.334 --> 00:11:22.840
and Prime Minister Modi of India
affirmed his commitment

00:11:22.864 --> 00:11:27.748
to put a toilet in every household
and school across India by 2019.

00:11:28.494 --> 00:11:32.710
Global citizens encouraged
by the late-night host Stephen Colbert

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.686
launched a Twitter invasion on Norway.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.917
Erna Solberg, the country's
Prime Minister, got the message,

00:11:38.941 --> 00:11:41.949
committing to double investment
into girls' education.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.235
Global citizens together with Rotarians
called on the Canadian, UK,

00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:47.660
and Australian governments

00:11:47.684 --> 00:11:50.546
to boost their investment
into polio eradication.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.679
They got together and committed
665 million dollars.

00:11:56.309 --> 00:11:58.357
But despite all of this momentum,

00:11:59.277 --> 00:12:01.277
we face some huge challenges.

00:12:02.008 --> 00:12:03.888
See, you might be thinking to yourself,

00:12:03.912 --> 00:12:06.236
how can we possibly persuade world leaders

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.617
to sustain a focus on global issues?

00:12:09.474 --> 00:12:14.557
Indeed, the powerful American
politician Tip O'Neill once said,

00:12:14.581 --> 00:12:16.580
"All politics is local."

00:12:17.762 --> 00:12:20.535
That's what always
got politicians elected:

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:23.581
to seek, gain and hold onto power

00:12:23.605 --> 00:12:27.478
through the pursuit of local
or at very best national interests.

00:12:28.185 --> 00:12:32.497
I experienced this for the first time
when I was 21 years old.

00:12:33.113 --> 00:12:34.495
I took a meeting

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:38.958
with a then-Australian Foreign Minister
who shall remain nameless --

00:12:39.655 --> 00:12:40.946
[Alexander Downer]

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.728
(Laughter)

00:12:43.515 --> 00:12:44.737
And behind closed doors,

00:12:44.761 --> 00:12:47.237
I shared with him my passion
to end extreme poverty.

00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:51.180
I said, "Minister -- Australia
has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:53.893
to help achieve the Millennium
Development Goals.

00:12:53.917 --> 00:12:55.163
We can do this."

00:12:55.806 --> 00:12:57.244
And he paused,

00:12:57.268 --> 00:12:59.790
looked down on me
with cold, dismissive eyes,

00:13:00.465 --> 00:13:01.933
and he said, "Hugh,

00:13:01.957 --> 00:13:04.147
no one gives a funk about foreign aid."

00:13:04.615 --> 00:13:06.425
Except he didn't use the word "funk."

00:13:07.528 --> 00:13:08.689
He went on.

00:13:08.713 --> 00:13:11.270
He said we need to look after
our own backyard first.

00:13:11.872 --> 00:13:13.035
This is, I believe,

00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:15.526
outdated, even dangerous thinking.

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:17.932
Or as my late grandfather would say,

00:13:17.956 --> 00:13:19.301
complete BS.

00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.947
Parochialism offers this false dichotomy

00:13:22.971 --> 00:13:26.477
because it pits the poor in one country
against the poor in another.

00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:30.350
It pretends we can isolate ourselves
and our nations from one another.

00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:32.766
The whole world is our backyard,

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.671
and we ignore it at our peril.

00:13:34.695 --> 00:13:36.893
See, look what happened
when we ignored Rwanda,

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:38.385
when we ignore Syria,

00:13:38.409 --> 00:13:40.312
when we ignore climate change.

00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:42.519
Political leaders ought to give a "funk"

00:13:42.543 --> 00:13:45.206
because the impact of climate change
and extreme poverty

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.586
comes right to our shore.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.720
Now, global citizens --
they understand this.

00:13:49.744 --> 00:13:52.994
We live in a time that favors
the global citizen,

00:13:53.018 --> 00:13:55.930
in an age where every
single voice can be heard.

00:13:55.954 --> 00:13:57.122
See, do you remember

00:13:57.146 --> 00:14:00.612
when the Millennium Development Goals
were signed back in the year 2000?

00:14:00.636 --> 00:14:03.541
The most we could do in those days
was fire off a letter

00:14:03.565 --> 00:14:05.276
and wait for the next election.

00:14:05.737 --> 00:14:07.411
There was no social media.

00:14:07.998 --> 00:14:11.213
Today, billions of citizens
have more tools,

00:14:11.237 --> 00:14:13.055
more access to information,

00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:15.530
more capacity to influence
than ever before.

00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:19.893
Both the problems and the tools
to solve them are right before us.

00:14:20.377 --> 00:14:22.443
The world has changed,

00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:24.864
and those of us who look
beyond our borders

00:14:24.888 --> 00:14:26.928
are on the right side of history.

00:14:28.063 --> 00:14:29.309
So where are we?

00:14:29.898 --> 00:14:32.265
So we run this amazing festival,

00:14:32.289 --> 00:14:34.604
we've scored some big policy wins,

00:14:34.628 --> 00:14:37.127
and citizens are signing up
all over the world.

00:14:37.817 --> 00:14:39.873
But have we achieved our mission?

00:14:40.651 --> 00:14:41.809
No.

00:14:42.285 --> 00:14:43.930
We have such a long way to go.

00:14:44.946 --> 00:14:47.128
But this is the opportunity that I see.

00:14:48.414 --> 00:14:50.541
The concept of global citizenship,

00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:57.412
self-evident in its logic but until now
impractical in many ways,

00:14:57.436 --> 00:15:01.566
has coincided with this particular moment
in which we are privileged to live.

00:15:02.044 --> 00:15:03.196
We, as global citizens,

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.807
now have a unique opportunity
to accelerate large-scale positive change

00:15:07.831 --> 00:15:09.068
around the world.

00:15:09.554 --> 00:15:11.713
So in the months and years ahead,

00:15:11.737 --> 00:15:14.781
global citizens will hold
world leaders accountable

00:15:14.805 --> 00:15:17.851
to ensure that the new Global Goals
for Sustainable Development

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:19.540
are tracked and implemented.

00:15:20.048 --> 00:15:22.926
Global citizens will partner
with the world's leading NGOs

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.782
to end diseases like polio and malaria.

00:15:26.243 --> 00:15:29.410
Global citizens will sign up
in every corner of this globe,

00:15:29.434 --> 00:15:32.090
increasing the frequency, quality

00:15:32.114 --> 00:15:33.859
and impact of their actions.

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.938
These dreams are within reach.

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:40.043
Imagine an army of millions

00:15:40.067 --> 00:15:42.264
growing into tens of millions,

00:15:42.288 --> 00:15:46.035
connected, informed, engaged

00:15:46.638 --> 00:15:48.820
and unwilling to take no for an answer.

00:15:50.432 --> 00:15:51.992
Over all these years,

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.405
I've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.603
Sadly, I've been unable to.

00:16:00.611 --> 00:16:02.804
We met long before social media,

00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:06.243
and his address has now
been relocated by the authorities,

00:16:06.267 --> 00:16:08.130
as often happens with slums.

00:16:09.923 --> 00:16:11.357
I'd love to sit down with him,

00:16:11.381 --> 00:16:12.574
wherever he is,

00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:17.390
and share with him how much the time
I spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.429
Thanks to him and so many others,

00:16:20.453 --> 00:16:24.124
I came to understand the importance
of being part of a movement of people --

00:16:24.752 --> 00:16:28.219
the kids willing to look up
from their screens and out to the world,

00:16:28.743 --> 00:16:30.211
the global citizens.

00:16:31.104 --> 00:16:33.227
Global citizens who stand together,

00:16:33.973 --> 00:16:35.775
who ask the question "Why?,"

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:38.415
who reject the naysayers,

00:16:38.938 --> 00:16:42.161
and embrace the amazing possibilities
of the world we share.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.605
I'm a global citizen.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.343
Are you?

00:16:46.841 --> 00:16:48.023
Thank you.

00:16:48.047 --> 00:16:55.613
(Applause)
