00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:15.349
This is an ambucycle.

00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:20.388
This is the fastest way
to reach any medical emergency.

00:00:20.412 --> 00:00:24.890
It has everything an ambulance
has except for a bed.

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:28.646
You see the defibrillator.
You see the equipment.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.812
We all saw the tragedy
that happened in Boston.

00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:33.892
When I was looking at these pictures,

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:36.882
it brought me back many years to my past

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:38.452
when I was a child.

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:41.530
I grew up in a small
neighborhood in Jerusalem.

00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:45.621
When I was six years old,
I was walking back from school

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:49.356
on a Friday afternoon
with my older brother.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.608
We were passing by a bus stop.

00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:55.651
We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes.

00:00:55.675 --> 00:01:00.696
The bus was on fire, and many people
were hurt and killed.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.628
I remembered an old man

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:06.096
yelling to us and crying
to help us get him up.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.559
He just needed someone helping him.

00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:12.093
We were so scared and we just ran away.

00:01:12.117 --> 00:01:15.883
Growing up, I decided I wanted
to become a doctor and save lives.

00:01:15.907 --> 00:01:18.884
Maybe that was because of what I saw
when I was a child.

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:22.176
When I was 15, I took an EMT course,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.236
and I went to volunteer on an ambulance.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.653
For two years, I volunteered
on an ambulance in Jerusalem.

00:01:28.677 --> 00:01:30.505
I helped many people,

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:33.420
but whenever someone really needed help,

00:01:33.444 --> 00:01:35.762
I never got there in time.
We never got there.

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:38.271
The traffic is so bad. The
distance, and everything.

00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:41.096
We never got there when
somebody really needed us.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.787
One day, we received a call
about a seven-year-old child

00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:45.370
choking from a hot dog.

00:01:45.394 --> 00:01:47.537
Traffic was horrific,
and we were coming from

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:51.148
the other side of town
in the north part of Jerusalem.

00:01:51.172 --> 00:01:53.434
When we got there, 20 minutes later,

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:55.952
we started CPR on the kid.

00:01:55.976 --> 00:01:59.436
A doctor comes in from a block away,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.632
stop us, checks the kid,
and tells us to stop CPR.

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:08.389
That second he declared this child dead.

00:02:08.413 --> 00:02:11.386
At that moment, I understood

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.257
that this child died for nothing.

00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:17.812
If this doctor, who lived
one block away from there,

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:19.503
would have come 20 minutes earlier,

00:02:19.527 --> 00:02:22.529
not have to wait
until that siren he heard before

00:02:22.553 --> 00:02:23.815
coming from the ambulance,

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.749
if he would have heard
about it way before,

00:02:26.773 --> 00:02:28.482
he would have saved this child.

00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:30.613
He could have run from a block away.

00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:32.300
He could have saved this child.

00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:34.985
I said to myself, there
must be a better way.

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:36.934
Together with 15 of my friends --

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.705
we were all EMTs —

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.777
we decided, let's protect
our neighborhood,

00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:42.801
so when something like that happens again,

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:46.215
we will be there running to the scene
a lot before the ambulance.

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.188
So I went over to the manager
of the ambulance company

00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:51.546
and I told him, "Please,
whenever you have a call

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.207
coming into our neighborhood,

00:02:53.231 --> 00:02:55.112
we have 15 great guys who are willing

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:57.803
to stop everything they're
doing and run and save lives.

00:02:57.827 --> 00:02:59.231
Just alert us by beeper.

00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:01.572
We'll buy these beepers,
just tell your dispatch

00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:05.483
to send us the beeper,
and we will run and save lives."

00:03:05.507 --> 00:03:12.460
Well, he was laughing. I was 17 years old.
I was a kid.

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:15.846
And he said to me — I remember
this like yesterday —

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.203
he was a great guy, but he said to me,

00:03:18.227 --> 00:03:22.639
"Kid, go to school, or go
open a falafel stand.

00:03:22.663 --> 00:03:26.640
We're not really interested
in these kinds of new adventures.

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:30.255
We're not interested in your help."
And he threw me out of the room.

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.914
"I don't need your help," he said.

00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:36.493
I was a very stubborn kid.

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:39.911
As you see now, I'm walking
around like crazy, meshugenah.

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:44.883
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:44.907 --> 00:03:48.936
So I decided to use the Israeli
very famous technique

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.591
you've probably all heard of, chutzpah.
(Laughter)

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:57.275
And the next day, I went
and I bought two police scanners,

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.889
and I said, "The hell
with you, if you don't want

00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:01.840
to give me information, I'll get
the information myself."

00:04:01.864 --> 00:04:05.105
And we did turns, who's going
to listen to the radio scanners.

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.874
The next day, while I was listening
to the scanners,

00:04:07.898 --> 00:04:11.190
I heard about a call coming
in of a 70-year-old man

00:04:11.214 --> 00:04:14.800
hurt by a car only one block away from me

00:04:14.824 --> 00:04:17.491
on the main street of my neighborhood.

00:04:17.515 --> 00:04:20.194
I ran there by foot. I had
no medical equipment.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:23.144
When I got there, the 70-year-old man

00:04:23.168 --> 00:04:26.058
was lying on the floor, blood
was gushing out of his neck.

00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:27.271
He was on Coumadin.

00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:32.265
I knew I had to stop his bleeding
or else he would die.

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.208
I took off my yarmulke,
because I had no medical equipment,

00:04:35.232 --> 00:04:37.661
and with a lot of pressure,
I stopped his bleeding.

00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:39.176
He was bleeding from his neck.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.633
When the ambulance arrived
15 minutes later,

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:45.220
I gave them over a patient who was alive.

00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:53.200
(Applause)

00:04:53.224 --> 00:04:55.362
When I went to visit him two days later,

00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:57.697
he gave me a hug and was crying

00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:00.719
and thanking me for saving his life.

00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:03.740
At that moment, when I realized
this is the first person

00:05:03.764 --> 00:05:07.050
I ever saved in my life after two years
volunteering in an ambulance,

00:05:07.074 --> 00:05:09.742
I knew this is my life's mission.

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:13.907
So today, 22 years later,
we have United Hatzalah.

00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:20.297
(Applause)

00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:23.369
"Hatzalah" means "rescue,"
for all of you who don't know Hebrew.

00:05:23.393 --> 00:05:25.321
I forgot I'm not in Israel.

00:05:25.345 --> 00:05:28.256
So we have thousands of volunteers

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.175
who are passionate about saving lives,

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.009
and they're spread all around,
so whenever a call comes in,

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:38.405
they just stop everything
and go and run and save a life.

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:40.962
Our average response time today

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:44.676
went down to less
than three minutes in Israel.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.322
(Applause)

00:05:48.346 --> 00:05:49.870
I'm talking about heart attacks,

00:05:49.894 --> 00:05:51.502
I'm talking about car accidents,

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:54.376
God forbid bomb attacks,
shootings, whatever it is,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.315
even a woman 3 o'clock in the morning

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:58.720
falling in her home and needs
someone to help her.

00:05:58.744 --> 00:06:01.084
Three minutes, we'll have
a guy with his pajamas

00:06:01.108 --> 00:06:04.733
running to her house
and helping her get up.

00:06:04.757 --> 00:06:07.805
The reasons why we're so successful
are because of three things.

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:09.627
Thousands of passionate volunteers

00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:11.347
who will leave everything they do

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.258
and run to help people
they don't even know.

00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:16.601
We're not there to replace ambulances.

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.205
We're just there

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:24.255
to get the gap between the ambulance
call until they arrive.

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:29.142
And we save people that otherwise
would not be saved.

00:06:29.166 --> 00:06:32.501
The second reason
is because of our technology.

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.525
You know, Israelis are good in technology.

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:37.758
Every one of us has on his phone,
no matter what kind of phone,

00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:40.834
a GPS technology done by NowForce,

00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:42.281
and whenever a call comes in,

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:44.456
the closest five volunteers get the call,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.354
and they actually get there really quick,

00:06:47.378 --> 00:06:51.078
and navigated by a traffic navigator
to get there and not waste time.

00:06:51.102 --> 00:06:53.277
And this is a great technology
we use all over the country

00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:54.867
and reduce the response time.

00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:57.003
And the third thing are these ambucycles.

00:06:57.027 --> 00:07:00.312
These ambucycles
are an ambulance on two wheels.

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:02.622
We don't transfer people,
but we stabilize them,

00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:03.863
and we save their lives.

00:07:03.887 --> 00:07:07.030
They never get stuck in traffic.
They could even go on a sidewalk.

00:07:07.054 --> 00:07:09.395
They never, literally,
get stuck in traffic.

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.200
That's why we get there so fast.

00:07:11.224 --> 00:07:13.682
A few years after I started
this organization,

00:07:13.706 --> 00:07:15.427
in a Jewish community,

00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:18.230
two Muslims from east
Jerusalem called me up.

00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:20.928
They ask me to meet. They
wanted to meet with me.

00:07:20.952 --> 00:07:23.419
Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.396
When Muhammad told me his personal story,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.251
how his father, 55 years
old, collapsed at home,

00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:29.507
had a cardiac arrest,

00:07:29.531 --> 00:07:31.927
and it took over an hour
for an ambulance arrive,

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.190
and he saw his father die
in front of his eyes,

00:07:34.214 --> 00:07:36.985
he asked me, "Please start
this in east Jerusalem."

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:40.810
I said to myself, I saw so
much tragedy, so much hate,

00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:44.094
and it's not about saving Jews.
It's not about saving Muslims.

00:07:44.118 --> 00:07:47.666
It's not about saving Christians.
It's about saving people.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.079
So I went ahead, full force --

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:54.670
(Applause) —

00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:58.337
and I started United
Hatzalah in east Jerusalem,

00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:00.156
and that's why the names United

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.236
and Hatzalah match so well.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.088
We started hand in hand
saving Jews and Arabs.

00:08:06.112 --> 00:08:08.351
Arabs were saving Jews.
Jews were saving Arabs.

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:10.352
Something special happened.

00:08:10.376 --> 00:08:13.017
Arabs and Jews, they don't
always get along together,

00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:14.327
but here in this situation,

00:08:14.351 --> 00:08:16.120
the communities, literally,

00:08:16.144 --> 00:08:18.287
it's an unbelievable
situation that happened,

00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:20.881
the diversities, all of a sudden
they had a common interest:

00:08:20.905 --> 00:08:22.323
Let's save lives together.

00:08:22.347 --> 00:08:25.109
Settlers were saving Arabs
and Arabs were saving settlers.

00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:27.229
It's an unbelievable
concept that could work

00:08:27.253 --> 00:08:29.984
only when you have such a great cause.

00:08:30.008 --> 00:08:31.857
And these are all volunteers.

00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:32.976
No one is getting money.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.852
They're all doing it
for the purpose of saving lives.

00:08:36.876 --> 00:08:39.137
When my own father
collapsed a few years ago

00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:41.542
from a cardiac arrest,
one of the first volunteers

00:08:41.566 --> 00:08:43.307
to arrive to save my father

00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:45.903
was one of these Muslim
volunteers from east Jerusalem

00:08:45.927 --> 00:08:49.448
who was in the first
course to join Hatzalah.

00:08:49.472 --> 00:08:50.525
And he saved my father.

00:08:50.549 --> 00:08:55.032
Could you imagine
how I felt in that moment?

00:08:55.056 --> 00:08:58.141
When I started this organization,
I was 17 years old.

00:08:58.165 --> 00:09:01.551
I never imagined that one day
I'd be speaking at TEDMED.

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:03.433
I never even knew what TEDMED was then.

00:09:03.457 --> 00:09:06.577
I don't think it existed,
but I never imagined,

00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:08.982
I never imagined that it's going
to go all around,

00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:10.064
it's going to spread around,

00:09:10.088 --> 00:09:13.132
and this last year we started
in Panama and Brazil.

00:09:13.156 --> 00:09:16.514
All I need is a partner
who is a little meshugenah like me,

00:09:16.538 --> 00:09:19.904
passionate about saving
lives, and willing to do it.

00:09:19.928 --> 00:09:23.413
And I'm actually starting
it in India very soon

00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:27.066
with a friend who I met
in Harvard just a while back.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.934
Hatzalah actually started
in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew

00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.212
years before us in Williamsburg,

00:09:33.236 --> 00:09:35.935
and now it's all over the Jewish
community in New York,

00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:39.195
even Australia and Mexico
and many other Jewish communities.

00:09:39.219 --> 00:09:40.789
But it could spread everywhere.

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:43.345
It's very easy to adopt.

00:09:43.369 --> 00:09:45.621
You even saw these volunteers in New York

00:09:45.645 --> 00:09:48.737
saving lives in the World Trade Center.

00:09:48.761 --> 00:09:52.282
Last year alone, we treated
in Israel 207,000 people.

00:09:52.306 --> 00:09:57.005
Forty-two thousand of them were
life-threatening situations.

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:59.182
And we made a difference.

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:01.930
I guess you could call this
a lifesaving flash mob,

00:10:01.954 --> 00:10:04.353
and it works.

00:10:04.377 --> 00:10:06.800
When I look all around here,

00:10:06.824 --> 00:10:10.191
I see lots of people
who would go an extra mile,

00:10:10.215 --> 00:10:12.912
run an extra mile to save other people,

00:10:12.936 --> 00:10:15.649
no matter who they are,
no matter what religion,

00:10:15.673 --> 00:10:18.565
no matter who, where they come from.

00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:20.350
We all want to be heroes.

00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:23.736
We just need a good idea, motivation

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.571
and lots of chutzpah,

00:10:25.595 --> 00:10:27.736
and we could save millions of people

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.908
that otherwise would not be saved.

00:10:29.932 --> 00:10:31.593
Thank you very much.

00:10:31.617 --> 00:10:36.587
