00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:18.923
I'd like to start my performance by saying
90 percent of everything is crap.

00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:20.149
(Laughter)

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:22.426
It's called Sturgeon's law,
and what that means

00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:27.264
is that the majority of anything
is always bad.

00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:31.226
I have a giraffe here.

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:33.510
I'm going to throw the giraffe
behind my back

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.714
and whoever catches it is going
to help me on this next thing.

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:41.655
Sir, you caught the giraffe.

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:43.961
I have a playing card in my hand.

00:00:44.806 --> 00:00:48.776
Freely name any card in the deck.

00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:51.229
Audience member: 10 of hearts.

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:52.916
Helder GuimarÃ£es: 10 of hearts.

00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:55.019
You could have named any card in the deck,

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.295
but you said the 10 of hearts.

00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:59.830
Ninety percent of everything is crap,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.703
so there's this to prove that
Sturgeon was correct.

00:01:03.703 --> 00:01:05.218
(Laughter)

00:01:05.218 --> 00:01:09.011
(Applause)

00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:12.804
(Laughter)

00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:16.597
Sir, this is not your show.

00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:20.933
(Laughter)

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.452
Keep the giraffe for a moment, okay?

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:26.793
Jesus.

00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:28.884
(Laughter)

00:01:28.884 --> 00:01:30.636
Crazy people.

00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:34.015
Well, the truth is,

00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:38.828
why is the majority of everything bad?

00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:43.011
And my answer is: I think we stop
thinking too soon.

00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:45.031
I'll give you a clear little example,

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:49.164
something that people used to do
around the turn of the century --

00:01:49.164 --> 00:01:51.570
not this century, the other one.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.574
The idea was to take a piece of paper

00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:59.802
and fold it inside out
using only your weaker hand,

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:01.657
in my case, the left hand.

00:02:01.657 --> 00:02:06.113
Something that would look like this.

00:02:13.858 --> 00:02:17.467
By the way you reacted, I can see
your lack of interest.

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.105
(Laughter)

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:21.116
But that's okay, I understand why.

00:02:21.116 --> 00:02:22.792
We stop thinking too soon.

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:24.928
But if we give it
a little bit more thought,

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:26.296
like a paper clip.

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:31.876
A paper clip makes this a little bit
more interesting.

00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:34.867
Not only that, if instead of using
my hand with the fingers,

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:36.945
I use my hand closed into a fist,

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:40.319
that makes this even a little
bit more interesting.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.210
Not only that, but I will impose myself
a time limit of one second,

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.240
something that would look like this.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.231
Now -- no, no, no.

00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:57.698
Sturgeon may be correct.

00:02:57.698 --> 00:02:59.996
But he doesn't have to be correct forever.

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:01.214
Things can always change.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:03.291
Sir, what was the card?

00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:05.410
The 10 of hearts?

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.573
There's this to prove that things
can always change --

00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:12.839
the 10 of hearts.

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.998
(Applause)

00:03:15.998 --> 00:03:19.264
Secrets are important.

00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:22.406
And secrets are valuable.

00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:26.890
And this is the best secret
I've ever experienced.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.981
It starts with a deck of cards
onto the table,

00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:33.139
an old man and a claim,

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.340
"I will not touch the deck till the end."

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.028
It doesn't matter who the man was,

00:03:39.028 --> 00:03:44.563
all that matters was that sentence
ringing in my head:

00:03:44.642 --> 00:03:48.476
"I will not touch the deck till the end."

00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:50.111
Now, during all this time,

00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:52.451
he was holding a small notebook

00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:55.262
that sometimes he would open
and flip through the pages

00:03:55.262 --> 00:03:56.865
and look at something.

00:03:56.865 --> 00:04:00.489
But I was not really
paying attention to the book

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.076
because I was paying attention the deck
and the claim he had made before,

00:04:05.076 --> 00:04:08.520
"I will not touch the deck till the end."

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.215
Now sir, you have the giraffe.

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:11.905
Go ahead, throw it in any direction

00:04:11.905 --> 00:04:14.122
so that you can find
someone else at random.

00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:19.157
Perfect. Sir, you're going to play
my role in this story.

00:04:19.157 --> 00:04:21.281
The old man turned to me and he said,

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.678
"You could pick a red card
or a black card."

00:04:23.678 --> 00:04:25.069
My answer was ...

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:26.719
Audience member 2: The black card.

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:28.030
HG: Indeed!

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.638
It was a black card.

00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:32.707
He said, "It could be a club or a spade,"

00:04:32.707 --> 00:04:34.460
and my answer was ...

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.067
Audience member 2: Spade.

00:04:36.384 --> 00:04:39.819
HG: Indeed! It was a spade.

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.954
He said, "It could be a high spade
or a low spade."

00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:44.819
And my answer was ...

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.517
Audience member 2: A high spade.

00:04:46.517 --> 00:04:49.197
HG: Indeed! It was a high spade.

00:04:49.197 --> 00:04:51.650
Since it's a high spade,
it could be a nine, a 10,

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.573
a jack, king, queen or the ace of spades.

00:04:54.573 --> 00:04:56.418
And my answer was ...

00:04:56.418 --> 00:04:58.159
Audience member 2: The king.

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.211
HG: The king of spades, indeed.

00:05:02.275 --> 00:05:03.417
Now sir, let's be fair.

00:05:03.417 --> 00:05:06.421
You selected black, you selected spade,

00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:09.011
you selected the high spade,
and you selected -- sorry?

00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:11.130
Audience member 2: King.
HG: King of spades.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.334
Did you feel I influenced you
in any decision?

00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:16.050
Audience member 2: No, I just felt
your energy.

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:17.931
HG: But it was a free choice, correct?

00:05:17.931 --> 00:05:20.094
Because if not, we could start
all over again.

00:05:20.094 --> 00:05:22.639
But it was really fair?
Audience member 2: Absolutely.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.958
HG: Now, the old man turned to me
and he asked me one more question,

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.024
a number between one and 52.

00:05:29.024 --> 00:05:31.479
And the first number I thought of was ...

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.841
Audience member 2: 17.

00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:36.918
HG: Indeed! It was the 17.

00:05:36.918 --> 00:05:39.977
The old man only said one more thing:

00:05:39.977 --> 00:05:42.796
"This is the end."

00:05:42.796 --> 00:05:46.984
And I knew exactly what that meant.

00:05:46.984 --> 00:05:49.621
I knew that he was going
to touch the deck.

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:57.177
Everything that you're about to see
is exactly as it looked.

00:05:57.177 --> 00:06:00.748
He took the deck out of the box.

00:06:00.748 --> 00:06:02.597
Nothing in the box.

00:06:03.726 --> 00:06:13.050
He counted, "One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10."

00:06:13.827 --> 00:06:15.716
The tension was building.

00:06:16.092 --> 00:06:18.986
(Laughter)

00:06:19.758 --> 00:06:28.140
"11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17."

00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:33.556
And on the 17, instead of
the king of spades,

00:06:33.556 --> 00:06:37.607
something appeared
in the middle of the deck,

00:06:37.607 --> 00:06:42.362
that later, I would realize
was actually a secret.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.743
The old man stood up, he left.

00:06:46.743 --> 00:06:48.103
I never saw him again.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.462
But he left his notebook

00:06:52.462 --> 00:06:54.373
that was there from the beginning.

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:57.566
And when I picked it up,

00:06:57.566 --> 00:07:03.150
that was the best secret
I've ever experienced.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.401
We are defined by the secrets we keep

00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:10.552
and by the secrets we share.

00:07:10.552 --> 00:07:15.417
And this was his way
of sharing a secret with me.

00:07:15.417 --> 00:07:20.070
(Applause)

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.398
Crazy shit! Now --

00:07:26.398 --> 00:07:28.746
(Laughter)

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:36.575
I believe that amazing things
happen all the time.

00:07:36.575 --> 00:07:38.242
I really do.

00:07:38.242 --> 00:07:41.420
And the reason why we don't see
them as often,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.366
it's because we don't
place ourselves in a position

00:07:44.366 --> 00:07:46.864
to search for those amazing things.

00:07:47.748 --> 00:07:52.502
But what if we decided to search
for those amazing things,

00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:58.160
for those small coincidences
in life that are truly amazing?

00:07:58.742 --> 00:08:00.355
So you have the giraffe,

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:04.836
go ahead, throw it in any direction
so you find one last person at random.

00:08:06.838 --> 00:08:09.861
Sir, I'm going to ask you,

00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:15.197
do you have, with you,
a United States $1 bill?

00:08:15.197 --> 00:08:16.835
Audience member 3: I think so.

00:08:16.835 --> 00:08:19.473
HG: Yes? You see, a coincidence!

00:08:19.473 --> 00:08:22.177
(Laughter)

00:08:22.177 --> 00:08:24.001
Let's make sure you have it.

00:08:24.001 --> 00:08:25.291
Do you have it?

00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:27.565
Audience member 3: Yes.
HG: Yes! Perfect.

00:08:27.565 --> 00:08:30.539
Now, I want you to do exactly the same
thing I am about to do.

00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:32.330
I have a dollar bill here to explain.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.069
I want you to take the dollar bill,

00:08:34.069 --> 00:08:37.599
and fold the Washington part
inside, like this.

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:40.579
So you get this kind of big square, okay?

00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:44.535
Now, I want you to take the bill
and fold it like this, lengthwise,

00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:46.054
so it becomes like a rectangle,

00:08:46.054 --> 00:08:48.573
and then again --
really fold it, really crease it --

00:08:48.573 --> 00:08:50.057
and when you have it,

00:08:50.057 --> 00:08:53.533
please fold the bill again
into a little square like this

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.861
and let me know when you have it.

00:08:56.708 --> 00:08:57.936
Do you have it? Perfect.

00:08:57.936 --> 00:09:00.301
Now, I'm going to approach,

00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:01.800
and before we start,

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.097
I want to make sure that we do this
in very, very serious conditions.

00:09:05.097 --> 00:09:10.692
First of all, I want to ensure that we
have a marker and we have a paper clip.

00:09:10.692 --> 00:09:14.149
First of all, take the marker
and go ahead and sign the bill.

00:09:14.149 --> 00:09:15.875
And this is the reason why:

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:18.506
later, I'm going to be doing
a bunch of stuff on stage

00:09:18.506 --> 00:09:20.024
and I don't want you to think,

00:09:20.024 --> 00:09:22.479
oh, while I was distracted by Helder,

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.558
someone came onstage and swapped the bill.

00:09:24.558 --> 00:09:27.033
So I want to make sure
it's exactly the same bill.

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:29.532
Now not only that, I want you
to take the paper clip

00:09:29.532 --> 00:09:31.732
and put it around the bill.

00:09:31.732 --> 00:09:34.338
So even if nobody comes onstage
and switches the bill,

00:09:34.338 --> 00:09:37.617
I don't have enough time
to go open the bill and close it

00:09:37.617 --> 00:09:39.256
and see what I don't want to see.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.441
Is that fair?

00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:42.228
Now you can give me the marker back.

00:09:42.228 --> 00:09:44.488
And just like that, very clearly,

00:09:44.488 --> 00:09:47.507
I want to make sure that
we place this in full view

00:09:47.507 --> 00:09:52.693
from the beginning of this experience

00:09:52.693 --> 00:09:55.174
and to make sure that everyone
is going to see it,

00:09:55.174 --> 00:09:58.939
we're going to actually have
a camera man onstage.

00:09:58.939 --> 00:10:01.249
Yes, perfect, so that you can see.

00:10:01.249 --> 00:10:03.539
That's your signature? Yes? Perfect.

00:10:03.579 --> 00:10:10.571
Now, we're going to use
also the deck and a glass for this.

00:10:11.151 --> 00:10:13.969
And we're going to put
ourselves in a position

00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:16.853
to search for an amazing coincidence.

00:10:16.853 --> 00:10:18.793
Do you mind, can you help me with this?

00:10:18.793 --> 00:10:21.447
Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle.

00:10:21.447 --> 00:10:23.993
And do you mind, can you
take some cards and shuffle?

00:10:23.993 --> 00:10:26.024
You can take some cards and shuffle.

00:10:26.024 --> 00:10:28.102
You can shuffle cards
in a variety of ways.

00:10:28.102 --> 00:10:29.634
You can shuffle cards like this.

00:10:29.634 --> 00:10:31.815
You can shuffle cards
in a more messed up way,

00:10:31.815 --> 00:10:32.870
something like this.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.913
You can shuffle cards in the American way.

00:10:34.913 --> 00:10:38.246
As a Portuguese, I don't feel entitled
to teach you guys how to do it.

00:10:38.246 --> 00:10:40.698
But the important part is
after shuffling the cards,

00:10:40.698 --> 00:10:42.951
always remember
to cut and complete the cards.

00:10:42.951 --> 00:10:44.663
Do you mind doing that for me, sir?

00:10:44.663 --> 00:10:45.859
Please cut and complete.

00:10:45.859 --> 00:10:48.521
And when you have it,
place the cards up in the air.

00:10:48.521 --> 00:10:50.760
And you too, cut and complete
and up in the air.

00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:52.025
Up in the air.

00:10:52.025 --> 00:10:56.403
A deck of cards cut and shuffled
by one, two, three, four and five people.

00:10:56.403 --> 00:11:00.964
Now, very clearly, I'm going
to gather the deck together.

00:11:02.494 --> 00:11:05.233
And just like that.

00:11:06.163 --> 00:11:12.345
I'm going to search for a coincidence
in front of everyone.

00:11:15.955 --> 00:11:17.478
I'm going to try.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.689
I have some cards that maybe,

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.972
maybe they don't mean anything.

00:11:32.904 --> 00:11:35.675
But maybe that's because
we are not paying close attention.

00:11:36.734 --> 00:11:40.317
Because maybe, maybe they mean a lot.

00:11:40.317 --> 00:11:43.766
Before we start,
sir, you gave me a dollar bill.

00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:45.649
Is that your signature?

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:47.069
Audience member 3: Yes it is.

00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:51.174
HG: I want you to see very clearly

00:11:51.174 --> 00:11:54.431
that I'm going to open your bill

00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:59.228
and reveal a small secret that we created.

00:11:59.228 --> 00:12:05.357
And the secret of this dollar bill
is the serial number.

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:08.280
Madam, can you take the dollar bill?

00:12:09.296 --> 00:12:11.242
In the serial number, there is a letter.

00:12:11.242 --> 00:12:14.485
What is the first number after the letter?

00:12:14.485 --> 00:12:15.985
Audience member 4: Seven.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.884
HG: Seven.

00:12:17.884 --> 00:12:19.286
Seven.

00:12:20.529 --> 00:12:23.509
But, that's maybe just one coincidence.

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:26.131
What is the second number?
Audience member 4: Nine.

00:12:26.131 --> 00:12:29.921
So after the seven, we have a nine.

00:12:31.155 --> 00:12:32.506
And after the nine?

00:12:32.506 --> 00:12:33.613
Audience member 4: Two.

00:12:33.613 --> 00:12:35.633
HG: The two. And after the two?

00:12:35.633 --> 00:12:36.875
Audience member 4: Three.

00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:38.518
HG: Three, and after?

00:12:38.518 --> 00:12:40.484
Audience member 4: Three.
HG: Three.

00:12:40.484 --> 00:12:42.540
Audience member 4: Seven.
HG: Seven.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.274
Audience member 4: Four.
HG: Four.

00:12:44.274 --> 00:12:46.788
Audience member 4: Two.
HG: Two, and?

00:12:46.788 --> 00:12:48.718
Audience member 4: Q.

00:12:48.718 --> 00:12:52.590
HG: Q like in queen?

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.280
(Applause)

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.590
The queen of clubs!

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.420
All the cards in order, just for you.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.716
And that's my show.

00:13:00.716 --> 00:13:03.623
Thank you very much and have a nice night.

00:13:03.623 --> 00:13:10.219
(Applause)
