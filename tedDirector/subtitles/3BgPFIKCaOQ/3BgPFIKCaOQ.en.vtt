00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:14.631
I'm an industrial engineer.

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:17.428
The goal in my life has always been to make

00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:18.900
more and more products

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.410
in the least amount of time and resources.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.910
While working at Toyota,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.875
all I knew was how to make cars

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:27.328
until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki,

00:00:27.328 --> 00:00:30.511
who came to our factory to make a forest in it

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:33.346
in order to make it carbon-neutral.

00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:35.220
I was so fascinated

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.666
that I decided to learn this methodology

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.557
by joining his team as a volunteer.

00:00:40.557 --> 00:00:42.379
Soon, I started making a forest

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.843
in the backyard of my own house,

00:00:44.843 --> 00:00:48.776
and this is how it looks after three years.

00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:49.910
These forests,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.960
compared to a conventional plantation,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.382
grow 10 times faster,

00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:56.969
they're 30 times more dense,

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.940
and 100 times more biodiverse.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.800
Within two years of having this forest in our backyard,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.744
I could observe that the groundwater

00:01:05.744 --> 00:01:07.623
didn't dry during summers,

00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:10.480
the number of bird species I spotted in this area

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.650
doubled.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.026
Quality of air became better,

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:15.587
and we started harvesting seasonal fruits

00:01:15.587 --> 00:01:17.319
growing effortlessly

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.930
right in the backyard of our house.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.247
I wanted to make more of these forests.

00:01:22.247 --> 00:01:23.665
I was so moved by these results

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:25.689
that I wanted to make these forests

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.479
with the same acumen with which we make cars

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.899
or write software or do any mainstream business,

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.743
so I founded a company

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:35.590
which is an end-to-end service provider

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.935
to create these native natural forests.

00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:42.130
But to make afforestation as a mainstream business

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.289
or an industry, we had to standardize

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.202
the process of forest-making.

00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:48.902
So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System

00:01:48.902 --> 00:01:51.916
known for its quality and efficiency

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:53.849
for the process of forest-making.

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:56.411
For an example, the core of TPS,

00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:59.751
Toyota Production System, lies in heijunka,

00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:01.341
which is making manufacturing

00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:03.790
of different models of cars

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.881
on a single assembly line.

00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:08.727
We replaced these cars with trees,

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:11.650
using which now we can make multi-layered forests.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.218
These forests utilize 100 percent vertical space.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:15.967
They are so dense

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:19.516
that one can't even walk into them.

00:02:19.516 --> 00:02:22.750
For an example, we can make a 300-tree forest

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.204
in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars.

00:02:27.204 --> 00:02:31.284
In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint,

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.279
we started utilizing local biomass

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.046
as soil amender and fertilizers.

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:38.814
For example, coconut shells crushed in a machine

00:02:38.814 --> 00:02:42.437
mixed with rice straw,

00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:46.040
powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.321
is finally dumped in soil on which

00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:49.658
our forest is planted.

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:52.887
Once planted, we use grass or rice straw

00:02:52.887 --> 00:02:54.619
to cover the soil

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.173
so that all the water which goes into irrigation

00:02:57.173 --> 00:02:59.866
doesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere.

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:01.796
And using these simple improvisations,

00:03:01.796 --> 00:03:03.495
today we can make a forest

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:07.361
for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone.

00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.814
Today, we are making forests in houses,

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:13.882
in schools, even in factories with the corporates.

00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:15.860
But that's not enough.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.812
There is a huge number of people

00:03:17.812 --> 00:03:20.681
who want to take matters into their own hands.

00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:22.545
So we let it happen.

00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:26.785
Today, we are working on an Internet-based platform

00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:29.362
where we are going to share our methodology

00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:31.319
on an open source

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.770
using which anyone and everyone

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.280
can make their own forest

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.802
without our physical presence being there,

00:03:36.802 --> 00:03:38.755
using our methodology.

00:03:38.755 --> 00:03:40.010
At the click of a button,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.560
they can get to know all the native species

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.778
of their place.

00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:47.596
By installing a small hardware probe on site,

00:03:47.596 --> 00:03:50.296
we can do remote soil testing,

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:54.101
using which we can give step-by-step instructions

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:57.005
on forest-making remotely.

00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.917
Also we can monitor the growth of this forest

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:03.566
without being on site.

00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:05.117
This methodology, I believe,

00:04:05.117 --> 00:04:06.862
has a potential.

00:04:06.862 --> 00:04:09.695
By sharing, we can actually
bring back our native forests.

00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:11.342
Now, when you go back home,

00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:13.045
if you see a barren piece of land,

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:16.638
do remember that it can be a potential forest.

00:04:16.638 --> 00:04:18.828
Thank you very much. Thanks.

00:04:18.828 --> 00:04:21.196
(Applause)
