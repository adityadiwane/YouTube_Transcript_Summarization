00:00:12.973 --> 00:00:15.209
While preparing for my talk

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.263
I was reflecting on my life
and trying to figure out

00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:24.187
where exactly was that moment
when my journey began.

00:00:24.187 --> 00:00:26.834
A long time passed by,
and I simply couldn't figure out

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:29.806
the beginning or the middle
or the end of my story.

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:31.757
I always used to think that my beginning

00:00:31.757 --> 00:00:35.867
was one afternoon in my community
when my mother had told me

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:39.308
that I had escaped three
arranged marriages by the time I was two.

00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:44.713
Or one evening when electricity had failed
for eight hours in our community,

00:00:44.713 --> 00:00:46.965
and my dad sat, surrounded by all of us,

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:50.866
telling us stories of when he was
a little kid struggling to go to school

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:54.974
while his father, who was a farmer,
wanted him to work in the fields with him.

00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:57.722
Or that dark night when I was 16

00:00:57.722 --> 00:01:02.139
when three little kids had come to me
and they whispered in my ear

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:06.416
that my friend was murdered
in something called the honor killings.

00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:10.231
But then I realized that,

00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:13.948
as much as I know that these moments
have contributed on my journey,

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:15.548
they have influenced my journey

00:01:15.548 --> 00:01:17.707
but they have not been
the beginning of it,

00:01:17.707 --> 00:01:22.003
but the true beginning of my journey
was in front of a mud house

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:24.626
in upper Sindh of Pakistan,

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:27.482
where my father held the hand
of my 14-year-old mother

00:01:27.482 --> 00:01:29.502
and they decided
to walk out of the village

00:01:29.502 --> 00:01:32.962
to go to a town where they could
send their kids to school.

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:35.168
In a way, I feel like my life

00:01:35.168 --> 00:01:40.903
is kind of a result of some wise choices
and decisions they've made.

00:01:40.903 --> 00:01:43.759
And just like that,
another of their decisions

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.986
was to keep me and my siblings
connected to our roots.

00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:51.235
While we were living in a community
I fondly remember as called Ribabad,

00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:53.464
which means community of the poor,

00:01:53.464 --> 00:01:57.156
my dad made sure that we also
had a house in our rural homeland.

00:01:57.156 --> 00:02:00.780
I come from an indigenous tribe
in the mountains of Balochistan

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.520
called Brahui.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.688
Brahui, or Brohi, means mountain dweller,
and it is also my language.

00:02:07.688 --> 00:02:11.924
Thanks to my father's very strict rules
about connecting to our customs,

00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:17.655
I had to live a beautiful life of songs, 
cultures, traditions, stories, mountains,

00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:19.046
and a lot of sheep.

00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:22.365
But then, living in two extremes

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:26.394
between the traditions 
of my culture, of my village,

00:02:26.394 --> 00:02:29.745
and then modern education
in my school wasn't easy.

00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:34.249
I was aware that I was the only girl
who got to have such freedom,

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.293
and I was guilty of it.

00:02:36.293 --> 00:02:40.255
While going to school
in Karachi and Hyderabad,

00:02:40.255 --> 00:02:44.196
a lot of my cousins and childhood friends
were getting married off,

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:46.950
some to older men, some in exchange,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.249
some even as second wives.

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:54.558
I got to see the beautiful tradition
and its magic fade in front of me

00:02:54.558 --> 00:02:59.892
when I saw that the birth of a girl child
was celebrated with sadness,

00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:04.659
when women were told
to have patience as their main virtue.

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.640
Up until I was 16,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.448
I healed my sadness by crying,

00:03:09.448 --> 00:03:11.634
mostly at nights 
when everyone would sleep

00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:13.950
and I would sob in my pillow,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.297
until that one night 
when I found out my friend was killed

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.471
in the name of honor.

00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:23.218
Honor killings is a custom

00:03:23.218 --> 00:03:26.116
where men and women
are suspected of having relationships

00:03:26.116 --> 00:03:27.811
before or outside of the marriage,

00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:29.990
and they're killed by their family for it.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.375
Usually the killer is the brother
or father or the uncle in the family.

00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:39.007
The U.N. reports there are about 1,000
honor murders every year in Pakistan,

00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:41.445
and these are only the reported cases.

00:03:41.445 --> 00:03:45.183
A custom that kills
did not make any sense to me,

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.761
and I knew I had to do
something about it this time.

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:50.152
I was not going to cry myself to sleep.

00:03:50.152 --> 00:03:52.660
I was going to do something,
anything, to stop it.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.726
I was 16 -- I started writing poetry

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:57.954
and going door to door
telling everybody about honor killings

00:03:57.954 --> 00:04:00.149
and why it happens,
why it should be stopped,

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:01.585
and raising awareness about it

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:06.162
until I actually found a much, much 
better way to handle this issue.

00:04:06.841 --> 00:04:13.002
In those days, we were living in
a very small, one-roomed house in Karachi.

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:17.529
Every year, during the monsoon seasons,
our house would flood up with water --

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.236
rainwater and sewage --

00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:22.368
and my mom and dad
would be taking the water out.

00:04:22.368 --> 00:04:27.467
In those days, my dad brought home
a huge machine, a computer.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:32.364
It was so big it looked as if it was going
to take up half of the only room we had,

00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:35.864
and had so many pieces and wires
that needed to be connected.

00:04:35.864 --> 00:04:37.954
But it was still the most exciting thing

00:04:37.954 --> 00:04:40.740
that has ever happened
to me and my sisters.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.850
My oldest brother Ali got to be in charge
of taking care of the computer,

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.785
and all of us were given
10 to 15 minutes every day to use it.

00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:51.850
Being the oldest of eight kids,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.335
I got to use it the last,

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:57.074
and that was after
I had washed the dishes,

00:04:57.074 --> 00:04:59.837
cleaned the house,
made dinner with my mom,

00:04:59.837 --> 00:05:02.529
and put blankets on the floor
for everyone to sleep,

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:04.712
and after that, 
I would run to the computer,

00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:06.269
connect it to the Internet,

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:12.288
and have pure joy and wonder
for 10 to 15 minutes.

00:05:12.288 --> 00:05:16.694
In those days, I had discovered
a website called Joogle.

00:05:16.694 --> 00:05:19.760
[Google] (Laughter)

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.474
In my frantic wish
to do something about this custom,

00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:26.982
I made use of Google
and discovered Facebook,

00:05:26.982 --> 00:05:31.137
a website where people can connect
to anyone around the world,

00:05:31.137 --> 00:05:35.618
and so, from my very tiny,
cement-roofed room in Karachi,

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:38.828
I connected with people in the U.K.,
the U.S., Australia and Canada,

00:05:38.828 --> 00:05:41.335
and created a campaign called

00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:44.228
WAKE UP Campaign
against Honor Killings.

00:05:44.228 --> 00:05:47.299
It became enormous
in just a few months.

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:49.851
I got a lot of support
from all around the world.

00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:51.312
Media was connecting to us.

00:05:51.312 --> 00:05:54.611
A lot of people were reaching out
trying to raise awareness with us.

00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:59.353
It became so big that it went from online
to the streets of my hometown,

00:05:59.353 --> 00:06:01.697
where we would do rallies and strikes

00:06:01.697 --> 00:06:05.169
trying to change the policies 
in Pakistan for women's support.

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.891
And while I thought
everything was perfect,

00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:12.768
my team -- which was basically
my friends and neighbors at that time --

00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:14.858
thought everything was going so well,

00:06:14.858 --> 00:06:19.259
we had no idea a big opposition
was coming to us.

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.174
My community stood up against us,

00:06:22.174 --> 00:06:25.891
saying we were spreading
un-Islamic behavior.

00:06:25.891 --> 00:06:30.601
We were challenging centuries-old
customs in those communities.

00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:33.679
I remember my father receiving
anonymous letters

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:36.615
saying, "Your daughter 
is spreading Western culture

00:06:36.615 --> 00:06:38.341
in the honorable societies."

00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:40.887
Our car was stoned at one point.

00:06:40.887 --> 00:06:44.787
One day I went to the office
and found our metal signboard

00:06:44.787 --> 00:06:49.589
wrinkled and broken as if a lot of people
had been hitting it with something heavy.

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:53.216
Things got so bad that I had
to hide myself in many ways.

00:06:53.216 --> 00:06:56.293
I would put up the windows of the car,

00:06:56.293 --> 00:07:00.225
veil my face, not speak
while I was in public,

00:07:00.225 --> 00:07:04.202
but eventually situations got worse
when my life was threatened,

00:07:04.202 --> 00:07:08.768
and I had to leave, back to Karachi,
and our actions stopped.

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:13.335
Back in Karachi, as an 18-year-old,

00:07:13.335 --> 00:07:18.101
I thought this was the biggest
failure of my entire life.

00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:20.011
I was devastated.

00:07:20.011 --> 00:07:23.656
As a teenager, I was blaming
myself for everything that happened.

00:07:23.656 --> 00:07:25.792
And it turns out,
when we started reflecting,

00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:31.666
we did realize that it was actually
me and my team's fault.

00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:36.821
There were two big reasons
why our campaign had failed big time.

00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:39.071
One of those, the first reason,

00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:41.700
is we were standing
against core values of people.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.412
We were saying no to something
that was very important to them,

00:07:46.412 --> 00:07:48.759
challenging their code of honor,

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:51.026
and hurting them deeply in the process.

00:07:51.026 --> 00:07:53.725
And number two, which was very
important for me to learn,

00:07:53.725 --> 00:07:55.930
and amazing, and surprising
for me to learn,

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.111
was that we were not including
the true heroes

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:01.317
who should be fighting for themselves.

00:08:01.317 --> 00:08:05.274
The women in the villages had no idea
we were fighting for them in the streets.

00:08:05.274 --> 00:08:06.711
Every time I would go back,

00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:09.718
I would find my cousins and friends
with scarves on their faces,

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:11.512
and I would ask, "What happened?"

00:08:11.512 --> 00:08:13.902
And they'd be like, 
"Our husbands beat us."

00:08:13.902 --> 00:08:16.781
But we are working in the streets for you!

00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:18.383
We are changing the policies.

00:08:18.383 --> 00:08:21.355
How is that not impacting their life?

00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:26.206
So then we found out something
which was very amazing for us.

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:28.856
The policies of a country

00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:33.467
do not necessarily always affect
the tribal and rural communities.

00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:37.771
It was devastating -- like, oh,
we can't actually do something about this?

00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:40.813
And we found out there's a huge gap

00:08:40.813 --> 00:08:44.649
when it comes to official policies
and the real truth on the ground.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:47.961
So this time, we were like,
we are going to do something different.

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:49.710
We are going to use strategy,

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.699
and we are going to go back and apologize.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.350
Yes, apologize.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.863
We went back to the communities

00:08:55.863 --> 00:08:59.111
and we said we are 
very ashamed of what we did.

00:08:59.111 --> 00:09:03.681
We are here to apologize, and in fact,
we are here to make it up to you.

00:09:03.681 --> 00:09:05.251
How do we do that?

00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:08.217
We are going to promote
three of your main cultures.

00:09:08.217 --> 00:09:11.799
We know that it's music,
language, and embroidery.

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:13.325
Nobody believed us.

00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:16.063
Nobody wanted to work with us.

00:09:16.063 --> 00:09:19.618
It took a lot of convincing
and discussions with these communities

00:09:19.618 --> 00:09:23.310
until they agreed that we are going
to promote their language

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.972
by making a booklet of their stories,
fables and old tales in the tribe,

00:09:27.972 --> 00:09:30.544
and we would promote their music

00:09:30.544 --> 00:09:36.055
by making a CD of the songs
from the tribe, and some drumbeating.

00:09:36.055 --> 00:09:38.216
And the third, which was my favorite,

00:09:38.216 --> 00:09:42.227
was we would promote their embroidery
by making a center in the village

00:09:42.227 --> 00:09:45.362
where women would come every day
to make embroidery.

00:09:46.064 --> 00:09:48.038
And so it began.

00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:52.040
We worked with one village,
and we started our first center.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.268
It was a beautiful day.

00:09:54.268 --> 00:09:55.372
We started the center.

00:09:55.372 --> 00:09:57.441
Women were coming to make embroidery,

00:09:57.441 --> 00:10:01.185
and going through a life-changing
process of education,

00:10:01.185 --> 00:10:04.235
learning about their rights,
what Islam says about their rights,

00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:07.054
and enterprise development,
how they can create money,

00:10:07.054 --> 00:10:09.306
and then how they can create
money from money,

00:10:09.306 --> 00:10:13.184
how they can fight the customs
that have been destroying their lives

00:10:13.184 --> 00:10:14.902
from so many centuries,

00:10:14.902 --> 00:10:16.758
because in Islam, in reality,

00:10:16.758 --> 00:10:20.373
women are supposed to be
shoulder to shoulder with men.

00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:24.125
Women have so much status
that we have not been hearing,

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:25.938
that they have not been hearing,

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:28.956
and we needed to tell them
that they need to know

00:10:28.956 --> 00:10:31.696
where their rights are
and how to take them by themselves,

00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:34.021
because they can do it and we can't.

00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:36.993
So this was the model which actually
came out -- very amazing.

00:10:36.993 --> 00:10:39.526
Through embroidery
we were promoting their traditions.

00:10:39.526 --> 00:10:42.237
We went into the village.
We would mobilize the community.

00:10:42.237 --> 00:10:45.257
We would make a center inside
where 30 women will come

00:10:45.257 --> 00:10:49.365
for six months to learn about
value addition of traditional embroidery,

00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:53.104
enterprise development,
life skills and basic education,

00:10:53.104 --> 00:10:56.215
and about their rights
and how to say no to those customs

00:10:56.215 --> 00:10:59.886
and how to stand as leaders
for themselves and the society.

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:04.698
After six months, we would connect
these women to loans and to markets

00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:08.608
where they can become
local entrepreneurs in their communities.

00:11:08.608 --> 00:11:11.865
We soon called this project Sughar.

00:11:11.865 --> 00:11:15.905
Sughar is a local word used
in many, many languages in Pakistan.

00:11:15.905 --> 00:11:19.341
It means skilled and confident women.

00:11:19.341 --> 00:11:24.449
I truly believe, to create women leaders,
there's only one thing you have to do:

00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:28.631
Just let them know that they have
what it takes to be a leader.

00:11:28.631 --> 00:11:30.130
These women you see here,

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:34.573
they have strong skills
and potential to be leaders.

00:11:34.573 --> 00:11:37.615
All we had to do was remove
the barriers that surrounded them,

00:11:37.615 --> 00:11:40.154
and that's what we decided to do.

00:11:40.154 --> 00:11:43.443
But then while we were thinking
everything was going well,

00:11:43.443 --> 00:11:46.043
once again everything was fantastic,

00:11:46.043 --> 00:11:48.110
we found our next setback:

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.279
A lot of men started seeing
the visible changes in their wife.

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:53.420
She's speaking more,
she's making decisions --

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.109
oh my gosh, she's handling 
everything in the house.

00:11:56.109 --> 00:12:00.578
They stopped them
from coming to the centers,

00:12:00.578 --> 00:12:04.622
and this time, we were like,
okay, time for strategy two.

00:12:04.622 --> 00:12:06.710
We went to the fashion 
industry in Pakistan

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.493
and decided to do research
about what happens there.

00:12:10.493 --> 00:12:15.480
Turns out the fashion industry in Pakistan
is very strong and growing day by day,

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.046
but there is less contribution
from the tribal areas

00:12:19.046 --> 00:12:22.121
and to the tribal areas, especially women.

00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:26.555
So we decided to launch our first ever
tribal women's very own fashion brand,

00:12:26.555 --> 00:12:29.185
which is now called Nomads.

00:12:30.085 --> 00:12:32.267
And so women started earning more,

00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:35.073
they started contributing more
financially to the house,

00:12:35.073 --> 00:12:38.304
and men had to think again
before saying no to them

00:12:38.304 --> 00:12:40.363
when they were coming to the centers.

00:12:43.343 --> 00:12:46.106
(Applause)

00:12:46.106 --> 00:12:48.265
Thank you, thank you.

00:12:48.265 --> 00:12:53.442
In 2013, we launched our first
Sughar Hub instead of a center.

00:12:53.442 --> 00:12:55.602
We partnered with TripAdvisor

00:12:55.602 --> 00:12:59.514
and created a cement hall
in the middle of a village

00:12:59.514 --> 00:13:03.752
and invited so many other organizations
to work over there.

00:13:03.752 --> 00:13:05.847
We created this platform
for the nonprofits

00:13:05.847 --> 00:13:08.170
so they can touch and work
on the other issues

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.395
that Sughar is not working on,

00:13:10.395 --> 00:13:14.259
which would be an easy place 
for them to give trainings,

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:16.874
use it as a farmer school,
even as a marketplace,

00:13:16.874 --> 00:13:19.146
and anything they want to use it for,

00:13:19.146 --> 00:13:21.259
and they have been doing really amazingly.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:24.789
And so far, we have been able
to support 900 women

00:13:24.789 --> 00:13:28.039
in 24 villages around Pakistan.

00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:32.544
(Applause)

00:13:33.624 --> 00:13:36.568
But that's actually not what I want.

00:13:38.758 --> 00:13:43.410
My dream is to reach out
to one million women in the next 10 years,

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.059
and to make sure that happens,

00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:48.047
this year we launched
Sughar Foundation in the U.S.

00:13:48.047 --> 00:13:52.811
It is not just going to fund Sughar
but many other organizations in Pakistan

00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:55.020
to replicate the idea

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.760
and to find even more innovative ways

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.591
to unleash the rural women's
potential in Pakistan.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.564
Thank you so much.

00:14:03.564 --> 00:14:06.606
(Applause)

00:14:06.606 --> 00:14:09.336
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:14:11.056 --> 00:14:14.359
Chris Anderson: Khalida, you are
quite the force of nature.

00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:18.982
I mean, this story, in many ways,
just seems beyond belief.

00:14:18.982 --> 00:14:23.042
It's incredible that someone
so young could do achieve this much

00:14:23.042 --> 00:14:25.900
through so much force and ingenuity.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.470
So I guess one question:

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:32.181
This is a spectacular dream to reach out
and empower a million women --

00:14:32.181 --> 00:14:35.975
how much of the current 
success depends on you,

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:40.208
the force of this magnetic personality?

00:14:40.218 --> 00:14:42.848
How does it scale?

00:14:42.858 --> 00:14:47.344
Khalida Brohi: I think my job
is to give the inspiration out,

00:14:47.344 --> 00:14:49.065
give my dream out.

00:14:49.065 --> 00:14:52.487
I can't teach how to do it, because
there are so many different ways.

00:14:52.487 --> 00:14:54.792
We have been experimenting
with three ways only.

00:14:54.792 --> 00:14:58.385
There are a hundred different ways
to unleash potential in women.

00:14:58.385 --> 00:15:01.033
I would just give the inspiration
and that's my job.

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:03.507
I will keep doing it.
Sughar will still be growing.

00:15:03.507 --> 00:15:06.595
We are planning to reach out
to two more villages,

00:15:06.595 --> 00:15:09.575
and soon I believe 
we will be scaling out of Pakistan

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.361
into South Asia and beyond.

00:15:12.361 --> 00:15:15.914
CA: I love that when you talked
about your team in the talk,

00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:18.096
I mean, you were all 18 at the time.

00:15:18.096 --> 00:15:19.861
What did this team look like?

00:15:19.861 --> 00:15:21.509
This was school friends, right?

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:26.478
KB: Do people here
believe that I'm at an age

00:15:26.478 --> 00:15:29.522
where I'm supposed
to be a grandmother in my village?

00:15:29.522 --> 00:15:35.412
My mom was married at nine,
and I am the oldest woman not married

00:15:35.412 --> 00:15:38.988
and not doing anything
in my life in my village.

00:15:38.988 --> 00:15:42.285
CA: Wait, wait, wait, not doing anything?

00:15:42.285 --> 00:15:44.653
KB: No.
CA: You're right.

00:15:44.653 --> 00:15:47.556
KB: People feel sorry for me,
a lot of times.

00:15:47.556 --> 00:15:51.480
CA: But how much time are you spending
now actually back in Balochistan?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.367
KB: I live over there.

00:15:53.367 --> 00:15:56.199
We live between, still,
Karachi and Balochistan.

00:15:56.199 --> 00:15:58.983
My siblings are all going to school.

00:15:58.983 --> 00:16:01.424
I am still the oldest of eight siblings.

00:16:01.424 --> 00:16:05.784
CA: But what you're doing is definitely
threatening to some people there.

00:16:05.784 --> 00:16:10.140
How do you handle safety?
Do you feel safe?

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.265
Are there issues there?

00:16:12.265 --> 00:16:16.075
KB: This question has come to me
a lot of times before,

00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:22.390
and I feel like the word "fear"
just comes to me and then drops,

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:26.120
but there is one fear that I have
that is different from that.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.623
The fear is that if I get killed,
what would happen to the people

00:16:29.623 --> 00:16:31.608
who love me so much?

00:16:31.608 --> 00:16:35.840
My mom waits for me till late at night
that I should come home.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.585
My sisters want to learn so much from me,

00:16:38.585 --> 00:16:41.846
and there are many, many girls
in my community who want to talk to me

00:16:41.846 --> 00:16:44.119
and ask me different things,

00:16:44.119 --> 00:16:46.910
and I recently got engaged. (Laughs)

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.324
(Applause)

00:16:49.324 --> 00:16:52.552

KB: Escaping arranged marriages,
I chose my own husband

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.178
across the world in L.A.,
a really different world.

00:17:08.178 --> 00:17:11.444
I had to fight for a whole year.
That's totally a different story.

00:17:11.444 --> 00:17:16.189
But I think that's
the only thing that I'm afraid of,

00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:21.933

when she waits in the night.

to help you on their way,

00:17:24.404 --> 00:17:27.077
they can go on, they can maybe
buy some of these clothes

00:17:27.077 --> 00:17:29.649
that you're bringing over

00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:33.161

is done back in Balochistan?

in the foundation.

KB: Definitely. We are looking
for as many people as we can,

00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:43.117
because now that the foundation's
in the beginning process,

00:17:43.117 --> 00:17:45.708
I am trying to learn a lot
about how to operate,

00:17:45.708 --> 00:17:50.087
how to get funding
or reach out to more organizations,

00:17:50.087 --> 00:17:53.245
and especially in the e-commerce,
which is very new for me.

00:17:53.245 --> 00:17:55.632
I mean, I am not
a fashion person, believe me.

00:17:55.632 --> 00:17:58.929
CA: Well, it's been incredible
to have you here.

00:17:58.929 --> 00:18:03.944

go on being smart, and please stay safe.
