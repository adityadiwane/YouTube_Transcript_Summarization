00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.002
When I was about 16 years old

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:22.701
I can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation,

00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:25.231
looking for a movie to watch on HBO --

00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:27.744
and how many of you remember "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"?

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:32.745
Oh yeah, great movie, right? -- Well, I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen, and so I thought,

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:35.457
"Sweet! Ferris Bueller. I'll watch this!"

00:00:35.457 --> 00:00:39.029
It wasn't Ferris Bueller. And forgive me Matthew Broderick,

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:43.146
I know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller, but that's how I remember you; you're Ferris.

00:00:43.146 --> 00:00:48.899
But you weren't doing Ferris-y things at the time; you were doing gay things at the time.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.227
He was in a movie called "Torch Song Trilogy."

00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:58.973
And "Torch Song Trilogy" was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love.

00:00:58.973 --> 00:01:02.037
Love and respect -- that's what the whole film was about.

00:01:02.037 --> 00:01:07.193
And as I'm watching it, I'm realizing that they're talking about me.

00:01:07.193 --> 00:01:12.786
Not the drag queen part -- I am not shaving my hair for anyone -- but the gay part.

00:01:12.786 --> 00:01:17.999
The finding love and respect, the part about trying to find your place in the world.

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:24.349
So as I'm watching this, I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears,

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:27.549
and it stuck with me for the past 25 years.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.658
And there's this quote that the main character, Arnold, tells his mother

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:37.817
as they're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives.

00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:43.036
"There's one thing more -- there's just one more thing you better understand.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:49.072
I've taught myself to sew, cook, fix plumbing, build furniture,

00:01:49.072 --> 00:01:51.929
I can even pat myself on the back when necessary,

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.428
all so I don't have to ask anyone for anything.

00:01:56.428 --> 00:02:02.107
There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect,

00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:06.556
and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life."

00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:14.323
I remember that scene like it was yesterday; I was 16, I was in tears, I was in the closet,

00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:19.684
and I'm looking at these two people, Ferris Bueller and some guy I'd never seen before,

00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:23.982
fighting for love.

00:02:23.982 --> 00:02:28.111
When I finally got to a place in my life

00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:31.734
where I came out and accepted who I was, and was really quite happy, to tell you the truth,

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:35.880
I was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.209
I realized there were a lot of people who weren't as gay as I was --

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.427
gay being happy, not gay being attracted to the same sex.

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:48.471
In fact, I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger

00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:51.081
and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear

00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:55.950
about who I was and the gay lifestyle.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.271
Now, I'm sitting here trying to figure out "the gay lifestyle," "the gay lifestyle,"

00:03:00.271 --> 00:03:04.683
and I keep hearing this word over and over and over again: lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle.

00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:09.313
I've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat

00:03:09.313 --> 00:03:12.221
to civilization than terrorism.

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.196
That's when I got scared.

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:22.318
Because I'm thinking, if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization,

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:26.944
I need to figure out what this stuff is, and I need to stop doing it right now.

00:03:26.944 --> 00:03:29.322
(Laughter)

00:03:29.322 --> 00:03:34.245
So, I took a look at my life, a hard look at my life,

00:03:34.245 --> 00:03:38.465
and I saw some things very disturbing.

00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:42.301
(Laughter)

00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:46.055
And I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you,

00:03:46.055 --> 00:03:48.352
starting with my mornings.

00:03:48.352 --> 00:03:51.398
I drink coffee.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:57.291
Not only do I drink coffee, I know other gay people who drink coffee.

00:03:57.291 --> 00:04:00.933
I get stuck in traffic --

00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:04.411
evil, evil traffic.

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.583
Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports.

00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:10.849
I look around, and I go, "My God, look at all these gay people!

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.291
We're all trapped in these lines! These long lines trying to get on an airplane!

00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:21.517
My God, this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil!"

00:04:21.517 --> 00:04:28.904
I clean up. This is not an actual photograph of my son's room; his is messier.

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:34.265
And because I have a 15-year-old, all I do is cook and cook and cook.

00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:39.222
Any parents out there of teenagers? All we do is cook for these people --

00:04:39.222 --> 00:04:44.026
they eat two, three, four dinners a night -- it's ridiculous!

00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:46.598
This is the gay lifestyle.

00:04:46.674 --> 00:04:53.461
And after I'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic,

00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:57.064
my partner and I, we get together

00:04:57.064 --> 00:05:03.219
and we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:07.043
(Laughter)

00:05:07.043 --> 00:05:10.395
We're usually in bed before we find out who's eliminated on "American Idol."

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:14.613
We have to wake up and find out the next day who's still on

00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:19.699
because we're too freaking tired to hear who stays on.

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.069
This is the super duper evil gay lifestyle.

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.934
Run for your heterosexual lives, people.

00:05:27.934 --> 00:05:36.313
(Applause)

00:05:36.328 --> 00:05:40.982
When my partner, Steve, and I first started dating,

00:05:40.982 --> 00:05:44.576
he told me this story about penguins.

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:48.027
And I didn't know where he was going with it at first.

00:05:48.027 --> 00:05:51.963
He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me, but he told me that

00:05:51.963 --> 00:05:56.316
when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with,

00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:59.917
they present them with a pebble -- the perfect pebble.

00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:06.533
And then he reaches into his pocket, and he brings this out to me.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:10.510
And I looked at it, and I was like, this is really cool.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.936
And he says, "I want to spend the rest of my life with you."

00:06:14.936 --> 00:06:20.475
So I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous,

00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:24.064
like, I don't know, a TEDx talk.

00:06:24.064 --> 00:06:28.050
I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.670
And sometimes I just wear it just because.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.588
How many people out there are in love? Anyone in love out there?

00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:39.764
You might be gay.

00:06:39.764 --> 00:06:41.190
(Laughter)

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:47.739
Because I, too, am in love, and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about.

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:54.004
(Applause)

00:06:54.004 --> 00:06:59.576
You may want to tell your spouse. Who, if they're in love, might be gay as well.

00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:03.478
How many of you are single? Any single people out there?

00:07:03.478 --> 00:07:08.644
You too might be gay! Because I know some gay people who are also single.

00:07:08.644 --> 00:07:15.389
It's really scary, this gay lifestyle thing; it's super duper evil and there's no end to it!

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.733
It goes and goes and engulfs!

00:07:18.733 --> 00:07:21.589
It's really quite silly, isn't it?

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:26.978
That's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say

00:07:28.973 --> 00:07:31.035
that he supports --

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:34.458
(Applause)

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:37.820
that he supports marriage equality.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.390
It's a wonderful day in our country's history; it's a wonderful day in the globe's history

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:47.436
to be able to have an actual sitting president say, enough of this --

00:07:47.436 --> 00:07:51.150
first to himself, and then to the rest of the world.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.238
It's wonderful.

00:07:53.238 --> 00:07:56.629
But there's something that's been disturbing me since he

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:00.366
made that remark just a short time ago.

00:08:00.366 --> 00:08:06.926
And that is, apparently, this is just another move by the gay activists

00:08:06.926 --> 00:08:10.407
that's on the gay agenda.

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:16.120
And I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.810
I've been to all of the functions, I've been to fundraisers,

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.295
I've written about the topic, and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:25.985
(Laughter)

00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:28.767
I've paid my dues on time,

00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:31.316
(Laughter)

00:08:31.316 --> 00:08:35.611
I've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine,

00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:38.952
and I've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda.

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:43.917
It's very, very frustrating, and I was feeling left out, like I wasn't quite gay enough.

00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:49.120
But then something wonderful happened: I was out shopping, as I tend to do,

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:57.543
and I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda.

00:08:57.543 --> 00:09:02.947
And I said to myself, "LZ, for so long, you have been denied this.

00:09:02.947 --> 00:09:07.963
When you get in front of this crowd, you're gonna share the news.

00:09:07.963 --> 00:09:11.834
You're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder,

00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:15.355
what exactly is in the gay agenda?

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:18.835
What are these gays up to?

00:09:18.835 --> 00:09:21.669
What do they want?"

00:09:21.669 --> 00:09:27.056
So, without further ado, I will present to you, ladies and gentlemen --

00:09:27.056 --> 00:09:31.290
now be careful, 'cause it's evil -- a copy,

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:36.723
the official copy, of the gay agenda.

00:09:36.723 --> 00:10:01.527
(Music)

00:10:01.527 --> 00:10:04.498
The gay agenda, people!

00:10:04.498 --> 00:10:08.435
(Applause)

00:10:08.435 --> 00:10:10.487
There it is!

00:10:10.487 --> 00:10:14.326
Did you soak it all in? The gay agenda.

00:10:14.326 --> 00:10:17.577
Some of you may be calling it, what,

00:10:17.577 --> 00:10:20.721
the Constitution of the United States, is that what you call it too?

00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:25.921
The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda.

00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:30.826
These gays, people like me, want to be treated like full citizens

00:10:30.826 --> 00:10:34.731
and it's all written down in plain sight.

00:10:34.731 --> 00:10:40.437
I was blown away when I saw it. I was like, wait, this is the gay agenda?

00:10:40.437 --> 00:10:44.646
Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about?

00:10:44.646 --> 00:10:48.334
I wouldn't have been so confused; I wouldn't have been so upset.

00:10:48.334 --> 00:10:53.042
But there it is. The gay agenda.

00:10:53.042 --> 00:10:58.846
Run for your heterosexual lives.

00:10:58.846 --> 00:11:05.578
Did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that

00:11:05.578 --> 00:11:08.719
people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered

00:11:08.719 --> 00:11:10.811
can be kicked out of their apartments

00:11:10.811 --> 00:11:14.947
for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?

00:11:14.947 --> 00:11:20.115
That's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed,

00:11:20.115 --> 00:11:25.957
because there's no protection from discrimination of GLBT people.

00:11:25.957 --> 00:11:31.106
Did you know in the states where there's no shading that

00:11:31.106 --> 00:11:37.292
you can be fired for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?

00:11:37.292 --> 00:11:41.303
Not based upon the quality of your work,

00:11:41.303 --> 00:11:45.305
how long you've been there, if you stink,

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:51.978
just if you're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered.

00:11:51.978 --> 00:11:57.308
All of which flies in the face of the gay agenda,

00:11:57.308 --> 00:12:01.023
also known as the U.S. Constitution.

00:12:01.023 --> 00:12:04.695
Specifically, this little amendment right here:

00:12:04.695 --> 00:12:09.946
"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities

00:12:09.946 --> 00:12:14.184
of citizens of the United States."

00:12:14.184 --> 00:12:17.225
I'm looking at you, North Carolina.

00:12:17.225 --> 00:12:21.822
But you're not looking at the U.S. Constitution.

00:12:21.822 --> 00:12:27.133
This is the gay agenda: equality. Not special rights,

00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:31.309
but the rights that were already written by these people --

00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:33.728
these elitists, if you will.

00:12:33.728 --> 00:12:37.759
Educated, well-dressed,

00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:40.447
(Laughter)

00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:43.188
some would dare say questionably dressed.

00:12:43.188 --> 00:12:45.967
(Laughter)

00:12:45.967 --> 00:12:49.749
Nonetheless, our forefathers, right?

00:12:49.749 --> 00:12:53.985
The people that, we say, knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution --

00:12:53.985 --> 00:12:57.158
the gay agenda, if you will.

00:12:57.158 --> 00:13:02.481
All of that flies in the face of what they did.

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:07.992
That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that

00:13:07.992 --> 00:13:13.334
I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda.

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:18.312
Because I figured if I made it funny, you wouldn't be as threatened.

00:13:18.312 --> 00:13:22.871
I figured if I was a bit irreverent, you wouldn't find it serious.

00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:28.298
But when you see the map, and you see our state of Michigan --

00:13:28.298 --> 00:13:33.945
it's legal to fire someone

00:13:33.945 --> 00:13:37.839
for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:42.103
that it's legal to remove someone from their home

00:13:42.103 --> 00:13:46.713
because they're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,

00:13:46.713 --> 00:13:50.701
then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality

00:13:50.701 --> 00:13:54.169
is not about stripping someone's rights away,

00:13:54.169 --> 00:13:58.749
it's about granting them the rights that [have] already been stated.

00:13:58.749 --> 00:14:03.210
And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated,

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.716
that we've already agreed upon.

00:14:06.716 --> 00:14:12.023
There are people living in fear

00:14:12.023 --> 00:14:15.640
of losing their jobs

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.730
so they don't show anyone who they really are

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:25.535
right here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina;

00:14:25.535 --> 00:14:31.224
all those states that were clear, it's legal.

00:14:31.224 --> 00:14:34.448
If I could brag for a second,

00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:40.552
I have a 15-year-old son from my marriage.

00:14:40.552 --> 00:14:43.303
He has a 4.0.

00:14:43.303 --> 00:14:49.742
He is starting a new club at school, Policy Debate.

00:14:49.742 --> 00:14:53.969
He's a budding track star;

00:14:53.969 --> 00:15:00.430
he has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.933
He volunteers.

00:15:02.933 --> 00:15:06.168
He prays before he eats.

00:15:06.168 --> 00:15:12.363
I would like to think, as his father -- and he lives with me primarily --

00:15:12.363 --> 00:15:16.280
that I had a little something to do with all of that.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.188
I would like to think that he's a good boy,

00:15:19.188 --> 00:15:23.555
a respectful young man. I would like to think that

00:15:23.555 --> 00:15:27.252
I've proven to be a capable father.

00:15:27.252 --> 00:15:31.005
But if I were to go to the state of Michigan today,

00:15:31.005 --> 00:15:35.937
and try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage,

00:15:35.937 --> 00:15:39.536
I would be disqualified for only one reason:

00:15:39.536 --> 00:15:42.893
because I'm gay.

00:15:42.893 --> 00:15:47.696
It doesn't matter what I've already proven, what I can do with my heart.

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:51.304
It's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am

00:15:51.304 --> 00:15:57.136
that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption.

00:15:57.136 --> 00:16:01.171
And that's not just about me,

00:16:01.171 --> 00:16:06.074
that's about so many other Michiganders, U.S. citizens,

00:16:06.074 --> 00:16:11.233
who don't understand why what they are

00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:16.513
is so much more significant than who they are.

00:16:16.513 --> 00:16:21.890
This story just keeps playing over and over

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.381
and over again in our country's history.

00:16:25.381 --> 00:16:29.238
There was a time in which, I don't know,

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:33.267
people who were black couldn't have the same rights.

00:16:33.267 --> 00:16:38.582
People who happened to be women didn't have the same rights, couldn't vote.

00:16:38.582 --> 00:16:43.372
There was a point in our history in which, if you were considered disabled,

00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:48.109
that an employer could just fire you, before the Americans with Disabilities Act.

00:16:48.109 --> 00:16:51.463
We keep doing this over and over again.

00:16:51.463 --> 00:16:56.047
And so here we are, 2012,

00:16:56.047 --> 00:16:58.376
gay agenda,

00:16:58.376 --> 00:17:02.244
gay lifestyle, and I'm not a good dad

00:17:02.244 --> 00:17:05.754
and people don't deserve to be able to protect their families

00:17:05.754 --> 00:17:10.425
because of what they are, not who they are.

00:17:10.425 --> 00:17:17.069
So when you hear the words "gay lifestyle" and "gay agenda" in the future,

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.474
I encourage you to do two things:

00:17:20.474 --> 00:17:26.759
One, remember the U.S. Constitution, and then two,

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:31.882
if you wouldn't mind looking to your left, please.

00:17:31.882 --> 00:17:35.038
Look to your right.

00:17:35.038 --> 00:17:40.505
That person next to you is a brother, is a sister.

00:17:40.505 --> 00:17:43.120
And they should be treated with love and respect.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.843
Thank you.
