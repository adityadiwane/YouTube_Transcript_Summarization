00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Ben Roche: So I'm Ben, by the way.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Homaro Cantu: And I'm Homaro.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
BR: And we're chefs. So when Moto

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
opened in 2004, people didn't really know

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
what to expect. A lot of people thought

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
that it was a Japanese restaurant, and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
maybe it was the name, maybe it was

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
the logo, which was like a Japanese

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
character, but anyway, we had all these

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
requests for Japanese food, which is

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
really not what we did. And after about

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
the ten thousandth request for a maki roll,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
we decided to give the people

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
what they wanted. So this picture is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
an example of printed food, and this was

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
the first foray into what we like to call

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
flavor transformation. So this is all

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
the ingredients, all the flavor of, you know,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
a standard maki roll, printed onto

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
a little piece of paper.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
HC: So our diners started to get bored

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
with this idea, and we decided to give them

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
the same course twice, so here we actually

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
took an element from the maki roll and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and took a picture of a dish and then

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
basically served that picture with the dish.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
So this dish in particular is basically

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
champagne with seafood.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
The champagne grapes that you see are

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
seafood and some crÃ¨me fraiche and the

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
picture actually tastes exactly like the dish. (Laughter)

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
BR: But it's not all just edible pictures.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
We decided to do something

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
a little bit different and transform flavors

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
that were very familiar -- so in this case,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
we have carrot cake.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
So we take a carrot cake, put it

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
in a blender, and we have kind of like

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
a carrot cake juice, and then that went into

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
this hollow shell of carrot cake

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
ice cream, I guess, and it comes off

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
looking like, you know,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Jupiter's floating around your plate.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
So yeah, we're transforming things into

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
something that you have absolutely

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
no reference for.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
HC: And here's something we have no

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
reference to eat. This is a cigar, and

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
basically it's a Cuban cigar made out of

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
a Cuban pork sandwich, so we take these

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
spices that go into the pork shoulder,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
we fashion that into ash. We take

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
the sandwich and wrap it up in

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
a collard green, put an edible label

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
that bears no similarity to

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
a Cohiba cigar label, and we put it

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
in a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and charge

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
you about twenty bucks for it. (Laughter)

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
HC: Delicious.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
BR: That's not it, though.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Instead of making foods that

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
look like things that you wouldn't eat,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
we decided to make ingredients

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
look like dishes that you know.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
So this is a plate of nachos.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
The difference between our nachos

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and the other guy's nachos,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
is that this is actually a dessert.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
So the chips are candied,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
the ground beef is made from chocolate,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and the cheese is made from a shredded

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
mango sorbet that gets shredded

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And after doing all of this

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
dematerialization and reconfiguring

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
of this, of these ingredients, we realized

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
that it was pretty cool,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
because as we served it, we learned that

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
the dish actually behaves like the real thing,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
where the cheese begins to melt.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
So when you're looking at this thing

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
in the dining room, you have this sensation

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
that this is actually a plate of nachos,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and it's not really until you begin tasting it

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
that you realize this is a dessert, and

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
it's just kind of like a mind-ripper.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
(Laughter)

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
HC: So we had been creating

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
all of these dishes out of a

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
kitchen that was more like

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
a mechanic's shop than a kitchen, and

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
the next logical step for us was to install

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
a state-of-the-art laboratory,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
and that's what we have here.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
So we put this in the basement, and we

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
got really serious about food, like

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
serious experimentation.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
BR: One of the really cool things about

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
the lab, besides that we have a new

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
science lab in the kitchen, is that,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
you know, with this new equipment, and

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
this new approach, all these

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
different doors to creativity that we never

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
knew were there began to open, and so the

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
experiments and the food and the dishes

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
that we created, they just kept going

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
further and further out there.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
HC: Let's talk about flavor transformation,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and let's actually make some cool stuff.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
You see a cow with its tongue hanging out.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
What I see is a cow about to eat something

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
delicious. What is that cow eating?

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And why is it delicious?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
So the cow, basically, eats three basic

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.260
things in their feed: corn, beets, and barley,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and so what I do is I actually

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
challenge my staff with these crazy,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
wild ideas. Can we take what the cow

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
eats, remove the cow, and then make

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
some hamburgers out of that?

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
And basically the reaction tends to be

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
kind of like this. (Laughter)

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
BR: Yeah, that's our chef de cuisine,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Chris Jones. This is not the only guy

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
that just flips out when we assign

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
a ridiculous task, but a lot of these ideas,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
they're hard to understand.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
They're hard to just get automatically.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
There's a lot of research and a lot of

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
failure, trial and error -- I guess, more error --

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
that goes into each and every dish,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
so we don't always get it right, and it takes

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
a while for us to be able to explain that

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
to people.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
HC: So, after about a day of Chris and I

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
staring at each other, we came up with

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
something that was pretty close

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
to the hamburger patty, and as you can

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
see it basically forms like hamburger meat.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
This is made from three ingredients:

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
beets, barley, corn, and so it

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
actually cooks up like hamburger meat,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
looks and tastes like hamburger meat,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and not only that, but it's basically

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
removing the cow from the equation.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
So replicating food, taking it into that

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
next level is where we're going.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
(Applause)

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
BR: And it's definitely the world's first

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
bleeding veggie burger,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
which is a cool side effect.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And a miracle berry, if you're not familiar

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
with it, is a natural ingredient, and it

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
contains a special property.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
It's a glycoprotein called miraculin,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
me out every time I eat it, but it has a

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
unique ability to mask certain taste

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
receptors on your tongue, so that primarily

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
sour taste receptors, so normally things

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
that would taste very sour or tart,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
somehow begin to taste very sweet.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
HC: You're about to eat a lemon,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
and now it tastes like lemonade.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
Let's just stop and think about the

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
economic benefits of something like that.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
We could eliminate sugar across the board

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
for all confectionary products and sodas,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and we can replace it with

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
all-natural fresh fruit.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
BR: So you see us here cutting up

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
some watermelon. The idea with this

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
is that we're going to eliminate tons of

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
food miles, wasted energy,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
or any exotic produce or item

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
from a very far-away place,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
with local, organic produce;

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
HC: So if miracle berries take sour things

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and turn them into sweet things,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
we have this other pixie dust

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
that we put on the watermelon, and it

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
makes it go from sweet to savory.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
So after we do that, we put it into

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
a vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
some spices, and we roll it, and this

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
starts taking on the appearance of tuna.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
So the key now is to make it

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
behave like tuna.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
BR: And then after a quick dip into some

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
we really have something that looks,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
tastes and behaves like the real thing.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
HC: So the key thing to remember here is,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
we don't really care

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
what this tuna really is.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
As long as it's good for you and good for

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
the environment, it doesn't matter.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
But where is this going?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
How can we take this idea of tricking your

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
tastebuds and leapfrog it into something

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
that we can do today that could be

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
a disruptive food technology?

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
So here's the next challenge.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
I told the staff, let's just take a bunch

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
of wild plants, think of them as

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
food ingredients. As long as they're

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
non-poisonous to the human body,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
go out around Chicago sidewalks,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
take it, blend it, cook it and then

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
have everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Let's charge them a boatload of cash for this

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.260
and see what they think. (Laughter)

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
BR: Yeah, so you can imagine, a task

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
like this -- this is another one of those

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
assignments that the kitchen staff

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
hated us for. But we really had to almost

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
relearn how to cook in general,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
because these are ingredients, you know,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
plant life that we're, one, unfamiliar with,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and two, we have no reference for how

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
to cook these things because

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
people don't eat them.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
So we really had to think about new, creative ways

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
to flavor, new ways to cook

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and to change texture -- and that was

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
the main issue with this challenge.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
HC: So this is where we step into the future

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
and we leapfrog ahead.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
So developing nations

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
and first-world nations,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
imagine if you could take these wild plants

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and consume them, food miles would

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
basically turn into food feet.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
This disruptive mentality of what food is

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
would essentially open up the encyclopedia

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
of what raw ingredients are, even if we just

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
swapped out, say, one of these for flour,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
that would eliminate so much energy

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
and so much waste.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And to give you a simple example here as to

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
what we actually fed these customers,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
there's a bale of hay there

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
and some crab apples.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
And basically we took hay and crab apples

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
People swore they were eating

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
barbecue sauce, and this is free food.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
BR: Thanks, guys.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:28.260
(Applause)
