00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.108
So, why does good sex so often fade,

00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:23.752
even for couples who continue
to love each other as much as ever?

00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:27.766
And why does good intimacy
not guarantee good sex,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.653
contrary to popular belief?

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:32.591
Or, the next question would be,

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.655
can we want what we already have?

00:00:35.188 --> 00:00:37.344
That's the million-dollar question, right?

00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:39.590
And why is the forbidden so erotic?

00:00:39.614 --> 00:00:43.330
What is it about transgression
that makes desire so potent?

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:45.338
And why does sex make babies,

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:47.972
and babies spell erotic
disaster in couples?

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:49.603
(Laughter)

00:00:49.627 --> 00:00:51.805
It's kind of the fatal
erotic blow, isn't it?

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:54.587
And when you love, how does it feel?

00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:57.091
And when you desire, how is it different?

00:00:57.885 --> 00:00:59.408
These are some of the questions

00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:04.898
that are at the center of my exploration
on the nature of erotic desire

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:08.346
and its concomitant
dilemmas in modern love.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.320
So I travel the globe,

00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:15.703
and what I'm noticing is that everywhere
where romanticism has entered,

00:01:15.727 --> 00:01:18.152
there seems to be a crisis of desire.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.396
A crisis of desire,
as in owning the wanting --

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.406
desire as an expression
of our individuality,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.395
of our free choice,
of our preferences, of our identity --

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:33.721
desire that has become a central concept

00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:36.945
as part of modern love
and individualistic societies.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.186
You know, this is the first time
in the history of humankind

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.616
where we are trying to experience
sexuality in the long term

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.002
not because we want 14 children,

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:54.198
for which we need to have even more
because many of them won't make it,

00:01:54.222 --> 00:01:58.367
and not because it is exclusively
a woman's marital duty.

00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:03.166
This is the first time
that we want sex over time

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.736
about pleasure and connection
that is rooted in desire.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.780
So what sustains desire,
and why is it so difficult?

00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:16.323
And at the heart of sustaining
desire in a committed relationship,

00:02:16.347 --> 00:02:21.930
I think, is the reconciliation
of two fundamental human needs.

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:27.092
On the one hand, our need
for security, for predictability,

00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:31.011
for safety, for dependability,

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:34.484
for reliability, for permanence.

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.602
All these anchoring,
grounding experiences of our lives

00:02:37.626 --> 00:02:38.778
that we call home.

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:43.704
But we also have an equally
strong need -- men and women --

00:02:43.728 --> 00:02:46.153
for adventure, for novelty,

00:02:46.177 --> 00:02:49.288
for mystery, for risk, for danger,

00:02:49.312 --> 00:02:52.578
for the unknown,
for the unexpected, surprise --

00:02:52.602 --> 00:02:54.509
you get the gist.

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:56.133
For journey, for travel.

00:02:56.508 --> 00:03:00.033
So reconciling our need for security
and our need for adventure

00:03:00.057 --> 00:03:01.607
into one relationship,

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.490
or what we today like to call
a passionate marriage,

00:03:04.514 --> 00:03:06.772
used to be a contradiction in terms.

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:10.486
Marriage was an economic institution

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.548
in which you were
given a partnership for life

00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:16.292
in terms of children and social status

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:19.099
and succession and companionship.

00:03:19.123 --> 00:03:23.128
But now we want our partner
to still give us all these things,

00:03:23.152 --> 00:03:25.580
but in addition I want you
to be my best friend

00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:28.814
and my trusted confidant
and my passionate lover to boot,

00:03:28.838 --> 00:03:30.218
and we live twice as long.

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:33.138
(Laughter)

00:03:33.162 --> 00:03:37.142
So we come to one person,
and we basically are asking them

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:40.058
to give us what once
an entire village used to provide.

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.370
Give me belonging, give me identity,

00:03:43.394 --> 00:03:44.709
give me continuity,

00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:48.369
but give me transcendence
and mystery and awe all in one.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.399
Give me comfort, give me edge.

00:03:50.423 --> 00:03:52.321
Give me novelty, give me familiarity.

00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:54.611
Give me predictability, give me surprise.

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:55.984
And we think it's a given,

00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:58.609
and toys and lingerie
are going to save us with that.

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:00.534
(Laughter)

00:04:00.558 --> 00:04:04.503
(Applause)

00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:07.988
So now we get to the existential
reality of the story, right?

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.418
Because I think, in some way --

00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:14.099
and I'll come back to that --

00:04:14.123 --> 00:04:17.550
but the crisis of desire
is often a crisis of the imagination.

00:04:17.574 --> 00:04:21.173
So why does good sex so often fade?

00:04:21.197 --> 00:04:23.721
What is the relationship
between love and desire?

00:04:23.745 --> 00:04:26.622
How do they relate,
and how do they conflict?

00:04:27.026 --> 00:04:29.495
Because therein lies
the mystery of eroticism.

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:33.889
So if there is a verb, for me,
that comes with love, it's "to have."

00:04:34.353 --> 00:04:37.599
And if there is a verb that comes
with desire, it is "to want."

00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:42.503
In love, we want to have,
we want to know the beloved.

00:04:42.527 --> 00:04:44.809
We want to minimize the distance.

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:46.789
We want to contract that gap.

00:04:46.813 --> 00:04:49.085
We want to neutralize the tensions.

00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:50.559
We want closeness.

00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:52.427
But in desire,

00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:56.242
we tend to not really want to go back
to the places we've already gone.

00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:59.587
Forgone conclusion
does not keep our interest.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.125
In desire, we want an Other,

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:05.174
somebody on the other side
that we can go visit,

00:05:05.198 --> 00:05:07.356
that we can go spend some time with,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.525
that we can go see what goes on
in their red-light district.

00:05:11.135 --> 00:05:12.136
You know?

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.529
In desire, we want a bridge to cross.

00:05:14.553 --> 00:05:17.534
Or in other words,
I sometimes say, fire needs air.

00:05:17.928 --> 00:05:19.772
Desire needs space.

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.703
And when it's said like that,
it's often quite abstract.

00:05:23.727 --> 00:05:25.394
But then I took a question with me.

00:05:25.418 --> 00:05:28.323
And I've gone to more than 20 countries
in the last few years

00:05:28.347 --> 00:05:30.711
with "Mating in Captivity,"
and I asked people,

00:05:30.735 --> 00:05:33.867
when do you find yourself
most drawn to your partner?

00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:36.758
Not attracted sexually,
per Se, but most drawn.

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:41.764
And across culture, across religion,
and across gender -- except for one --

00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:45.666
there are a few answers
that just keep coming back.

00:05:46.103 --> 00:05:47.936
So the first group is:

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.151
I am most drawn to my partner
when she is away,

00:05:53.175 --> 00:05:56.736
when we are apart, when we reunite.

00:05:57.317 --> 00:06:00.753
Basically, when I get back in touch

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:04.464
with my ability to imagine myself
with my partner,

00:06:04.488 --> 00:06:07.546
when my imagination comes
back in the picture,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.210
and when I can root it
in absence and in longing,

00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:14.455
which is a major component of desire.

00:06:14.995 --> 00:06:18.158
But then the second group
is even more interesting.

00:06:18.182 --> 00:06:19.843
I am most drawn to my partner

00:06:19.867 --> 00:06:22.389
when I see him in the studio,

00:06:22.413 --> 00:06:23.960
when she is onstage,

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:25.660
when he is in his element,

00:06:25.684 --> 00:06:28.198
when she's doing something
she's passionate about,

00:06:28.222 --> 00:06:31.603
when I see him at a party
and other people are really drawn to him,

00:06:31.627 --> 00:06:33.548
when I see her hold court.

00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:38.255
Basically, when I look at my partner
radiant and confident.

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.163
Probably the biggest
turn-on across the board.

00:06:41.552 --> 00:06:44.189
Radiant, as in self-sustaining.

00:06:44.213 --> 00:06:47.206
I look at this person --
by the way, in desire

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.983
people rarely talk about it,
when we are blended into one,

00:06:50.007 --> 00:06:51.627
five centimeters from each other.

00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:53.562
I don't know in inches how much that is.

00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:56.477
But it's also not when the other person
is that far apart

00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:58.237
that you no longer see them.

00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:02.261
It's when I'm looking at my partner
from a comfortable distance,

00:07:02.285 --> 00:07:06.610
where this person that is already
so familiar, so known,

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:11.074
is momentarily once again
somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.

00:07:11.582 --> 00:07:16.304
And in this space between me
and the other lies the erotic élan,

00:07:16.328 --> 00:07:18.464
lies that movement toward the other.

00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:21.060
Because sometimes, as Proust says,

00:07:21.084 --> 00:07:23.735
mystery is not
about traveling to new places,

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.914
but it's about looking with new eyes.

00:07:25.938 --> 00:07:29.767
And so, when I see my partner
on his own or her own,

00:07:29.791 --> 00:07:32.600
doing something
in which they are enveloped,

00:07:32.624 --> 00:07:37.015
I look at this person and I momentarily
get a shift in perception,

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:40.976
and I stay open to the mysteries
that are living right next to me.

00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:47.031
And then, more importantly,
in this description about the other

00:07:47.055 --> 00:07:48.881
or myself -- it's the same --

00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:52.962
what is most interesting
is that there is no neediness in desire.

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:55.290
Nobody needs anybody.

00:07:55.314 --> 00:07:57.772
There is no caretaking in desire.

00:07:57.796 --> 00:07:59.940
Caretaking is mightily loving.

00:07:59.964 --> 00:08:01.668
It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac.

00:08:01.692 --> 00:08:02.693
(Laughter)

00:08:02.717 --> 00:08:05.046
I have yet to see somebody
who is so turned on

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.748
by somebody who needs them.

00:08:06.772 --> 00:08:08.488
Wanting them is one thing.

00:08:08.512 --> 00:08:10.241
Needing them is a shot down

00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:12.142
and women have known that forever,

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:14.749
because anything
that will bring up parenthood

00:08:14.773 --> 00:08:17.112
will usually decrease the erotic charge.

00:08:17.136 --> 00:08:18.349
(Laughter)

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.089
For good reasons, right?

00:08:20.113 --> 00:08:23.342
And then the third group
of answers usually would be:

00:08:23.366 --> 00:08:27.762
when I'm surprised,
when we laugh together,

00:08:27.786 --> 00:08:30.047
as somebody said to me
in the office today,

00:08:30.071 --> 00:08:32.071
when he's in his tux, so I said, you know,

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:35.203
it's either the tux or the cowboy boots.

00:08:35.227 --> 00:08:38.609
But basically it's when there is novelty.

00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:41.445
But novelty isn't about new positions.

00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:43.400
It isn't a repertoire of techniques.

00:08:43.424 --> 00:08:46.645
Novelty is, what parts
of you do you bring out?

00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:49.451
What parts of you are just being seen?

00:08:49.475 --> 00:08:53.393
Because in some way one could say
sex isn't something you do, eh?

00:08:53.417 --> 00:08:54.758
Sex is a place you go.

00:08:55.142 --> 00:08:56.627
It's a space you enter

00:08:56.651 --> 00:09:00.173
inside yourself
and with another, or others.

00:09:00.197 --> 00:09:02.062
So where do you go in sex?

00:09:02.395 --> 00:09:04.847
What parts of you do you connect to?

00:09:04.871 --> 00:09:07.046
What do you seek to express there?

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.236
Is it a place for transcendence
and spiritual union?

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.563
Is it a place for naughtiness
and is it a place to be safely aggressive?

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:16.907
Is it a place where you
can finally surrender

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:20.075
and not have to take
responsibility for everything?

00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:23.051
Is it a place where you can
express your infantile wishes?

00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:25.331
What comes out there? It's a language.

00:09:25.355 --> 00:09:27.473
It isn't just a behavior.

00:09:27.781 --> 00:09:30.643
And it's the poetic of that language
that I'm interested in,

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:34.231
which is why I began to explore
this concept of erotic intelligence.

00:09:34.786 --> 00:09:36.421
You know, animals have sex.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:40.336
It's the pivot, it's biology,
it's the natural instinct.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.590
We are the only ones
who have an erotic life,

00:09:43.614 --> 00:09:48.772
which means that it's sexuality
transformed by the human imagination.

00:09:49.716 --> 00:09:53.002
We are the only ones
who can make love for hours,

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:55.874
have a blissful time, multiple orgasms,

00:09:55.898 --> 00:09:59.063
and touch nobody,
just because we can imagine it.

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:02.627
We can hint at it.
We don't even have to do it.

00:10:02.651 --> 00:10:06.121
We can experience that powerful
thing called anticipation,

00:10:06.145 --> 00:10:08.569
which is a mortar to desire.

00:10:08.593 --> 00:10:12.212
The ability to imagine it,
as if it's happening,

00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:14.610
to experience it as if it's happening,

00:10:14.634 --> 00:10:16.120
while nothing is happening

00:10:16.144 --> 00:10:18.411
and everything is happening,
at the same time.

00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:21.335
So when I began to think about eroticism,

00:10:21.359 --> 00:10:23.930
I began to think about the poetics of sex.

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:27.016
And if I look at it as an intelligence,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.213
then it's something that you cultivate.

00:10:29.237 --> 00:10:30.785
What are the ingredients?

00:10:30.809 --> 00:10:33.456
Imagination, playfulness,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.592
novelty, curiosity, mystery.

00:10:37.044 --> 00:10:41.803
But the central agent is really
that piece called the imagination.

00:10:41.827 --> 00:10:44.962
But more importantly,
for me to begin to understand

00:10:44.986 --> 00:10:47.558
who are the couples
who have an erotic spark,

00:10:47.582 --> 00:10:49.384
what sustains desire,

00:10:49.408 --> 00:10:52.798
I had to go back
to the original definition of eroticism,

00:10:52.822 --> 00:10:54.655
the mystical definition,

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:56.766
and I went through it
through a bifurcation

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.888
by looking, actually, at trauma,

00:10:58.912 --> 00:11:00.679
which is the other side.

00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:01.904
And I looked at it,

00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:04.258
looking at the community
that I had grown up in,

00:11:04.282 --> 00:11:08.096
which was a community in Belgium,
all Holocaust survivors,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.726
and in my community,
there were two groups:

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.882
those who didn't die,
and those who came back to life.

00:11:14.676 --> 00:11:17.937
And those who didn't die lived
often very tethered to the ground,

00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:21.452
could not experience
pleasure, could not trust,

00:11:21.476 --> 00:11:25.477
because when you're vigilant,
worried, anxious, and insecure,

00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:29.040
you can't lift your head
to go and take off in space

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.752
and be playful and safe and imaginative.

00:11:32.498 --> 00:11:34.291
Those who came back to life

00:11:34.315 --> 00:11:37.601
were those who understood
the erotic as an antidote to death.

00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:40.384
They knew how to keep themselves alive.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:42.751
And when I began to listen

00:11:42.775 --> 00:11:45.281
to the sexlessness
of the couples that I work with,

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:48.249
I sometimes would hear people
say, "I want more sex,"

00:11:48.273 --> 00:11:50.802
but generally, people want better sex,

00:11:50.826 --> 00:11:54.056
and better is to reconnect
with that quality of aliveness,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.859
of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality,

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.484
of Eros, of energy

00:11:58.508 --> 00:12:00.179
that sex used to afford them,

00:12:00.203 --> 00:12:02.448
or that they've hoped
it would afford them.

00:12:02.901 --> 00:12:05.417
And so I began to ask
a different question.

00:12:06.171 --> 00:12:10.527
"I shut myself off when ..."
began to be the question.

00:12:10.551 --> 00:12:12.541
"I turn off my desires when ..."

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.234
Which is not the same question as,

00:12:14.258 --> 00:12:17.332
"What turns me off is ..."
and "You turn me off when ..."

00:12:18.111 --> 00:12:21.268
And people began to say,
"I turn myself off when

00:12:21.292 --> 00:12:24.173
I feel dead inside,
when I don't like my body,

00:12:24.197 --> 00:12:25.442
when I feel old,

00:12:25.466 --> 00:12:27.189
when I haven't had time for myself,

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:29.813
when I haven't had a chance
to even check in with you,

00:12:29.837 --> 00:12:31.557
when I don't perform well at work,

00:12:31.581 --> 00:12:33.006
when I feel low self esteem,

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.997
when I don't have a sense of self-worth,

00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:37.876
when I don't feel like I have
a right to want, to take,

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.532
to receive pleasure."

00:12:40.424 --> 00:12:42.566
And then I began to ask
the reverse question.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.400
"I turn myself on when ..."

00:12:44.424 --> 00:12:47.225
Because most of the time,
people like to ask the question,

00:12:47.249 --> 00:12:49.435
"You turn me on, what turns me on,"

00:12:49.459 --> 00:12:51.708
and I'm out of the question, you know?

00:12:51.732 --> 00:12:53.339
Now, if you are dead inside,

00:12:53.363 --> 00:12:56.084
the other person can do
a lot of things for Valentine's.

00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:59.013
It won't make a dent.
There is nobody at the reception desk.

00:12:59.037 --> 00:13:00.311
(Laughter)

00:13:00.335 --> 00:13:02.713
So I turn myself on when,

00:13:02.737 --> 00:13:06.197
I turn on my desires, I wake up when ...

00:13:06.748 --> 00:13:11.342
Now, in this paradox
between love and desire,

00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:13.468
what seems to be so puzzling

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:17.361
is that the very ingredients
that nurture love --

00:13:17.385 --> 00:13:19.810
mutuality, reciprocity,

00:13:19.834 --> 00:13:23.571
protection, worry,
responsibility for the other --

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:27.015
are sometimes the very ingredients
that stifle desire.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.758
Because desire comes
with a host of feelings

00:13:31.782 --> 00:13:35.636
that are not always
such favorites of love:

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.429
jealousy, possessiveness,

00:13:37.453 --> 00:13:40.001
aggression, power, dominance,

00:13:40.025 --> 00:13:41.779
naughtiness, mischief.

00:13:41.803 --> 00:13:46.091
Basically most of us will get turned on
at night by the very same things

00:13:46.115 --> 00:13:48.478
that we will demonstrate
against during the day.

00:13:48.865 --> 00:13:52.140
You know, the erotic mind
is not very politically correct.

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:54.796
If everybody was fantasizing
on a bed of roses,

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.444
we wouldn't be having such
interesting talks about this.

00:13:57.468 --> 00:13:58.469
(Laughter)

00:13:58.493 --> 00:14:03.826
But no, in our mind up there
are a host of things going on

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.993
that we don't always know
how to bring to the person that we love,

00:14:07.017 --> 00:14:09.948
because we think love
comes with selflessness

00:14:09.972 --> 00:14:13.518
and in fact desire comes
with a certain amount of selfishness

00:14:13.542 --> 00:14:15.495
in the best sense of the word:

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:19.899
the ability to stay connected
to one's self in the presence of another.

00:14:20.335 --> 00:14:22.873
So I want to draw
that little image for you,

00:14:22.897 --> 00:14:26.582
because this need to reconcile
these two sets of needs,

00:14:26.606 --> 00:14:28.126
we are born with that.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.022
Our need for connection,
our need for separateness,

00:14:31.046 --> 00:14:33.231
or our need for security and adventure,

00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:36.085
or our need for togetherness
and for autonomy,

00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:39.260
and if you think about the little kid
who sits on your lap

00:14:39.284 --> 00:14:43.163
and who is cozily nested here
and very secure and comfortable,

00:14:43.187 --> 00:14:47.429
and at some point all of us
need to go out into the world

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:49.572
to discover and to explore.

00:14:49.596 --> 00:14:51.430
That's the beginning of desire,

00:14:51.454 --> 00:14:55.270
that exploratory need,
curiosity, discovery.

00:14:56.454 --> 00:15:00.176
And then at some point they turn
around and they look at you.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.949
And if you tell them,

00:15:01.973 --> 00:15:03.970
"Hey kiddo, the world's a great place.

00:15:03.994 --> 00:15:06.119
Go for it. There's so much fun out there,"

00:15:06.143 --> 00:15:08.669
then they can turn away
and they can experience

00:15:08.693 --> 00:15:10.874
connection and separateness
at the same time.

00:15:10.898 --> 00:15:14.688
They can go off in their imagination,
off in their body,

00:15:14.712 --> 00:15:16.340
off in their playfulness,

00:15:16.364 --> 00:15:19.498
all the while knowing that there's
somebody when they come back.

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:22.292
But if on this side
there is somebody who says,

00:15:22.316 --> 00:15:25.872
"I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed.

00:15:25.896 --> 00:15:28.151
My partner hasn't taken care
of me in so long.

00:15:28.175 --> 00:15:29.523
What's so good out there?

00:15:29.547 --> 00:15:32.669
Don't we have everything
you need together, you and I?"

00:15:32.693 --> 00:15:34.782
then there are a few little reactions

00:15:34.806 --> 00:15:37.862
that all of us can pretty much recognize.

00:15:38.219 --> 00:15:41.125
Some of us will come back,

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.902
came back a long time ago,

00:15:42.926 --> 00:15:45.311
and that little child who comes back

00:15:45.335 --> 00:15:48.264
is the child who will forgo
a part of himself

00:15:48.288 --> 00:15:50.002
in order not to lose the other.

00:15:50.431 --> 00:15:53.992
I will lose my freedom
in order not to lose connection.

00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:57.326
And I will learn to love in a certain way

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.166
that will become burdened with extra worry

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.710
and extra responsibility
and extra protection,

00:16:04.734 --> 00:16:07.174
and I won't know how to leave you

00:16:07.198 --> 00:16:10.718
in order to go play,
in order to go experience pleasure,

00:16:10.742 --> 00:16:13.958
in order to discover,
to enter inside myself.

00:16:13.982 --> 00:16:16.481
Translate this into adult language.

00:16:16.866 --> 00:16:18.355
It starts very young.

00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:21.658
It continues into our sex lives
up to the end.

00:16:22.127 --> 00:16:24.497
Child number two comes back

00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:27.563
but looks like that
over their shoulder all the time.

00:16:27.587 --> 00:16:29.342
"Are you going to be there?

00:16:29.366 --> 00:16:31.438
Are you going to curse me, scold me?

00:16:31.462 --> 00:16:33.219
Are you going to be angry with me?"

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:36.838
And they may be gone,
but they're never really away.

00:16:36.862 --> 00:16:39.243
And those are often the people
that will tell you,

00:16:39.267 --> 00:16:41.369
"In the beginning, it was super hot."

00:16:41.393 --> 00:16:43.546
Because in the beginning,

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.898
the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong

00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:49.791
that it actually led
to the decrease of desire.

00:16:49.815 --> 00:16:53.819
The more connected I became,
the more responsible I felt,

00:16:53.843 --> 00:16:56.942
the less I was able to let go
in your presence.

00:16:56.966 --> 00:16:59.010
The third child doesn't really come back.

00:16:59.606 --> 00:17:03.014
So what happens,
if you want to sustain desire,

00:17:03.038 --> 00:17:05.254
it's that real dialectic piece.

00:17:05.278 --> 00:17:08.935
On the one hand you want the security
in order to be able to go.

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:12.687
On the other hand if you can't go,
you can't have pleasure,

00:17:12.711 --> 00:17:15.731
you can't culminate,
you don't have an orgasm,

00:17:15.755 --> 00:17:18.150
you don't get excited
because you spend your time

00:17:18.174 --> 00:17:21.009
in the body and the head
of the other and not in your own.

00:17:21.612 --> 00:17:27.652
So in this dilemma about reconciling
these two sets of fundamental needs,

00:17:27.676 --> 00:17:31.825
there are a few things that I've come
to understand erotic couples do.

00:17:31.849 --> 00:17:34.802
One, they have a lot of sexual privacy.

00:17:34.826 --> 00:17:37.308
They understand
that there is an erotic space

00:17:37.332 --> 00:17:38.932
that belongs to each of them.

00:17:39.383 --> 00:17:42.518
They also understand
that foreplay is not something you do

00:17:42.542 --> 00:17:44.353
five minutes before the real thing.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.822
Foreplay pretty much starts
at the end of the previous orgasm.

00:17:48.293 --> 00:17:51.825
They also understand
that an erotic space isn't about,

00:17:51.849 --> 00:17:53.380
you begin to stroke the other.

00:17:53.404 --> 00:17:56.786
It's about you create a space
where you leave Management Inc.,

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.445
maybe where you leave the Agile program --

00:17:59.469 --> 00:18:02.153
(Laughter)

00:18:02.177 --> 00:18:06.429
And you actually just enter that place
where you stop being the good citizen

00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:09.093
who is taking care of things
and being responsible.

00:18:09.117 --> 00:18:12.637
Responsibility and desire just butt heads.

00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:14.792
They don't really do well together.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:19.468
Erotic couples also understand
that passion waxes and wanes.

00:18:19.492 --> 00:18:21.292
It's pretty much like the moon.

00:18:21.316 --> 00:18:23.037
It has intermittent eclipses.

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:25.660
But what they know
is they know how to resurrect it.

00:18:25.684 --> 00:18:27.352
They know how to bring it back.

00:18:27.376 --> 00:18:28.996
And they know how to bring it back

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.382
because they have
demystified one big myth,

00:18:31.406 --> 00:18:33.755
which is the myth of spontaneity,

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.186
which is that it's just going
to fall from heaven

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.168
while you're folding the laundry
like a deus ex machina,

00:18:39.192 --> 00:18:41.137
and in fact they understood

00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:46.303
that whatever is going to just happen
in a long-term relationship, already has.

00:18:46.327 --> 00:18:49.089
Committed sex is premeditated sex.

00:18:49.113 --> 00:18:51.405
It's willful. It's intentional.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.477
It's focus and presence.

00:18:55.374 --> 00:18:56.494
Merry Valentine's.

00:18:56.518 --> 00:18:59.664
(Applause)
