00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:14.437
Hi.

00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:16.807
Let me ask the audience a question:

00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:19.026
Did you ever lie as a child?

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.717
If you did, could you please
raise your hand?

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:26.599
Wow! This is the most honest
group of people I've ever met.

00:00:26.623 --> 00:00:28.580
(Laughter)

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:30.313
So for the last 20 years,

00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:33.752
I've been studying
how children learn to tell lies.

00:00:33.776 --> 00:00:36.080
And today, I'm going to share with you

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:38.266
some of the discoveries we have made.

00:00:38.624 --> 00:00:43.549
But to begin, I'm going to tell you
a story from Mr. Richard Messina,

00:00:43.573 --> 00:00:46.702
who is my friend and an elementary
school principal.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.827
He got a phone call one day.

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:52.430
The caller says,

00:00:52.454 --> 00:00:56.336
"Mr. Messina, my son Johnny
will not come to school today

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.823
because he's sick."

00:00:58.498 --> 00:01:00.234
Mr. Messina asks,

00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:02.272
"Who am I speaking to, please?"

00:01:02.788 --> 00:01:04.278
And the caller says,

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:05.967
"I am my father."

00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:08.778
(Laughter)

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:11.909
So this story --

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.465
(Laughter)

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:17.799
sums up very nicely
three common beliefs we have

00:01:17.823 --> 00:01:19.682
about children and lying.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.771
One, children only come to tell lies

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:27.063
after entering elementary school.

00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:29.863
Two, children are poor liars.

00:01:29.887 --> 00:01:32.744
We adults can easily detect their lies.

00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:36.806
And three, if children lie
at a very young age,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.679
there must be some
character flaws with them,

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:43.752
and they are going to become
pathological liars for life.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.914
Well, it turns out

00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:49.236
all of the three beliefs are wrong.

00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:53.327
We have been playing guessing games

00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:55.433
with children all over the world.

00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:56.943
Here is an example.

00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:01.332
So in this game, we asked children
to guess the numbers on the cards.

00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.836
And we tell them if they win the game,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.017
they are going to get a big prize.

00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:09.002
But in the middle of the game,

00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:11.786
we make an excuse and leave the room.

00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:15.697
And before we leave the room,

00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.657
we tell them not to peek at the cards.

00:02:19.518 --> 00:02:20.934
Of course,

00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.119
we have hidden cameras in the room

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.938
to watch their every move.

00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:29.633
Because the desire
to win the game is so strong,

00:02:29.657 --> 00:02:33.143
more than 90 percent of children will peek

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:34.604
as soon as we leave the room.

00:02:34.628 --> 00:02:36.628
(Laughter)

00:02:37.044 --> 00:02:39.030
The crucial question is:

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:41.802
When we return and ask the children

00:02:41.826 --> 00:02:44.135
whether or not they have peeked,

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.211
will the children who peeked confess

00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:49.813
or lie about their transgression?

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:56.298
We found that regardless
of gender, country, religion,

00:02:56.934 --> 00:02:58.513
at two years of age,

00:02:59.188 --> 00:03:01.115
30 percent lie,

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.948
70 percent tell the truth
about their transgression.

00:03:04.972 --> 00:03:07.110
At three years of age,

00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:10.608
50 percent lie and 50 percent
tell the truth.

00:03:11.302 --> 00:03:13.201
At four years of age,

00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:15.172
more than 80 percent lie.

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:18.785
And after four years of age,

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.198
most children lie.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.543
So as you can see,

00:03:22.567 --> 00:03:26.030
lying is really a typical part
of development.

00:03:26.054 --> 00:03:28.844
And some children begin to tell lies

00:03:28.868 --> 00:03:31.307
as young as two years of age.

00:03:32.438 --> 00:03:35.995
So now, let's take a closer look
at the younger children.

00:03:37.336 --> 00:03:41.149
Why do some but not all
young children lie?

00:03:42.184 --> 00:03:45.513
In cooking, you need good ingredients

00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:47.150
to cook good food.

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:52.356
And good lying requires
two key ingredients.

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.219
The first key ingredient
is theory of mind,

00:03:57.243 --> 00:03:59.078
or the mind-reading ability.

00:03:59.768 --> 00:04:01.846
Mind reading is the ability to know

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.478
that different people have
different knowledge about the situation

00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:10.303
and the ability to differentiate
between what I know

00:04:10.327 --> 00:04:11.550
and what you know.

00:04:11.914 --> 00:04:14.161
Mind reading is important for lying

00:04:14.185 --> 00:04:18.032
because the basis of lying is that I know

00:04:18.056 --> 00:04:19.207
you don't know

00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:20.382
what I know.

00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:21.777
Therefore, I can lie to you.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.680
The second key ingredient
for good lying is self-control.

00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:32.327
It is the ability to control your speech,
your facial expression

00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:33.891
and your body language,

00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:35.993
so that you can tell a convincing lie.

00:04:36.938 --> 00:04:40.664
And we found that those young children

00:04:40.688 --> 00:04:45.544
who have more advanced mind-reading
and self-control abilities

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:47.606
tell lies earlier

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.446
and are more sophisticated liars.

00:04:51.887 --> 00:04:57.506
As it turns out, these two abilities
are also essential for all of us

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.052
to function well in our society.

00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:05.183
In fact, deficits in mind-reading
and self-control abilities

00:05:05.207 --> 00:05:08.766
are associated with serious
developmental problems,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.549
such as ADHD and autism.

00:05:13.893 --> 00:05:19.070
So if you discover your two-year-old
is telling his or her first lie,

00:05:19.094 --> 00:05:21.078
instead of being alarmed,

00:05:21.102 --> 00:05:22.594
you should celebrate --

00:05:22.618 --> 00:05:24.140
(Laughter)

00:05:24.164 --> 00:05:29.894
because it signals that your child
has arrived at a new milestone

00:05:29.918 --> 00:05:31.553
of typical development.

00:05:33.085 --> 00:05:36.221
Now, are children poor liars?

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:39.872
Do you think you can easily
detect their lies?

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:42.423
Would you like to give it a try?

00:05:42.921 --> 00:05:44.401
Yes? OK.

00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:46.564
So I'm going to show you two videos.

00:05:47.024 --> 00:05:48.175
In the videos,

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.256
the children are going to respond
to a researcher's question,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.762
"Did you peek?"

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:54.340
So try to tell me

00:05:54.364 --> 00:05:55.762
which child is lying

00:05:55.786 --> 00:05:57.896
and which child is telling the truth.

00:05:58.272 --> 00:05:59.991
Here's child number one.

00:06:00.991 --> 00:06:02.228
Are you ready?

00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:04.926
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:07.855
Kang Lee: And this is child number two.

00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:11.693
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.

00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:16.883
KL: OK, if you think
child number one is lying,

00:06:16.907 --> 00:06:18.594
please raise your hand.

00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:23.953
And if you think child number two
is lying, please raise your hand.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:28.067
OK, so as a matter of fact,

00:06:28.091 --> 00:06:31.028
child number one is telling the truth,

00:06:31.052 --> 00:06:33.081
child number two is lying.

00:06:34.124 --> 00:06:37.354
Looks like many of you are terrible
detectors of children's lies.

00:06:37.378 --> 00:06:39.856
(Laughter)

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.264
Now, we have played similar kinds of games

00:06:43.288 --> 00:06:47.913
with many, many adults
from all walks of life.

00:06:48.714 --> 00:06:50.872
And we show them many videos.

00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:53.896
In half of the videos, the children lied.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.187
In the other half of the videos,
the children told the truth.

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:01.386
And let's find out
how these adults performed.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.174
Because there are as many liars
as truth tellers,

00:07:06.198 --> 00:07:08.597
if you guess randomly,

00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:12.691
there's a 50 percent chance
you're going to get it right.

00:07:12.715 --> 00:07:16.309
So if your accuracy is around 50 percent,

00:07:16.333 --> 00:07:19.774
it means you are a terrible detector
of children's lies.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.819
So let's start with undergrads
and law school students,

00:07:24.843 --> 00:07:28.515
who typically have
limited experience with children.

00:07:30.038 --> 00:07:32.000
No, they cannot detect children's lies.

00:07:32.024 --> 00:07:34.238
Their performance is around chance.

00:07:34.262 --> 00:07:39.491
Now how about social workers
and child-protection lawyers,

00:07:39.515 --> 00:07:42.189
who work with children on a daily basis?

00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:44.300
Can they detect children's lies?

00:07:45.624 --> 00:07:46.775
No, they cannot.

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:47.844
(Laughter)

00:07:47.868 --> 00:07:49.340
What about judges,

00:07:49.364 --> 00:07:51.164
customs officers

00:07:51.188 --> 00:07:53.046
and police officers,

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.713
who deal with liars on a daily basis?

00:07:55.737 --> 00:07:57.654
Can they detect children's lies?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.014
No, they cannot.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.616
What about parents?

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.654
Can parents detect other children's lies?

00:08:05.898 --> 00:08:07.136
No, they cannot.

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:11.406
What about, can parents
detect their own children's lies?

00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:14.409
No, they cannot.

00:08:14.433 --> 00:08:17.909
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:19.480
So now you may ask

00:08:20.504 --> 00:08:24.136
why children's lies
are so difficult to detect.

00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.970
Let me illustrate this
with my own son, Nathan.

00:08:27.994 --> 00:08:30.163
This is his facial expression

00:08:30.187 --> 00:08:31.571
when he lies.

00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:33.801
(Laughter)

00:08:33.825 --> 00:08:35.427
So when children lie,

00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:38.607
their facial expression
is typically neutral.

00:08:39.123 --> 00:08:42.583
However, behind this neutral expression,

00:08:42.607 --> 00:08:45.933
the child is actually experiencing
a lot of emotions,

00:08:45.957 --> 00:08:49.812
such as fear, guilt, shame

00:08:49.836 --> 00:08:52.932
and maybe a little bit of liar's delight.

00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:55.658
(Laughter)

00:08:55.682 --> 00:09:00.522
Unfortunately, such emotions
are either fleeting or hidden.

00:09:00.546 --> 00:09:03.645
Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us.

00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:05.028
So in the last five years,

00:09:05.052 --> 00:09:08.948
we have been trying to figure out a way
to reveal these hidden emotions.

00:09:08.972 --> 00:09:10.486
Then we made a discovery.

00:09:11.273 --> 00:09:14.458
We know that underneath our facial skin,

00:09:14.482 --> 00:09:17.876
there's a rich network of blood vessels.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.317
When we experience different emotions,

00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:22.982
our facial blood flow changes subtly.

00:09:23.613 --> 00:09:27.561
And these changes are regulated
by the autonomic system

00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:29.754
that is beyond our conscious control.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:33.982
By looking at facial blood flow changes,

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:36.703
we can reveal people's hidden emotions.

00:09:37.229 --> 00:09:42.007
Unfortunately, such emotion-related
facial blood flow changes

00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:44.656
are too subtle to detect by our naked eye.

00:09:45.632 --> 00:09:49.400
So to help us reveal
people's facial emotions,

00:09:49.424 --> 00:09:52.458
we have developed a new imaging technology

00:09:52.482 --> 00:09:55.631
we call "transdermal optical imaging."

00:09:56.679 --> 00:10:00.632
To do so, we use a regular
video camera to record people

00:10:00.656 --> 00:10:03.742
when they experience
various hidden emotions.

00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:08.479
And then, using our image
processing technology,

00:10:08.503 --> 00:10:14.039
we can extract transdermal images
of facial blood flow changes.

00:10:16.475 --> 00:10:20.747
By looking at transdermal video images,

00:10:20.771 --> 00:10:22.558
now we can easily see

00:10:23.737 --> 00:10:29.368
facial blood flow changes associated
with the various hidden emotions.

00:10:29.944 --> 00:10:31.732
And using this technology,

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:36.424
we can now reveal the hidden emotions
associated with lying,

00:10:36.448 --> 00:10:39.358
and therefore detect people's lies.

00:10:39.382 --> 00:10:41.821
We can do so noninvasively,

00:10:41.845 --> 00:10:44.384
remotely, inexpensively,

00:10:44.408 --> 00:10:48.068
with an accuracy at about 85 percent,

00:10:48.092 --> 00:10:50.146
which is far better than chance level.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.890
And in addition, we discovered
a Pinocchio effect.

00:10:56.336 --> 00:10:58.391
No, not this Pinocchio effect.

00:10:58.415 --> 00:10:59.422
(Laughter)

00:10:59.446 --> 00:11:01.568
This is the real Pinocchio effect.

00:11:01.592 --> 00:11:03.009
When people lie,

00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:06.812
the facial blood flow
on the cheeks decreases,

00:11:06.836 --> 00:11:10.097
and the facial blood flow
on the nose increases.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:14.886
Of course, lying is not the only situation

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.758
that will evoke our hidden emotions.

00:11:17.782 --> 00:11:19.656
So then we asked ourselves,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.027
in addition to detecting lies,

00:11:22.051 --> 00:11:24.384
how can our technology be used?

00:11:25.027 --> 00:11:28.573
One application is in education.

00:11:28.597 --> 00:11:33.258
For example, using this technology,
we can help this mathematics teacher

00:11:33.282 --> 00:11:36.189
to identify the student in his classroom

00:11:36.213 --> 00:11:40.958
who may experience high anxiety
about the topic he's teaching

00:11:40.982 --> 00:11:42.491
so that he can help him.

00:11:43.337 --> 00:11:46.077
And also we can use this in health care.

00:11:46.101 --> 00:11:49.469
For example, every day I Skype my parents,

00:11:49.493 --> 00:11:51.575
who live thousands of miles away.

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:53.999
And using this technology,

00:11:54.023 --> 00:11:57.505
I can not only find out
what's going on in their lives

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:03.831
but also simultaneously monitor
their heart rate, their stress level,

00:12:03.855 --> 00:12:07.080
their mood and whether or not
they are experiencing pain.

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:09.649
And perhaps in the future,

00:12:09.673 --> 00:12:12.962
their risks for heart attack
or hypertension.

00:12:13.701 --> 00:12:14.961
And you may ask:

00:12:15.472 --> 00:12:20.953
Can we use this also to reveal
politicians' emotions?

00:12:20.977 --> 00:12:22.517
(Laughter)

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.395
For example, during a debate.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.673
Well, the answer is yes.

00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:29.111
Using TV footage,

00:12:29.135 --> 00:12:33.181
we could detect
the politicians' heart rate,

00:12:33.205 --> 00:12:35.251
mood and stress,

00:12:35.275 --> 00:12:38.853
and perhaps in the future,
whether or not they are lying to us.

00:12:39.495 --> 00:12:42.491
We can also use this
in marketing research,

00:12:42.515 --> 00:12:44.366
for example, to find out

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.745
whether or not people like
certain consumer products.

00:12:49.229 --> 00:12:51.467
We can even use it in dating.

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:53.064
So for example,

00:12:53.088 --> 00:12:55.682
if your date is smiling at you,

00:12:55.706 --> 00:12:58.500
this technology can help you to determine

00:12:58.524 --> 00:13:01.131
whether she actually likes you

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:03.330
or she is just trying to be nice to you.

00:13:03.864 --> 00:13:05.559
And in this case,

00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:07.459
she is just trying to be nice to you.

00:13:07.483 --> 00:13:09.875
(Laughter)

00:13:11.244 --> 00:13:14.953
So transdermal optical imaging technology

00:13:14.977 --> 00:13:17.555
is at a very early stage of development.

00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:21.693
Many new applications will come about
that we don't know today.

00:13:22.293 --> 00:13:25.071
However, one thing I know for sure

00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:28.509
is that lying will never
be the same again.

00:13:28.533 --> 00:13:29.691
Thank you very much.

00:13:29.715 --> 00:13:31.039
Xiè xie.

00:13:31.063 --> 00:13:34.969
(Applause)
