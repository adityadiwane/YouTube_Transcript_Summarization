00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.855
In terms of invention,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.738
I'd like to tell you the tale
of one of my favorite projects.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:33.055
I think it's one of the most exciting
that I'm working on,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.800
but I think it's also the simplest.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.616
It's a project that has the potential
to make a huge impact around the world.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.056
It addresses one of the biggest
health issues on the planet,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.092
the number one cause of death
in children under five.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.840
Which is ...?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.760
Water-borne diseases?
Diarrhea? Malnutrition?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.400
No.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.496
It's breathing the smoke
from indoor cooking fires --

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.280
acute respiratory infections
caused by this.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.240
Can you believe that?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.136
I find this shocking
and somewhat appalling.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.776
Can't we make
cleaner burning cooking fuels?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.736
Can't we make better stoves?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.776
How is it that this can lead
to over two million deaths every year?

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.136
I know Bill Joy was talking to you
about the wonders of carbon nanotubes,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.976
so I'm going to talk to you
about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.216
which is charcoal.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.216
(Laughter)

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.416
So this is a picture of rural Haiti.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.736
Haiti is now 98 percent deforested.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.856
You'll see scenes like this
all over the island.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.656
It leads to all sorts
of environmental problems

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.936
and problems that affect people
throughout the nation.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.016
A couple years ago
there was severe flooding

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.660
that led to thousands of deaths --

00:01:45.684 --> 00:01:47.616
that's directly attributable to the fact

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.616
that there are no trees on the hills
to stabilize the soil.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.896
So the rains come --

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.360
they go down the rivers
and the flooding happens.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.896
Now one of the reasons
why there are so few trees is this:

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.296
people need to cook,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.416
and they harvest wood
and they make charcoal in order to do it.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.345
It's not that people are ignorant
to the environmental damage.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.989
They know perfectly well,
but they have no other choice.

00:02:10.013 --> 00:02:12.016
Fossil fuels are not available,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.936
and solar energy doesn't cook the way
that they like their food prepared.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.096
And so this is what they do.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.296
You'll find families like this who go out
into the forest to find a tree,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.200
cut it down and make charcoal out of it.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.656
So not surprisingly,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.479
there's a lot of effort that's been done
to look at alternative cooking fuels.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.416
About four years ago, I took
a team of students down to Haiti

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.856
and we worked with
Peace Corps volunteers there.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.296
This is one such volunteer

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.936
and this is a device that he had built
in the village where he worked.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.616
And the idea was
that you could take waste paper;

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.856
you could compress it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.536
and make briquettes
that could be used for fuel.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.576
But this device was very slow.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.696
So our engineering students
went to work on it

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.816
and with some very simple changes,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.896
they were able to triple
the throughput of this device.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.456
So you could imagine
they were very excited about it.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.280
And they took the briquettes back to MIT
so that they could test them.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.256
And one of the things
that they found was they didn't burn.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.056
So it was a little
discouraging to the students.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.616
(Laughter)

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.016
And in fact, if you look closely,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.640
right here you can see
it says, "US Peace Corps."

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.456
As it turns out, there actually wasn't
any waste paper in this village.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.696
And while it was a good use
of government paperwork

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.625
for this volunteer to bring it
back with him to his village,

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.736
it was 800 kilometers away.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.656
And so we thought perhaps
there might be a better way

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.880
to come up with
an alternative cooking fuel.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.896
What we wanted to do
is we wanted to make a fuel

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.256
that used something that was
readily available on the local level.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.056
You see these all over Haiti as well.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.816
They're small-scale sugar mills.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.336
And the waste product from them

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.776
after you extract the juice
from the sugarcane

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.336
is called "bagasse."

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.576
It has no other use.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.896
It has no nutritional value,
so they don't feed it to the animals.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.960
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill
until eventually they burn it.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.336
What we wanted to do was
we wanted to find a way

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.336
to harness this waste resource
and turn it into a fuel

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.336
that would be something
that people could easily cook with,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.600
something like charcoal.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.216
So over the next couple of years,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.896
students and I worked
to develop a process.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.736
So you start with the bagasse,
and then you take a very simple kiln

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.936
that you can make out of
a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.256
After some time, after setting it on fire,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.256
you seal it to restrict the oxygen
that goes into the kiln,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.280
and then you end up
with this carbonized material here.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.656
However, you can't burn this.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.375
It's too fine and it burns too quickly
to be useful for cooking.

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:49.656
So we had to try to find a way
to form it into useful briquettes.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.096
And conveniently,
one of my students was from Ghana,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.454
and he remembered a dish his mom
used to make for him called "kokonte,"

00:04:56.478 --> 00:04:59.936
which is a very sticky porridge
made out of the cassava root.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.536
And so what we did was we looked,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.656
and we found that cassava
is indeed grown in Haiti,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.816
under the name of "manioc."

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.793
In fact, it's grown all over the world --

00:05:08.817 --> 00:05:11.896
yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava,
it's all the same thing --

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.016
a very starchy root vegetable.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.256
And you can make a very thick,
sticky porridge out of it,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.416
which you can use to bind together
the charcoal briquettes.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.616
So we did this. We went down to Haiti.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.296
These are the graduates
of the first Ecole de Charbon,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.016
or Charcoal Institute.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.256
And these --

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.496
(Laughter)

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.496
That's right. So I'm actually
an instructor at MIT as well as CIT.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.600
And these are the briquettes that we made.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.440
Now I'm going to take you
to a different continent.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.536
This is India

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.776
and this is the most commonly used
cooking fuel in India.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.176
It's cow dung.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.376
And more than in Haiti,
this produces really smoky fires,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.856
and this is where you see
the health impacts

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.960
of cooking with cow dung
and biomass as a fuel.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.816
Kids and women
are especially affected by it,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.976
because they're the ones
who are around the cooking fires.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.216
So we wanted to see

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.736
if we could introduce
this charcoal-making technology there.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.176
Well, unfortunately,
they didn't have sugarcane

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.581
and they didn't have cassava,

00:06:15.605 --> 00:06:16.805
but that didn't stop us.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.216
What we did was we found what were
the locally available sources of biomass.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.616
And there was wheat straw
and there was rice straw in this area.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.256
And what we could use as a binder
was actually small amounts of cow manure,

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.520
which they used ordinarily for their fuel.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.136
And we did side-by-side tests,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.736
and here you can see
the charcoal briquettes

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.976
and here the cow dung.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.256
And you can see that it's a lot cleaner
burning of a cooking fuel.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.856
And in fact, it heats the water
a lot more quickly.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.176
And so we were very happy, thus far.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.896
But one of the things that we found

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.736
was when we did side-by-side
comparisons with wood charcoal,

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.376
it didn't burn as long.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.305
And the briquettes crumbled a little bit

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:57.496
and we lost energy as they fell apart
as they were cooking.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.736
So we wanted to try to find a way
to make a stronger briquette

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.360
so that we could compete with
wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.336
So we went back to MIT,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.576
we took out the Instron machine

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.296
and we figured out
what sort of forces you needed

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.416
in order to compress
a briquette to the level

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.298
that you actually are getting
improved performance out of it?

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.256
And at the same time that we had
students in the lab looking at this,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:28.216
we also had community partners in Haiti
working to develop the process,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.240
to improve it and make it more accessible
to people in the villages there.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.376
And after some time,

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.216
we developed a low-cost press
that allows you to produce charcoal,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.920
which actually now burns not only --

00:07:43.642 --> 00:07:46.960
actually, it burns longer,
cleaner than wood charcoal.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.936
So now we're in a situation
where we have a product,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.256
which is actually better than what
you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.000
which is a very wonderful place to be.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.696
In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees
are cut down every year.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.216
There's a possibility
of this being implemented

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.536
and saving a good portion of those.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.976
In addition, the revenue generated
from that charcoal is 260 million dollars.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.536
That's an awful lot
for a country like Haiti --

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.416
with a population of eight million

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.640
and an average income
of less than 400 dollars.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.536
So this is where we're also moving ahead
with our charcoal project.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.216
And one of the things
that I think is also interesting,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.536
is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley
who's been doing risk analysis.

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.616
And he's looked at the problem
of the health impacts

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.736
of burning wood versus charcoal.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.856
And he's found that worldwide,
you could prevent a million deaths

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.856
switching from wood
to charcoal as a cooking fuel.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.096
That's remarkable,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.576
but up until now, there weren't ways
to do it without cutting down trees.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.816
But now we have a way

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.520
that's using an agricultural
waste material to create a cooking fuel.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.976
One of the really exciting things, though,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.572
is something that came out of the trip
that I took to Ghana just last month.

00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:06.015
And I think it's the coolest thing,

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:08.279
and it's even lower tech
than what you just saw,

00:09:08.303 --> 00:09:10.336
if you can imagine such a thing.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.576
Here it is.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.800
So what is this?

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.056
This is corncobs turned into charcoal.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.223
And the beauty of this is
that you don't need to form briquettes --

00:09:19.247 --> 00:09:20.576
it comes ready made.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.456
This is my $100 laptop, right here.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.496
And actually, like Nick,
I brought samples.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.736
(Laughter)

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.520
So we can pass these around.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.604
They're fully functional,
field-tested, ready to roll out.

00:09:36.628 --> 00:09:38.334
(Laughter)

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.016
And I think one of the things

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.256
which is also remarkable
about this technology,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.056
is that the technology
transfer is so easy.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.216
Compared to the sugarcane charcoal,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.056
where we have to teach people
how to form it into briquettes

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.496
and you have the extra step
of cooking the binder,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.096
this comes pre-briquetted.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.073
And this is about the most exciting
thing in my life right now,

00:10:01.097 --> 00:10:04.296
which is perhaps
a sad commentary on my life.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.576
(Laughter)

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.136
But once you see it,
like you guys in the front row --

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.376
All right, yeah, OK.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.616
So anyway --

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.656
(Laughter)

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.896
Here it is.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.376
And this is, I think, a perfect example

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.616
of what Robert Wright was talking about
in those non-zero-sum things.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.136
So not only do you have health benefits,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.296
you have environmental benefits.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.136
But this is one
of the incredibly rare situations

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.496
where you also have economic benefits.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.576
People can make their own cooking fuel
from waste products.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.616
They can generate income from this.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.776
They can save the money
that they were going to spend on charcoal

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.277
and they can produce excess
and sell it in the market

00:10:44.301 --> 00:10:46.256
to people who aren't making their own.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.576
It's really rare
that you don't have trade-offs

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.816
between health and economics,
or environment and economics.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.576
So this is a project
that I just find extremely exciting

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.000
and I'm really looking forward
to see where it takes us.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.616
So when we talk about, now,
the future we will create,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.656
one of the things
that I think is necessary

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.640
is to have a very clear vision
of the world that we live in.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.946
And now, I don't actually mean
the world that we live in.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.016
I mean the world where women
spend two to three hours everyday

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.480
grinding grain for their families to eat.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.336
I mean the world
where advanced building materials

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.776
means cement roofing tiles
that are made by hand,

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.936
and where, when you work 10 hours a day,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.800
you're still only earning
60 dollars in a month.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.536
I mean the world

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.760
where women and children spend
40 billion hours a year fetching water.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.256
That's as if the entire workforce
of the state of California

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.776
worked full time for a year
doing nothing but fetching water.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.136
It's a place where,
for example, if this were India,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.600
in this room, only three of us
would have a car.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.576
If this were Afghanistan,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.216
only one person in this room
would know how the use the Internet.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.440
If this were Zambia --

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.216
300 of you would be farmers,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.376
100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.240
And more than half of you would be living
on less than a dollar a day.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.016
These are the issues that we
need to come up with solutions for.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.896
These are the issues that
we need to be training our engineers,

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.360
our designers, our business people,
our entrepreneurs to be facing.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.976
These are the solutions
that we need to find.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.176
I have a few areas that I believe
are especially important that we address.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.256
One of them is creating technologies

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.296
to promote micro-finance
and micro-enterprise,

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.176
so that people who are living
below the poverty line

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.736
can find a way to move out --

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.141
and that they're not doing it

00:12:52.165 --> 00:12:55.776
using the same traditional
basket making, poultry rearing, etc.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.991
But there are new technologies
and new products

00:12:58.015 --> 00:13:00.255
that they can make on a small scale.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.016
The next thing I believe

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.416
is that we need to create
technologies for poor farmers

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.680
to add value to their own crops.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.256
And we need to rethink
our development strategies,

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.536
so that we're not promoting
educational campaigns

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.936
to get them to stop being farmers,

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.736
but rather to stop being poor farmers.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.593
And we need to think
about how we can do that effectively.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.216
We need to work with the people
in these communities

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.096
and give them the resources
and the tools that they need

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.816
to solve their own problems.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.221
That's the best way to do it.

00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:35.536
We shouldn't be doing it from outside.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.720
So we need to create this future,
and we need to start doing it now.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.456
Thank you.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.736
(Applause)

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.252
Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.520
Stay here.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.256
Tell us -- just while we see
if someone has a question --

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.696
just tell us about one of the other things
that you've worked on.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.216
Amy Smith: Some of the other
things we're working on

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.417
are ways to do low-cost
water quality testing,

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:05.176
so that communities can maintain
their own water systems,

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.915
know when they're working,
know when they treat them, etc.

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:10.576
We're also looking at low-cost
water-treatment systems.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.981
One of the really exciting things
is looking at solar water disinfection

00:14:14.005 --> 00:14:16.565
and improving the ability
to be able to do that.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.256
CA: What's the bottleneck
preventing this stuff getting from scale?

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.536
Do you need to find entrepreneurs,
or venture capitalists,

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.416
or what do you need to take
what you've got and get it to scale?

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.210
AS: I think it's large numbers
of people moving it forward.

00:14:32.234 --> 00:14:33.433
It's a difficult thing --

00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:35.464
it's a marketplace
which is very fragmented

00:14:35.488 --> 00:14:37.696
and a consumer population with no income.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.976
So you can't use the same models
that you use in the United States

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.536
for making things move forward.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.576
And we're a pretty small staff,

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.816
which is me.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.816
(Laughter)

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.079
So, you know,
I do what I can with the students.

00:14:50.103 --> 00:14:52.342
We have 30 students a year
go out into the field

00:14:52.366 --> 00:14:54.816
and try to implement this
and move it forward.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.336
The other thing is you have to do things
with a long time frame,

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.296
as, you know, you can't expect to get
something done in a year or two years;

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.463
you have to be looking
five or 10 years ahead.

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:07.687
But I think with the vision to do that,
we can move forward.
