00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:15.999
"Give me liberty or give me death."

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.266
When Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia,

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.191
said these words in 1775,

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:23.094
he could never have imagined

00:00:23.094 --> 00:00:25.159
just how much they would come to resonate

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.182
with American generations to come.

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:30.847
At the time, these words were earmarked

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:33.220
and targeted against the British,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.119
but over the last 200 years, they've come to embody

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.807
what many Westerners believe,

00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:42.255
that freedom is the most cherished value,

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:45.176
and that the best systems of politics and economics

00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:47.390
have freedom embedded in them.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.184
Who could blame them?

00:00:49.184 --> 00:00:52.098
Over the past hundred years, the combination

00:00:52.098 --> 00:00:55.141
of liberal democracy and private capitalism

00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:57.561
has helped to catapult the United States

00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:58.822
and Western countries

00:00:58.822 --> 00:01:01.235
to new levels of economic development.

00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:03.953
In the United States over the past hundred years,

00:01:03.953 --> 00:01:06.343
incomes have increased 30 times,

00:01:06.343 --> 00:01:08.014
and hundreds of thousands of people

00:01:08.014 --> 00:01:10.287
have been moved out of poverty.

00:01:10.287 --> 00:01:14.320
Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.699
has helped to spur industrialization

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:20.561
and also helped in the creation and the building

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:22.352
of things like household appliances

00:01:22.352 --> 00:01:24.575
such as refrigerators and televisions,

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:28.623
motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets.

00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:31.305
It's no surprise, then, that even at the depths

00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:33.569
of the private capitalism crisis,

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.336
President Obama said,

00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:38.232
"The question before us is not whether the market

00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:40.867
is a force for good or ill.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:44.090
Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.168
is unmatched."

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:48.057
Thus, there's understandably

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:51.191
a deep-seated presumption among Westerners

00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:54.001
that the whole world will decide to adopt

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.085
private capitalism as the model of economic growth,

00:01:57.085 --> 00:01:59.392
liberal democracy, and will continue

00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:03.523
to prioritize political rights over economic rights.

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:06.373
However, to many who live in the emerging markets,

00:02:06.373 --> 00:02:09.337
this is an illusion, and even though

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.444
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

00:02:11.444 --> 00:02:13.715
which was signed in 1948,

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:16.010
was unanimously adopted,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.701
what it did was to mask a schism

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:22.207
that has emerged between developed
and developing countries,

00:02:22.224 --> 00:02:24.305
and the ideological beliefs

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:27.952
between political and economic rights.

00:02:27.952 --> 00:02:31.489
This schism has only grown wider.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.059
Today, many people who live in the emerging markets,

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.972
where 90 percent of the world's population lives,

00:02:36.972 --> 00:02:39.000
believe that the Western obsession

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.627
with political rights is beside the point,

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:43.605
and what is actually important

00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:45.826
is delivering on food, shelter,

00:02:45.826 --> 00:02:47.924
education and healthcare.

00:02:47.924 --> 00:02:50.340
"Give me liberty or give me death"

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.103
is all well and good if you can afford it,

00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:56.066
but if you're living on less than one dollar a day,

00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:58.034
you're far too busy trying to survive

00:02:58.034 --> 00:02:59.850
and to provide for your family

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.381
than to spend your time going around

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.392
trying to proclaim and defend democracy.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.239
Now, I know many people in this room

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.427
and around the world will think,

00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:11.410
"Well actually, this is hard to grasp,"

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.637
because private capitalism and liberal democracy

00:03:14.637 --> 00:03:16.903
are held sacrosanct.

00:03:16.903 --> 00:03:19.272
But I ask you today, what would you do

00:03:19.272 --> 00:03:21.083
if you had to choose?

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:22.897
What if you had to choose

00:03:22.897 --> 00:03:25.360
between a roof over your head

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.037
and the right to vote?

00:03:27.037 --> 00:03:28.630
Over the last 10 years,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.410
I've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries,

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.615
many of them in the emerging markets,

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:36.943
in Latin America, Asia,

00:03:36.943 --> 00:03:39.625
and my own continent of Africa.

00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:42.265
I've met with presidents, dissidents,

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:44.633
policymakers, lawyers, teachers,

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:46.936
doctors and the man on the street,

00:03:46.936 --> 00:03:48.619
and through these conversations,

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.419
it's become clear to me

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.347
that many people in the emerging markets

00:03:52.347 --> 00:03:55.556
believe that there's actually a split occurring

00:03:55.556 --> 00:03:58.322
between what people believe ideologically

00:03:58.322 --> 00:04:01.008
in terms of politics and economics in the West

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:03.892
and that which people believe in the rest of the world.

00:04:03.892 --> 00:04:05.763
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:04:05.763 --> 00:04:07.223
I'm not saying people in the emerging markets

00:04:07.223 --> 00:04:09.314
don't understand democracy,

00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:11.223
nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally

00:04:11.223 --> 00:04:13.708
like to pick their presidents or their leaders.

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:15.263
Of course they would.

00:04:15.263 --> 00:04:18.284
However, I am saying that on balance,

00:04:18.284 --> 00:04:19.866
they worry more about

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:22.897
where their living standard improvements are going to come from,

00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:25.180
and how it is their governments can deliver for them,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.085
than whether or not the government

00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:30.025
was elected by democracy.

00:04:30.025 --> 00:04:32.114
The fact of the matter

00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:34.579
is that this has become a very poignant question

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:36.912
because there is for the first time in a long time

00:04:36.912 --> 00:04:40.482
a real challenge to the Western ideological systems

00:04:40.482 --> 00:04:42.636
of politics and economics,

00:04:42.636 --> 00:04:45.709
and this is a system that is embodied by China.

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:49.671
And rather than have private capitalism,
they have state capitalism.

00:04:49.687 --> 00:04:53.959
Instead of liberal democracy,
they have de-prioritized the democratic system.

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:56.323
And they have also decided to prioritize

00:04:56.323 --> 00:04:59.980
economic rights over political rights.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.829
I put it to you today that it is this system

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:04.674
that is embodied by China

00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:06.634
that is gathering momentum amongst people

00:05:06.634 --> 00:05:09.722
in the emerging markets as the system to follow,

00:05:09.722 --> 00:05:11.742
because they believe increasingly

00:05:11.742 --> 00:05:13.417
that it is the system

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:16.818
that will promise the best and fastest improvements

00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:20.429
in living standards in the shortest period of time.

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:23.008
If you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments

00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:24.830
explaining to you first

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.860
why economically they've come to this belief.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.686
First of all, it's China's economic performance

00:05:31.686 --> 00:05:33.728
over the past 30 years.

00:05:33.728 --> 00:05:36.448
She's been able to produce record economic growth

00:05:36.448 --> 00:05:40.083
and meaningfully move many people out of poverty,

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:43.262
specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty

00:05:43.262 --> 00:05:46.076
by moving over 300 million people

00:05:46.076 --> 00:05:49.334
out of indigence.

00:05:49.334 --> 00:05:51.848
It's not just in economics,

00:05:51.848 --> 00:05:54.345
but it's also in terms of living standards.

00:05:54.345 --> 00:05:57.189
We see that in China, 28 percent of people

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:59.012
had secondary school access.

00:05:59.012 --> 00:06:01.389
Today, it's closer to 82 percent.

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.984
So in its totality, economic improvement

00:06:03.984 --> 00:06:06.680
has been quite significant.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.716
Second, China has been able

00:06:09.716 --> 00:06:12.852
to meaningfully improve its income inequality

00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:15.517
without changing the political construct.

00:06:15.517 --> 00:06:17.947
Today, the United States and China

00:06:17.947 --> 00:06:20.473
are the two leading economies in the world.

00:06:20.473 --> 00:06:22.722
They have vastly different political systems

00:06:22.722 --> 00:06:25.044
and different economic systems,

00:06:25.044 --> 00:06:26.514
one with private capitalism,

00:06:26.514 --> 00:06:28.953
another one broadly with state capitalism.

00:06:28.953 --> 00:06:31.026
However, these two countries

00:06:31.026 --> 00:06:33.133
have the identical GINI Coefficient,

00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:35.680
which is a measure of income equality.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.912
Perhaps what is more disturbing

00:06:37.912 --> 00:06:40.006
is that China's income equality

00:06:40.006 --> 00:06:42.327
has been improving in recent times,

00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:43.944
whereas that of the United States

00:06:43.944 --> 00:06:47.007
has been declining.

00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:49.563
Thirdly, people in the emerging markets

00:06:49.563 --> 00:06:51.957
look at China's amazing and legendary

00:06:51.957 --> 00:06:54.283
infrastructure rollout.

00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:55.942
This is not just about China

00:06:55.942 --> 00:06:58.302
building roads and ports and railways

00:06:58.302 --> 00:06:59.738
in her own country --

00:06:59.738 --> 00:07:02.826
she's been able to build 85,000 kilometers

00:07:02.826 --> 00:07:04.417
of road network in China

00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:07.365
and surpass that of the United States --

00:07:07.365 --> 00:07:10.176
but even if you look to places like Africa,

00:07:10.176 --> 00:07:13.233
China has been able to help tar the distance

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:14.887
of Cape Town to Cairo,

00:07:14.887 --> 00:07:16.512
which is 9,000 miles,

00:07:16.512 --> 00:07:20.423
or three times the distance of New York to California.

00:07:20.423 --> 00:07:24.863
Now this is something that people can see and point to.

00:07:24.863 --> 00:07:26.545
Perhaps it's no surprise

00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:30.266
that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed,

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:32.134
Africans in 10 countries said

00:07:32.134 --> 00:07:33.802
they thought that the Chinese were doing

00:07:33.802 --> 00:07:35.696
amazing things to improve their livelihoods

00:07:35.696 --> 00:07:40.194
by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.

00:07:40.194 --> 00:07:44.714
Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:48.085
to age-old social problems that the world faces.

00:07:48.085 --> 00:07:51.353
If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai,

00:07:51.353 --> 00:07:54.605
you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics

00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:56.832
continue to be a stumbling block

00:07:56.832 --> 00:07:58.933
to the delivery of medicine and healthcare

00:07:58.933 --> 00:08:00.803
in the rural areas.

00:08:00.803 --> 00:08:03.681
However, through a network of state-owned enterprises,

00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:06.577
the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas,

00:08:06.577 --> 00:08:08.067
using their companies

00:08:08.067 --> 00:08:11.339
to help deliver on these healthcare solutions.

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:13.545
Ladies and gentlemen, it's no surprise

00:08:13.545 --> 00:08:16.795
that around the world, people are pointing
at what China is doing and saying,

00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:18.937
"I like that. I want that.

00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:21.131
I want to be able to do what China's doing.

00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:23.901
That is the system that seems to work."

00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:25.574
I'm here to also tell you

00:08:25.574 --> 00:08:27.321
that there are lots of shifts occurring

00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:29.281
around what China is doing

00:08:29.281 --> 00:08:31.356
in the democratic stance.

00:08:31.356 --> 00:08:34.021
In particular, there is growing doubt

00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:36.123
among people in the emerging markets,

00:08:36.123 --> 00:08:37.830
when people now believe that democracy

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.114
is no longer to be viewed

00:08:40.114 --> 00:08:43.597
as a prerequisite for economic growth.

00:08:43.597 --> 00:08:47.838
In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile,

00:08:47.838 --> 00:08:50.746
not just China, have shown that actually,

00:08:50.746 --> 00:08:53.432
it's economic growth that is a prerequisite

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:55.196
for democracy.

00:08:55.196 --> 00:08:58.442
In a recent study, the evidence has shown

00:08:58.442 --> 00:09:00.940
that income is the greatest determinant

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.688
of how long a democracy can last.

00:09:03.688 --> 00:09:06.421
The study found that if your per capita income

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.633
is about 1,000 dollars a year,

00:09:08.633 --> 00:09:11.631
your democracy will last about eight and a half years.

00:09:11.631 --> 00:09:13.349
If your per capita income is between

00:09:13.349 --> 00:09:15.749
2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year,

00:09:15.749 --> 00:09:18.791
then you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy.

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:20.615
And only if your per capita income

00:09:20.615 --> 00:09:22.746
is above 6,000 dollars a year

00:09:22.746 --> 00:09:26.490
will you have democracy come hell or high water.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.202
What this is telling us

00:09:28.202 --> 00:09:30.775
is that we need to first establish a middle class

00:09:30.775 --> 00:09:33.892
that is able to hold the government accountable.

00:09:33.892 --> 00:09:36.267
But perhaps it's also telling us

00:09:36.267 --> 00:09:37.849
that we should be worried about going

00:09:37.849 --> 00:09:40.759
around the world and shoehorning democracy,

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:42.569
because ultimately we run the risk

00:09:42.569 --> 00:09:44.699
of ending up with illiberal democracies,

00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:46.760
democracies that in some sense

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.927
could be worse than the authoritarian governments

00:09:48.927 --> 00:09:52.614
that they seek to replace.

00:09:52.614 --> 00:09:54.880
The evidence around illiberal democracies

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.700
is quite depressing.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.146
Freedom House finds that although 50 percent

00:09:59.146 --> 00:10:02.303
of the world's countries today are democratic,

00:10:02.303 --> 00:10:05.009
70 percent of those countries are illiberal

00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:07.362
in the sense that people don't have free speech

00:10:07.362 --> 00:10:10.107
or freedom of movement.

00:10:10.107 --> 00:10:12.426
But also, we're finding from Freedom House

00:10:12.426 --> 00:10:14.547
in a study that they published last year

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:16.662
that freedom has been on the decline

00:10:16.662 --> 00:10:19.234
every year for the past seven years.

00:10:19.234 --> 00:10:21.018
What this says

00:10:21.018 --> 00:10:22.356
is that for people like me

00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:24.966
who care about liberal democracy,

00:10:24.966 --> 00:10:27.313
is we've got to find a more sustainable way

00:10:27.313 --> 00:10:29.658
of ensuring that we have a sustainable form

00:10:29.658 --> 00:10:31.859
of democracy in a liberal way,

00:10:31.859 --> 00:10:34.859
and that has its roots in economics.

00:10:34.859 --> 00:10:37.788
But it also says that as China moves

00:10:37.788 --> 00:10:40.320
toward being the largest economy in the world,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.341
something that is expected to happen

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:44.416
by experts in 2016,

00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:46.686
that this schism between the political

00:10:46.686 --> 00:10:50.048
and economic ideologies of the West and the rest

00:10:50.048 --> 00:10:52.979
is likely to widen.

00:10:52.979 --> 00:10:55.534
What might that world look like?

00:10:55.534 --> 00:10:57.096
Well, the world could look like

00:10:57.096 --> 00:11:00.361
more state involvement and state capitalism;

00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:03.200
greater protectionisms of nation-states;

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.709
but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago,

00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:07.876
ever-declining political rights

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:09.937
and individual rights.

00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:12.699
The question that is left for us in general

00:11:12.699 --> 00:11:15.815
is, what then should the West be doing?

00:11:15.815 --> 00:11:18.520
And I suggest that they have two options.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.937
The West can either compete or cooperate.

00:11:22.937 --> 00:11:26.125
If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model,

00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:28.132
and in effect go around the world

00:11:28.132 --> 00:11:30.459
and continue to try and push an agenda

00:11:30.459 --> 00:11:33.499
of private capitalism and liberal democracy,

00:11:33.499 --> 00:11:36.155
this is basically going against headwinds,

00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:38.179
but it also would be a natural stance

00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:39.640
for the West to take

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.673
because in many ways it is the antithesis

00:11:41.673 --> 00:11:43.820
of the Chinese model

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.948
of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.

00:11:47.948 --> 00:11:49.727
Now the fact of the matter is,

00:11:49.727 --> 00:11:51.685
if the West decides to compete,

00:11:51.685 --> 00:11:55.083
it will create a wider schism.

00:11:55.083 --> 00:11:57.936
The other option is for the West to cooperate,

00:11:57.936 --> 00:11:59.530
and by cooperating I mean

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.040
giving the emerging market countries the flexibility

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.087
to figure out in an organic way

00:12:05.087 --> 00:12:06.849
what political and economic system

00:12:06.849 --> 00:12:08.542
works best for them.

00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:10.272
Now I'm sure some of you in the room

00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:13.146
will be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China,

00:12:13.146 --> 00:12:15.217
and this is a way, in other words,

00:12:15.217 --> 00:12:17.129
for the West to take a back seat.

00:12:17.129 --> 00:12:18.584
But I put it to you

00:12:18.584 --> 00:12:20.934
that if the United States and European countries

00:12:20.934 --> 00:12:23.585
want to remain globally influential,

00:12:23.585 --> 00:12:25.455
they may have to consider cooperating

00:12:25.455 --> 00:12:28.004
in the short term in order to compete,

00:12:28.004 --> 00:12:30.247
and by that, they might have to focus

00:12:30.247 --> 00:12:33.482
more aggressively on economic outcomes

00:12:33.482 --> 00:12:35.191
to help create the middle class

00:12:35.191 --> 00:12:37.862
and therefore be able to hold government accountable

00:12:37.862 --> 00:12:41.889
and create the democracies that we really want.

00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:44.478
The fact of the matter is that

00:12:44.478 --> 00:12:46.381
instead of going around the world

00:12:46.381 --> 00:12:49.868
and haranguing countries for engaging with China,

00:12:49.868 --> 00:12:52.828
the West should be encouraging its own businesses

00:12:52.828 --> 00:12:55.327
to trade and invest in these regions.

00:12:55.327 --> 00:12:59.579
Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior,

00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:02.179
the West should be showing how it is

00:13:02.179 --> 00:13:04.566
that their own system of politics and economics

00:13:04.566 --> 00:13:06.716
is the superior one.

00:13:06.716 --> 00:13:08.736
And instead of shoehorning democracy

00:13:08.736 --> 00:13:10.227
around the world,

00:13:10.227 --> 00:13:11.502
perhaps the West should take a leaf

00:13:11.502 --> 00:13:13.354
out of its own history book

00:13:13.354 --> 00:13:16.204
and remember that it takes a lot of patience

00:13:16.204 --> 00:13:17.774
in order to develop the models

00:13:17.774 --> 00:13:20.107
and the systems that you have today.

00:13:20.107 --> 00:13:23.579
Indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer

00:13:23.579 --> 00:13:26.208
reminds us that it took the United States

00:13:26.208 --> 00:13:28.854
nearly 170 years

00:13:28.854 --> 00:13:31.523
from the time that the Constitution was written

00:13:31.523 --> 00:13:34.483
for there to be equal rights in the United States.

00:13:34.483 --> 00:13:35.845
Some people would argue that today

00:13:35.845 --> 00:13:37.359
there is still no equal rights.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.205
In fact, there are groups who would argue

00:13:39.205 --> 00:13:44.533
that they still do not have equal rights under the law.

00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:46.115
At its very best,

00:13:46.115 --> 00:13:48.367
the Western model speaks for itself.

00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:50.528
It's the model that put food on the table.

00:13:50.528 --> 00:13:52.119
It's the refrigerators.

00:13:52.119 --> 00:13:54.151
It put a man on the moon.

00:13:54.151 --> 00:13:55.941
But the fact of the matter is,

00:13:55.941 --> 00:13:57.591
although people back in the day

00:13:57.591 --> 00:13:59.657
used to point at the Western countries and say,

00:13:59.657 --> 00:14:01.700
"I want that, I like that,"

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.859
there's now a new person in town

00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:06.298
in the form of a country, China.

00:14:06.298 --> 00:14:08.384
Today, generations are looking at China

00:14:08.384 --> 00:14:11.024
and saying, "China can produce infrastructure,

00:14:11.024 --> 00:14:13.140
China can produce economic growth,

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.708
and we like that."

00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:17.422
Because ultimately, the question before us,

00:14:17.422 --> 00:14:19.278
and the question before

00:14:19.278 --> 00:14:20.983
seven billion people on the planet

00:14:20.983 --> 00:14:24.083
is, how can we create prosperity?

00:14:24.083 --> 00:14:26.998
People who care and will pivot towards the model

00:14:26.998 --> 00:14:28.523
of politics and economics

00:14:28.523 --> 00:14:30.090
in a very rational way,

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.555
to those models that will ensure

00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:34.536
that they can have better living standards

00:14:34.536 --> 00:14:37.159
in the shortest period of time.

00:14:37.159 --> 00:14:38.870
As you leave here today,

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.275
I would like to leave you

00:14:40.275 --> 00:14:41.928
with a very personal message,

00:14:41.928 --> 00:14:44.014
which is what it is that I believe

00:14:44.014 --> 00:14:46.418
we should be doing as individuals,

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:49.787
and this is really about being open-minded,

00:14:49.787 --> 00:14:53.126
open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams

00:14:53.126 --> 00:14:56.361
of creating prosperity for people around the world,

00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:59.285
creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty

00:14:59.285 --> 00:15:00.961
for hundreds of millions of people,

00:15:00.961 --> 00:15:03.745
has to be based in being open-minded,

00:15:03.745 --> 00:15:05.972
because these systems have good things

00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:08.449
and they have bad things.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:10.158
Just to illustrate,

00:15:10.158 --> 00:15:12.644
I went into my annals of myself.

00:15:12.644 --> 00:15:14.426
That's a picture of me.

00:15:14.426 --> 00:15:16.666
Awww. (Laughter)

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:20.892
I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969.

00:15:20.892 --> 00:15:22.839
At the time of my birth,

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.921
blacks were not issued birth certificates,

00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:27.265
and that law only changed in 1973.

00:15:27.265 --> 00:15:30.410
This is an affidavit from the Zambian government.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.862
I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years,

00:15:32.862 --> 00:15:35.747
I've gone from not being recognized as a human being

00:15:35.747 --> 00:15:38.694
to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today

00:15:38.694 --> 00:15:41.272
to talk to you about my views.

00:15:41.272 --> 00:15:44.996
In this vein, we can increase economic growth.

00:15:44.996 --> 00:15:48.413
We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty.

00:15:48.413 --> 00:15:50.614
But also, it's going to require

00:15:50.614 --> 00:15:52.608
that we look at our assumptions,

00:15:52.608 --> 00:15:54.835
assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with

00:15:54.835 --> 00:15:56.814
around democracy, around private capitalism,

00:15:56.814 --> 00:15:58.749
around what creates economic growth

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:01.381
and reduces poverty and creates freedoms.

00:16:01.381 --> 00:16:03.258
We might have to tear those books up

00:16:03.258 --> 00:16:05.829
and start to look at other options

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:08.686
and be open-minded to seek the truth.

00:16:08.686 --> 00:16:10.933
Ultimately, it's about transforming the world

00:16:10.933 --> 00:16:12.619
and making it a better place.

00:16:12.619 --> 00:16:14.837
Thank you very much.

00:16:14.837 --> 00:16:18.437
(Applause)
