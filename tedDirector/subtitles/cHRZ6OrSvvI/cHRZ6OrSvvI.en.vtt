00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:16.924
When you grow up in a developing country
like India, as I did,

00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:23.107
you instantly learn to get more value
from limited resources

00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:27.237
and find creative ways to reuse
what you already have.

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:32.005
Take Mansukh Prajapati,
a potter in India.

00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:37.977
He has created a fridge
made entirely of clay

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:40.275
that consumes no electricity.

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:44.130
He can keep fruits and vegetables
fresh for many days.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.680
That's a cool invention, literally.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.906
In Africa, if you run out of
your cell phone battery, don't panic.

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:55.920
You will find some
resourceful entrepreneurs

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.565
who can recharge your 
cell phone using bicycles.

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:00.698
And since we are in South America,

00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:03.842
let's go to Lima in Peru,

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:06.466
a region with high humidity

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:11.230
that receives only one inch
of rainfall each year.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.124
An engineering college in Lima
designed a giant advertising billboard

00:01:18.124 --> 00:01:24.787
that absorbs air humidity
and converts it into purified water,

00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:29.664
generating over 90 liters
of water every day.

00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:31.751
The Peruvians are amazing.

00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:36.432
They can literally create
water out of thin air.

00:01:36.432 --> 00:01:38.476
For the past seven years,

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:42.252
I have met and studied
hundreds of entrepreneurs

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:48.840
in India, China, Africa and South America,
and they keep amazing me.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.041
Many of them did not go to school.

00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:55.517
They don't invent stuff in big R&amp;D labs.

00:01:55.517 --> 00:01:58.550
The street is the lab.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.059
Why do they do that?

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:04.526
Because they don't have the kind
of basic resources we take for granted,

00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:06.367
like capital and energy,

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:09.315
and basic services
like healthcare and education

00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:12.958
are also scarce in those regions.

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:18.945
When external resources are scarce,
you have to go within yourself

00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:22.905
to tap the most abundant
resource, human ingenuity,

00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:29.700
and use that ingenuity to find clever ways
to solve problems with limited resources.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.986
In India, we call it Jugaad.

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:36.162
Jugaad is a Hindi word

00:02:36.162 --> 00:02:42.190
that means an improvised fix,
a clever solution born in adversity.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.824
Jugaad solutions are not
sophisticated or perfect,

00:02:46.824 --> 00:02:49.623
but they create more value at lower cost.

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:53.812
For me, the entrepreneurs
who will create Jugaad solutions

00:02:53.812 --> 00:02:55.786
are like alchemists.

00:02:55.786 --> 00:02:59.849
They can magically transform
adversity into opportunity,

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.350
and turn something of less value
into something of high value.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.318
In other words, they mastered the art
of doing more with less,

00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:17.287
which is the essence of frugal innovation.

00:03:17.287 --> 00:03:22.917
Frugal innovation is the ability 
to create more economic and social value

00:03:22.917 --> 00:03:26.277
using fewer resources.

00:03:26.277 --> 00:03:32.104
Frugal innovation is not about making do;
it's about making things better.

00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:38.210
Now I want to show you how,
across emerging markets,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.109
entrepreneurs and companies are adopting 
frugal innovation on a larger scale

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.565
to cost-effectively deliver healthcare
and energy to billions of people

00:03:47.565 --> 00:03:52.440
who may have little income
but very high aspirations.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.180
Let's first go to China,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.197
where the country's largest
I.T. service provider, Neusoft,

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:02.030
has developed a telemedicine solution

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.722
to help doctors in cities
remotely treat old and poor patients

00:04:06.722 --> 00:04:08.553
in Chinese villages.

00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:13.198
This solution is based on
simple-to-use medical devices

00:04:13.198 --> 00:04:18.355
that less qualified health workers
like nurses can use in rural clinics.

00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:22.370
China desperately needs
these frugal medical solutions

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:29.568
because by 2050 it will be home
to over half a billion senior citizens.

00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:32.516
Now let's go to Kenya,

00:04:32.516 --> 00:04:38.507
a country where half the population
uses M-Pesa, a mobile payment solution.

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:41.247
This is a great solution
for the African continent

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:45.332
because 80 percent of Africans
don't have a bank account,

00:04:45.332 --> 00:04:50.031
but what is exciting is that M-Pesa
is now becoming the source

00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:54.650
of other disruptive business models
in sectors like energy.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.468
Take M-KOPA, the home solar solution
that comes literally in a box

00:05:00.468 --> 00:05:05.463
that has a solar rooftop panel,
three LED lights,

00:05:05.463 --> 00:05:08.687
a solar radio, and a cell phone charger.

00:05:08.687 --> 00:05:14.915
The whole kit, though, costs 200 dollars,
which is too expensive for most Kenyans,

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:20.858
and this is where mobile telephony
can make the solution more affordable.

00:05:20.858 --> 00:05:27.011
Today, you can buy this kit by making
an initial deposit of just 35 dollars,

00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:32.398
and then pay off the rest by making
a daily micro-payment of 45 cents

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:34.790
using your mobile phone.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.712
Once you've made 365 micro-payments,
the system is unlocked,

00:05:39.713 --> 00:05:45.958
and you own the product and you start 
receiving clean, free electricity.

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.280
This is an amazing solution for Kenya,

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.530
where 70 percent of people
live off the grid.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.128
This shows that with frugal innovation

00:05:56.128 --> 00:06:01.120
what matters is that you take what is
most abundant, mobile connectivity,

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.191
to deal with what is scarce,
which is energy.

00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:10.761
With frugal innovation,
the global South is actually catching up

00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:14.288
and in some cases 
even leap-frogging the North.

00:06:14.288 --> 00:06:19.480
Instead of building expensive hospitals,
China is using telemedicine

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.109
to cost-effectively treat
millions of patients,

00:06:23.109 --> 00:06:27.799
and Africa, instead of building
banks and electricity grids,

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:33.116
is going straight to mobile payments
and distributed clean energy.

00:06:33.116 --> 00:06:39.875
Frugal innovation is diametrically opposed
to the way we innovate in the North.

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:41.521
I live in Silicon Valley,

00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:44.934
where we keep chasing
the next big technology thing.

00:06:44.934 --> 00:06:49.578
Think of the iPhone 5, 6, then 7, 8.

00:06:49.578 --> 00:06:53.967
Companies in the West spend
billions of dollars investing in R&amp;D,

00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:58.431
and use tons of natural resources
to create ever more complex products,

00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:01.767
to differentiate their brands
from competition,

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:05.854
and they charge customers
more money for new features.

00:07:05.854 --> 00:07:12.095
So the conventional business model 
in the West is more for more.

00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:18.744
But sadly, this more for more model
is running out of gas, for three reasons:

00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:22.890
First, a big portion
of customers in the West

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.872
because of the diminishing
purchasing power,

00:07:25.872 --> 00:07:28.702
can no longer afford
these expensive products.

00:07:28.702 --> 00:07:33.820
Second, we are running out of
natural water and oil.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.721
In California, where I live,
water scarcity is becoming a big problem.

00:07:37.721 --> 00:07:40.338
And third, most importantly,

00:07:40.338 --> 00:07:42.713
because of the growing income disparity

00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:45.773
between the rich 
and the middle class in the West,

00:07:45.773 --> 00:07:49.191
there is a big disconnect
between existing products and services

00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:51.372
and basic needs of customers.

00:07:51.372 --> 00:07:53.270
Do you know that today,

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.036
there are over 70 million Americans
today who are underbanked,

00:07:58.036 --> 00:08:01.358
because existing banking services

00:08:01.358 --> 00:08:05.616
are not designed to address
their basic needs.

00:08:05.616 --> 00:08:09.508
The prolonged economic crisis
in the West is making people think

00:08:09.508 --> 00:08:12.782
that they are about to lose
the high standard of living

00:08:12.782 --> 00:08:15.638
and face deprivation.

00:08:15.638 --> 00:08:20.096
I believe that the only way we can sustain
growth and prosperity in the West

00:08:20.096 --> 00:08:23.597
is if we learn to do more with less.

00:08:23.597 --> 00:08:26.635
The good news is,
that's starting to happen.

00:08:26.635 --> 00:08:30.150
Several Western companies
are now adopting frugal innovation

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.515
to create affordable products
for Western consumers.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.945
Let me give you two examples.

00:08:36.945 --> 00:08:38.718
When I first saw this building,

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:41.875
I told myself it's some
kind of postmodern house.

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:47.123
Actually, it's a small manufacturing plant
set up by Grameen Danone,

00:08:47.123 --> 00:08:50.579
a joint venture between 
Grameen Bank of Muhammad Yunus

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:52.515
and the food multinational Danone

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:55.830
to make high-quality yogurt in Bangladesh.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.774
This factory is 10 percent the size
of existing Danone factories

00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:02.536
and cost much less to build.

00:09:02.536 --> 00:09:06.070
I guess you can call it a low-fat factory.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.760
Now this factory, unlike Western factories
that are highly automated,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.828
relies a lot on manual processes in order 
to generate jobs for local communities.

00:09:17.493 --> 00:09:19.769
Danone was so inspired by this model

00:09:19.769 --> 00:09:23.749
that combines economic efficiency
and social sustainability,

00:09:23.749 --> 00:09:28.121
they are planning to roll it out
in other parts of the world as well.

00:09:28.121 --> 00:09:30.123
Now, when you see this example,

00:09:30.123 --> 00:09:33.917
you might be thinking, "Well,
frugal innovation is low tech."

00:09:33.917 --> 00:09:35.560
Actually, no.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.782
Frugal innovation is also
about making high tech

00:09:38.782 --> 00:09:41.963
more affordable and more
accessible to more people.

00:09:41.963 --> 00:09:43.787
Let me give you an example.

00:09:43.787 --> 00:09:46.993
In China, the R&amp;D engineers
of Siemens Healthcare

00:09:46.993 --> 00:09:51.986
have designed a C.T. scanner
that is easy enough to be used

00:09:51.986 --> 00:09:55.709
by less qualified health workers,
like nurses and technicians.

00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:59.517
This device can scan
more patients on a daily basis,

00:09:59.517 --> 00:10:01.792
and yet consumes less energy,

00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:05.713
which is great for hospitals,
but it's also great for patients

00:10:05.713 --> 00:10:10.406
because it reduces the cost
of treatment by 30 percent

00:10:10.406 --> 00:10:14.052
and radiation dosage by up to 60 percent.

00:10:14.052 --> 00:10:17.674
This solution was initially designed
for the Chinese market,

00:10:17.674 --> 00:10:21.691
but now it's selling like hotcakes
in the U.S. and Europe,

00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:27.302
where hospitals are pressured
to deliver quality care at lower cost.

00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:30.584
But the frugal innovation revolution

00:10:30.584 --> 00:10:34.833
in the West is actually led
by creative entrepreneurs

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:36.992
who are coming up with amazing solutions

00:10:36.992 --> 00:10:40.175
to address basic needs
in the U.S. and Europe.

00:10:40.175 --> 00:10:43.377
Let me quickly give you
three examples of startups

00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:45.049
that personally inspire me.

00:10:45.049 --> 00:10:48.657
The first one happens to be launched
by my neighbor in Silicon Valley.

00:10:48.657 --> 00:10:50.506
It's called gThrive.

00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:54.337
They make these wireless sensors
designed like plastic rulers

00:10:54.337 --> 00:10:57.146
that farmers can stick
in different parts of the field

00:10:57.146 --> 00:11:01.070
and start collecting detailed
information like soil conditions.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:06.085
This dynamic data allows farmers
to optimize use of water energy

00:11:06.085 --> 00:11:10.335
while improving quality
of the products and the yields,

00:11:10.335 --> 00:11:14.964
which is a great solution for California,
which faces major water shortage.

00:11:14.964 --> 00:11:17.463
It pays for itself within one year.

00:11:17.463 --> 00:11:21.108
Second example is Be-Bound,
also in Silicon Valley,

00:11:21.108 --> 00:11:23.732
that enables you
to connect to the Internet

00:11:23.732 --> 00:11:28.681
even in no-bandwidth areas
where there's no wi-fi or 3G or 4G.

00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:30.164
How do they do that?

00:11:30.164 --> 00:11:36.568
They simply use SMS, a basic technology,
but that happens to be the most reliable

00:11:36.568 --> 00:11:38.970
and most widely available
around the world.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.280
Three billion people today with 
cell phones can't access the Internet.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.788
This solution can connect them
to the Internet in a frugal way.

00:11:46.788 --> 00:11:50.573
And in France, there is
a startup calle Compte Nickel,

00:11:53.174 --> 00:11:57.167
It allows thousands of people
to walk into a Mom and Pop store

00:11:57.167 --> 00:12:01.486
and in just five minutes activate
the service that gives them two products:

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:05.716
an international bank account number
and an international debit card.

00:12:05.716 --> 00:12:10.256
They charge a flat annual 
maintenance fee of just 20 Euros.

00:12:10.256 --> 00:12:12.558
That means you can do
all banking transactions --

00:12:12.558 --> 00:12:14.953
send and receive money,
pay with your debit card --

00:12:14.953 --> 00:12:17.321
all with no additional charge.

00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:21.222
This is what I call low-cost banking
without the bank.

00:12:21.222 --> 00:12:25.665
Amazingly, 75 percent
of the customers using this service

00:12:25.665 --> 00:12:30.463
are the middle-class French
who can't afford high banking fees.

00:12:30.463 --> 00:12:34.875
Now, I talked about frugal innovation,
initially pioneered in the South,

00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:36.965
now being adopted in the North.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.333
Ultimately, we would like to see

00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:41.678
developed countries
and developing countries

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.743
come together and co-create
frugal solutions

00:12:44.743 --> 00:12:47.135
that benefit the entire humanity.

00:12:47.135 --> 00:12:49.923
The exciting news is
that's starting to happen.

00:12:49.923 --> 00:12:52.547
Let's go to Nairobi to find that out.

00:12:52.547 --> 00:12:56.167
Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams.

00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:59.082
When I first saw them,
I thought, "Holy cow."

00:12:59.082 --> 00:13:04.258
Literally, because you have to dodge cows
as well when you drive in Nairobi.

00:13:04.258 --> 00:13:06.186
To ease the situation,

00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:12.707
the engineers at the IBM lab in Kenya
are piloting a solution called Megaffic,

00:13:12.707 --> 00:13:17.250
which initially was designed
by the Japanese engineers.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:22.424
Unlike in the West, Megaffic
doesn't rely on roadside sensors,

00:13:22.424 --> 00:13:24.702
which are very expensive
to install in Nairobi.

00:13:24.702 --> 00:13:28.397
Instead they process images, traffic data,

00:13:28.397 --> 00:13:34.026
collected from a small number of
low-resolution webcams in Nairobi streets,

00:13:34.026 --> 00:13:38.216
and then they use analytic software
to predict congestion points,

00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:42.117
and they can SMS drivers
alternate routes to take.

00:13:42.117 --> 00:13:46.459
Granted, Megaffic is not
as sexy as self-driving cars,

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:51.446
but it promises to take Nairobi drivers
from point A to point B

00:13:51.446 --> 00:13:54.696
at least 20 percent faster.

00:13:54.696 --> 00:14:01.412
And earlier this year, UCLA Health
launched its Global Lab for Innovation,

00:14:01.412 --> 00:14:06.087
which seeks to identify frugal healthcare 
solutions anywhere in the world

00:14:06.087 --> 00:14:11.474
that will be at least 20 percent cheaper
than existing solutions in the U.S.

00:14:11.474 --> 00:14:13.584
and yet more effective.

00:14:13.584 --> 00:14:18.339
It also tries to bring together
innovators from North and South

00:14:18.339 --> 00:14:22.857
to cocreate affordable healthcare
solutions for all of humanity.

00:14:24.027 --> 00:14:28.300
I gave tons of examples of frugal
innovators from around the world,

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.328
but the question is, how do you go about
adopting frugal innovation?

00:14:32.328 --> 00:14:35.923
Well, I gleaned out three principles
from frugal innovators around the world

00:14:35.923 --> 00:14:37.669
that I want to share with you

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:39.940
that you can apply
in your own organization

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.649
to do more with less.

00:14:42.649 --> 00:14:46.829
The first principle is: Keep it simple.

00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:49.870
Don't create solutions
to impress customers.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.121
Make them easy enough to use
and widely accessible,

00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:56.128
like the C.T. scanner we saw in China.

00:14:56.128 --> 00:15:00.319
Second principle: 
Do not reinvent the wheel.

00:15:00.319 --> 00:15:04.405
Try to leverage existing resources
and assets that are widely available,

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:08.399
like using mobile telephony
to offer clean energy

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:12.091
or Mom and Pop stores
to offer banking services.

00:15:12.091 --> 00:15:16.381
Third principle is:
Think and act horizontally.

00:15:16.381 --> 00:15:19.567
Companies tend to scale up vertically

00:15:19.567 --> 00:15:23.097
by centralizing operations
in big factories and warehouses,

00:15:23.097 --> 00:15:27.253
but if you want to be agile and deal
with immense customer diversity,

00:15:27.253 --> 00:15:32.052
you need to scale out horizontally
using a distributed supply chain

00:15:32.052 --> 00:15:34.906
with smaller manufacturing
and distribution units,

00:15:34.906 --> 00:15:39.164
like Grameen Bank has shown.

00:15:39.164 --> 00:15:44.379
The South pioneered frugal innovation
out of sheer necessity.

00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:48.684
The North is now learning to do
more and better with less

00:15:48.684 --> 00:15:51.958
as it faces resource constraints.

00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:57.321
As an Indian-born French national
who lives in the United States,

00:15:57.321 --> 00:16:03.702
my hope is that we transcend
this artificial North-South divide

00:16:03.702 --> 00:16:06.043
so that we can harness
the collective ingenuity

00:16:06.043 --> 00:16:08.397
of innovators from around the world

00:16:08.397 --> 00:16:11.021
to cocreate frugal solutions

00:16:11.021 --> 00:16:15.479
that will improve the quality of life
of everyone in the world,

00:16:15.479 --> 00:16:18.358
while preserving our precious planet.

00:16:18.358 --> 00:16:20.448
Thank you very much.

00:16:20.448 --> 00:16:24.046
(Applause)
