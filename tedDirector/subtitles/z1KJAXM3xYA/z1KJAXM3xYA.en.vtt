00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I would like to tell you all

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
that you are all actually cyborgs,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
but not the cyborgs that you think.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
or use one of your cell phone devices.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
So what's a good definition for cyborg?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Well, traditional definition is "an organism

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
to which exogenous components have been added

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
for the purpose of adapting to new environments."

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
People aren't supposed to be there.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
so they can go to the Alps one day

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and then become a fish in the sea the next.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Somebody goes to another country,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
says, "How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
how curious their culture is."

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and we think it's very exotic.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Well, what's happening

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
is that we've suddenly found a new species.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
and look at these fascinating cultures,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and look at these curious rituals

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
that everybody's doing around this technology.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
They're clicking on things and staring at screens."

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Now there's a reason why I study this,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
versus traditional anthropology.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And the reason is that tool use,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
everything has been a physical modification of self.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
It has helped us to extend our physical selves,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
go faster, hit things harder,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and there's been a limit on that.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
but an extension of the mental self,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
and because of that, we're able to travel faster,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
communicate differently.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And the other thing that happens

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and then we can take anything out.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
What does the inside of your computer actually look like?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
that you're carrying around all the time.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And if you actually lose that information,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
that you suddenly feel like something's missing,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and people are interacting with your second self

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
when you're not there.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And so you have to be careful

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
about leaving your front lawn open,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
which is basically your Facebook wall,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night --

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
because it's very much the equivalent.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
You have to present yourself in digital life

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
in a similar way that you would in your analog life.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
you have to learn to do that for your digital self.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And the problem is that a lot of people now,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
especially adolescents,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
have to go through two adolescences.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
and then they go through their second self's adolescence,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and that's even more awkward

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
because there's an actual history

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
of what they've gone through online.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And anybody coming in new to technology

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
is an adolescent online right now,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and so it's very awkward,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and it's very difficult for them to do those things.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And I said, "Great."

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And he said one day, "What's the shortest distance between two points?"

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And I said, "Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday."

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
I thought I was very clever.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
He said, "No, no, no. Here's a better way."

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
He took a piece of paper,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
drew A and B on one side and the other

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
and folded them together so where A and B touched.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
And he said, "That is the shortest distance between two points."

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And I said, "Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?"

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
He said, "Well, you just bend time and space,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
it takes an awful lot of energy,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and that's just how you do it."

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And I said, "I want to do that."

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And he said, "Well, okay."

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
I was thinking at night,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
to make things accelerate faster.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And I want to make a time machine."

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
I was always sending messages to my future self

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
using tape recorders.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
But then what I realized when I went to college

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
is that technology doesn't just get adopted

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
because it works.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
It gets adopted because people use it

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
and it's made for humans.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
So I started studying anthropology.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
They weren't physically transporting themselves;

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
they were mentally transporting themselves.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
They would click on a button,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
and they would be connected as A to B immediately.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And I thought, "Oh, wow. I found it. This is great."

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
So over time, time and space

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
have compressed because of this.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
You can stand on one side of the world,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
whisper something and be heard on the other.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
One of the other ideas that comes around

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And because of that, you start to dig around

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
for your external memories -- where did you leave them?

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
So now we're all these paleontologists

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
that are digging for things that we've lost

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And that incites a sort of panic architecture --

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
"Oh no, where's this thing?"

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
We're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
and we can't keep up.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And so what happens is,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
when we bring all that into the social space,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
we end up checking our phones all the time.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
It's not that we're always connected to everybody,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
the room would be very crowded.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
These are the people that you have access to right now, in general --

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
One I'm really worried about

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and that they aren't slowing down and stopping,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
being around all those people in the room all the time

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
that are trying to compete for their attention

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
on the simultaneous time interfaces,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
paleontology and panic architecture.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
They're not just sitting there.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
And really, when you have no external input,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
that is a time when there is a creation of self,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
when you can do long-term planning,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
when you can try and figure out who you really are.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And then, once you do that, you can figure out

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
how to present your second self in a legitimate way,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in --

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
And so this is very important.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
I'm really worried that, especially kids today,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
they're not going to be dealing with this down-time,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
and that everything comes to them,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
It has its own external prosthetic devices,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and these devices are helping us all

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
to communicate and interact with each other.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
But when you actually visualize it,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
all the connections that we're doing right now --

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
this is an image of the mapping of the Internet --

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
it doesn't look technological.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
It actually looks very organic.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
This is the first time in the entire history of humanity

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
that we've connected in this way.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
And it's not that machines are taking over.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
It's that they're helping us to be more human,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
helping us to connect with each other.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
The most successful technology gets out of the way

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and helps us live our lives.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And really,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
it ends up being more human than technology,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
because we're co-creating each other all the time.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
And so this is the important point that I like to study:

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection --

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
it's just done in a different way.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
We're just increasing our humanness

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
So that's why I study cyborg anthropology.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Thank you.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.260
(Applause)
