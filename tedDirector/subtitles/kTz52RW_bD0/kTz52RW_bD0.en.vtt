00:00:12.843 --> 00:00:17.598
What if I told you that time has a race,

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:20.382
a race in the contemporary way
that we understand race

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:21.956
in the United States?

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.342
Typically, we talk about race
in terms of black and white issues.

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.222
In the African-American communities
from which I come,

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:33.038
we have a long-standing
multi-generational joke

00:00:33.062 --> 00:00:35.599
about what we call "CP time,"

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:37.496
or "colored people's time."

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.360
Now, we no longer refer
to African-Americans as "colored,"

00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:43.146
but this long-standing joke

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.543
about our perpetual lateness to church,

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:47.249
to cookouts, to family events

00:00:47.273 --> 00:00:49.890
and even to our own funerals, remains.

00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:53.750
I personally am a stickler for time.

00:00:53.774 --> 00:00:56.462
It's almost as if my mother,
when I was growing up, said,

00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:58.412
"We will not be those black people."

00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:01.101
So we typically arrive to events
30 minutes early.

00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:06.895
But today, I want to talk to you
more about the political nature of time,

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:08.838
for if time had a race,

00:01:08.862 --> 00:01:10.200
it would be white.

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:13.147
White people own time.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.859
I know, I know.

00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:19.755
Making such "incendiary statements"
makes us uncomfortable:

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:24.171
Haven't we moved past the point
where race really matters?

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:27.282
Isn't race a heavy-handed concept?

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.837
Shouldn't we go ahead
with our enlightened, progressive selves

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.496
and relegate useless concepts like race
to the dustbins of history?

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.592
How will we ever get over racism
if we keep on talking about race?

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:45.183
Perhaps we should lock up our concepts
of race in a time capsule,

00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:48.128
bury them and dig them up
in a thousand years,

00:01:48.152 --> 00:01:50.520
peer at them with the clearly
more enlightened,

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:53.535
raceless versions of ourselves
that belong to the future.

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:55.611
But you see there,

00:01:55.635 --> 00:02:00.226
that desire to mitigate the impact
of race and racism shows up

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.564
in how we attempt to manage time,

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:04.648
in the ways we narrate history,

00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:07.818
in the ways we attempt to shove
the negative truths of the present

00:02:07.842 --> 00:02:09.000
into the past,

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:12.080
in the ways we attempt to argue
that the future that we hope for

00:02:12.104 --> 00:02:14.316
is the present in which
we're currently living.

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.351
Now, when Barack Obama
became President of the US in 2008,

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:21.365
many Americans declared
that we were post-racial.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.449
I'm from the academy

00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:25.904
where we're enamored
with being post-everything.

00:02:26.304 --> 00:02:30.446
We're postmodern, we're post-structural,
we're post-feminist.

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.625
"Post" has become
a simple academic appendage

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:35.589
that we apply to a range of terms

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:37.227
to mark the way we were.

00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:42.307
But prefixes alone don't have the power
to make race and racism

00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:44.091
a thing of the past.

00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:46.077
The US was never "pre-race."

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.650
So to claim that we're post-race when we
have yet to grapple with the impact

00:02:50.674 --> 00:02:53.572
of race on black people,
Latinos or the indigenous

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:55.198
is disingenuous.

00:02:55.902 --> 00:02:58.771
Just about the moment
we were preparing to celebrate

00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:00.166
our post-racial future,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.145
our political conditions became
the most racial they've been

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.511
in the last 50 years.

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.782
So today, I want to offer to you
three observations,

00:03:08.806 --> 00:03:12.192
about the past, the present
and the future of time,

00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:16.335
as it relates to the combating
of racism and white dominance.

00:03:16.817 --> 00:03:18.797
First: the past.

00:03:19.622 --> 00:03:21.509
Time has a history,

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.500
and so do black people.

00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:26.190
But we treat time as though
it is timeless,

00:03:26.214 --> 00:03:28.618
as though it has always been this way,

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:30.931
as though it doesn't have
a political history

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:33.165
bound up with the plunder
of indigenous lands,

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.138
the genocide of indigenous people

00:03:35.162 --> 00:03:37.812
and the stealing of Africans
from their homeland.

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.678
When white male European philosophers

00:03:40.702 --> 00:03:45.702
first thought to conceptualize
time and history, one famously declared,

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:49.269
"[Africa] is no historical
part of the World."

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.864
He was essentially saying

00:03:51.888 --> 00:03:54.255
that Africans were people
outside of history

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.765
who had had no impact on time

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:58.438
or the march of progress.

00:03:58.923 --> 00:04:03.368
This idea, that black people
have had no impact on history,

00:04:03.392 --> 00:04:06.864
is one of the foundational ideas
of white supremacy.

00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:11.722
It's the reason that Carter G. Woodson
created "Negro History Week" in 1926.

00:04:11.746 --> 00:04:14.861
It's the reason that we continue
to celebrate Black History Month

00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:17.453
in the US every February.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.950
Now, we also see this idea

00:04:20.974 --> 00:04:25.497
that black people are people either
alternately outside of the bounds of time

00:04:25.521 --> 00:04:27.029
or stuck in the past,

00:04:27.053 --> 00:04:29.928
in a scenario where,
much as I'm doing right now,

00:04:29.952 --> 00:04:34.078
a black person stands up and insists
that racism still matters,

00:04:34.102 --> 00:04:36.428
and a person, usually white,

00:04:36.452 --> 00:04:37.618
says to them,

00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:39.206
"Why are you stuck in the past?

00:04:39.602 --> 00:04:41.079
Why can't you move on?

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.811
We have a black president.

00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:45.261
We're past all that."

00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:48.780
William Faulkner famously said,

00:04:48.804 --> 00:04:50.899
"The past is never dead.

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.435
It's not even past."

00:04:53.816 --> 00:04:56.905
But my good friend
Professor Kristie Dotson says,

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:00.178
"Our memory is longer than our lifespan."

00:05:01.024 --> 00:05:03.326
We carry, all of us,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.051
family and communal
hopes and dreams with us.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.782
We don't have the luxury
of letting go of the past.

00:05:13.806 --> 00:05:15.725
But sometimes,

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.734
our political conditions are so troubling

00:05:17.758 --> 00:05:19.947
that we don't know
if we're living in the past

00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:22.064
or we're living in the present.

00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:24.763
Take, for instance,
when Black Lives Matter protesters

00:05:24.787 --> 00:05:28.808
go out to protest unjust killings
of black citizens by police,

00:05:28.832 --> 00:05:31.933
and the pictures that emerge
from the protest

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:34.520
look like they could have been
taken 50 years ago.

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:37.813
The past won't let us go.

00:05:38.516 --> 00:05:42.467
But still, let us press our way
into the present.

00:05:43.357 --> 00:05:45.789
At present, I would argue

00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:48.150
that the racial struggles
we are experiencing

00:05:48.174 --> 00:05:51.251
are clashes over time and space.

00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:53.390
What do I mean?

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.039
Well, I've already told you
that white people own time.

00:05:57.662 --> 00:06:00.737
Those in power dictate
the pace of the workday.

00:06:01.413 --> 00:06:04.802
They dictate how much money
our time is actually worth.

00:06:05.793 --> 00:06:07.935
And Professor George Lipsitz argues

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:11.870
that white people even dictate
the pace of social inclusion.

00:06:11.894 --> 00:06:14.650
They dictate how long
it will actually take

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:18.658
for minority groups to receive the rights
that they have been fighting for.

00:06:19.135 --> 00:06:21.993
Let me loop back to the past quickly
to give you an example.

00:06:22.921 --> 00:06:25.064
If you think about
the Civil Rights Movement

00:06:25.088 --> 00:06:28.021
and the cries of its leaders
for "Freedom Now,"

00:06:28.045 --> 00:06:31.414
they were challenging the slow pace
of white social inclusion.

00:06:32.137 --> 00:06:36.165
By 1965, the year
the Voting Rights Act was passed,

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:37.819
there had been a full 100 years

00:06:37.843 --> 00:06:39.686
between the end of the Civil War

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.856
and the conferral of voting rights
on African-American communities.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.095
Despite the urgency of a war,

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.466
it still took a full 100 years
for actual social inclusion to occur.

00:06:50.318 --> 00:06:52.253
Since 2012,

00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:55.954
conservative state legislatures
across the US have ramped up attempts

00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:58.167
to roll back African-American
voting rights

00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.666
by passing restrictive voter ID laws

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.255
and curtailing early voting opportunities.

00:07:03.672 --> 00:07:07.622
This past July, a federal court
struck down North Carolina's voter ID law

00:07:07.646 --> 00:07:12.819
saying it "... targeted African-Americans
with surgical precision."

00:07:14.425 --> 00:07:17.837
Restricting African-American inclusion
in the body politic

00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:22.853
is a primary way that we attempt
to manage and control people

00:07:22.877 --> 00:07:25.396
by managing and controlling time.

00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:29.576
But another place that we see
these time-space clashes

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.068
is in gentrifying cities
like Atlanta, Brooklyn,

00:07:33.092 --> 00:07:36.559
Philadelphia, New Orleans
and Washington, DC --

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:40.207
places that have had
black populations for generations.

00:07:40.231 --> 00:07:43.523
But now, in the name
of urban renewal and progress,

00:07:43.547 --> 00:07:45.534
these communities are pushed out,

00:07:45.558 --> 00:07:48.152
in service of bringing them
into the 21st century.

00:07:48.724 --> 00:07:51.972
Professor Sharon Holland asked:

00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:55.663
What happens when a person
who exists in time

00:07:55.687 --> 00:07:59.114
meets someone who only occupies space?

00:08:00.717 --> 00:08:02.312
These racial struggles

00:08:02.336 --> 00:08:05.916
are battles over those
who are perceived to be space-takers

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.861
and those who are perceived
to be world-makers.

00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:12.850
Those who control the flow
and thrust of history

00:08:12.874 --> 00:08:16.447
are considered world-makers
who own and master time.

00:08:17.015 --> 00:08:19.310
In other words: white people.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.195
But when Hegel famously said that Africa
was no historical part of the world,

00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:26.724
he implied that it was merely
a voluminous land mass

00:08:26.748 --> 00:08:28.869
taking up space
at the bottom of the globe.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.822
Africans were space-takers.

00:08:32.348 --> 00:08:36.631
So today, white people continue to control
the flow and thrust of history,

00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:41.198
while too often treating black people
as though we are merely taking up space

00:08:41.222 --> 00:08:42.799
to which we are not entitled.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.477
Time and the march of progress
is used to justify

00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:51.916
a stunning degree of violence
towards our most vulnerable populations,

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:57.015
who, being perceived as space-takers
rather than world-makers,

00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:59.356
are moved out of the places
where they live,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.428
in service of bringing them
into the 21st century.

00:09:03.688 --> 00:09:07.818
Shortened life span according to zip code
is just one example of the ways

00:09:07.842 --> 00:09:10.569
that time and space cohere
in an unjust manner

00:09:10.593 --> 00:09:12.253
in the lives of black people.

00:09:12.793 --> 00:09:17.314
Children who are born
in New Orleans zip code 70124,

00:09:17.338 --> 00:09:19.266
which is 93 percent white,

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.519
can expect to live a full 25 years longer

00:09:22.543 --> 00:09:26.798
than children born
in New Orleans zip code 70112,

00:09:26.822 --> 00:09:28.729
which is 60 percent black.

00:09:29.856 --> 00:09:33.980
Children born in Washington, DC's
wealthy Maryland suburbs

00:09:34.004 --> 00:09:37.110
can expect to live a full 20 years longer

00:09:37.134 --> 00:09:40.742
than children born
in its downtown neighborhoods.

00:09:41.492 --> 00:09:44.176
Ta-Nehisi Coates argues

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.840
that, "The defining feature
of being drafted into the Black race

00:09:49.864 --> 00:09:52.768
is the inescapable robbery of time."

00:09:53.518 --> 00:09:55.310
We experience time discrimination,

00:09:55.334 --> 00:09:56.561
he tells us,

00:09:56.585 --> 00:09:58.065
not just as structural,

00:09:58.089 --> 00:09:59.540
but as personal:

00:09:59.564 --> 00:10:01.388
in lost moments of joy,

00:10:01.412 --> 00:10:03.628
lost moments of connection,

00:10:03.652 --> 00:10:06.149
lost quality of time with loved ones

00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:09.249
and lost years of healthy quality of life.

00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:15.304
In the future, do you see black people?

00:10:16.344 --> 00:10:19.108
Do black people have a future?

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:22.439
What if you belong
to the very race of people

00:10:22.463 --> 00:10:25.210
who have always been pitted against time?

00:10:26.145 --> 00:10:30.791
What if your group is the group
for whom a future was never imagined?

00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:33.607
These time-space clashes --

00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:36.172
between protesters and police,

00:10:36.196 --> 00:10:38.566
between gentrifiers and residents --

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.587
don't paint a very pretty picture

00:10:40.611 --> 00:10:44.186
of what America hopes
for black people's future.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.924
If the present is any indicator,

00:10:45.948 --> 00:10:47.999
our children will be under-educated,

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:50.381
health maladies will take their toll

00:10:50.405 --> 00:10:53.204
and housing will continue
to be unaffordable.

00:10:53.912 --> 00:10:56.934
So if we're really ready
to talk about the future,

00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.346
perhaps we should begin
by admitting that we're out of time.

00:11:01.814 --> 00:11:04.497
We black people
have always been out of time.

00:11:05.085 --> 00:11:07.209
Time does not belong to us.

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:10.429
Our lives are lives of perpetual urgency.

00:11:10.453 --> 00:11:12.985
Time is used to displace us,

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:16.019
or conversely, we are urged
into complacency

00:11:16.043 --> 00:11:19.164
through endless calls to just be patient.

00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:22.257
But if past is prologue,

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:25.534
let us seize upon the ways in which
we're always out of time anyway

00:11:25.558 --> 00:11:27.206
to demand with urgency

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.548
freedom now.

00:11:29.587 --> 00:11:32.442
I believe the future is what we make it.

00:11:32.466 --> 00:11:36.911
But first, we have to decide
that time belongs to all of us.

00:11:37.637 --> 00:11:40.340
No, we don't all get equal time,

00:11:40.364 --> 00:11:44.382
but we can decide that the time
we do get is just and free.

00:11:44.406 --> 00:11:47.051
We can stop making your zip code
the primary determinant

00:11:47.075 --> 00:11:48.297
of your lifespan.

00:11:48.844 --> 00:11:51.564
We can stop stealing learning time
from black children

00:11:51.588 --> 00:11:54.644
through excessive use
of suspensions and expulsions.

00:11:54.668 --> 00:11:56.737
We can stop stealing time
from black people

00:11:56.761 --> 00:12:00.080
through long periods
of incarceration for nonviolent crimes.

00:12:00.767 --> 00:12:03.763
The police can stop
stealing time and black lives

00:12:03.787 --> 00:12:05.879
through use of excessive force.

00:12:06.997 --> 00:12:09.737
I believe the future is what we make it.

00:12:10.244 --> 00:12:14.259
But we can't get there
on colored people's time

00:12:14.283 --> 00:12:16.211
or white time

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:18.047
or your time

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.820
or even my time.

00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:22.124
It's our time.

00:12:22.883 --> 00:12:24.155
Ours.

00:12:24.179 --> 00:12:25.336
Thank you.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.569
(Applause)
