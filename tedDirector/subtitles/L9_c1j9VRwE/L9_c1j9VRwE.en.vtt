00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The humanitarian model has barely changed

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
since the early 20th century.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Its origins are firmly rooted

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
in the analog age.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And there is a major shift coming on the horizon.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
The catalyst for this change

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
was the major earthquake that struck Haiti

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.260
on the 12th of January in 2010.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Haiti was a game changer.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.260
The earthquake destroyed the capital of Port-au-Prince,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
claiming the lives of some 320,000 people,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
rendering homeless

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
about 1.2 million people.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Government institutions were completely decapitated,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
including the presidential palace.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
I remember standing

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
on the roof of the Ministry of Justice

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
in downtown Port-au-Prince.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
It was about two meters high,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
completely squashed

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
by the violence of the earthquake.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
For those of us on the ground in those early days,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
that Haiti was something different.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Haiti was something we hadn't seen before.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
But Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
of what disaster response might look like

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
in a hyper-connected world

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
where people have access

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
to mobile smart devices.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Because out of the urban devastation

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
in Port-au-Prince

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
came a torrent of SMS texts --

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
people crying for help,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
beseeching us for assistance,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
sharing data, offering support,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
looking for their loved ones.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
This was a situation

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
We were in one of the poorest countries on the planet,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
but 80 percent of the people

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
had mobile devices in their hands.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And we were unprepared for this,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and they were shaping the aid effort.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Outside Haiti also, things were looking different.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Tens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
were scouring the Internet,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
converting tweets

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
that had already been converted from texts

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and putting these into open-source maps,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
layering them with all sorts of important information --

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
people like Crisis Mappers and Open Street Map --

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and putting these on the Web for everybody --

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
the media, the aid organizations and the communities themselves --

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
to participate in and to use.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Back in Haiti,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
people were increasingly turning

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
to the medium of SMS.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
People that were hungry and hurting

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
were signaling their distress,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
were signaling their need for help.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
On street sides all over Port-au-Prince,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
entrepreneurs sprung up

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
offering mobile phone charging stations.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
They understood more than we did

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
people's innate need

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
to be connected.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Never having been confronted

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
with this type of situation before,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
we wanted to try and understand

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
how we could tap into this incredible resource,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
how we could really leverage

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
this incredible use of mobile technology

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and SMS technology.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.260
We started talking with a local telecom provider called VoilÃ ,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.260
which is a subsidiary of Trilogy International.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
We had basically three requirements.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
We wanted to communicate

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
in a two-way form of communication.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
We didn't want to shout; we needed to listen as well.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
We wanted to be able to target

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
specific geographic communities.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
We didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And we wanted it to be easy to use.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
Out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
came something that we call TERA --

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
the Trilogy Emergency Response Application --

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
which has been used to support the aid effort

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
ever since.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
It has been used to signal early warning

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
in advance of weather-related disasters.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
It's used for public health awareness campaigns

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
such as the prevention of cholera.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And it is even used for sensitive issues

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
such as building awareness

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
around gender-based violence.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
But does it work?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
We have just published

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
an evaluation of this program,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and the evidence that is there for all to see

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
is quite remarkable.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Some 74 percent of people

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
received the data.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Those who were intended to receive the data,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
74 percent of them received it.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
96 percent of them

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
found it useful.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
83 percent of them took action --

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
evidence that it is indeed empowering.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And 73 percent of them shared it.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
The TERA system

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
was developed from Haiti

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
with support of engineers in the region.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
It is a user-appropriate technology

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Technology is transformational.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Right across the developing world,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
citizens and communities

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
are using technology

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
to enable them to bring about change, positive change,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
in their own communities.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
The grassroots has been strengthened

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
through the social power of sharing

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and they are challenging the old models,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
the old analog models

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
of control and command.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
One illustration of the transformational power of technology

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
is in Kibera.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
Kibera is one of Africa's largest slums.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
It's on the outskirts of Nairobi,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
the capital city of Kenya.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
It's home to an unknown number of people --

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
some say between 250,000

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and 1.2 million.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
If you were to arrive in Nairobi today

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and pick up a tourist map,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
Kibera is represented

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
as a lush, green national park

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
devoid of human settlement.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
Young people living in Kibera

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
in their community,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
with simple handheld devices,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.260
GPS handheld devices and SMS-enabled mobile phones,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
have literally put themselves on the map.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
They have collated crowd-sourced data

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
and rendered the invisible visible.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
People like Josh and Steve

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
are continuing to layer information upon information,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
real-time information, Tweet it and text it onto these maps

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
for all to use.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
You can find out about the latest impromptu music session.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
You can find out about the latest security incident.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
You can find out about places of worship.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
You can find out about the health centers.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
You can feel the dynamism

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
of this living, breathing community.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
They also have their own news network on YouTube

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
with 36,000 viewers at the moment.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
They're showing us what can be done

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
with mobile, digital technologies.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
They're showing that the magic of technology

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
can bring the invisible visible.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And they are giving a voice to themselves.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
They are telling their own story,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
bypassing the official narrative.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And we're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
In Mongolia for instance,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
where 30 percent of the people are nomadic,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
SMS information systems are being used

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
to track migration and weather patterns.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
SMS is even used

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
to hold herder summits

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
from remote participation.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
And if people are migrating

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
into urban, unfamiliar, concrete environments,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
they can also be helped in anticipation

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
with social supporters ready and waiting for them

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
based on SMS knowledge.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
In Nigeria,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
open-source SMS tools

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
are being used by the Red Cross community workers

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
to gather information from the local community

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
in an attempt to better understand and mitigate

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
the prevalence of malaria.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
My colleague, Jason Peat, who runs this program,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
tells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
than the traditional way of doing things.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And not only is it empowering to the communities,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
but really importantly,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
this information stays in the community

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
We are on a planet

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
of seven billion people,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
five billion mobile subscriptions.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
By 2015,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.260
there will be three billion smartphones in the world.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
The U.N. broadband commission

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
has recently set targets

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
to help broadband access

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
in 50 percent of the Developing World,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
compared to 20 percent today.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
We are hurtling towards a hyper-connected world

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
where citizens from all cultures and all social strata

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.260
will have access to smart, fast mobile devices.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
People are understanding,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
from Cairo to Oakland,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
that there are new ways to come together,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
there are new ways to mobilize,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
there are new ways to influence.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
A transformation is coming which needs to be understood

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
The collective voices of people

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
needs to be more integrated through new technologies

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
into the organizational strategies and plans of actions

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
and not just recycled

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
for fundraising or marketing.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
We need to, for example, embrace

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
the big data,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
the knowledge that is there from market leaders

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
who understand what it means

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
to use and leverage big data.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
One idea that I'd like you to consider, for instance,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
is to take a look at our IT departments.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
but they need to be elevated to software strategists.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
We need people in our organizations

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
who know what it's like to work with big data.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
We need technology

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
as a core organizational principle.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
We need technological strategists in the boardroom

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
who can ask and answer the question,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
"What would Amazon or Google

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
do with all of this data?"

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
and convert it to humanitarian good.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
The possibilities

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
that new digital technologies are bringing

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
can help humanitarian organizations,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
not only ensure

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
that people's right to information is met,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
or that they have their right to communicate,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
but I think in the future,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
the right for people to access

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
critical communication technologies

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
in order to ensure

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
that their voices are heard,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
that they're truly participating,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
that they're truly empowered in the humanitarian world.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
It has always been the elusive ideal

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
in the humanitarian effort.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
We now have the tools. We now have the possibilities.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.260
There are no more reasons not to do it.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
I believe we need to bring the humanitarian world

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
from analog to digital.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
Thank you very much.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.260
