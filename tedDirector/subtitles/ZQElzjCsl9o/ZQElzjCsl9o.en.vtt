00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:14.333
Hi.

00:00:14.357 --> 00:00:18.176
I want to talk about understanding,
and the nature of understanding,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.593
and what the essence of understanding is,

00:00:21.617 --> 00:00:24.654
because understanding is something
we aim for, everyone.

00:00:24.678 --> 00:00:27.089
We want to understand things.

00:00:27.763 --> 00:00:30.111
My claim is that understanding has to do

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:32.713
with the ability to change
your perspective.

00:00:32.737 --> 00:00:35.629
If you don't have that,
you don't have understanding.

00:00:36.106 --> 00:00:37.648
So that is my claim.

00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:39.571
And I want to focus on mathematics.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.546
Many of us think of mathematics
as addition, subtraction,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.518
multiplication, division,

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:49.352
fractions, percent, geometry,
algebra -- all that stuff.

00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:53.708
But actually, I want to talk
about the essence of mathematics as well.

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:57.019
And my claim is that mathematics
has to do with patterns.

00:00:57.043 --> 00:00:59.534
Behind me, you see a beautiful pattern,

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:03.489
and this pattern actually emerges
just from drawing circles

00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:05.143
in a very particular way.

00:01:05.778 --> 00:01:10.367
So my day-to-day definition
of mathematics that I use every day

00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:11.596
is the following:

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.858
First of all, it's about finding patterns.

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:21.496
And by "pattern," I mean a connection,
a structure, some regularity,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.513
some rules that govern what we see.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.325
Second of all,

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:28.989
I think it is about representing
these patterns with a language.

00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:31.805
We make up language if we don't have it,

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.198
and in mathematics, this is essential.

00:01:35.013 --> 00:01:36.813
It's also about making assumptions

00:01:36.837 --> 00:01:40.450
and playing around with these assumptions
and just seeing what happens.

00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:42.556
We're going to do that very soon.

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:45.841
And finally, it's about doing cool stuff.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.775
Mathematics enables us
to do so many things.

00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:52.848
So let's have a look at these patterns.

00:01:52.872 --> 00:01:55.094
If you want to tie a tie knot,

00:01:55.118 --> 00:01:56.428
there are patterns.

00:01:56.452 --> 00:01:57.923
Tie knots have names.

00:01:58.453 --> 00:02:00.800
And you can also do
the mathematics of tie knots.

00:02:00.824 --> 00:02:03.402
This is a left-out, right-in,
center-out and tie.

00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:07.616
This is a left-in, right-out,
left-in, center-out and tie.

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:12.115
This is a language we made up
for the patterns of tie knots,

00:02:12.522 --> 00:02:14.212
and a half-Windsor is all that.

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.316
This is a mathematics book
about tying shoelaces

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.730
at the university level,

00:02:19.754 --> 00:02:21.732
because there are patterns in shoelaces.

00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:23.867
You can do it in so many different ways.

00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:25.135
We can analyze it.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.925
We can make up languages for it.

00:02:28.218 --> 00:02:31.157
And representations
are all over mathematics.

00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:34.857
This is Leibniz's notation from 1675.

00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:39.005
He invented a language
for patterns in nature.

00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:41.231
When we throw something up in the air,

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:42.445
it falls down.

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.620
Why?

00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:47.714
We're not sure, but we can represent
this with mathematics in a pattern.

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:49.888
This is also a pattern.

00:02:49.912 --> 00:02:52.612
This is also an invented language.

00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:54.180
Can you guess for what?

00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:58.857
It is actually a notation system
for dancing, for tap dancing.

00:02:59.532 --> 00:03:04.788
That enables him as a choreographer
to do cool stuff, to do new things,

00:03:04.812 --> 00:03:06.765
because he has represented it.

00:03:07.232 --> 00:03:12.034
I want you to think about how amazing
representing something actually is.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.363
Here it says the word "mathematics."

00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:18.305
But actually, they're just dots, right?

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.320
So how in the world can these dots
represent the word?

00:03:21.344 --> 00:03:22.684
Well, they do.

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:25.241
They represent the word "mathematics,"

00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:27.825
and these symbols also represent that word

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.507
and this we can listen to.

00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:30.888
It sounds like this.

00:03:30.912 --> 00:03:32.896
(Beeps)

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.210
Somehow these sounds represent
the word and the concept.

00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:37.890
How does this happen?

00:03:37.914 --> 00:03:41.402
There's something amazing
going on about representing stuff.

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:47.583
So I want to talk about
that magic that happens

00:03:47.607 --> 00:03:49.578
when we actually represent something.

00:03:49.602 --> 00:03:52.618
Here you see just lines
with different widths.

00:03:52.642 --> 00:03:55.267
They stand for numbers
for a particular book.

00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:58.284
And I can actually recommend
this book, it's a very nice book.

00:03:58.308 --> 00:03:59.330
(Laughter)

00:03:59.354 --> 00:04:00.635
Just trust me.

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:03.798
OK, so let's just do an experiment,

00:04:03.822 --> 00:04:05.990
just to play around
with some straight lines.

00:04:06.014 --> 00:04:07.181
This is a straight line.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:08.359
Let's make another one.

00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:11.192
So every time we move,
we move one down and one across,

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:13.790
and we draw a new straight line, right?

00:04:13.814 --> 00:04:15.839
We do this over and over and over,

00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:17.709
and we look for patterns.

00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:19.855
So this pattern emerges,

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.262
and it's a rather nice pattern.

00:04:22.286 --> 00:04:24.021
It looks like a curve, right?

00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:26.617
Just from drawing simple, straight lines.

00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:30.555
Now I can change my perspective
a little bit. I can rotate it.

00:04:30.944 --> 00:04:32.326
Have a look at the curve.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.729
What does it look like?

00:04:33.753 --> 00:04:35.735
Is it a part of a circle?

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.661
It's actually not a part of a circle.

00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:41.844
So I have to continue my investigation
and look for the true pattern.

00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:45.079
Perhaps if I copy it and make some art?

00:04:45.674 --> 00:04:46.830
Well, no.

00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:49.003
Perhaps I should extend
the lines like this,

00:04:49.027 --> 00:04:50.797
and look for the pattern there.

00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:52.116
Let's make more lines.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.370
We do this.

00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:57.162
And then let's zoom out
and change our perspective again.

00:04:57.801 --> 00:05:01.312
Then we can actually see that
what started out as just straight lines

00:05:01.336 --> 00:05:03.425
is actually a curve called a parabola.

00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:07.072
This is represented by a simple equation,

00:05:07.096 --> 00:05:08.914
and it's a beautiful pattern.

00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:11.296
So this is the stuff that we do.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.930
We find patterns, and we represent them.

00:05:13.954 --> 00:05:16.578
And I think this is a nice
day-to-day definition.

00:05:16.602 --> 00:05:18.933
But today I want to go
a little bit deeper,

00:05:18.957 --> 00:05:22.901
and think about
what the nature of this is.

00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:24.353
What makes it possible?

00:05:24.377 --> 00:05:26.531
There's one thing
that's a little bit deeper,

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:30.058
and that has to do with the ability
to change your perspective.

00:05:30.082 --> 00:05:32.605
And I claim that when
you change your perspective,

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.435
and if you take another point of view,

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:39.369
you learn something new
about what you are watching

00:05:39.393 --> 00:05:40.844
or looking at or hearing.

00:05:41.472 --> 00:05:45.262
And I think this is a really important
thing that we do all the time.

00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:49.814
So let's just look at
this simple equation,

00:05:49.838 --> 00:05:52.387
x + x = 2 • x.

00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:54.483
This is a very nice pattern,
and it's true,

00:05:54.507 --> 00:05:57.336
because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5, etc.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.461
We've seen this over and over,
and we represent it like this.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.669
But think about it: this is an equation.

00:06:03.025 --> 00:06:05.587
It says that something
is equal to something else,

00:06:05.611 --> 00:06:07.898
and that's two different perspectives.

00:06:07.922 --> 00:06:09.821
One perspective is, it's a sum.

00:06:09.845 --> 00:06:11.691
It's something you plus together.

00:06:11.715 --> 00:06:14.087
On the other hand, it's a multiplication,

00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:16.554
and those are two different perspectives.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.888
And I would go as far as to say
that every equation is like this,

00:06:20.912 --> 00:06:25.028
every mathematical equation
where you use that equality sign

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:26.471
is actually a metaphor.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.925
It's an analogy between two things.

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.444
You're just viewing something
and taking two different points of view,

00:06:32.468 --> 00:06:34.861
and you're expressing that in a language.

00:06:34.885 --> 00:06:36.449
Have a look at this equation.

00:06:36.473 --> 00:06:38.728
This is one of the most
beautiful equations.

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:41.120
It simply says that, well,

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.795
two things, they're both -1.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.325
This thing on the left-hand side is -1,
and the other one is.

00:06:47.693 --> 00:06:50.019
And that, I think, is one
of the essential parts

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:52.506
of mathematics -- you take
different points of view.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.865
So let's just play around.

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:55.156
Let's take a number.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.058
We know four-thirds.
We know what four-thirds is.

00:06:58.082 --> 00:07:01.084
It's 1.333, but we have to have
those three dots,

00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:03.862
otherwise it's not exactly four-thirds.

00:07:03.886 --> 00:07:05.782
But this is only in base 10.

00:07:05.806 --> 00:07:08.069
You know, the number system,
we use 10 digits.

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:10.411
If we change that around
and only use two digits,

00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:12.245
that's called the binary system.

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:13.972
It's written like this.

00:07:13.996 --> 00:07:15.958
So we're now talking about the number.

00:07:15.982 --> 00:07:17.528
The number is four-thirds.

00:07:17.964 --> 00:07:19.307
We can write it like this,

00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:22.336
and we can change the base,
change the number of digits,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.148
and we can write it differently.

00:07:24.172 --> 00:07:28.339
So these are all representations
of the same number.

00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:31.911
We can even write it simply,
like 1.3 or 1.6.

00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:34.135
It all depends on
how many digits you have.

00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:37.903
Or perhaps we just simplify
and write it like this.

00:07:37.927 --> 00:07:41.142
I like this one, because this says
four divided by three.

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:44.203
And this number expresses
a relation between two numbers.

00:07:44.227 --> 00:07:47.191
You have four on the one hand
and three on the other.

00:07:47.215 --> 00:07:49.293
And you can visualize this in many ways.

00:07:49.317 --> 00:07:53.364
What I'm doing now is viewing that number
from different perspectives.

00:07:53.388 --> 00:07:54.539
I'm playing around.

00:07:54.563 --> 00:07:57.107
I'm playing around with
how we view something,

00:07:57.131 --> 00:07:58.843
and I'm doing it very deliberately.

00:07:58.867 --> 00:08:00.050
We can take a grid.

00:08:00.074 --> 00:08:04.752
If it's four across and three up,
this line equals five, always.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.464
It has to be like this.
This is a beautiful pattern.

00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:08.742
Four and three and five.

00:08:09.177 --> 00:08:11.888
And this rectangle, which is 4 x 3,

00:08:11.912 --> 00:08:13.503
you've seen a lot of times.

00:08:13.527 --> 00:08:15.340
This is your average computer screen.

00:08:15.364 --> 00:08:18.743
800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200

00:08:18.767 --> 00:08:21.255
is a television or a computer screen.

00:08:21.864 --> 00:08:23.896
So these are all nice representations,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.842
but I want to go a little bit further
and just play more with this number.

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:31.114
Here you see two circles.
I'm going to rotate them like this.

00:08:31.138 --> 00:08:32.926
Observe the upper-left one.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.723
It goes a little bit faster, right?

00:08:35.137 --> 00:08:36.295
You can see this.

00:08:36.319 --> 00:08:39.693
It actually goes exactly
four-thirds as fast.

00:08:39.717 --> 00:08:42.117
That means that when it goes
around four times,

00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:44.020
the other one goes around three times.

00:08:44.044 --> 00:08:47.545
Now let's make two lines, and draw
this dot where the lines meet.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:49.271
We get this dot dancing around.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.332
(Laughter)

00:08:50.356 --> 00:08:52.125
And this dot comes from that number.

00:08:52.926 --> 00:08:54.793
Right? Now we should trace it.

00:08:55.239 --> 00:08:57.417
Let's trace it and see what happens.

00:08:57.441 --> 00:08:59.369
This is what mathematics is all about.

00:08:59.393 --> 00:09:01.028
It's about seeing what happens.

00:09:01.052 --> 00:09:03.996
And this emerges from four-thirds.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.380
I like to say that this
is the image of four-thirds.

00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:08.700
It's much nicer -- (Cheers)

00:09:08.724 --> 00:09:09.882
Thank you!

00:09:09.906 --> 00:09:13.690
(Applause)

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:17.707
This is not new.

00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:19.765
This has been known
for a long time, but --

00:09:19.789 --> 00:09:21.398
(Laughter)

00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:23.106
But this is four-thirds.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.689
Let's do another experiment.

00:09:24.713 --> 00:09:28.822
Let's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep)

00:09:28.846 --> 00:09:31.835
This is a perfect A, 440Hz.

00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:33.545
Let's multiply it by two.

00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:34.928
We get this sound. (Beep)

00:09:34.952 --> 00:09:37.207
When we play them together,
it sounds like this.

00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:38.444
This is an octave, right?

00:09:38.468 --> 00:09:41.233
We can do this game. We can play
a sound, play the same A.

00:09:41.257 --> 00:09:42.958
We can multiply it by three-halves.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:44.600
(Beep)

00:09:44.624 --> 00:09:46.568
This is what we call a perfect fifth.

00:09:46.592 --> 00:09:47.638
(Beep)

00:09:47.662 --> 00:09:49.768
They sound really nice together.

00:09:49.792 --> 00:09:53.915
Let's multiply this sound
by four-thirds. (Beep)

00:09:53.939 --> 00:09:55.865
What happens?

00:09:55.889 --> 00:09:57.320
You get this sound. (Beep)

00:09:57.344 --> 00:09:58.630
This is the perfect fourth.

00:09:58.654 --> 00:10:00.899
If the first one is an A, this is a D.

00:10:00.923 --> 00:10:02.953
They sound like this together. (Beeps)

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.387
This is the sound of four-thirds.

00:10:05.411 --> 00:10:07.965
What I'm doing now,
I'm changing my perspective.

00:10:07.989 --> 00:10:10.769
I'm just viewing a number
from another perspective.

00:10:10.793 --> 00:10:12.758
I can even do this with rhythms, right?

00:10:12.782 --> 00:10:16.454
I can take a rhythm and play
three beats at one time (Drumbeats)

00:10:16.478 --> 00:10:18.029
in a period of time,

00:10:18.053 --> 00:10:22.395
and I can play another sound
four times in that same space.

00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:23.461
(Clanking sounds)

00:10:23.485 --> 00:10:25.866
Sounds kind of boring,
but listen to them together.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.676
(Drumbeats and clanking sounds)

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.990
(Laughter)

00:10:30.014 --> 00:10:31.435
Hey! So.

00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:33.347
(Laughter)

00:10:33.371 --> 00:10:35.530
I can even make a little hi-hat.

00:10:35.554 --> 00:10:37.395
(Drumbeats and cymbals)

00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:38.570
Can you hear this?

00:10:38.594 --> 00:10:40.707
So, this is the sound of four-thirds.

00:10:40.731 --> 00:10:42.581
Again, this is as a rhythm.

00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:44.415
(Drumbeats and cowbell)

00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:47.287
And I can keep doing this
and play games with this number.

00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:50.056
Four-thirds is a really great number.
I love four-thirds!

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.356
(Laughter)

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.867
Truly -- it's an undervalued number.

00:10:53.891 --> 00:10:56.750
So if you take a sphere and look
at the volume of the sphere,

00:10:56.774 --> 00:10:59.707
it's actually four-thirds
of some particular cylinder.

00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:03.265
So four-thirds is in the sphere.
It's the volume of the sphere.

00:11:03.824 --> 00:11:05.866
OK, so why am I doing all this?

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.120
Well, I want to talk about what it means
to understand something

00:11:09.144 --> 00:11:11.708
and what we mean
by understanding something.

00:11:11.732 --> 00:11:13.155
That's my aim here.

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:15.309
And my claim is that
you understand something

00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:18.325
if you have the ability to view it
from different perspectives.

00:11:18.349 --> 00:11:20.890
Let's look at this letter.
It's a beautiful R, right?

00:11:20.914 --> 00:11:22.092
How do you know that?

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:25.745
Well, as a matter of fact,
you've seen a bunch of R's,

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:27.414
and you've generalized

00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:30.408
and abstracted all of these
and found a pattern.

00:11:30.432 --> 00:11:33.794
So you know that this is an R.

00:11:35.643 --> 00:11:38.450
So what I'm aiming for here
is saying something

00:11:38.474 --> 00:11:41.855
about how understanding
and changing your perspective

00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:43.211
are linked.

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:45.404
And I'm a teacher and a lecturer,

00:11:45.428 --> 00:11:47.740
and I can actually use this
to teach something,

00:11:47.764 --> 00:11:52.604
because when I give someone else
another story, a metaphor, an analogy,

00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:55.027
if I tell a story
from a different point of view,

00:11:55.051 --> 00:11:56.564
I enable understanding.

00:11:56.588 --> 00:11:58.454
I make understanding possible,

00:11:58.478 --> 00:12:01.544
because you have to generalize
over everything you see and hear,

00:12:01.568 --> 00:12:06.167
and if I give you another perspective,
that will become easier for you.

00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:08.097
Let's do a simple example again.

00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:10.762
This is four and three.
This is four triangles.

00:12:10.786 --> 00:12:13.234
So this is also four-thirds, in a way.

00:12:13.258 --> 00:12:14.980
Let's just join them together.

00:12:15.004 --> 00:12:17.713
Now we're going to play a game;
we're going to fold it up

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.419
into a three-dimensional structure.

00:12:19.443 --> 00:12:20.607
I love this.

00:12:20.631 --> 00:12:22.047
This is a square pyramid.

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:25.679
And let's just take two of them
and put them together.

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:28.392
So this is what is called an octahedron.

00:12:28.416 --> 00:12:31.123
It's one of the five platonic solids.

00:12:31.147 --> 00:12:33.592
Now we can quite literally
change our perspective,

00:12:33.616 --> 00:12:36.311
because we can rotate it
around all of the axes

00:12:36.335 --> 00:12:38.347
and view it from different perspectives.

00:12:38.371 --> 00:12:40.437
And I can change the axis,

00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:42.799
and then I can view it
from another point of view,

00:12:42.823 --> 00:12:45.526
but it's the same thing,
but it looks a little different.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.218
I can do it even one more time.

00:12:47.242 --> 00:12:50.544
Every time I do this,
something else appears,

00:12:50.568 --> 00:12:52.747
so I'm actually learning
more about the object

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:54.296
when I change my perspective.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.714
I can use this as a tool
for creating understanding.

00:12:58.548 --> 00:13:02.140
I can take two of these
and put them together like this

00:13:02.164 --> 00:13:03.411
and see what happens.

00:13:03.865 --> 00:13:07.276
And it looks a little bit
like the octahedron.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.778
Have a look at it if I spin
it around like this.

00:13:09.802 --> 00:13:10.984
What happens?

00:13:11.008 --> 00:13:14.352
Well, if you take two of these,
join them together and spin it around,

00:13:14.376 --> 00:13:16.777
there's your octahedron again,

00:13:16.801 --> 00:13:18.432
a beautiful structure.

00:13:18.456 --> 00:13:20.620
If you lay it out flat on the floor,

00:13:20.644 --> 00:13:21.861
this is the octahedron.

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:24.588
This is the graph structure
of an octahedron.

00:13:25.255 --> 00:13:27.628
And I can continue doing this.

00:13:27.652 --> 00:13:31.179
You can draw three great circles
around the octahedron,

00:13:31.203 --> 00:13:33.053
and you rotate around,

00:13:33.077 --> 00:13:37.538
so actually three great circles
is related to the octahedron.

00:13:37.562 --> 00:13:41.221
And if I take a bicycle pump
and just pump it up,

00:13:41.245 --> 00:13:44.398
you can see that this is also
a little bit like the octahedron.

00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:47.097
Do you see what I'm doing here?

00:13:47.121 --> 00:13:49.802
I am changing the perspective every time.

00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:53.451
So let's now take a step back --

00:13:53.475 --> 00:13:56.512
and that's actually
a metaphor, stepping back --

00:13:56.536 --> 00:13:58.899
and have a look at what we're doing.

00:13:58.923 --> 00:14:00.587
I'm playing around with metaphors.

00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:03.083
I'm playing around
with perspectives and analogies.

00:14:03.107 --> 00:14:05.139
I'm telling one story in different ways.

00:14:05.472 --> 00:14:06.682
I'm telling stories.

00:14:06.706 --> 00:14:09.890
I'm making a narrative;
I'm making several narratives.

00:14:09.914 --> 00:14:13.436
And I think all of these things
make understanding possible.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.839
I think this actually is the essence
of understanding something.

00:14:16.863 --> 00:14:18.157
I truly believe this.

00:14:18.181 --> 00:14:20.608
So this thing about changing
your perspective --

00:14:20.608 --> 00:14:23.341
it's absolutely fundamental for humans.

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:25.450
Let's play around with the Earth.

00:14:25.474 --> 00:14:27.983
Let's zoom into the ocean,
have a look at the ocean.

00:14:28.007 --> 00:14:29.949
We can do this with anything.

00:14:29.973 --> 00:14:32.433
We can take the ocean
and view it up close.

00:14:32.457 --> 00:14:34.391
We can look at the waves.

00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:35.627
We can go to the beach.

00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:37.914
We can view the ocean
from another perspective.

00:14:37.938 --> 00:14:41.128
Every time we do this, we learn
a little bit more about the ocean.

00:14:41.152 --> 00:14:43.741
If we go to the shore,
we can kind of smell it, right?

00:14:43.765 --> 00:14:45.475
We can hear the sound of the waves.

00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:47.545
We can feel salt on our tongues.

00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:50.459
So all of these
are different perspectives.

00:14:50.483 --> 00:14:51.747
And this is the best one.

00:14:51.771 --> 00:14:53.414
We can go into the water.

00:14:53.438 --> 00:14:55.447
We can see the water from the inside.

00:14:55.471 --> 00:14:56.649
And you know what?

00:14:56.673 --> 00:14:59.754
This is absolutely essential
in mathematics and computer science.

00:14:59.778 --> 00:15:02.733
If you're able to view
a structure from the inside,

00:15:02.757 --> 00:15:05.327
then you really learn something about it.

00:15:05.351 --> 00:15:07.372
That's somehow the essence of something.

00:15:07.883 --> 00:15:11.526
So when we do this,
and we've taken this journey

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.723
into the ocean,

00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:14.637
we use our imagination.

00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:17.314
And I think this is one level deeper,

00:15:17.338 --> 00:15:21.072
and it's actually a requirement
for changing your perspective.

00:15:21.818 --> 00:15:22.985
We can do a little game.

00:15:23.009 --> 00:15:25.050
You can imagine that you're sitting there.

00:15:25.074 --> 00:15:28.301
You can imagine that you're up here,
and that you're sitting here.

00:15:28.325 --> 00:15:30.651
You can view yourselves from the outside.

00:15:30.675 --> 00:15:32.613
That's really a strange thing.

00:15:32.637 --> 00:15:34.460
You're changing your perspective.

00:15:34.484 --> 00:15:36.343
You're using your imagination,

00:15:36.367 --> 00:15:38.573
and you're viewing yourself
from the outside.

00:15:39.073 --> 00:15:41.102
That requires imagination.

00:15:41.126 --> 00:15:46.059
Mathematics and computer science
are the most imaginative art forms ever.

00:15:46.884 --> 00:15:49.066
And this thing about changing perspectives

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.598
should sound a little bit familiar to you,

00:15:51.622 --> 00:15:53.834
because we do it every day.

00:15:54.604 --> 00:15:56.224
And then it's called empathy.

00:15:56.954 --> 00:15:59.653
When I view the world
from your perspective,

00:16:00.939 --> 00:16:02.605
I have empathy with you.

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:04.477
If I really, truly understand

00:16:04.501 --> 00:16:07.579
what the world looks
like from your perspective,

00:16:07.603 --> 00:16:09.074
I am empathetic.

00:16:09.098 --> 00:16:11.278
That requires imagination.

00:16:11.827 --> 00:16:14.286
And that is how we obtain understanding.

00:16:15.206 --> 00:16:18.959
And this is all over mathematics
and this is all over computer science,

00:16:18.983 --> 00:16:24.518
and there's a really deep connection
between empathy and these sciences.

00:16:25.288 --> 00:16:28.092
So my conclusion is the following:

00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:32.153
understanding something really deeply

00:16:32.177 --> 00:16:34.838
has to do with the ability
to change your perspective.

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:39.483
So my advice to you is:
try to change your perspective.

00:16:39.507 --> 00:16:41.056
You can study mathematics.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.513
It's a wonderful way to train your brain.

00:16:44.663 --> 00:16:48.471
Changing your perspective
makes your mind more flexible.

00:16:48.495 --> 00:16:50.329
It makes you open to new things,

00:16:50.353 --> 00:16:53.178
and it makes you
able to understand things.

00:16:53.202 --> 00:16:55.219
And to use yet another metaphor:

00:16:55.243 --> 00:16:56.724
have a mind like water.

00:16:56.748 --> 00:16:57.899
That's nice.

00:16:57.923 --> 00:16:59.080
Thank you.

00:16:59.104 --> 00:17:03.275
(Applause)
