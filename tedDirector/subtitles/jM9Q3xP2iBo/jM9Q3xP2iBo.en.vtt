00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:15.004
What is a parent?

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.606
What is a parent?

00:00:19.043 --> 00:00:21.151
It's not an easy question.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.004
Today we have adoption,

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:25.604
stepfamilies,

00:00:25.628 --> 00:00:27.085
surrogate mothers.

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:30.259
Many parents face tough questions

00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:32.680
and tough decisions.

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:37.141
Shall we tell our child
about the sperm donation?

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:40.697
If so, when?

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:42.776
What words to use?

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:49.383
Sperm donors are often referred
to as "biological fathers,"

00:00:49.407 --> 00:00:52.406
but should we really
be using the word "father?"

00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:56.248
As a philosopher and social scientist,

00:00:56.272 --> 00:01:00.494
I have been studying these questions
about the concept of parenthood.

00:01:01.088 --> 00:01:04.116
But today, I will talk to you
about what I learned

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.280
from talking to parents and children.

00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:11.731
I will show you that they know
what matters most in a family,

00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:14.286
even though their family
looks a little different.

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:20.134
I will show you their creative ways
of dealing with tough questions.

00:01:21.287 --> 00:01:25.037
But I will also show you
the parents' uncertainties.

00:01:27.284 --> 00:01:28.815
We interviewed couples

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:32.241
who received fertility treatment
at Ghent University Hospital,

00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:34.814
using sperm from a donor.

00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:36.750
In this treatment timeline,

00:01:36.774 --> 00:01:40.066
you can see two points
at which we conducted interviews.

00:01:40.994 --> 00:01:43.427
We included heterosexual couples,

00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:47.927
where the man for some reason
did not have good-quality sperm,

00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:53.553
and lesbian couples who obviously
needed to find sperm elsewhere.

00:01:54.996 --> 00:01:57.194
We also included children.

00:01:58.878 --> 00:02:00.361
I wanted to know

00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:05.018
how those children define concepts
like parenthood and family.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.951
In fact, that is what I asked them,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.698
only not in that way.

00:02:13.437 --> 00:02:16.096
I drew an apple tree instead.

00:02:17.056 --> 00:02:20.403
This way, I could ask abstract,
philosophical questions

00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:23.700
in a way that did not make them run off.

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:26.984
So as you can see,

00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:28.550
the apple tree is empty.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.243
And that illustrates my research approach.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.942
By designing techniques like this,

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:39.739
I can bring as little meaning and content
as possible to the interview,

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:42.551
because I want to hear that from them.

00:02:44.362 --> 00:02:45.694
I asked them:

00:02:46.738 --> 00:02:49.828
What would your family look like
if it were an apple tree?

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.489
And they could take a paper apple
for everyone who, in their view,

00:02:54.513 --> 00:02:56.120
was a member of the family,

00:02:56.144 --> 00:02:59.318
write a name on it
and hang it wherever they wanted.

00:02:59.342 --> 00:03:00.912
And I would ask questions.

00:03:02.153 --> 00:03:05.278
Most children started
with a parent or a sibling.

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:07.970
One started with "Boxer,"

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:11.175
the dead dog of his grandparents.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.688
At this point, none of the children
started mentioning the donor.

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:20.803
So, I asked them about their birth story.

00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:23.183
I said, "Before you were born,

00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:25.570
it was just your mom and dad,

00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:26.872
or mom and mommy.

00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:30.478
Can you tell me how you came
into the family?"

00:03:31.282 --> 00:03:32.721
And they explained.

00:03:33.602 --> 00:03:34.808
One said,

00:03:35.691 --> 00:03:38.164
"My parents did not have good seeds,

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:42.887
but there are friendly men out there
who have spare seeds.

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:45.136
They bring them to the hospital,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.374
and they put them in a big jar.

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:49.486
My mommy went there,

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.081
and she took two from the jar,

00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:54.924
one for me and one for my sister.

00:03:55.725 --> 00:03:57.774
She put the seeds in her belly --

00:03:58.161 --> 00:03:59.353
somehow --

00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:02.543
and her belly grew really big,

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:03.819
and there I was."

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:06.439
Hmm.

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:12.191
So only when they started
mentioning the donor,

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:15.440
I asked questions about him,
using their own words.

00:04:15.926 --> 00:04:17.325
I said,

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.815
"If this would be an apple
for the friendly man with the seeds,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.172
what would you do with it?"

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.427
And one boy was thinking out loud,

00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:27.819
holding the apple.

00:04:27.843 --> 00:04:29.088
And he said,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.584
"I won't put this one
up there with the others.

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.132
He's not part of my family.

00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:38.385
But I will not put him on the ground.

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.319
That's too cold and too hard.

00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:43.325
I think he should be in the trunk,

00:04:44.207 --> 00:04:46.550
because he made my family possible.

00:04:47.264 --> 00:04:49.218
If he would not have done this,

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:53.200
that would really be sad
because my family would not be here,

00:04:53.224 --> 00:04:54.820
and I would not be here."

00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:01.373
So also, parents
constructed family tales --

00:05:01.397 --> 00:05:03.154
tales to tell their children.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.787
One couple explained their insemination

00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:10.334
by taking their children to a farm

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:13.852
to watch a vet inseminate cows.

00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:17.027
And why not?

00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:19.491
It's their way of explaining;

00:05:19.515 --> 00:05:22.541
their do-it-yourself
with family narratives.

00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:24.161
DIY.

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:26.901
And we had another couple
who made books --

00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:28.380
a book for each child.

00:05:28.752 --> 00:05:30.274
They were really works of art

00:05:30.298 --> 00:05:33.774
containing their thoughts and feelings
throughout the treatment.

00:05:34.192 --> 00:05:36.806
They even had the hospital
parking tickets in there.

00:05:37.553 --> 00:05:39.174
So it is DIY:

00:05:39.198 --> 00:05:41.580
finding ways, words and images

00:05:41.604 --> 00:05:44.354
to tell your family story to your child.

00:05:45.717 --> 00:05:48.532
And these stories were highly diverse,

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.876
but they all had one thing in common:

00:05:53.913 --> 00:05:57.134
it was a tale of longing for a child

00:05:57.885 --> 00:05:59.563
and a quest for that child.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.437
It was about how special
and how deeply loved their child was.

00:06:07.142 --> 00:06:11.790
And research so far shows
that these children are doing fine.

00:06:11.814 --> 00:06:14.408
They do not have
more problems than other kids.

00:06:14.854 --> 00:06:19.275
Yet, these parents also wanted
to justify their decisions

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:20.961
through the tales they tell.

00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:24.639
They hoped that their children
would understand their reasons

00:06:24.663 --> 00:06:26.498
for making the family in this way.

00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:31.819
Underlying was a fear
that their children might disapprove

00:06:31.843 --> 00:06:34.085
and would reject the non-genetic parent.

00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:37.131
And that fear is understandable,

00:06:37.155 --> 00:06:40.196
because we live in a very heteronormative

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.958
and geneticized society --

00:06:42.438 --> 00:06:43.930
a world that still believes

00:06:43.954 --> 00:06:48.106
that true families consist
of one mom, one dad

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.467
and their genetically related children.

00:06:51.738 --> 00:06:52.893
Well.

00:06:54.165 --> 00:06:57.266
I want to tell you about a teenage boy.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.059
He was donor-conceived
but not part of our study.

00:07:00.658 --> 00:07:03.276
One day, he had an argument
with his father,

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.592
and he yelled,

00:07:05.305 --> 00:07:07.402
"You're telling me what to do?

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:09.307
You're not even my father!"

00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:14.983
That was exactly what
the parents in our study feared.

00:07:15.984 --> 00:07:19.213
Now, the boy soon felt sorry,
and they made up.

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:23.400
But it is the reaction of his father
that is most interesting.

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:25.342
He said,

00:07:25.772 --> 00:07:31.134
"This outburst had nothing to do
with the lack of a genetic link.

00:07:31.765 --> 00:07:34.642
It was about puberty --

00:07:35.005 --> 00:07:36.446
being difficult.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.233
It's what they do at that age.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.066
It will pass."

00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:43.318
What this man shows us

00:07:43.342 --> 00:07:45.930
is that when something goes wrong,

00:07:46.564 --> 00:07:48.165
we should not immediately think

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:50.596
it is because the family
is a little different.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.416
These things happen in all families.

00:07:55.936 --> 00:07:57.426
And every now and then,

00:07:57.818 --> 00:07:59.495
all parents may wonder:

00:08:00.412 --> 00:08:02.441
Am I a good enough parent?

00:08:03.164 --> 00:08:04.488
These parents, too.

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:09.192
They, above all, wanted to do
what's best for their child.

00:08:09.748 --> 00:08:11.643
But they also sometimes wondered:

00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:13.810
Am I a real parent?

00:08:14.288 --> 00:08:18.257
And their uncertainties were present
long before they even were parents.

00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:19.713
At the start of treatment,

00:08:19.737 --> 00:08:21.452
when they first saw the counselor,

00:08:22.146 --> 00:08:24.841
they paid close attention
to the counselor,

00:08:24.865 --> 00:08:26.872
because they wanted to do it right.

00:08:27.853 --> 00:08:29.331
Even 10 years later,

00:08:30.053 --> 00:08:32.672
they still remember
the advice they were given.

00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:39.882
So when they thought about the counselor

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.653
and the advice they were given,

00:08:42.677 --> 00:08:43.840
we discussed that.

00:08:43.864 --> 00:08:47.428
And we saw one lesbian couple who said,

00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:50.231
"When our son asks us,

00:08:50.255 --> 00:08:52.304
'Do I have a dad?'

00:08:53.482 --> 00:08:56.294
we will say 'No, you do not have a dad.'

00:08:56.839 --> 00:08:59.907
But we will say nothing more,
not unless he asks,

00:09:00.287 --> 00:09:02.315
because he might not be ready for that.

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:03.839
The counselor said so."

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.520
Well.

00:09:07.091 --> 00:09:08.993
I don't know; that's quite different

00:09:09.017 --> 00:09:11.710
from how we respond
to children's questions.

00:09:12.473 --> 00:09:15.274
Like, "Milk -- is that made in a factory?"

00:09:15.783 --> 00:09:18.945
We will say, "No, it comes from cows,"

00:09:18.969 --> 00:09:20.725
and we will talk about the farmer,

00:09:20.749 --> 00:09:22.972
and the way the milk ends up in the shop.

00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:25.353
We will not say,

00:09:26.102 --> 00:09:29.710
"No, milk is not made in a factory."

00:09:32.042 --> 00:09:34.472
So something strange happened here,

00:09:34.496 --> 00:09:36.854
and of course these children noticed that.

00:09:37.571 --> 00:09:38.856
One boy said,

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:41.837
"I asked my parents loads of questions,

00:09:41.861 --> 00:09:43.670
but they acted really weird.

00:09:44.788 --> 00:09:48.732
So, you know, I have a friend at school,
and she's made in the same way.

00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:52.241
When I have a question,
I just go and ask her."

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.968
Clever guy.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.927
Problem solved.

00:09:57.765 --> 00:10:00.349
But his parents did not notice,

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:03.457
and it certainly was not
what they had in mind,

00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:05.415
nor what the counselor had in mind

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:10.636
when they were saying how important
it is to be an open-communication family.

00:10:12.462 --> 00:10:14.716
And that's the strange thing about advice.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.036
When we offer people pills,
we gather evidence first.

00:10:18.536 --> 00:10:19.792
We do tests,

00:10:19.816 --> 00:10:21.117
we do follow-up studies.

00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:25.068
We want to know, and rightly so,
what this pill is doing

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:27.588
and how it affects people's lives.

00:10:28.035 --> 00:10:29.356
And advice?

00:10:30.748 --> 00:10:32.594
It is not enough for advice,

00:10:32.618 --> 00:10:37.441
or for professionals to give advice
that is theoretically sound,

00:10:37.465 --> 00:10:38.766
or well-meant.

00:10:39.447 --> 00:10:42.828
It should be advice
that there is evidence for --

00:10:42.852 --> 00:10:46.753
evidence that it actually
improves patients' lives.

00:10:48.174 --> 00:10:52.737
So the philosopher in me
would now like to offer you a paradox:

00:10:54.308 --> 00:10:58.392
I advise you to stop following advice.

00:10:59.897 --> 00:11:01.289
But, yes.

00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:05.138
(Applause)

00:11:06.591 --> 00:11:09.154
I will not end here with what went wrong;

00:11:09.178 --> 00:11:13.414
I would not be doing justice
to the warmth we found in those families.

00:11:14.931 --> 00:11:17.561
Remember the books
and the trip to the farmer?

00:11:17.585 --> 00:11:21.199
When parents do things that work for them,

00:11:21.572 --> 00:11:23.145
they do brilliant things.

00:11:24.391 --> 00:11:28.034
What I want you to remember
as members of families,

00:11:28.058 --> 00:11:30.549
in no matter what form or shape,

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:36.277
is that what families need
are warm relationships.

00:11:37.409 --> 00:11:40.870
And we do not need to be
professionals to create those.

00:11:41.644 --> 00:11:43.946
Most of us do just fine,

00:11:44.986 --> 00:11:46.695
although it may be hard work,

00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:49.908
and from time to time,
we can do with some advice.

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:52.480
In that case,

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:54.527
bear in mind three things.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.047
Work with advice
that works for your family.

00:12:00.008 --> 00:12:05.486
Remember -- you're the expert,
because you live your family life.

00:12:06.681 --> 00:12:07.965
And finally,

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:12.468
believe in your abilities
and your creativity,

00:12:13.027 --> 00:12:16.372
because you can do it yourself.

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:18.413
Thank you.

00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:24.915
(Applause)
