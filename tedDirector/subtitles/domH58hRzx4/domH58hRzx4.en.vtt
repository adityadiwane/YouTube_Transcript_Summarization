00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.160
So, what I'd like to talk about is something

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
that was very dear to Kahn's heart, which is:

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
how do we discover what is really particular about a project?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.160
How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
Because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:41.160
has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization;

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.160
that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
and the uniqueness of a program in a building.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
And so I'll take you to Wichita, Kansas,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.160
on a site, right downtown by the river.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.160
And I thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river, part of the river.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.160
Unfortunately, though, the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
so I suggested, "Let's reroute McLean,"

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.160
and that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.160
(Laughter)

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
And it took six months to reroute it.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.160
The first image I showed the building committee was

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160
this astronomic observatory of Jantar Mantar in Jaipur

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.160
because I talked about what makes a building a building of science.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.160
And it seemed to me that this structure -- complex, rich and yet

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
totally rational: it's an instrument -- had something to do with science,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.160
and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
And so my first sketch after I left was to say,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.160
"Let's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building."

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
And I got all excited and came back, and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
they sort of looked at me in dismay and said, "An island?

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
This used to be an island -- Ackerman Island --

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
and we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs."

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
(Laughter)

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
And so the process began and they said,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
"You can't put it all on an island;

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
some of it has to be on the mainland because

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
we don't want to turn our back to the community."

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.160
And there emerged a design: the galleries sort of forming an island

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
and you could walk through them or on the roof.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
And there were all kinds of exciting features:

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
you could come in through the landside buildings,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
If you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160
peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
come back and pay the five dollars admission.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
(Laughter)

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
And the client was happy -- well, sort of happy

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.160
because we were four million dollars over the budget, but essentially happy.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.160
But I was still troubled, and I was troubled because I felt this was capricious.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.160
It was complex, but there was something capricious about its complexity.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
It was, what I would say, compositional complexity,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.160
and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about --

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a generating idea,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
some kind of a generating geometry.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.160
And this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.160
one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.160
and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
A toroid, for those who don't know,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.160
is the surface of a doughnut or, for some of us, a bagel.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.160
And out of this idea started spinning off many,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.160
and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
And finally the building -- this is the model.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
And when there were complaints about budget, I said,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.160
"Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections."

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
And here's the building as it opened,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.160
with a channel overlooking downtown, and as seen from downtown.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
And the bike route's going right through the building,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.160
so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
The toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building:

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.160
every beam in this building is the same radius, all laminated wood.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.160
Every wall, every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
Every piece of the building works.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.160
These are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.160
and at night, and on opening day.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
Going back to 1976.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.160
(Applause)

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.160
In 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.160
in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
which you see here the campus.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
I was asked to do a building,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.160
and I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
And I felt very troubled.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
they are totally saturated with information

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
and to see yet another museum with information,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.160
it would make them just unable to digest.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
And so I made a counter-proposal:

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:02.160
I said, "No building." There was a cave on the site; we tunnel into the hill,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.160
descend through the rock into an underground chamber.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.160
There's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
and then you come into a large space.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.160
There is a single candle flickering in the center;

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:27.160
by an arrangement of reflective glasses, it reflects into infinity in all directions.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.160
You walk through the space, a voice reads the names,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
ages and place of birth of the children.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
This voice does not repeat for six months.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.160
And then you descend to light and to the north and to life.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
Well, they said, "People won't understand,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that."

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.160
And they shelved the project. And it sat there for 10 years,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
and then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
who had lost his three-year-old son at Auschwitz,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.160
came, saw the model, wrote the check and it got built 10 years later.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.160
So, many years after that in 1998,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.160
I was on one of my monthly trips to Jerusalem

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
and I got a call from the foreign ministry saying,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.160
"We've got the Chief Minister of the Punjab here.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.160
He is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
we took him to the children's memorial; he was extremely moved.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
He's demanding to meet the architect. Could you come down and meet him in Tel Aviv?"

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.160
And I went down and Chief Minister Badal said to me,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.160
"We Sikhs have suffered a great deal, as you have Jews.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
I was very moved by what I saw today.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.160
We are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people;

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
we're about to embark on that.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
I'd like you to come and design it."

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.160
And so, you know, it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.160
But two weeks later, I was in this little town, Anandpur Sahib,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.160
outside Chandigarh, the capital of the Punjab,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.160
and the temple and also next to it the fortress

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.160
that the last guru of the Sikhs, Guru Gobind, died in

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.160
as he wrote the Khalsa, which is their holy scripture.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.160
And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
nine kilometers away from the town and the temple,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.160
and said, "That's where we have chosen the location."

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.160
And I said, "This just doesn't make any sense.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
The pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands --

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
they're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
Let's get back to the town and walk to the site."

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.160
And I recommended they do it right there, on that hill

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.160
and this hill, and bridge all the way into the town.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.160
And, as things are a little easier in India, the site was purchased within a week

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
and we were working.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160
(Laughter)

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.160
And my proposal was to split the museum into two --

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.160
the permanent exhibits at one end, the auditorium, library,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160
and changing exhibitions on the other --

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.160
to flood the valley into a series of water gardens

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.160
and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.160
And the structures rise from the sand cliffs --

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.160
they're built in concrete and sandstones; the roofs are stainless steel --

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.160
they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.160
And as you come from the north, it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.160
as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
And then I went away for four months

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.160
and there was going to be groundbreaking.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.160
And I came back and, lo and behold, the little model I'd left behind

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.160
had been built ten times bigger for public display on site

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.160
and ... the bridge was built!

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:11.160
(Laughter)

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
Within the working drawings!

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.160
And half a million people gathered for the celebrations;

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.160
you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.160
I was renamed Safdie Singh. And there it is under construction;

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.160
there are 1,800 workers at work and it will be finished in two years.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.160
Back to Yad Vashem three years ago. After all this episode began,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.160
Yad Vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
because now Washington was built -- the Holocaust Museum in Washington --

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.160
and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.160
And Yad Vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
They said, "Let's rebuild the museum."

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.160
But of course, the Sikhs might give you a job on a platter -- the Jews make it hard:

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.160
international competition, phase one, phase two, phase three.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
(Laughter)

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.160
And again, I felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.160
that a building the size of the Washington building --

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.160
50,000 square feet -- will sit on that fragile hill

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.160
and that we will go into galleries -- rooms with doors

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.160
and sort of familiar rooms -- to tell the story of the Holocaust.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.160
And I proposed that we cut through the mountain. That was my first sketch.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
Just cut the whole museum through the mountain --

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
enter from one side of the mountain,

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
come out on the other side of the mountain --

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
And here you see the model:

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
a reception building and some underground parking.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.160
You cross a bridge, you enter this triangular room, 60 feet high,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
which cuts right into the hill

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.160
and extends right through as you go towards the north.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
And all of it, then, all the galleries are underground,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
and you see the openings for the light.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
And at night, just one line of light cuts through the mountain,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.160
which is a skylight on top of that triangle.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160
And all the galleries,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
as you move through them and so on, are below grade.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.160
And there are chambers carved in the rock --

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.160
concrete walls, stone, the natural rock when possible -- with the light shafts.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.160
This is actually a Spanish quarry, which sort of inspired

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
the kind of spaces that these galleries could be.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.160
And then, coming towards the north, it opens up:

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.160
it bursts out of the mountain into, again, a view of light and of the city

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
and of the Jerusalem hills.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.160
I'd like to conclude with a project I've been working on for two months.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.160
It's the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
the U.S. Institute of Peace.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.160
The site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial;

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.160
you see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.160
on access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:28.160
That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.160
But one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
If it were to be anywhere in Washington,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
it would be an office building, a conference center,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.160
a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is --

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.160
but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:52.160
this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.160
And that was a lot of heat to deal with.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.160
The first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces --

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.160
spaces where research goes on, conference centers,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.160
a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking --

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.160
and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.160
the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.160
You see the structure as, in the sequence of structures on the Mall,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.160
very transparent and inviting and looking in.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.160
And then as you enter it again, looking in all directions towards the city.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.160
And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:43.160
that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote Kundera --

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.160
that it had to do with whiteness,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:51.160
it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.160
And this is where it is; it's sort of evolving.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
Studies for the structure of the roof,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.160
which demands maybe new materials:

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.160
how to make it white, how to make it translucent, how to make it glowing,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
how to make it not capricious.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.160
And here studying, in three dimensions,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:21.160
how to give some kind, again, of order, a structure;

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
not something you feel you could just change

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.160
because you stop the design of that particular process.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160
And so it goes.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
I'd like to conclude by saying something ...

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:47.160
(Applause)

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:53.160
I'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term "beauty."

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.160
And I know it is not a fashionable term these days,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.160
and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.160
but it seems to me that all this, in one way or the other, is a search for beauty.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.160
Beauty in the most profound sense of fit.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:18.160
I have a quote that I like by a morphologist, 1917,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.160
Theodore Cook, who said, "Beauty connotes humanity.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.160
We call a natural object beautiful because we see

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.160
that its form expresses fitness, the perfect fulfillment of function."

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.160
Well, I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.160
Nevertheless, beauty as the kind of fit; something that tells us

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.160
that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.160
have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.160
Twenty years ago, in a conference Richard and I were at together,

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.160
I wrote a poem, which seems to me to still hold for me today.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:05.160
"He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.160
He who seeks order shall find gratification.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.160
He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.160
He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:22.160
shall find the joy of self-expression. He who seeks self-expression

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
shall fall into the pit of arrogance.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.160
Arrogance is incompatible with nature.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.160
Through nature, the nature of the universe and the nature of man,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.160
we shall seek truth. If we seek truth, we shall find beauty."

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.160
Thank you very much. (Applause)
