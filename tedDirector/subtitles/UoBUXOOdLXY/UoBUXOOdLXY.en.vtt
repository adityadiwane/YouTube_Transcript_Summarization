00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:17.982
So a few weeks ago, a friend

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:20.236
of mine gave this toy car to his

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:21.847
8-year-old son.

00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:24.668
But instead of going into a store and buying one,

00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:27.463
like we do normally, he went to this

00:00:27.463 --> 00:00:29.378
website and he downloaded

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:31.547
a file, and then he printed it

00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:33.402
on this printer.

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:35.381
So this idea that you can

00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:37.328
manufacture objects

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.891
digitally using these machines

00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:40.569
is something that The Economist magazine

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:43.199
defined as the Third Industrial Revolution.

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.042
Actually, I argue that there is another revolution

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.640
going on, and it's the one that has to do with

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.168
open-source hardware and the maker's movement,

00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:55.927
because the printer that my friend used

00:00:55.927 --> 00:00:58.544
to print the toy is actually open-source.

00:00:58.544 --> 00:01:02.037
So you go to the same website, you can download all the files

00:01:02.037 --> 00:01:05.794
that you need in order to make that printer:

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:09.306
the construction files, the hardware, the software,

00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:12.115
all the instruction is there.

00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:14.235
And also this is part of a large

00:01:14.235 --> 00:01:16.835
community where there are thousands of people

00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:18.795
around the world that are actually

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:20.338
making these kinds of printers,

00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:21.810
and there's a lot of innovation

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.724
happening because it's all open-source.

00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:27.612
You don't need anybody's permission to create something great.

00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:29.973
And that space is like

00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:32.769
the personal computer in 1976,

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:35.126
like the Apples with the other companies are fighting,

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.508
and we will see in a few years,

00:01:37.508 --> 00:01:40.635
there will be the Apple of this kind of market come out.

00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:44.444
Well, there's also another interesting thing.

00:01:44.444 --> 00:01:46.408
I said the electronics are open-source, because at the heart

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:49.389
of this printer there is something I'm really attached to:

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:52.340
these Arduino boards, the motherboard that sort of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.547
powers this printer, is a project

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:56.970
I've been working on for the past seven years.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.531
It's an open-source project.

00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:01.552
I worked with these friends of mine that I have here.

00:02:01.552 --> 00:02:04.206
So the five of us, two Americans, two Italians

00:02:04.206 --> 00:02:07.187
and a Spaniard, we — (Laughter)

00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:10.262
You know, it's a worldwide project. (Laughter)

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:12.131
So we came together in this

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.754
design institute called the Interaction Design Institute

00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:16.903
Ivrea, which was teaching

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:19.201
interaction design, this idea that you can take

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:21.752
design from the simple shape

00:02:21.752 --> 00:02:23.529
of an object and you can move it

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:25.573
forward to design the way you interact with things.

00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:28.473
Well, when you design an object that's supposed to interact

00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:30.281
with a human being, if you make a foam model

00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:33.104
of a mobile phone, it doesn't make any sense.

00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:34.610
You have to have something that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.117
actually interacts with people.

00:02:37.117 --> 00:02:40.236
So, we worked on Arduino and

00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:42.052
a lot of other projects there to

00:02:42.052 --> 00:02:43.953
create platforms that would be

00:02:43.953 --> 00:02:46.137
simple for our students to use,

00:02:46.137 --> 00:02:48.598
so that our students could just build things that worked,

00:02:48.598 --> 00:02:52.656
but they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month.

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:55.311
So how do I make something that even a kid can use?

00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:58.212
And actually, with Arduino,

00:02:58.212 --> 00:03:00.635
we have kids like Sylvia that you see here,

00:03:00.635 --> 00:03:02.507
that actually make projects with Arduino.

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:05.115
I have 11-year-old kids stop me and show me

00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:07.934
stuff they built for Arduino that's really

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:09.675
scary to see the capabilities

00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:12.098
that kids have when you give them the tools.

00:03:12.098 --> 00:03:15.078
So let's look at what happens when you make a tool

00:03:15.078 --> 00:03:17.922
that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly,

00:03:17.925 --> 00:03:19.793
so one of the examples that I like to sort of

00:03:19.793 --> 00:03:21.707
kick off this discussion is this

00:03:21.707 --> 00:03:23.437
example of this cat feeder.

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:26.004
The gentleman who made this project had two cats.

00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:27.738
One was sick and the other one

00:03:27.738 --> 00:03:30.116
was healthy, so he had to make

00:03:30.116 --> 00:03:31.804
sure they ate the proper food.

00:03:31.804 --> 00:03:33.963
So he made this thing that recognizes the cat

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:36.100
from a chip mounted inside

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.820
on the collar of the cat, and opens the door

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.564
and the cat can eat the food.

00:03:40.564 --> 00:03:42.354
This is made by recycling an old CD player

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:44.561
that you can get from an old computer,

00:03:44.567 --> 00:03:48.023
some cardboard, tape, couple of sensors, a few blinking LEDs,

00:03:48.023 --> 00:03:50.811
and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something

00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:52.748
that you cannot find on the market.

00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:55.512
And I like this phrase: "Scratch your own itch."

00:03:55.512 --> 00:03:58.107
If you have an idea, you just go and you make it.

00:03:58.107 --> 00:04:00.056
This is the equivalent of sketching on paper

00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:02.628
done with electronics.

00:04:02.628 --> 00:04:04.376
So one of the features that I

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:06.204
think is important about our work

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.976
is that our hardware, on top of

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:11.166
being made with love in Italy —

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:12.919
as you can see from the

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.948
back of the circuit — (Laughter)

00:04:14.948 --> 00:04:16.788
is that it's open,

00:04:16.788 --> 00:04:18.756
so we publish all the design

00:04:18.756 --> 00:04:20.484
files for the circuit online,

00:04:20.484 --> 00:04:22.467
so you can download it and

00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:24.307
you can actually use it to

00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:26.940
make something, or to modify, to learn.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.209
You know, when I was learning about programming,

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:30.086
I learned by looking at other people's code,

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:33.515
or looking at other people's circuits in magazines.

00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:35.731
And this is a good way to learn,

00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:37.972
by looking at other people's work.

00:04:37.972 --> 00:04:40.564
So the different elements of the project are all open,

00:04:40.564 --> 00:04:42.267
so the hardware is released

00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:44.331
with a Creative Commons license.

00:04:44.331 --> 00:04:46.357
So, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes

00:04:46.357 --> 00:04:48.496
like a piece of culture that you share

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:50.455
and you build upon, like it was

00:04:50.455 --> 00:04:54.092
a song or a poem with Creative Commons.

00:04:54.092 --> 00:04:56.768
Or, the software is GPL, so it's open-source as well.

00:04:56.768 --> 00:05:00.195
The documentation and the hands-on teaching

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:03.778
methodology is also open-source and released as the Creative Commons.

00:05:03.778 --> 00:05:05.781
Just the name is protected so

00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:08.527
that we can make sure that we can tell people

00:05:08.527 --> 00:05:11.167
what is Arduino and what isn't.

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:12.839
Now, Arduino itself is made of

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:15.079
a lot of different open-source components

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:17.830
that maybe individually are hard to use for

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.937
a 12-year-old kid, so Arduino

00:05:19.937 --> 00:05:21.790
wraps everything together into

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.056
a mashup of open-source technologies

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:25.928
where we try to give them the

00:05:25.928 --> 00:05:28.135
best user experience to get something done quickly.

00:05:28.135 --> 00:05:31.006
So you have situations like this,

00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:32.944
where some people in Chile

00:05:32.944 --> 00:05:35.736
decided to make their own boards instead of buying them,

00:05:35.742 --> 00:05:37.667
to organize a workshop and

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:40.767
to save money. Or there are

00:05:40.767 --> 00:05:42.712
companies that make their own

00:05:42.712 --> 00:05:44.481
variations of Arduino that fit

00:05:44.481 --> 00:05:46.232
in a certain market, and there's

00:05:46.232 --> 00:05:48.945
probably, maybe like a 150 of them

00:05:48.945 --> 00:05:50.737
or something at the moment.

00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:52.625
This one is made by a company

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:54.569
called Adafruit, which is run by

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.881
this woman called Limor Fried,

00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:58.488
also known as Ladyada, who is

00:05:58.488 --> 00:06:01.209
one of the heroes of the open-source hardware movement

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:02.743
and the maker movement.

00:06:02.743 --> 00:06:05.697
So, this idea that you have a new, sort of

00:06:05.697 --> 00:06:08.481
turbo-charged DIY community

00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:10.161
that believes in open-source,

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.361
in collaboration, collaborates

00:06:12.361 --> 00:06:14.802
online, collaborates in different spaces.

00:06:14.802 --> 00:06:17.924
There is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered

00:06:17.924 --> 00:06:19.464
all these people and sort of put them together

00:06:19.464 --> 00:06:21.896
as a community, and you see

00:06:21.896 --> 00:06:23.924
a very technical project explained in a

00:06:23.924 --> 00:06:26.781
very simple language, beautifully typeset.

00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:28.349
Or you have websites,

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:30.610
like this one, like Instructables,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.614
where people actually teach each other about anything.

00:06:32.614 --> 00:06:34.359
So this one is about Arduino projects,

00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:37.920
the page you see on the screen, but effectively here you can

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.498
learn how to make a cake and everything else.

00:06:40.498 --> 00:06:43.298
So let's look at some projects.

00:06:43.298 --> 00:06:44.914
So this one is a quadcopter.

00:06:44.914 --> 00:06:46.629
It's a small model helicopter.

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:48.899
In a way, it's a toy, no?

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:51.192
And so this one was military technology

00:06:51.192 --> 00:06:53.113
a few years ago, and now it's

00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:55.755
open-source, easy to use, you can buy it online.

00:06:55.755 --> 00:06:59.673
DIY Drones is the community; they do this thing called ArduCopter.

00:06:59.673 --> 00:07:02.684
But then somebody actually launched this start-up called

00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:04.879
Matternet, where they figured out that you could

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.177
use this to actually transport

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.610
things from one village to another in Africa,

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.178
and the fact that this was easy to find,

00:07:11.178 --> 00:07:13.790
open-source, easy to hack, enabled them

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.928
to prototype their company really quickly.

00:07:15.928 --> 00:07:18.617
Or, other projects. Matt Richardson: I'm getting a little sick

00:07:18.617 --> 00:07:21.873
of hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over

00:07:21.873 --> 00:07:25.083
again, so I decided to do something about it.

00:07:25.083 --> 00:07:26.497
This Arduino project,

00:07:26.497 --> 00:07:29.859
which I call the Enough Already, will mute the TV anytime

00:07:29.872 --> 00:07:31.847
any of these over-exposed

00:07:31.847 --> 00:07:33.079
personalities is mentioned. (Laughter)

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:37.927
I'll show you how I made it. (Applause)

00:07:37.927 --> 00:07:39.751
MB: Check this out.

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.708
MR: Our producers caught up with Kim Kardashian earlier

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:44.611
today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her —

00:07:44.611 --> 00:07:46.002
MB: Eh? (Laughter)

00:07:46.002 --> 00:07:47.904
MR: It should do a pretty good

00:07:47.904 --> 00:07:49.571
job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details

00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:51.367
of Kim Kardashian's wedding.

00:07:51.367 --> 00:07:55.924
MB: Okay. So, you know, again, what is interesting here

00:07:55.924 --> 00:07:58.894
is that Matt found this module

00:07:58.894 --> 00:08:01.126
that lets Arduino process

00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:03.015
TV signals, he found some code

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:05.844
written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV,

00:08:05.844 --> 00:08:08.194
put it together and then created this great project.

00:08:08.194 --> 00:08:10.246
It's also used, Arduino's used,

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:13.133
in serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider.

00:08:13.146 --> 00:08:15.855
There's some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of

00:08:15.855 --> 00:08:17.655
measuring some parameters.

00:08:17.655 --> 00:08:19.974
Or it's used for —

00:08:19.974 --> 00:08:30.686
(Music)

00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:33.127
So this is a musical interface

00:08:33.127 --> 00:08:35.246
built by a student from Italy,

00:08:35.246 --> 00:08:37.366
and he's now turning this into

00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:39.224
a product. Because it was a

00:08:39.224 --> 00:08:41.455
student project becoming a product.

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:43.399
Or it can be used to make an assistive device.

00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:45.389
This is a glove that understands

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:47.536
the sign language and transforms

00:08:47.536 --> 00:08:49.735
the gestures you make into sounds

00:08:49.735 --> 00:08:53.051
and writes the words that you're signing on a display

00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:54.397
And again, this is made of all different parts you can find

00:08:54.397 --> 00:08:57.346
on all the websites that sell Arduino-compatible parts,

00:08:57.346 --> 00:08:59.430
and you assemble it into a project.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.751
Or this is a project from the ITP part of NYU,

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:04.478
where they met with this boy

00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:07.495
who has a severe disability, cannot play with the PS3,

00:09:07.496 --> 00:09:09.439
so they built this device that

00:09:09.439 --> 00:09:11.886
allows the kid to play baseball

00:09:11.886 --> 00:09:13.783
although he has limited

00:09:13.783 --> 00:09:16.159
movement capability.

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:18.309
Or you can find it in arts projects.

00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:20.624
So this is the txtBomber.

00:09:20.624 --> 00:09:22.261
So you put a message into this device

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:25.104
and then you roll it on the wall, and it basically

00:09:25.104 --> 00:09:27.006
has all these solenoids

00:09:27.006 --> 00:09:28.798
pressing the buttons on spray cans,

00:09:28.798 --> 00:09:30.434
so you just pull it over a wall

00:09:30.434 --> 00:09:32.161
and it just writes on the wall

00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:34.623
all the political messages.

00:09:34.623 --> 00:09:37.254
So, yeah. (Applause)

00:09:37.254 --> 00:09:39.294
Then we have this plant here.

00:09:39.294 --> 00:09:41.184
This is called Botanicalls,

00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:44.379
because there's an Arduino ball with a Wi-Fi module

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:46.980
in the plant, and it's measuring

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.495
the well-being of the plant,

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:50.485
and it's creating a Twitter account

00:09:50.485 --> 00:09:54.014
where you can actually interact with the plant. (Laughter)

00:09:54.014 --> 00:09:55.944
So, you know, this plant

00:09:55.944 --> 00:09:58.423
will start to say, "This is really hot," or

00:09:58.423 --> 00:10:02.494
there's a lot of, you know, "I need water right now." (Laughter)

00:10:02.494 --> 00:10:05.917
So it just gives a personality to your plant.

00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:08.584
Or this is something that twitters when the

00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:10.550
baby inside the belly of a

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.158
pregnant woman kicks. (Laughter)

00:10:13.158 --> 00:10:14.749
Or this is a 14-year-old kid in

00:10:14.749 --> 00:10:16.869
Chile who made a system that

00:10:16.869 --> 00:10:19.193
detects earthquakes and publishes on Twitter.

00:10:19.193 --> 00:10:21.681
He has 280,000 followers.

00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:23.825
He's 14 and he anticipated

00:10:23.825 --> 00:10:27.464
a governmental project by one year. (Applause)

00:10:27.464 --> 00:10:31.205
Or again, another project where,

00:10:31.205 --> 00:10:32.951
by analyzing the Twitter feed

00:10:32.951 --> 00:10:34.887
of a family, you can basically

00:10:34.887 --> 00:10:37.629
point where they are, like in the "Harry Potter" movie.

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:40.445
So you can find out everything about this project on the website.

00:10:40.445 --> 00:10:45.126
Or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts. (Laughter)

00:10:45.126 --> 00:10:48.209
It's interesting how, in 2009,

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:50.591
Gizmodo basically defined,

00:10:50.591 --> 00:10:53.354
said that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter,

00:10:53.354 --> 00:10:56.615
so it was — a lot changed in between. (Laughter)

00:10:56.615 --> 00:10:58.059
So very serious project.

00:10:58.059 --> 00:11:00.266
When the Fukushima disaster happened,

00:11:00.266 --> 00:11:03.268
a bunch of people in Japan, they realized that the information

00:11:03.268 --> 00:11:05.823
that the government was giving wasn't really open

00:11:05.823 --> 00:11:07.573
and really reliable, so they built

00:11:07.573 --> 00:11:10.349
this Geiger counter, plus Arduino, plus network

00:11:10.349 --> 00:11:12.281
interface. They made 100

00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:15.846
of them and gave them to people around Japan, and essentially

00:11:15.859 --> 00:11:18.119
the data that they gathered gets published on this website

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:20.268
called Cosm, another website

00:11:20.268 --> 00:11:23.909
they built, so you can actually get reliable real-time

00:11:23.909 --> 00:11:25.734
information from the field,

00:11:25.734 --> 00:11:29.341
and you can get unbiased information.

00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:31.224
Or this machine here, it's from

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:33.664
the DIY bio movement,

00:11:33.664 --> 00:11:35.988
and it's one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA,

00:11:35.988 --> 00:11:39.366
and again, it's completely open-source from the ground up.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:42.758
Or you have students in developing countries making

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.749
replicas of scientific instruments that cost

00:11:45.749 --> 00:11:47.660
a lot of money to make.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.250
Actually they just build them themselves for a lot less

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.483
using Arduino and a few parts.

00:11:51.483 --> 00:11:53.379
This is a pH probe.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:56.777
Or you get kids, like these kids, they're from Spain.

00:11:56.777 --> 00:11:59.635
They learned how to program and to make robots when they

00:11:59.641 --> 00:12:02.310
were probably, like, 11, and then they started to use Arduino

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.303
to make these robots that play football. They became

00:12:04.303 --> 00:12:07.145
world champions by making an Arduino-based robot.

00:12:07.145 --> 00:12:09.021
And so when we had to make

00:12:09.021 --> 00:12:11.831
our own educational robot, we just went to them and said,

00:12:11.833 --> 00:12:14.181
you know, "You design it, because you know exactly

00:12:14.181 --> 00:12:17.911
what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids."

00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:19.587
Not me. I'm an old guy.

00:12:19.587 --> 00:12:22.123
What am I supposed to excite, huh? (Laughter)

00:12:22.123 --> 00:12:26.058
But as I — in terms of educational assets. (Laughter)

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:27.956
There's also companies like Google

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:29.907
that are using the technology

00:12:29.907 --> 00:12:32.781
to create interfaces between

00:12:32.781 --> 00:12:36.174
mobile phones, tablets and the real world.

00:12:36.174 --> 00:12:37.194
So the Accessory Development Kit

00:12:37.194 --> 00:12:39.246
from Google is open-source

00:12:39.246 --> 00:12:40.628
and based on Arduino, as opposed

00:12:40.628 --> 00:12:42.285
to the one from Apple which is

00:12:42.285 --> 00:12:44.789
closed-source, NDA, sign your

00:12:44.789 --> 00:12:47.354
life to Apple. Here you are.

00:12:47.354 --> 00:12:49.934
There's a giant maze, and Joey's sitting there, and the

00:12:49.934 --> 00:12:54.118
maze is moving when you tilt the tablet.

00:12:54.118 --> 00:12:57.089
Also, I come from Italy, and the design is important

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.437
in Italy, and yet very conservative.

00:12:59.437 --> 00:13:00.854
So we worked with a design

00:13:00.854 --> 00:13:03.020
studio called Habits, in Milan,

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.708
to make this mirror, which is completely open-source.

00:13:05.708 --> 00:13:08.893
This doubles also as an iPod speaker.

00:13:08.893 --> 00:13:12.530
So the idea is that the hardware, the software,

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.998
the design of the object, the fabrication,

00:13:13.998 --> 00:13:16.483
everything about this project is open-source

00:13:16.483 --> 00:13:18.353
and you can make it yourself.

00:13:18.353 --> 00:13:20.707
So we want other designers to pick this up and learn how

00:13:20.707 --> 00:13:23.318
to make great devices, to learn

00:13:23.318 --> 00:13:24.996
how to make interactive products

00:13:24.996 --> 00:13:27.765
by starting from something real.

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:30.166
But when you have this idea,

00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:32.079
you know, what happens to all these ideas?

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:33.957
There's, like, thousands of ideas that I —

00:13:33.957 --> 00:13:36.117
You know, it would take seven hours for me to do

00:13:36.117 --> 00:13:37.997
all the presentations.

00:13:37.997 --> 00:13:41.045
I will not take all the seven hours. Thank you.

00:13:41.045 --> 00:13:43.061
But let's start from this example:

00:13:43.061 --> 00:13:44.989
So, the group of people

00:13:44.989 --> 00:13:47.400
that started this company called Pebble, they prototyped

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.092
a watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone,

00:13:51.092 --> 00:13:52.628
and you can display information

00:13:52.628 --> 00:13:54.900
on it. And they prototyped with

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.845
an old LCD screen from a Nokia

00:13:56.845 --> 00:13:59.253
mobile phone and an Arduino.

00:13:59.253 --> 00:14:01.086
And then, when they had a final

00:14:01.086 --> 00:14:03.494
project, they actually went to Kickstarter

00:14:03.494 --> 00:14:06.113
and they were asking for 100,000 dollars to make

00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:07.968
a few of them to sell.

00:14:07.968 --> 00:14:10.039
They got 10 million dollars.

00:14:10.039 --> 00:14:11.574
They got a completely

00:14:11.574 --> 00:14:14.269
fully funded start-up, and they don't have to,

00:14:14.287 --> 00:14:16.139
you know, get VCs involved or anything,

00:14:16.139 --> 00:14:18.972
just excite the people with their great project.

00:14:19.007 --> 00:14:21.291
The last project I want to show you is this:

00:14:21.291 --> 00:14:25.029
It's called ArduSat. It's currently on Kickstarter,

00:14:25.029 --> 00:14:27.336
so if you want to contribute, please do it.

00:14:27.336 --> 00:14:30.146
It's a satellite that goes into space, which is probably

00:14:30.146 --> 00:14:32.068
the least open-source thing you can imagine,

00:14:32.068 --> 00:14:34.119
and it contains an Arduino

00:14:34.119 --> 00:14:37.229
connected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino,

00:14:37.229 --> 00:14:39.685
you can actually upload your experiments

00:14:39.685 --> 00:14:41.876
into this satellite and run them.

00:14:41.876 --> 00:14:44.512
So imagine, if you as a high school can have the satellite

00:14:44.512 --> 00:14:46.861
for a week and do satellite

00:14:46.861 --> 00:14:49.513
space experiments like that.

00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:52.269
So, as I said, there's

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:53.828
lots of examples, and I'm going to stop here. And I just

00:14:53.828 --> 00:14:56.344
want to thank the Arduino community

00:14:56.344 --> 00:14:58.014
for being the best, and just

00:14:58.014 --> 00:15:00.206
every day making lots of projects.

00:15:00.206 --> 00:15:03.670
Thank you. (Applause)

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.997
(Applause)

00:15:05.997 --> 00:15:08.484
And thanks to the community.

00:15:08.484 --> 00:15:10.457
Chris Anderson: Massimo,

00:15:10.457 --> 00:15:13.062
you told me earlier today that you had no idea, of course,

00:15:13.062 --> 00:15:14.534
that it would take off like this.

00:15:14.534 --> 00:15:15.323
MB: No.

00:15:15.323 --> 00:15:17.119
CA: I mean, how must you feel when you read this stuff and you

00:15:17.119 --> 00:15:19.620
see what you've unlocked?

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.436
MB: Well, it's the work of a lot of people, so we as a community

00:15:22.439 --> 00:15:24.233
are enabling people to make

00:15:24.233 --> 00:15:26.717
great stuff, and I just feel overwhelmed.

00:15:26.735 --> 00:15:28.904
It's just, it's difficult to describe this.

00:15:28.904 --> 00:15:30.918
Every morning, I wake up and I look at all the stuff that

00:15:30.918 --> 00:15:33.104
Google Alerts sends me, and it's

00:15:33.104 --> 00:15:34.639
just amazing. It's just

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:37.312
going into every field that you can imagine.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.304
CA: Thank you so much. (Applause)

00:15:39.304 --> 00:15:42.566
(Applause)
