00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So historically there has

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
been a huge divide between what people

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
consider to be non-living systems on one

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
side, and living systems on the other side.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
So we go from, say, this beautiful and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
complex crystal as non-life, and this rather

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
beautiful and complex cat on the other side.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Over the last hundred and fifty years or so,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
science has kind of blurred this distinction

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
between non-living and living systems, and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
now we consider that there may be a kind

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
of continuum that exists between the two.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
We'll just take one example here:

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
a virus is a natural system, right?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
But it's very simple. It's very simplistic.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
It doesn't really satisfy all the requirements,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
it doesn't have all the characteristics

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
of living systems and is in fact a parasite

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
on other living systems in order to, say,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
reproduce and evolve.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
But what we're going to be talking about here

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
tonight are experiments done on this sort of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
non-living end of this spectrum -- so actually

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
doing chemical experiments in the laboratory,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
mixing together nonliving ingredients

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
to make new structures, and that these

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
new structures might have some of the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
characteristics of living systems.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Really what I'm talking about here is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
trying to create a kind of artificial life.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
So what are these characteristics that I'm

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
talking about? These are them.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
We consider first that life has a body.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Now this is necessary to distinguish the self

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
from the environment.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
Life also has a metabolism. Now this is a

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
process by which life can convert resources

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
from the environment into building blocks

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
so it can maintain and build itself.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Life also has a kind of inheritable information.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Now we, as humans, we store our information

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
as DNA in our genomes and we pass this

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
information on to our offspring.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
If we couple the first two -- the body and the metabolism --

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
we can come up with a system that could

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
perhaps move and replicate, and if we

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
coupled these now to inheritable information,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
we can come up with a system that would be

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
more lifelike, and would perhaps evolve.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And so these are the things we will try to do

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
in the lab, make some experiments that have

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
one or more of these characteristics of life.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
So how do we do this? Well, we use

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
a model system that we term a protocell.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
You might think of this as kind of like a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
primitive cell. It is a simple chemical

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
model of a living cell, and if you consider

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
for example a cell in your body may have

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
on the order of millions of different types

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
of molecules that need to come together,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
play together in a complex network

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
to produce something that we call alive.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
In the laboratory what we want to do

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
is much the same, but with on the order of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
tens of different types of molecules --

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
so a drastic reduction in complexity, but still

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
trying to produce something that looks lifelike.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And so what we do is, we start simple

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and we work our way up to living systems.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Consider for a moment this quote by

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Leduc, a hundred years ago, considering a

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
kind of synthetic biology:

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
"The synthesis of life, should it ever occur,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
will not be the sensational discovery which we

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
usually associate with the idea."

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
That's his first statement. So if we actually

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
create life in the laboratories, it's

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
probably not going to impact our lives at all.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
"If we accept the theory of evolution, then

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
in the production of forms intermediate

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
between the inorganic and the organic

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
world, or between the non-living

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and living world, forms which possess

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
only some of the rudimentary attributes of life"

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
-- so, the ones I just discussed --

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
"to which other attributes will be slowly added

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
in the course of development by the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
evolutionary actions of the environment."

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
So we start simple, we make some structures

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that may have some of these characteristics

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
of life, and then we try to develop that

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
to become more lifelike.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
This is how we can start to make a protocell.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
We use this idea called self-assembly.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
What that means is, I can mix some

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
chemicals together in a test tube in my lab,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and these chemicals will start to self-associate

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
to form larger and larger structures.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
So say on the order of tens of thousands,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
hundreds of thousands of molecules will

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
come together to form a large structure

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
that didn't exist before.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And in this particular example,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
what I took is some membrane molecules,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
mixed those together in the right environment,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and within seconds it forms these rather

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
complex and beautiful structures here.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
These membranes are also quite similar,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
morphologically and functionally,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
to the membranes in your body,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and we can use these, as they say,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
to form the body of our protocell.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Likewise,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
we can work with oil and water systems.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
As you know, when you put oil and water together,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
they don't mix, but through self-assembly

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
we can get a nice oil droplet to form,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
and we can actually use this as a body for

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
our artificial organism or for our protocell,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
as you will see later.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
So that's just forming some body stuff, right?

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Some architectures.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
What about the other aspects of living systems?

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
So we came up with this protocell model here

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
that I'm showing.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
We started with a natural occurring clay

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
called montmorillonite.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
This is natural from the environment, this clay.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
It forms a surface that is, say, chemically active.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
It could run a metabolism on it.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Certain kind of molecules like to associate

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
with the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
-- this is a relative of DNA,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
it's an informational molecule --

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
it can come along and it starts to associate

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
with the surface of this clay.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
This structure, then, can organize the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
formation of a membrane boundary around

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
itself, so it can make a body of

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
liquid molecules around itself, and that's

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
shown in green here on this micrograph.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
So just through self-assembly, mixing things

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
together in the lab, we can come up with, say,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
a metabolic surface with some

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
informational molecules attached

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
inside of this membrane body, right?

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.260
So we're on a road towards living systems.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
But if you saw this protocell, you would not

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
confuse this with something that was actually alive.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
It's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
it doesn't really do anything.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
So, something is missing.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Some things are missing.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
So some things that are missing is,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
for example, if you had a flow of energy

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
through a system, what we'd want

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
is a protocell that can harvest

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
some of that energy in order to maintain itself,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
much like living systems do.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
So we came up with a different protocell

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
model, and this is actually simpler than the previous one.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
In this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
but a chemical metabolism inside

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
that allows this protocell to use energy

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
to do something, to actually become dynamic,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
as we'll see here.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
You add the droplet to the system.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
It's a pool of water, and the protocell

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
starts moving itself around in the system.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
Okay? Oil droplet forms

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
through self-assembly, has a chemical

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
metabolism inside so it can use energy,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
and it uses that energy to move itself

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
around in its environment.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
As we heard earlier, movement is very

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
important in these kinds of living systems.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
It is moving around, exploring its environment,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and remodeling its environment, as you see,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
So it's acting, in a sense, like a living system

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
trying to preserve itself.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
We take this same moving protocell here,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
and we put it in another experiment,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
get it moving. Then I'm going

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
to add some food to the system,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
and you'll see that in blue here, right?

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
So I add some food source to the system.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
The protocell moves. It encounters the food.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
It reconfigures itself and actually then

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
is able to climb to the highest concentration

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
of food in that system and stop there.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Alright? So not only do we have this system

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
that has a body, it has a metabolism,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
it can use energy, it moves around.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
It can sense its local environment

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and actually find resources

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
in the environment to sustain itself.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Now, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
a neural system. This is just a sack of

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
chemicals that is able to have this interesting

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
and complex lifelike behavior.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
If we count the number of chemicals

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
in that system, actually, including the water

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
that's in the dish, we have five chemicals

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
that can do this.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
So then we put these protocells together in a

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
single experiment to see what they would do,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and depending on the conditions, we have

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
some protocells on the left that are

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
moving around and it likes to touch the other

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
structures in its environment.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
On the other hand we have two moving

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
protocells that like to circle each other,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and they form a kind of a dance, a complex dance with each other.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Right? So not only do individual protocells

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
have behavior, what we've interpreted as

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
behavior in this system, but we also have

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
basically population-level behavior

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
similar to what organisms have.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
So now that you're all experts on protocells,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
we're going to play a game with these protocells.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
We're going to make two different kinds.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistry

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
inside that, when activated, the protocell

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
starts to vibrate around, just dancing.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
So remember, these are primitive things,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
so dancing protocells, that's very

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
interesting to us. (Laughter)

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
The second protocell has a different

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
chemistry inside, and when activated,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
the protocells all come together and they fuse

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
into one big one. Right?

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
And we just put these two together

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
in the same system.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
So there's population A,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
there's population B, and then

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
we activate the system,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and protocell Bs, they're the blue ones,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
they all come together. They fuse together

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
to form one big blob, and the other protocell

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
just dances around. And this just happens

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
until all of the energy in the system is

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
basically used up, and then, game over.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
So then I repeated this experiment

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
a bunch of times, and one time

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
something very interesting happened.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
So, I added these protocells together

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
to the system, and protocell A and protocell B

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
That didn't happen before. There it goes.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
There's a protocell AB now in this system.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
while protocell B does the fusing, okay?

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
But then something even more interesting happens.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
Watch when these two large protocells,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
the hybrid ones, fuse together.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Now we have a dancing protocell

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter)

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
Just with blobs of chemicals, again.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
So the way this works is, you have

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
a simple system of five chemicals here,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
a simple system here. When they hybridize,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
you then form something that's different than

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
before, it's more complex than before,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
and you get the emergence of another kind of

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
lifelike behavior which

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
in this case is replication.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
So since we can make some interesting

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
protocells that we like, interesting colors and

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
interesting behaviors, and they're very easy

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
to make, and they have interesting lifelike

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
properties, perhaps these protocells have

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
something to tell us about the origin of life

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
on the Earth. Perhaps these represent an

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
easily accessible step, one of the first steps

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
by which life got started on the early Earth.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Certainly, there were molecules present on

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
the early Earth, but they wouldn't have been

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
these pure compounds that we worked with

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
in the lab and I showed in these experiments.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Rather, they'd be a real complex mixture of

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
all kinds of stuff, because

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
uncontrolled chemical reactions produce

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
a diverse mixture of organic compounds.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
Think of it like a primordial ooze, okay?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
And it's a pool that's too difficult to fully

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
characterize, even by modern methods, and

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
the product looks brown, like this tar here

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
on the left. A pure compound

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
is shown on the right, for contrast.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
So this is similar to what happens when you

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
you put them in a pan, and you apply energy.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
You turn up the heat, you start making

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
forming a brownish caramel, right?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
If you let that go unregulated, you'll

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
continue to make and break chemical bonds,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
forming an even more diverse mixture of

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
molecules that then forms this kind of black

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
tarry stuff in your pan, right, that's

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
difficult to wash out. So that's what

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
the origin of life would have looked like.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
You needed to get life out of this junk that

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
is present on the early Earth,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
four, 4.5 billion years ago.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
So the challenge then is,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
and try to make some protocells with lifelike

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
properties from this kind of primordial ooze.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
So we're able to then see the self-assembly

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
of these oil droplet bodies again

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
that we've seen previously,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
and the black spots inside of there

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
represent this kind of black tar -- this diverse,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
very complex, organic black tar.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
And we put them into one of these

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
experiments, as you've seen earlier, and then

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
we watch lively movement that comes out.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
They look really good, very nice movement,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
and also they appear to have some kind of

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
behavior where they kind of circle

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
around each other and follow each other,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
similar to what we've seen before -- but again,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
working with just primordial conditions,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
no pure chemicals.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
These are also, these tar-fueled protocells,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
are also able to locate resources

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.260
in their environment.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
I'm going to add some resource from the left,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
here, that defuses into the system,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
and you can see, they really like that.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
They become very energetic, and able

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
to find the resource in the environment,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
similar to what we saw before.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
But again, these are done in these primordial

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
conditions, really messy conditions,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
not sort of sterile laboratory conditions.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
These are very dirty little protocells,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
as a matter of fact. (Laughter)

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
But they have lifelike properties, is the point.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
So, doing these artificial life experiments

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
helps us define a potential path between

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
non-living and living systems.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
And not only that, but it helps us

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
broaden our view of what life is

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
and what possible life there could be

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
out there -- life that could be very different

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
from life that we find here on Earth.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And that leads me to the next

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
term, which is "weird life."

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
This is a term by Steve Benner.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
This is used in reference to a report

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
in 2007 by the National Research Council

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
in the United States, wherein

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
they tried to understand how we can

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
look for life elsewhere in the universe, okay,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
especially if that life is very different from life

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
on Earth. If we went to another planet and

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
we thought there might be life there,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
how could we even recognize it as life?

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Well, they came up with three very general

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
criteria. First is -- and they're listed here.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
The first is, the system has to be in

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
non-equilibrium. That means the system

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.260
cannot be dead, in a matter of fact.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
Basically what that means is, you have

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
an input of energy into the system that life

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
can use and exploit to maintain itself.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
This is similar to having the Sun shining

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
on the Earth, driving photosynthesis,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
driving the ecosystem.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Without the Sun, there's likely to be

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
no life on this planet.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
Secondly, life needs to be in liquid form,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
so that means even if we had some

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
interesting structures, interesting molecules

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
together but they were frozen solid,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
then this is not a good place for life.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
And thirdly, we need to be able to make

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
and break chemical bonds. And again

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
this is important because life transforms

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
resources from the environment into

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
building blocks so it can maintain itself.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Now today, I told you about very strange

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and weird protocells -- some that contain clay,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
some that have primordial ooze in them,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
some that have basically oil

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
instead of water inside of them.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Most of these don't contain DNA,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
but yet they have lifelike properties.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
But these protocells satisfy

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
these general requirements of living systems.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
So by making these chemical, artificial

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
life experiments, we hope not only

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
to understand something fundamental

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
about the origin of life and the existence

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
of life on this planet, but also

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
what possible life there could be

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
out there in the universe. Thank you.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.260
(Applause)
