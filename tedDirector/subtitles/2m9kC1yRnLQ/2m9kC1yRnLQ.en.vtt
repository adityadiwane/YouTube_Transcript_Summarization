00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.121
Wow, this is bright.

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:18.112
It must use a lot of power.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:19.604
Well, flying you all in here

00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:22.052
must have cost a bit of energy too.

00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:24.970
So the whole planet needs a lot of energy,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.871
and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel.

00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:29.920
We've been burning gas.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.307
It's been a good run.

00:00:31.307 --> 00:00:34.175
It got us to where we are, but we have to stop.

00:00:34.175 --> 00:00:36.329
We can't do that anymore.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.610
So we are trying different types of energy now,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.824
alternative energy,

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:42.322
but it proved quite difficult to find something

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:45.123
that's as convenient and as cost-effective

00:00:45.123 --> 00:00:47.940
as oil, gas and coal.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.030
My personal favorite is nuclear energy.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.631
Now, it's very energy-dense,

00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:57.112
it produces solid, reliable power,

00:00:57.112 --> 00:00:59.495
and it doesn't make any CO2.

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:00.987
Now we know of two ways

00:01:00.987 --> 00:01:06.161
of making nuclear energy: fission and fusion.

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:08.506
Now in fission, you take a big nucleus,

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:10.141
you break it in part, in two,

00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:11.688
and it makes lots of energy,

00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:13.901
and this is how the nuclear reactor today works.

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:15.310
It works pretty good.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.464
And then there's fusion.

00:01:17.464 --> 00:01:19.870
Now, I like fusion. Fusion's much better.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.564
So you take two small nuclei,

00:01:21.564 --> 00:01:24.070
you put it together, and you make helium,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.428
and that's very nice.

00:01:25.428 --> 00:01:26.974
It makes lots of energy.

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:29.574
This is nature's way of producing energy.

00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:31.982
The sun and all the stars in the universe

00:01:31.982 --> 00:01:34.227
run on fusion.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.123
Now, a fusion plant

00:01:36.123 --> 00:01:38.438
would actually be quite cost-effective

00:01:38.438 --> 00:01:40.428
and it also would be quite safe.

00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:44.861
It only produces short term radioactive waste,

00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:46.893
and it cannot melt down.

00:01:46.893 --> 00:01:49.420
Now, the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.238
In the ocean, you can extract the fuel

00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:53.128
for about one thousandth of a cent

00:01:53.128 --> 00:01:55.459
per kilowatt-hour, so that's very, very cheap.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.847
And if the whole planet would run on fusion,

00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:00.291
we could extract the fuel from the ocean.

00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:03.555
It would run for billions and billions of years.

00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:07.327
Now, if fusion is so great, why don't we have it?

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:08.663
Where is it?

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:10.511
Well, there's always a bit of a catch.

00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:13.749
Fusion is really, really hard to do.

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.233
So the problem is, those two nuclei,

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:17.861
they are both positively charged,

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:19.652
so they don't want to fuse.

00:02:19.652 --> 00:02:21.429
They go like this. They go like that.

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:22.393
So in order to make them fuse,

00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:24.580
you have to throw them at
each other with great speed,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.493
and if they have enough speed,

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:27.327
they will go against the repulsion,

00:02:27.327 --> 00:02:29.480
they will touch, and they will make energy.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.887
Now, the particle speed

00:02:31.887 --> 00:02:33.657
is a measure of the temperature.

00:02:33.657 --> 00:02:35.399
So the temperature required for fusion

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.561
is 150 billion degrees C.

00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:40.392
This is rather warm,

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:43.838
and this is why fusion is so hard to do.

00:02:43.838 --> 00:02:45.863
Now, I caught my little fusion bug

00:02:45.863 --> 00:02:49.533
when I did my Ph.D. here at the
University of British Columbia,

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:52.585
and then I got a big job in a laser printer place

00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:55.123
making printing for the printing industry.

00:02:55.123 --> 00:02:57.375
I worked there for 10 years,

00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:59.055
and I got a little bit bored,

00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:02.008
and then I was 40, and I got a mid-life crisis,

00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:03.641
you know, the usual thing:

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.100
Who am I? What should I do?

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.686
What should I do? What can I do?

00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:10.738
And then I was looking at my good work,

00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:12.789
and what I was doing is I was cutting the forests

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:14.144
around here in B.C.

00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:15.738
and burying you, all of you,

00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:19.180
in millions of tons of junk mail.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.115
Now, that was not very satisfactory.

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:23.380
So some people buy a Porsche.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.151
Others get a mistress.

00:03:26.151 --> 00:03:27.825
But I've decided to get my bit

00:03:27.825 --> 00:03:32.088
to solve global warming and make fusion happen.

00:03:32.088 --> 00:03:33.819
Now, so the first thing I did

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.248
is I looked into the literature and I see,

00:03:36.248 --> 00:03:38.990
how does fusion work?

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.132
So the physicists have been
working on fusion for a while,

00:03:42.132 --> 00:03:43.448
and one of the ways they do it

00:03:43.448 --> 00:03:45.754
is with something called a tokamak.

00:03:45.754 --> 00:03:48.484
It's a big ring of magnetic coil,

00:03:48.484 --> 00:03:49.810
superconducting coil,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.160
and it makes a magnetic field

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.948
in a ring like this,

00:03:52.948 --> 00:03:54.340
and the hot gas in the middle,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.470
which is called a plasma, is trapped.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.218
The particles go round and round and round

00:03:58.218 --> 00:03:59.658
the circle at the wall.

00:03:59.658 --> 00:04:01.186
Then they throw a huge amount of heat in there

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:03.660
to try to cook that to fusion temperature.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.988
So this is the inside of one of those donuts,

00:04:05.988 --> 00:04:07.320
and on the right side you can see

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.460
the fusion plasma in there.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.708
Now, a second way of doing this

00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:14.108
is by using laser fusion.

00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:16.228
Now in laser fusion, you have a little ping pong ball,

00:04:16.228 --> 00:04:18.274
you put the fusion fuel in the center,

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:21.204
and you zap that with a whole
bunch of laser around it.

00:04:21.204 --> 00:04:22.908
The lasers are very strong, and it squashes

00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:24.634
the ping pong ball really, really quick.

00:04:24.634 --> 00:04:26.589
And if you squeeze something hard enough,

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:27.964
it gets hotter,

00:04:27.964 --> 00:04:29.360
and if it gets really, really fast,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.678
and they do that in one billionth of a second,

00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:33.581
it makes enough energy and enough heat

00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:34.917
to make fusion.

00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:36.994
So this is the inside of one such machine.

00:04:36.994 --> 00:04:38.837
You see the laser beam and the pellet

00:04:38.837 --> 00:04:40.386
in the center.

00:04:40.386 --> 00:04:43.348
Now, most people think that fusion is going nowhere.

00:04:43.348 --> 00:04:46.280
They always think that the physicists are in their lab

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.095
and they're working hard, but nothing is happening.

00:04:48.095 --> 00:04:49.615
That's actually not quite true.

00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:51.607
This is a curve of the gain in fusion

00:04:51.607 --> 00:04:53.799
over the last 30 years or so,

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:55.357
and you can see that we're making now

00:04:55.357 --> 00:04:58.190
about 10,000 times more fusion than we used to

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.264
when we started.

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:00.259
That's a pretty good gain.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.245
As a matter of fact, it's as fast

00:05:02.245 --> 00:05:03.945
as the fabled Moore's Law

00:05:03.945 --> 00:05:06.149
that defined the amount of transistors

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:07.666
they can put on a chip.

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:10.671
Now, this dot here is called JET,

00:05:10.671 --> 00:05:12.094
the Joint European Torus.

00:05:12.094 --> 00:05:14.524
It's a big tokamak donut in Europe,

00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:17.594
and this machine in 1997

00:05:17.594 --> 00:05:20.818
produced 16 megawatts of fusion power

00:05:20.818 --> 00:05:22.976
with 17 megawatts of heat.

00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:24.781
Now, you say, that's not much use,

00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:26.492
but it's actually pretty close,

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:27.532
considering we can get

00:05:27.532 --> 00:05:29.839
about 10,000 times more than we started.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:32.452
The second dot here is the NIF.

00:05:32.452 --> 00:05:34.738
It's the National Ignition Facility.

00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:37.264
It's a big laser machine in the U.S.,

00:05:37.264 --> 00:05:38.541
and last month they announced

00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:40.394
with quite a bit of noise

00:05:40.394 --> 00:05:42.552
that they had managed to make more fusion energy

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:44.142
from the fusion

00:05:44.142 --> 00:05:46.998
than the energy that they put in 
the center of the ping pong ball.

00:05:46.998 --> 00:05:48.823
Now, that's not quite good enough,

00:05:48.823 --> 00:05:50.523
because the laser to put that energy in

00:05:50.523 --> 00:05:52.255
was more energy than that,

00:05:52.255 --> 00:05:54.295
but it was pretty good.

00:05:54.295 --> 00:05:56.022
Now this is ITER,

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.080
pronounced in French: EE-tairh.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.211
So this is a big collaboration of different countries

00:06:01.211 --> 00:06:03.066
that are building a huge magnetic donut

00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:05.010
in the south of France,

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.018
and this machine, when it's finished,

00:06:07.018 --> 00:06:09.796
will produce 500 megawatts of fusion power

00:06:09.796 --> 00:06:12.196
with only 50 megawatts to make it.

00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:13.382
So this one is the real one.

00:06:13.382 --> 00:06:14.114
It's going to work.

00:06:14.114 --> 00:06:16.306
That's the kind of machine that makes energy.

00:06:16.306 --> 00:06:18.062
Now if you look at the graph, you will notice

00:06:18.062 --> 00:06:19.567
that those two dots are a little bit

00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:20.609
on the right of the curve.

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:22.545
We kind of have fallen off the progress.

00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:24.534
Actually, the science to make those machines

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:26.070
was really in time

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.906
to produce fusion during that curve.

00:06:28.906 --> 00:06:31.645
However, there has been a bit of politics going on,

00:06:31.645 --> 00:06:33.777
and the will to do it was not there,

00:06:33.777 --> 00:06:35.455
so it drifted to the right.

00:06:35.455 --> 00:06:37.511
ITER, for example, could have been built

00:06:37.511 --> 00:06:39.362
in 2000 or 2005,

00:06:39.362 --> 00:06:41.807
but because it's a big international collaboration,

00:06:41.807 --> 00:06:44.255
the politics got in and it delayed it a bit.

00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:45.879
For example, it took them about three years

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.447
to decide where to put it.

00:06:47.447 --> 00:06:49.983
Now, fusion is often criticized

00:06:49.983 --> 00:06:51.583
for being a little too expensive.

00:06:51.583 --> 00:06:53.124
Yes, it did cost

00:06:53.124 --> 00:06:55.160
a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.353
to make this progress.

00:06:56.353 --> 00:06:57.943
But you have to compare that to the cost

00:06:57.943 --> 00:06:59.183
of making Moore's Law.

00:06:59.183 --> 00:07:01.071
That cost way more than that.

00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:02.589
The result of Moore's Law

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.525
is this cell phone here in my pocket.

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:06.754
This cell phone, and the Internet behind it,

00:07:06.754 --> 00:07:09.434
cost about one trillion dollars,

00:07:09.434 --> 00:07:12.665
just so I can take a selfie

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:15.239
and put it on Facebook.

00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:16.740
Then when my dad sees that,

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.920
he'll be very proud.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.828
We also spend about 650 billion dollars a year

00:07:23.828 --> 00:07:26.130
in subsidies for oil and gas

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.760
and renewable energy.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.934
Now, we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion.

00:07:31.934 --> 00:07:34.582
So me, personally, I don't think it's too expensive.

00:07:34.582 --> 00:07:36.362
I think it's actually been shortchanged,

00:07:36.362 --> 00:07:38.754
considering it can solve all our energy problems

00:07:38.754 --> 00:07:41.428
cleanly for the next couple of billions of years.

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:44.088
Now I can say that, but I'm a little bit biased,

00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:45.976
because I started a fusion company

00:07:45.976 --> 00:07:48.534
and I don't even have a Facebook account.

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:53.917
So when I started this fusion company in 2002,

00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:56.759
I knew I couldn't fight with the big lads.

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:58.336
They had much more resources than me.

00:07:58.336 --> 00:08:00.576
So I decided I would need to find a solution

00:08:00.576 --> 00:08:02.463
that is cheaper and faster.

00:08:02.463 --> 00:08:04.373
Now magnetic and laser fusion

00:08:04.373 --> 00:08:05.804
are pretty good machines.

00:08:05.804 --> 00:08:07.245
They are awesome pieces of technology,

00:08:07.245 --> 00:08:09.119
wonderful machines, and they have shown

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:10.598
that fusion can be done.

00:08:10.598 --> 00:08:12.552
However, as a power plant,

00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:14.423
I don't think they're very good.

00:08:14.423 --> 00:08:16.480
They're way too big, way too complicated,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.618
way too expensive,

00:08:17.618 --> 00:08:19.374
and also, they don't deal very much

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:20.648
with the fusion energy.

00:08:20.648 --> 00:08:22.406
When you make fusion, the energy comes out

00:08:22.406 --> 00:08:25.074
as neutrons, fast neutrons comes out of the plasma.

00:08:25.074 --> 00:08:27.334
Those neutrons hit the wall of the machine.

00:08:27.334 --> 00:08:28.719
It damages it.

00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:30.683
And also, you have to catch
the heat from those neutrons

00:08:30.683 --> 00:08:33.116
and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere,

00:08:33.116 --> 00:08:34.400
and on those machines,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.031
it was all a bit of an afterthought.

00:08:37.031 --> 00:08:40.182
So I decided that surely there
is a better way of doing that.

00:08:40.182 --> 00:08:41.466
So back to the literature,

00:08:41.466 --> 00:08:43.458
and I read about the fusion everywhere.

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:46.180
One way in particular attracted my attention,

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.270
and it's called magnetized target fusion,

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.858
or MTF for short.

00:08:50.858 --> 00:08:53.300
Now, in MTF, what you want to do

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.270
is you take a big vat

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.286
and you fill that with liquid metal,

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:58.806
and you spin the liquid metal

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:00.454
to open a vortex in the center,

00:09:00.454 --> 00:09:01.590
a bit like your sink.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.694
When you pull the plug on a sink, it makes a vortex.

00:09:03.694 --> 00:09:06.090
And then you have some pistons driven by pressure

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.566
that goes on the outside,

00:09:07.566 --> 00:09:09.486
and this compresses the liquid metal

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:11.248
around the plasma, and it compresses it,

00:09:11.248 --> 00:09:12.902
it gets hotter, like a laser,

00:09:12.902 --> 00:09:14.128
and then it makes fusion.

00:09:14.128 --> 00:09:15.048
So it's a bit of a mix

00:09:15.048 --> 00:09:16.703
between a magnetized fusion

00:09:16.703 --> 00:09:18.686
and the laser fusion.

00:09:18.686 --> 00:09:21.459
So those have a couple of very good advantages.

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:23.802
The liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons

00:09:23.802 --> 00:09:25.558
and no neutrons hit the wall,

00:09:25.558 --> 00:09:27.694
and therefore there's no damage to the machine.

00:09:27.694 --> 00:09:29.150
The liquid metal gets hot,

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.150
so you can pump that in a heat exchanger,

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.030
make some steam, spin a turbine.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.209
So that's a very convenient way of doing

00:09:34.209 --> 00:09:35.469
this part of the process.

00:09:35.469 --> 00:09:39.060
And finally, all the energy to make the fusion happen

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.195
comes from steam-powered pistons,

00:09:41.195 --> 00:09:42.851
which is way cheaper than lasers

00:09:42.851 --> 00:09:44.745
or superconducting coils.

00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:46.233
Now, this was all very good

00:09:46.233 --> 00:09:48.737
except for the problem that it didn't quite work.

00:09:48.737 --> 00:09:50.607
(Laughter)

00:09:50.607 --> 00:09:51.903
There's always a catch.

00:09:51.903 --> 00:09:53.417
So when you compress that,

00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:55.341
the plasma cools down

00:09:55.341 --> 00:09:56.969
faster than the compression speed,

00:09:56.969 --> 00:09:58.282
so you're trying to compress it,

00:09:58.282 --> 00:10:00.617
but the plasma cooled down and
cooled down and cooled down

00:10:00.617 --> 00:10:02.558
and then it did absolutely nothing.

00:10:02.558 --> 00:10:04.593
So when I saw that, I said,
well, this is such a shame,

00:10:04.593 --> 00:10:06.343
because it's a very, very good idea.

00:10:06.343 --> 00:10:08.697
So hopefully I can improve on that.

00:10:08.697 --> 00:10:09.792
So I thought about it for a minute,

00:10:09.792 --> 00:10:11.869
and I said, okay, how can we make that work better?

00:10:11.869 --> 00:10:13.727
So then I thought about impact.

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:15.561
What about if we use a big hammer

00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:18.093
and we swing it and we hit the nail like this,

00:10:18.093 --> 00:10:20.067
in the place of putting the hammer on the nail

00:10:20.067 --> 00:10:22.262
and pushing and try to put it in? That won't work.

00:10:22.262 --> 00:10:24.193
So what the idea is

00:10:24.193 --> 00:10:25.937
is to use the idea of an impact.

00:10:25.937 --> 00:10:28.019
So we accelerate the pistons with steam,

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:29.298
that takes a little bit of time,

00:10:29.298 --> 00:10:31.281
but then, bang! you hit the piston,

00:10:31.281 --> 00:10:33.833
and, baff!, all the energy is done instantly,

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.429
down instantly to the liquid,

00:10:35.429 --> 00:10:37.479
and that compresses the plasma much faster.

00:10:37.479 --> 00:10:39.927
So I decided, okay, this is good, let's make that.

00:10:39.927 --> 00:10:43.652
So we built this machine in this garage here.

00:10:43.652 --> 00:10:44.737
We made a small machine

00:10:44.737 --> 00:10:46.709
that we managed to squeeze

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:48.357
a little bit of neutrons out of that,

00:10:48.357 --> 00:10:50.558
and those are my marketing neutrons,

00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:52.001
and with those marketing neutrons,

00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:54.600
then I raised about 50 million dollars,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.490
and I hired 65 people. That's my team here.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.072
And this is what we want to build.

00:10:59.072 --> 00:11:00.586
So it's going to be a big machine,

00:11:00.586 --> 00:11:02.060
about three meters in diameter,

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.862
liquid lead spinning around,

00:11:03.862 --> 00:11:05.454
big vortex in the center,

00:11:05.454 --> 00:11:07.774
put the plasma on the top and on the bottom,

00:11:07.774 --> 00:11:09.200
piston hits on the side,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.710
bang!, it compresses it,

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.994
and it will make some energy,

00:11:11.994 --> 00:11:14.386
and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal,

00:11:14.386 --> 00:11:16.986
going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine,

00:11:16.986 --> 00:11:18.492
and some of the steam will go back

00:11:18.492 --> 00:11:19.490
to fire the piston.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.380
We're going to run that about one time per second,

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.764
and it will produce 100 megawatts of electricity.

00:11:26.764 --> 00:11:28.449
Okay, we also built this injector,

00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:30.736
so this injector makes the plasma to start with.

00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:32.451
It makes the plasma at about

00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:36.426
a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C.

00:11:36.426 --> 00:11:38.633
Unfortunately, it doesn't last quite long enough,

00:11:38.633 --> 00:11:41.768
so we need to extend the life
of the plasma a little bit,

00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:43.400
but last month it got a lot better,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.985
so I think we have the plasma compressing now.

00:11:45.985 --> 00:11:48.541
Then we built a small sphere, about this big,

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.007
14 pistons around it,

00:11:50.007 --> 00:11:52.331
and this will compress the liquid.

00:11:52.331 --> 00:11:54.436
However, plasma is difficult to compress.

00:11:54.436 --> 00:11:55.225
When you compress it,

00:11:55.225 --> 00:11:57.777
it tends to go a little bit crooked like that,

00:11:57.777 --> 00:11:59.385
so you need the timing of the piston

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.481
to be very good,

00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:03.153
and for that we use several control systems,

00:12:03.153 --> 00:12:05.355
which was not possible in 1970,

00:12:05.355 --> 00:12:06.747
but we now can do that

00:12:06.747 --> 00:12:10.039
with nice, new electronics.

00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:12.568
So finally, most people think that fusion

00:12:12.568 --> 00:12:14.720
is in the future and will never happen,

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.814
but as a matter of fact, fusion is getting very close.

00:12:17.814 --> 00:12:18.890
We are almost there.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.527
The big labs have shown that fusion is doable,

00:12:21.527 --> 00:12:23.834
and now there are small companies
that are thinking about that,

00:12:23.834 --> 00:12:26.195
and they say, it's not that it cannot be done,

00:12:26.195 --> 00:12:28.300
but it's how to make it cost-effectively.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.453
General Fusion is one of those small companies,

00:12:30.453 --> 00:12:33.771
and hopefully, very soon, somebody, someone,

00:12:33.771 --> 00:12:35.054
will crack that nut,

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:36.628
and perhaps it will be General Fusion.

00:12:36.628 --> 00:12:38.407
Thank you very much.

00:12:38.407 --> 00:12:42.587
(Applause)
