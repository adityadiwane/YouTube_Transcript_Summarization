00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:16.764
In the next six minutes
that you will listen to me,

00:00:16.788 --> 00:00:19.325
the world will have lost three mothers

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.190
while delivering their babies:

00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:26.297
one, because of a severe complication;

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:28.839
second, because she will be a teenager

00:00:28.863 --> 00:00:32.648
and her body will not
be prepared for birth;

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:38.678
but the third, only because of lack
of access to basic clean tools

00:00:38.702 --> 00:00:40.432
at the time of childbirth.

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:43.779
She will not be alone.

00:00:43.803 --> 00:00:47.478
Over one million mothers and babies
die every single year

00:00:47.502 --> 00:00:49.031
in the developing world,

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:52.799
only because of lack of access
to basic cleanliness

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:55.030
while giving birth to their babies.

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.079
My journey began on a hot summer afternoon

00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:01.271
in India in 2008,

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:04.968
when after a day of meeting women
and listening to their needs,

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:07.919
I landed in a thatched hut with a midwife.

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:13.605
As a mother, I was very curious
on how she delivered babies in her house.

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:16.332
After a deep and engaging
conversation with her

00:01:16.356 --> 00:01:20.702
on how she considered it a profound
calling to do what she was doing,

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:22.766
I asked her a parting question:

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:26.642
Do you have the tools that you need
to deliver the babies?

00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:29.448
I got to see her tool.

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:34.556
"This is what I use to separate
the mother and the baby," she said.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.440
Unsure of how to react, I held this
agricultural tool in my hand in shock.

00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:44.530
I took a picture of this,
hugged her and walked away.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.429
My mind was flooded with reflections
of my own infection

00:01:48.453 --> 00:01:51.485
that I had to struggle with
for a year past childbirth

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.059
despite having access
to the best medical care,

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:57.465
and memories of my conversation
with my father,

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:59.654
who had lost his mom to childbirth,

00:01:59.678 --> 00:02:02.120
on how he thought his life
would be so different

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:04.739
if she would have been
just next to him growing up.

00:02:05.632 --> 00:02:09.389
As a product developer,
I started my process of research.

00:02:09.413 --> 00:02:12.588
I was very excited to find
that there was a product out there

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:14.013
called the Clean Birth Kit.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.104
But I just couldn't buy one for months.

00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:21.357
They were only assembled
based on availability of funding.

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:26.236
Finally, when I got my hands on one,
I was in shock again.

00:02:26.783 --> 00:02:30.449
I would never use these tools
to deliver my baby, I thought.

00:02:30.473 --> 00:02:33.384
But to confirm my instincts,
I went back to the women,

00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:36.546
some of whom had the experience
of using this product.

00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:40.314
Lo and behold, they had
the same reaction and more.

00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:43.352
The women said they would rather
deliver on a floor

00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:45.974
than on a plastic sheet
that smeared blood all over.

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:49.413
They were absolutely right --
it would cause more infection.

00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:52.446
The thread provided was a highway
to bacterial infection

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.169
through the baby's umbilical cord,

00:02:54.193 --> 00:02:57.037
and the blade used was the kind
that men used for shaving,

00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:59.618
and they did not want it
anywhere close to them.

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.403
There was no incentive for anybody
to redesign this product,

00:03:03.427 --> 00:03:05.338
because it was based on charity.

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:08.102
The women were never
consulted in this process.

00:03:08.704 --> 00:03:11.203
And to my surprise, the need
was not only in homes

00:03:11.227 --> 00:03:14.556
but also in institutional settings
with high-volume births.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.790
Situations in remote areas
were even more daunting.

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.025
This had to change.

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.311
I made this my area of focus.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:25.466
I started the design process
by collecting feedback,

00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:27.826
developing prototypes

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.658
and engaging with various stakeholders
researching global protocols.

00:03:32.126 --> 00:03:34.768
With every single prototype,
we went back to the women

00:03:34.792 --> 00:03:37.258
to ensure that we had a product for them.

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.595
What I learned through this process
was that these women,

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.058
despite their extreme poverty,

00:03:42.082 --> 00:03:44.459
placed great value
on their health and well-being.

00:03:44.483 --> 00:03:46.933
They were absolutely not poor in mind.

00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:49.958
As with all of us, they would appreciate
a well-designed product

00:03:49.982 --> 00:03:51.414
developed for their needs.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.567
After many iterations
working with experts,

00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:56.072
medical health professionals

00:03:56.096 --> 00:03:57.931
and the women themselves,

00:03:57.955 --> 00:04:01.323
I should say it was not
an easy process at all,

00:04:01.347 --> 00:04:04.253
but we had a simple and beautiful design.

00:04:05.507 --> 00:04:10.277
For a dollar more than what
the existing product was offered for,

00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:13.052
at three dollars, we were able
to deliver "janma,"

00:04:13.076 --> 00:04:14.953
a clean birth kit in a purse.

00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:18.698
Janma, meaning "birth," contained
a blood-absorbing sheet

00:04:18.722 --> 00:04:20.449
for the woman to give birth on,

00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:24.478
a surgical scalpel, a cord clamp,
a bar of soap, a pair of gloves

00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:27.165
and the first cloth
to wipe the baby clean.

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:29.377
All this came packaged
in a beautiful purse

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:32.616
that was given to the mother
as a gift after all her hard work,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.923
that she carried home with pride
as a symbol of prosperity.

00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:40.143
One woman reacted to this gift.

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:42.987
She said, "Is this really mine?
Can I keep it?"

00:04:43.915 --> 00:04:46.524
The other one said,
"Will you give me a different color

00:04:46.548 --> 00:04:48.027
when I have my next baby?"

00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:49.805
(Laughter)

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:52.746
Better yet, a woman expressed
that this was the first purse

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.847
that she had ever owned in her life.

00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:57.655
The kit, aside from its symbolism
and its simplicity,

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:00.991
is designed to follow
globally recommended medical protocol

00:05:01.015 --> 00:05:05.894
and serves as a behavior-change tool
to follow steps one after the other.

00:05:05.918 --> 00:05:09.561
It can not only be used in homes,
but also in institutional settings.

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:14.425
To date, our kit has impacted
over 600,000 mothers and babies

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:15.657
around the world.

00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:19.464
It's a humbling experience
to watch these numbers grow,

00:05:19.488 --> 00:05:23.159
and I cannot wait until
we reach a hundred million.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.573
But women's health issues do not end here.

00:05:27.597 --> 00:05:31.607
There are thousands of simple issues
that require low-cost interventions.

00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.547
We have facts to prove
that if we invest in women and girls

00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:36.980
and provide them with better
health and well-being,

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:42.015
they will deliver healthier and wealthier
and prosperous communities.

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.023
We have to start by bringing simplicity
and dignity to women's health issues:

00:05:46.047 --> 00:05:49.119
from reducing maternal mortality,
to breaking taboos,

00:05:49.143 --> 00:05:52.653
to empowering women
to take control of their own lives.

00:05:52.677 --> 00:05:54.431
This is my dream.

00:05:55.137 --> 00:05:59.593
But it is not possible to achieve it
without engaging men and women alike

00:05:59.617 --> 00:06:01.058
from around the world --

00:06:01.082 --> 00:06:02.808
yes, all of you.

00:06:04.593 --> 00:06:07.655
I recently heard this lyric
by Leonard Cohen:

00:06:08.782 --> 00:06:12.005
"Ring the bells that still can ring.

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:15.169
Forget your perfect offering.

00:06:15.193 --> 00:06:18.094
There is a crack in everything.

00:06:18.118 --> 00:06:20.866
That's how the light gets in."

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.337
This is my bit of light.

00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:25.005
But we need more light.

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:28.473
In fact, we need huge spotlights
placed in the world of women's health

00:06:28.497 --> 00:06:30.795
if we need a better tomorrow.

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.312
We should never forget that women
are at the center of a sustainable world,

00:06:35.336 --> 00:06:37.863
and we do not exist without them.

00:06:37.887 --> 00:06:39.046
Thank you.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.145
(Applause)
