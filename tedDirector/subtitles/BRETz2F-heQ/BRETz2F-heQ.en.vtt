00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Hello. I would like to start my talk

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
with actually two questions, and the first one is:

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
How many people here actually eat pig meat?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Please raise your hand --

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
oh, that's a lot.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And how many people have actually seen

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
a live pig producing this meat?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
In the last year?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
In the Netherlands -- where I come from --

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
you actually never see a pig, which is really strange,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
because, on a population of 16 million people,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
we have 12 million pigs.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
They eat about one-third, and the rest is exported

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
to all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
A lot goes to the U.K., Germany.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
And what I was curious about --

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
because historically, the whole pig would be used up until the last bit

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
so nothing would be wasted --

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and I was curious to find out

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
if this was actually still the case.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
And I spent about three years researching.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And I followed this one pig

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
with number "05049,"

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
all the way up until the end

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and to what products it's made of.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And in these years, I met all kinds people

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
like, for instance, farmers and butchers, which seems logical.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
But I also met aluminum mold makers,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
ammunition producers

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and all kinds of people.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
And what was striking to me

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
is that the farmers actually had no clue

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
what was made of their pigs,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
but the consumers -- as in us --

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
had also no idea

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
of the pigs being in all these products.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
So what I did is,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I took all this research

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and I made it into a -- well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
on the back.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And it consists of seven chapters --

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
the chapters are skin, bones, meat, internal organs,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
blood, fat and miscellaneous.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
(Laughter)

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
In total,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
they weigh 103.7 kilograms.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And to show you how often you actually

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
meet part of this pig in a regular day,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
I want to show you some images of the book.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
You probably start the day with a shower.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
So, in soap, fatty acids

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
made from boiling pork bone fat

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
are used as a hardening agent,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
but also for giving it a pearl-like effect.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Then if you look around you in the bathroom,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
you see lots more products

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
like shampoo, conditioner,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
anti-wrinkle cream, body lotion,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
but also toothpaste.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Then, so, before breakfast,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
you've already met the pig so many times.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Then, at breakfast, the pig that I followed,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
were used as an improver of dough.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
(Laughter)

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Well, that's what the producer says: it's "improving the dough,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
of course."

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
In low-fat butter, or actually in many low-fat products,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
when you take the fat out, you actually take the taste and the texture out.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
So what they do is they put gelatin back in,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
in order to retain the texture.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Well, when you're off to work, under the road or under the buildings that you see,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
there might very well be cellular concrete,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
which is a very light kind of concrete

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
that's actually got proteins from bones inside

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
and it's also fully reusable.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
In the train brakes -- at least in the German train brakes --

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
there's this part of the brake

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
that's made of bone ash.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
like chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
everything that's cooled in the supermarket,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
there's gelatin to make it look good.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Of course, the bone in fine-bone china

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
gives it its translucency

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
and also its strength,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
in order to make these really fine shapes,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
like this deer.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
In interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
It's used in paint for the texture,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
but also for the glossiness.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
In sandpaper, bone glue

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
is actually the glue between the sand and the paper.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And then in paintbrushes,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
hairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
because of their hard-wearing nature.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
I was not planning on showing you any meat

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
because, of course, half the book's meat

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and you probably all know what meats they are.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
But I didn't want you to miss out on this one,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
because this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts."

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
And this is actually sold

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
in the frozen area of the supermarket.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And what it is -- it's actually steak.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
So, this is sold as cow,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
but what happens when you slaughter a cow --

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
at least in industrial factory farming --

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
they have all these little bits of steak left

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
that they can't actually sell as steak,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
so what they do is they glue them all together

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
with fibrin from pig blood

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
into this really large sausage,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
then freeze the sausage, cut it in little slices

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and sell those as steak again.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
So, with the steak, you might drink a beer.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
In the brewing process, there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
so to get rid of these cloudy elements,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
what some companies do

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
in order to get rid of that cloudiness.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
There's actually a company in Greece

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
that produces these cigarettes

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And according to them,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
this creates an artificial lung in the filter.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
(Laughter)

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
So, this is actually a healthier cigarette.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
(Laughter)

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Injectable collagen -- or, since the '70s, collagen from pigs --

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
has been used for injecting into wrinkles.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
so the collagen is as well.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Well, this must be the strangest thing I found.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
This is a bullet coming from

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
a very large ammunition company in the United States.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And while I was making the book,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
I contacted all the producers of products

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
because I wanted them to send me the real samples

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and the real specimens.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
So I sent this company an email

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
saying, "Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
And can you send me a bullet?"

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
(Laughter)

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
And well, I didn't expect them to even answer my email.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
But they answered

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and they said, "Why, thank you for your email. What an interesting story.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government?"

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
I thought that was really weird,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.260
(Laughter)

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
So, the most beautiful thing I found --

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
at least what I think is the most beautiful -- in the book, is this heart valve.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
It's actually a very low-tech

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
and very high-tech product at the same time.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
The low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
mounted in the high-tech bit,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
which is a memory metal casing.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
without open heart surgery.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
And once it's in the right spot,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
they remove the outer shell,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
and the heart valve, well, it gets this shape

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and at that moment it starts beating, instantly.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
It's really a sort of magical moment.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
So this is actually a Dutch company,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
so I called them up, and I asked,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
"Can I borrow a heart valve from you?"

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
So they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
and you can borrow it."

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
Great -- and then I didn't hear from them for weeks,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
so I called,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and I asked, "What's going on with the heart valve?"

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And they said, "Well the director of the company

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
decided not to let you borrow this heart valve,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
because want his product

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
to be associated with pigs."

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
(Laughter)

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
Well, the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy --

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
actually, to show that my first question,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
if pigs are still used up until the last bit, was still true.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
is made into a fuel

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
that can be used as renewable energy source.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
In total, I found 185 products.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And what they showed me

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
is that, well, firstly,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
it's at least to say odd

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
that we don't treat these pigs

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
as absolute kings and queens.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
And the second, is that we actually don't have a clue

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
of what all these products that surround us are made of.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
And you might think I'm very fond of pigs,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
but actually -- well, I am a little bit --

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
but I'm more fond

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
of raw materials in general.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
And I think that, in order to take better care

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
of what's behind our products --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
so, the livestock, the crops, the plants,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
the non-renewable materials,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
but also the people that produce these products --

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
the first step would actually be to know that they are there.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Thank you very much.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
