00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:17.780
Do you ever think about how important
the oceans are in our daily lives?

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.396
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.411
They provide half the oxygen we breathe.

00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:27.510
They moderate our climate.

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:31.652
And they provide jobs
and medicine and food

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.945
including 20 percent of protein
to feed the entire world population.

00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:40.667
People used to think
that the oceans were so vast

00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:43.152
that they wouldn't be affected
by human activities.

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:47.311
Well today I'm going to tell you
about a serious reality

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:51.968
that is changing our oceans
called ocean acidification,

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:54.548
or the evil twin of climate change.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.142
Did you know that the oceans have absorbed
25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:03.410
that we have emitted to the atmosphere?

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.428
Now this is just another great service
provided by the oceans

00:01:07.453 --> 00:01:10.322
since carbon dioxide
is one of the greenhouse gases

00:01:10.347 --> 00:01:12.103
that's causing climate change.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.166
But as we keep pumping
more and more and more

00:01:17.192 --> 00:01:19.684
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.303
more is dissolving into the oceans.

00:01:22.623 --> 00:01:25.543
And this is what's changing
our ocean chemistry.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.558
When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater,

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:31.821
it undergoes a number
of chemical reactions.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.405
Now lucky for you,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.715
I don't have time to get into
the details of the chemistry for today.

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:40.532
But I'll tell you as more
carbon dioxide enters the ocean,

00:01:40.557 --> 00:01:42.914
the seawater pH goes down.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.517
And this basically means that there
is an increase in ocean acidity.

00:01:48.168 --> 00:01:52.290
And this whole process
is called ocean acidification.

00:01:52.724 --> 00:01:55.450
And it's happening
alongside climate change.

00:01:56.176 --> 00:02:00.279
Scientists have been monitoring
ocean acidification for over two decades.

00:02:00.818 --> 00:02:03.491
This figure is an important
time series in Hawaii,

00:02:03.516 --> 00:02:08.411
and the top line shows steadily increasing
concentrations of carbon dioxide,

00:02:08.436 --> 00:02:10.951
or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere.

00:02:11.062 --> 00:02:14.308
And this is directly as a result
of human activities.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.191
The line underneath shows the increasing
concentrations of carbon dioxide

00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:22.152
that is dissolved
in the surface of the ocean

00:02:22.398 --> 00:02:25.357
which you can see is increasing
at the same rate

00:02:25.382 --> 00:02:28.556
as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
since measurements began.

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:31.754
The line on the bottom shows
then shows the change in chemistry.

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.605
As more carbon dioxide
has entered the ocean,

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.876
the seawater pH has gone down,

00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:41.418
which basically means there has been
an increase in ocean acidity.

00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:47.075
Now in Ireland, scientists are also
monitoring ocean acidification --

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.893
scientists at the Marine
Institute and NUI Galway.

00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:54.193
And we, too, are seeing
acidification at the same rate

00:02:54.218 --> 00:02:57.225
as these main ocean time-series
sites around the world.

00:02:57.686 --> 00:03:00.559
So it's happening right at our doorstep.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.548
Now I'd like to give you an example
of just how we collect our data

00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:06.826
to monitor a changing ocean.

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.064
Firstly we collect a lot of our samples
in the middle of winter.

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.228
So as you can imagine,
in the North Atlantic

00:03:12.253 --> 00:03:14.858
we get hit with some seriously
stormy conditions --

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.602
so not for any of you
who get a little motion sickness,

00:03:17.627 --> 00:03:20.055
but we are collecting
some very valuable data.

00:03:20.412 --> 00:03:23.291
So we lower this instrument
over the side of the ship,

00:03:23.316 --> 00:03:25.752
and there are sensors
that are mounted on the bottom

00:03:25.777 --> 00:03:28.450
that can tell us information about
the surrounding water,

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:30.895
such as temperature
or dissolved oxygen.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.085
And then we can collect our seawater
samples in these large bottles.

00:03:35.252 --> 00:03:38.504
So we start at the bottom,
which can be over four kilometers deep

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:40.386
just off our continental shelf,

00:03:40.632 --> 00:03:44.298
and we take samples at regular intervals
right up to the surface.

00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:46.956
We take the seawater back on the deck,

00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:49.470
and then we can either
analyze them on the ship

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:52.630
or back in the laboratory
for the different chemicals parameters.

00:03:52.987 --> 00:03:54.273
But why should we care?

00:03:54.471 --> 00:03:58.915
How is ocean acidification
going to affect all of us?

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:03.486
Well, here are the worrying facts.

00:04:04.597 --> 00:04:10.399
There has already been an increase
in ocean acidity of 26 percent

00:04:10.424 --> 00:04:14.431
since pre-industrial times,
which is directly due to human activities.

00:04:15.471 --> 00:04:19.558
Unless we can start slowing down
our carbon dioxide emissions,

00:04:19.851 --> 00:04:25.788
we're expecting an increase
in ocean acidity of 170 percent

00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:28.557
by the end of this century.

00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:31.866
I mean this is within
our children's lifetime.

00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:38.943
This rate of acidification
is 10 times faster

00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:45.389
than any acidification in our oceans
for over 55 million years.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.251
So our marine life have never,
ever experienced

00:04:50.276 --> 00:04:53.045
such a fast rate of change before.

00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:57.270
So we literally could not know
how they're going to cope.

00:04:58.855 --> 00:05:03.441
Now there was a natural acidification
event millions of years ago,

00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:06.339
which was much slower
than what we're seeing today.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.441
And this coincided with a mass extinction
of many marine species.

00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:14.298
So is that what we're headed for?

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.240
Well, maybe.

00:05:16.851 --> 00:05:20.343
Studies are showing
some species are actually doing quite well

00:05:20.368 --> 00:05:23.358
but many are showing a negative response.

00:05:24.906 --> 00:05:28.953
One of the big concerns is
as ocean acidity increases,

00:05:29.247 --> 00:05:33.501
the concentration of carbonate
ions in seawater decrease.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.221
Now these ions are basically
the building blocks

00:05:37.246 --> 00:05:40.047
for many marine species
to make their shells,

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:45.134
for example crabs or mussels, oysters.

00:05:45.594 --> 00:05:47.554
Another example are corals.

00:05:47.752 --> 00:05:50.933
They also need these carbonate
ions in seawater

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.863
to make their coral structure
in order to build coral reefs.

00:05:56.187 --> 00:05:58.377
As ocean acidity increases

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.829
and the concentration
of carbonate ions decrease,

00:06:02.282 --> 00:06:06.742
these species first find it more difficult
to make their shells.

00:06:07.051 --> 00:06:10.860
And at even even lower levels,
they can actually begin to dissolve.

00:06:12.035 --> 00:06:15.098
This here is a pteropod,
it's called a sea butterfly.

00:06:15.336 --> 00:06:18.510
And it's an important food source
in the ocean for many species,

00:06:18.772 --> 00:06:22.295
from krill to salmon right up to whales.

00:06:23.208 --> 00:06:26.722
The shell of the pteropod
was placed into seawater

00:06:26.747 --> 00:06:30.167
at a pH that we're expecting
by the end of this century.

00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:36.516
After only 45 days
at this very realistic pH,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.002
you can see the shell
has almost completely dissolved.

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:45.509
So ocean acidification could affect
right up through the food chain --

00:06:45.644 --> 00:06:47.755
and right onto our dinner plates.

00:06:48.294 --> 00:06:51.936
I mean who here
likes shellfish? Or salmon?

00:06:52.502 --> 00:06:54.130
Or many other fish species

00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:56.998
whose food source
in the ocean could be affected?

00:06:57.946 --> 00:06:59.793
These are cold-water corals.

00:06:59.932 --> 00:07:03.465
And did you know we actually have
cold-water corals in Irish waters,

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.337
just off our continental shelf?

00:07:05.843 --> 00:07:09.962
And they support rich biodiversity,
including some very important fisheries.

00:07:10.676 --> 00:07:13.763
It's projected that
by the end of this century,

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:20.010
70 percent of all known cold-water corals
in the entire ocean

00:07:20.397 --> 00:07:25.091
will be surrounded by seawater
that is dissolving their coral structure.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.328
The last example I have
are these healthy tropical corals.

00:07:32.892 --> 00:07:37.640
They were placed in seawater at a pH
we're expecting by the year 2100.

00:07:39.304 --> 00:07:44.818
After six months, the coral
has almost completely dissolved.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.355
Now coral reefs support

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:54.953
25 percent of all marine life
in the entire ocean.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:56.840
All marine life.

00:07:57.888 --> 00:08:02.213
So you can see: ocean
acidification is a global threat.

00:08:02.858 --> 00:08:04.980
I have an eight-month-old baby boy.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.657
Unless we start now to slow this down,

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:14.188
I dread to think what our oceans
will look like when he's a grown man.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.488
We will see acidification.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.890
We have already put too much
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.532
But we can slow this down.

00:08:25.916 --> 00:08:30.292
We can prevent the worst-case scenario.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.754
The only way of doing that

00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:36.137
is by reducing our
carbon dioxide emissions.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.236
This is important for both you and I,
for industry, for governments.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.191
We need to work together,
slow down global warming

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.701
slow down ocean acidification

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.633
and help to maintain a healthy ocean
and a healthy planet

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:55.950
for our generation
and for generations to come.

00:08:57.144 --> 00:09:01.647
