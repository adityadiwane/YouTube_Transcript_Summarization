00:00:14.963 --> 00:00:17.988
It's said that to be a poet

00:00:18.948 --> 00:00:22.553
you have to go to hell and back.

00:00:24.173 --> 00:00:27.349
The first time I visited the prison,

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.025
I was not surprised by the noise
of the padlocks,

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:36.243
or the closing doors,
or the cell bars,

00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:40.246
or by any of the things
I had imagined.

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:45.559
Maybe because the prison
is in a quite open space.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.689
You can see the sky.

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:51.332
Seagulls fly overhead,
and you feel like you're next to the sea,

00:00:51.332 --> 00:00:54.375
that you're really close to the beach.

00:00:54.375 --> 00:01:00.305
But in fact, the gulls are looking
for food in the dump near the prison.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.221
I went farther inside and I suddenly saw
inmates moving across the corridors.

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:11.966
Then it was as if I stepped back
and thought

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.775
that I could have very well been
one of them.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:21.522
If I had another story,
another context, different luck.

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:27.959
Because nobody - nobody -
can choose where they're born.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.453
In 2009, I was invited to join a project

00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:39.860
that San Martín National University
conducted at the Unit 48 penitentiary,

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:43.080
to coordinate a writing workshop.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.525
The prison service ceded some land
at the end of the prison,

00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:55.157
which is where they constructed
the University Center building.

00:01:56.152 --> 00:01:58.570
The first time I met with the prisoners,

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.245
I asked them why they were asking
for a writing workshop

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:05.896
and they told me they wanted 
to put on paper

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:09.827
all that they couldn't say and do.

00:02:11.062 --> 00:02:15.929
Right then I decided that I wanted poetry
to enter the prison.

00:02:17.434 --> 00:02:21.038
So I said to them
why don't we work with poetry,

00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:22.780
if they knew what poetry was.

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:28.267
But nobody had a clue
what poetry really was.

00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:32.256
They also suggested to me

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:34.775
that the workshop should be
not just for the inmates

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:40.031
taking university classes, 
but for all the inmates.

00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:43.808
And so I said
that to start this workshop,

00:02:43.808 --> 00:02:47.650
I needed to find a tool
that we all had in common.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.756
That tool was language.

00:02:50.756 --> 00:02:56.948
We had language, we had the workshop.
We could have poetry.

00:02:56.948 --> 00:03:02.774
But what I hadn't considered
was that inequality exists in prison, too.

00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:07.895
Many of the prisoners hadn't even
completed grammar school.

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:13.275
Many couldn't use cursive,
could barely print.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.082
They didn't write fluently, either.

00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:23.693
So we started looking for short poems.

00:03:23.693 --> 00:03:26.759
Very short, but very powerful.

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.507
And we started to read, and we'd read
one author, then another author,

00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:35.982
and by reading such short poems,
they all began to realize

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:40.639
that what the poetic language did
was to break a certain logic,

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.394
and create another system.

00:03:42.394 --> 00:03:45.988
Breaking the logic of language
also breaks the logic of the system

00:03:45.988 --> 00:03:49.755
under which they've learned to respond.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.043
So a new system appeared,

00:03:54.043 --> 00:03:59.202
new rules that made them
understand very quickly,

00:03:59.202 --> 00:04:01.081
- very quickly -

00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:03.230
that with poetic language

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.739
they would be able to say
absolutely whatever they wanted.

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:16.570
It's said that to be a poet
you have to go to hell and back.

00:04:17.475 --> 00:04:21.974
And they have plenty of hell.
Plenty of hell.

00:04:21.974 --> 00:04:26.589
One of them once said:
"In prison you never sleep.

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:31.454
You can never sleep in jail.
You can never close your eyelids."

00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:38.707
And so, like I’m doing now,
I gave them a moment of silence,

00:04:38.707 --> 00:04:43.429
then said,
“That's what poetry is, you guys.

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:49.494
It's in this prison universe
that you have all around you.

00:04:49.494 --> 00:04:51.774
Everything you say
about how you never sleep,

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:53.464
it exudes fear.

00:04:53.464 --> 00:04:58.229
All the things that go unwritten --
all of that is poetry."

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:03.676
So we started appropriating that hell;

00:05:03.676 --> 00:05:07.184
we plunged ourselves, headfirst,
into the seventh circle.

00:05:07.184 --> 00:05:11.222
And in that seventh circle of hell,
our very own, beloved circle,

00:05:11.222 --> 00:05:15.434
they learned that they could
make the walls invisible,

00:05:15.434 --> 00:05:17.604
that they could make the windows yell,

00:05:17.604 --> 00:05:20.544
and that we could hide inside the shadows.

00:05:23.504 --> 00:05:27.464
When the first year
of the workshop had ended,

00:05:27.464 --> 00:05:29.872
we organized a little closing party,

00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:33.562
like you do when a job is done
with so much love,

00:05:33.562 --> 00:05:36.512
and you want to celebrate with a party.

00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:40.979
We called family, friends, 
the university authorities.

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.321
The only thing the inmates
had to do was read a poem,

00:05:45.321 --> 00:05:47.558
and receive their diplomas and applause.

00:05:47.558 --> 00:05:50.085
That was our simple party.

00:05:52.105 --> 00:05:57.004
The only thing I want to leave you with

00:05:58.694 --> 00:06:03.019
is the moment in which those men,

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:05.514
some of them just huge
when standing next to me,

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:11.230
or the young boys - so young,
but with an enormous pride,

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.073
held their papers and trembled
like little kids and sweated,

00:06:17.078 --> 00:06:22.287
and read their poems with their
voices completely broken.

00:06:24.042 --> 00:06:28.009
That moment made me think a lot

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:33.066
that for most of them,
it was surely the very first time

00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:37.564
that someone applauded them
for something they had done.

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:44.262
In prison there are things
that can't be done.

00:06:44.262 --> 00:06:49.118
In prison, you can't dream.
In prison, you can't cry.

00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:54.147
There are words that are virtually
forbidden, like the word "time,"

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:59.016
the word "future," the word "wish".

00:06:59.016 --> 00:07:04.322
But we dared to dream, and to dream a lot.

00:07:04.322 --> 00:07:09.126
We decided
that they were going to write a book.

00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:13.546
Not only did they write a book,
but they also bound it themselves.

00:07:13.546 --> 00:07:16.642
That was at the end of 2010.

00:07:16.642 --> 00:07:21.051
Then, we doubled the bet
and wrote another book.

00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:22.685
And we bound that one, too.

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:26.109
That was a short time ago,
at the end of last year.

00:07:28.474 --> 00:07:32.000
What I see week after week,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.357
is how they're turning
into different people;

00:07:36.357 --> 00:07:38.904
how they're being transformed.

00:07:38.904 --> 00:07:43.251
How words are empowering them
with a dignity they had never known,

00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:45.334
that they couldn't even imagine.

00:07:45.334 --> 00:07:50.125
They had no idea such dignity
could come from them.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:58.397
At the workshop, in that beloved hell
we share, we all give something.

00:07:58.397 --> 00:08:02.997
We open our hands and hearts and give
what we have, what we can.

00:08:02.997 --> 00:08:05.151
All of us;
all of us equally.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:09.766
And so you feel that at least
in a small way

00:08:09.766 --> 00:08:13.416
you're repairing
that huge social fracture

00:08:13.416 --> 00:08:18.634
which makes it so that for many of them,

00:08:18.634 --> 00:08:21.812
prison is their only destination.

00:08:24.172 --> 00:08:29.551
I remember a verse
by a tremendous poet, a great poet,

00:08:30.586 --> 00:08:36.430
from our Unit 48 workshop,
Nicolás Dorado:

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:46.789
"I will need an infinite thread
to sew up this huge wound."

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:52.679
Poetry does that; it sews up
the wounds of exclusion.

00:08:53.004 --> 00:08:58.242
It opens doors. 
Poetry works as a mirror.

00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:01.762
It creates a mirror, which is the poem.

00:09:01.762 --> 00:09:05.745
They recognize themselves,
they look at themselves in the poem

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:10.808
and write from who they are,
and are from what they write.

00:09:10.808 --> 00:09:13.513
In order to write,

00:09:13.513 --> 00:09:17.704
they need to appropriate
the moment of writing

00:09:17.704 --> 00:09:21.155
which is a moment
of extraordinary freedom.

00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:24.098
They have to get into their heads,
search for that bit of freedom

00:09:24.098 --> 00:09:29.124
that can never be taken away
when they write

00:09:29.124 --> 00:09:32.635
and that is also useful
to realize that freedom is possible

00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:34.973
even inside a prison,

00:09:34.973 --> 00:09:40.235
and that the only bars we have
in our wonderful space

00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:42.097
is the word "bars,"

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:45.959
and that all of us in our hell
burn with happiness

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:49.669
when we light the wick of the word.

00:09:49.669 --> 00:09:52.669
(Applause)

00:10:17.143 --> 00:10:23.597
I told you a lot about the prison,
a lot about what I experience

00:10:23.597 --> 00:10:28.178
every week, and how I enjoy it
and transform myself with the inmates.

00:10:28.178 --> 00:10:31.593
But you don't know how much I'd like it

00:10:31.593 --> 00:10:37.159
if you could feel, live, experience,
even for a few seconds,

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:41.494
what I enjoy every week
and what makes me who I am.

00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:47.151
(Applause)

00:10:53.228 --> 00:10:57.459
Martín Bustamante: 
The heart chews tears of time;

00:10:57.464 --> 00:11:00.346
blinded by that light,

00:11:00.346 --> 00:11:03.721
it hides the speed of existence

00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:05.874
where the images go rowing by.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:08.847
It fights; it hangs on.

00:11:08.847 --> 00:11:12.549
The heart cracks under sad gazes,

00:11:12.554 --> 00:11:16.327
rides on storms that spread fire,

00:11:16.327 --> 00:11:19.451
lifts chests lowered by shame,

00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:22.627
knows that it's not just reading
and going on,

00:11:22.627 --> 00:11:26.452
it also wishes to see the infinite blue.

00:11:26.457 --> 00:11:30.185
The heart sits down to think about things,

00:11:30.185 --> 00:11:32.897
fights to avoid being ordinary,

00:11:32.897 --> 00:11:36.320
tries to love without hurting,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.023
breathes the sun,
giving courage to itself,

00:11:40.023 --> 00:11:44.391
surrenders, travels toward reason.

00:11:44.391 --> 00:11:47.294
The heart fights among the swamps,

00:11:47.294 --> 00:11:50.819
skirts the edge of the underworld,

00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:55.101
falls exhausted, but won't give in
to what's easy,

00:11:55.101 --> 00:11:57.590
while irregular steps of intoxication

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.167
wake up,

00:11:59.167 --> 00:12:01.057
wake the stillness.

00:12:01.057 --> 00:12:03.029
I'm Martín Bustamante,

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:07.254
I'm a prisoner in Unit 48 of San Martín,

00:12:07.254 --> 00:12:10.112
today is my day of temporary release.

00:12:10.112 --> 00:12:13.784
And for me, poetry and literature
have changed my life.

00:12:13.784 --> 00:12:14.905
Thank you very much!

00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:16.325
Cristina Domenech: Thank you!

00:12:16.325 --> 00:12:18.645
(Applause)
