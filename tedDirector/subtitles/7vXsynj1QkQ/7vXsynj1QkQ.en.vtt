00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Good morning.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.160
Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
We're all familiar with his fantastic work --

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
But we do not know his face.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
Thousands of books have been written about him,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.160
but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.160
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
So, what do you think?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
Let's find out.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.160
He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
But no faces?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
I find that hard to believe.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here --

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
en face or three-quarters.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
So, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
must have made self-portraits from time to time.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
So let's try to find them.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
I think that if we were to scan all of his work

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
and looked for male portraits.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
There are about 120, you see them here.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
Which ones of these could be self-portraits?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.160
Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
So we can eliminate all the profiles.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
It also has to be sufficiently detailed.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.160
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
And we know from his contemporaries

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.160
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160
(Laughter)

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.160
And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
And here they are.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
Yes, indeed, the old man is there,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.160
And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, "The Musician."

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
Before we go into these faces,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.160
I've made more than 1,100 portraits myself

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.160
for newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.160
(Laughter)

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.160
But there are 1,100, and very few artists have drawn so many faces.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
OK, now let's look at these three portraits.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.160
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
and look, they are very similar.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
Now, are they made in the right order?

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
The young man should be made first.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
And as you see here from the years that they were created,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
it is indeed the case.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
They are made in the right order.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
What was the age of Leonardo at the time? Does that fit?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
Yes, it does. He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
of the same age as Leonardo at the time.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
But how do we know it's him, and not someone else?

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
Well, we need a reference.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.160
And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
It's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
And if we now compare the face of the statue,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
to those three faces.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.160
Ladies and gentlemen, this story has not yet been published.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
The icon of icons finally has a face.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Here he is: Leonardo da Vinci.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.160
(Applause)
