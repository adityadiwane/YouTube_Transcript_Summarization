00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:14.611
So yesterday, I was out in the street

00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.287
in front of this building,

00:00:17.287 --> 00:00:20.323
and I was walking down the sidewalk,

00:00:20.323 --> 00:00:22.183
and I had company, several of us,

00:00:22.183 --> 00:00:23.681
and we were all abiding by the rules

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:26.068
of walking down sidewalks.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:28.510
We're not talking each other. We're facing forward.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.933
We're moving.

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:33.196
When the person in front of me slows down.

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:35.186
And so I'm watching him, and he slows down,

00:00:35.186 --> 00:00:36.783
and finally he stops.

00:00:36.783 --> 00:00:38.868
Well, that wasn't fast enough for me,

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:42.547
so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him,

00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:45.280
and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.843
and he was doing this.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.792
He was texting,

00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:51.814
and he couldn't text and walk at the same time.

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:53.623
Now we could approach this

00:00:53.623 --> 00:00:55.515
from a working memory perspective

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:57.500
or from a multitasking perspective.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.029
We're going to do working memory today.

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:02.169
Now, working memory

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:05.317
is that part of our consciousness that we are

00:01:05.317 --> 00:01:07.771
aware of at any given time of day.

00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:09.413
You're going it right now.

00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:11.067
It's not something we can turn off.

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:14.518
If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay?

00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:17.621
So right now, you're doing just fine.

00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:19.977
Now working memory has four basic components.

00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:22.574
It allows us to store some immediate experiences

00:01:22.574 --> 00:01:24.190
and a little bit of knowledge.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.559
It allows us to reach back
into our long-term memory

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:29.409
and pull some of that in as we need it,

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.609
mixes it, processes it

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.903
in light of whatever our current goal is.

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:35.417
Now the current goal isn't something like,

00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:37.699
I want to be president or the best surfer in the world.

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:40.502
It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie,

00:01:40.502 --> 00:01:43.104
or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room.

00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:45.284
Now working memory capacity

00:01:45.284 --> 00:01:47.890
is our ability to leverage that,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.685
our ability to take what we know

00:01:50.685 --> 00:01:51.961
and what we can hang onto

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:55.560
and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.310
our current goal.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.094
Now working memory capacity

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:01.147
has a fairly long history,

00:02:01.147 --> 00:02:03.346
and it's associated with a lot of positive effects.

00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:05.734
People with high working memory capacity

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:07.978
tend to be good storytellers.

00:02:07.978 --> 00:02:11.955
They tend to solve and do well
on standardized tests,

00:02:11.955 --> 00:02:14.300
however important that is.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.083
They're able to have high levels of writing ability.

00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:20.957
They're also able to reason at high levels.

00:02:20.957 --> 00:02:23.875
So what we're going to do here
is play a little bit with some of that.

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:26.425
So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks,

00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:29.504
and we're going to take your 
working memory out for a ride.

00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:32.101
You up for that? Okay.

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:34.299
I'm going to give you five words,

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.092
and I just want you to hang on to them.

00:02:36.092 --> 00:02:37.960
Don't write them down. Just hang on to them.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.372
Five words.

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:42.575
While you're hanging on to them,
I'm going to ask you to answer three questions.

00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:44.480
I want to see what happens with those words.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.327
So here's the words:

00:02:46.327 --> 00:02:49.615
tree,

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:52.550
highway,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.928
mirror,

00:02:54.928 --> 00:02:57.060
Saturn

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.479
and electrode.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.063
So far so good?

00:03:01.063 --> 00:03:02.917
Okay. What I want you to do

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:06.264
is I want you to tell me what the answer is

00:03:06.264 --> 00:03:08.586
to 23 times eight.

00:03:08.586 --> 00:03:11.300
Just shout it out.

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:16.468
(Mumbling) (Laughter)

00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:18.889
In fact it's -- (Mumbling) -- exactly. (Laughter)

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.116
All right. I want you to take out your left hand

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:24.796
and I want you to go, "One, two, three, four, five,

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:26.999
six, seven, eight, nine, 10."

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.695
It's a neurological test,
just in case you were wondering.

00:03:29.695 --> 00:03:31.560
All right, now what I want you to do

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.785
is to recite the last five letters

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:36.654
of the English alphabet backwards.

00:03:38.637 --> 00:03:40.539
You should have started with Z.

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.830
(Laughter)

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.917
All right. How many people here are still pretty sure

00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:48.368
you've got all five words?

00:03:48.368 --> 00:03:51.549
Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half,

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.624
right, which is normal. There will be a range.

00:03:53.624 --> 00:03:55.180
Some people can hang on to five.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.464
Some people can hang on to 10.

00:03:56.464 --> 00:03:58.769
Some will be down to two or three.

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.173
What we know is this is really important
to the way we function, right?

00:04:02.173 --> 00:04:04.121
And it's going to be really important here at TED

00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:07.157
because you're going to be exposed
to so many different ideas.

00:04:07.157 --> 00:04:09.364
Now the problem that we have

00:04:09.364 --> 00:04:11.076
is that life comes at us,

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:13.193
and it comes at us very quickly,

00:04:13.193 --> 00:04:17.106
and what we need to do is to take that amorphous

00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:18.884
flow of experience and somehow

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:20.391
extract meaning from it

00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:21.690
with a working memory

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.959
that's about the size of a pea.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:26.506
Now don't get me wrong,
working memory is awesome.

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:28.621
Working memory allows us

00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:30.993
to investigate our current experience

00:04:30.993 --> 00:04:32.488
as we move forward.

00:04:32.488 --> 00:04:35.656
It allows us to make sense of the world around us.

00:04:35.656 --> 00:04:37.575
But it does have certain limits.

00:04:37.575 --> 00:04:41.418
Now working memory is great
for allowing us to communicate.

00:04:41.418 --> 00:04:42.890
We can have a conversation,

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.577
and I can build a narrative around that

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.307
so I know where we've been and where we're going

00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:49.395
and how to contribute to this conversation.

00:04:49.395 --> 00:04:51.632
It allows us to problem-solve, critical think.

00:04:51.632 --> 00:04:53.436
We can be in the middle of a meeting,

00:04:53.436 --> 00:04:55.939
listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it,

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.581
decide whether or not we like it,

00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:58.839
ask follow-up questions.

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:02.209
All of that occurs within working memory.

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:04.056
It also allows us to go to the store

00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:07.710
and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.481
when what we're really looking for

00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:12.318
is Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter)

00:05:12.318 --> 00:05:15.040
Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.377
Now, a central issue with working memory

00:05:18.377 --> 00:05:19.774
is that it's limited.

00:05:19.774 --> 00:05:21.970
It's limited in capacity, limited in duration,

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.580
limited in focus.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.315
We tend to remember about four things.

00:05:26.315 --> 00:05:28.212
Okay? It used to be seven,

00:05:28.212 --> 00:05:30.236
but with functional MRIs, apparently it's four,

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:32.779
and we were overachieving.

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.752
Now we can remember those four things

00:05:34.752 --> 00:05:36.615
for about 10 to 20 seconds

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:38.342
unless we do something with it,

00:05:38.342 --> 00:05:40.855
unless we process it,
unless we apply it to something,

00:05:40.855 --> 00:05:44.500
unless we talk to somebody about it.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.742
When we think about working memory,

00:05:47.742 --> 00:05:51.046
we have to realize that this limited capacity

00:05:51.046 --> 00:05:53.541
has lots of different impacts on us.

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:56.566
Have you ever walked from one room to another

00:05:56.566 --> 00:05:59.577
and then forgotten why you're there?

00:05:59.577 --> 00:06:01.746
You do know the solution to that, right?

00:06:01.746 --> 00:06:04.092
You go back to that original room. (Laughter)

00:06:04.092 --> 00:06:08.029
Have you ever forgotten your keys?

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.558
You ever forgotten your car?

00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:13.529
You ever forgotten your kids?

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.718
Have you ever been involved in a conversation,

00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:17.662
and you realize that the conversation to your left

00:06:17.662 --> 00:06:20.496
is actually more interesting? (Laughter)

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:22.120
So you're nodding and you're smiling,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.508
but you're really paying attention
to this one over here,

00:06:24.508 --> 00:06:26.808
until you hear that last word go up,

00:06:26.808 --> 00:06:28.468
and you realize,

00:06:28.468 --> 00:06:31.422
you've been asked a question. (Laughter)

00:06:31.422 --> 00:06:33.369
And you're really hoping the answer is no,

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:36.588
because that's what you're about to say.

00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:39.064
All of that talks about working memory,

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:41.322
what we can do and what we can't do.

00:06:41.322 --> 00:06:42.859
We need to realize that working memory

00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:44.258
has a limited capacity,

00:06:44.258 --> 00:06:47.777
and that working memory capacity itself
is how we negotiate that.

00:06:47.777 --> 00:06:49.948
We negotiate that through strategies.

00:06:49.948 --> 00:06:52.269
So what I want to do is talk a little bit
about a couple of strategies here,

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:53.544
and these will be really important

00:06:53.544 --> 00:06:57.299
because you are now in an
information target-rich environment

00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:59.419
for the next several days.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.323
Now the first part of this that we need to think about

00:07:02.323 --> 00:07:05.090
and we need to process our existence, our life,

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.805
immediately and repeatedly.

00:07:06.805 --> 00:07:09.246
We need to process what's going on

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:12.160
the moment it happens, not 10 minutes later,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.429
not a week later, at the moment.

00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:18.162
So we need to think about, well,
do I agree with him?

00:07:18.162 --> 00:07:20.942
What's missing? What would I like to know?

00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:23.164
Do I agree with the assumptions?

00:07:23.164 --> 00:07:24.974
How can I apply this in my life?

00:07:24.974 --> 00:07:26.954
It's a way of processing what's going on

00:07:26.954 --> 00:07:28.721
so that we can use it later.

00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:31.681
Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice.

00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:34.093
So we need to think about it here.

00:07:34.093 --> 00:07:36.888
In between, we want to talk to people about it.

00:07:36.888 --> 00:07:39.111
We're going to write it down,
and when you get home,

00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:41.071
pull out those notes and think about them

00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:43.460
and end up practicing over time.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.011
Practice for some reason
became a very negative thing.

00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:47.463
It's very positive.

00:07:47.463 --> 00:07:50.513
The next thing is, we need to think elaboratively

00:07:50.513 --> 00:07:52.853
and we need to think illustratively.

00:07:52.853 --> 00:07:56.307
Oftentimes, we think that we have to relate
new knowledge to prior knowledge.

00:07:56.307 --> 00:07:58.237
What we want to do is spin that around.

00:07:58.237 --> 00:07:59.994
We want to take all of our existence

00:07:59.994 --> 00:08:01.747
and wrap it around that new knowledge

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:05.195
and make all of these connections
and it becomes more meaningful.

00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:08.989
We also want to use imagery.
We are built for images.

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:10.847
We need to take advantage of that.

00:08:10.847 --> 00:08:12.357
Think about things in images,

00:08:12.357 --> 00:08:14.706
write things down that way.

00:08:14.706 --> 00:08:16.268
If you read a book, pull things up.

00:08:16.268 --> 00:08:18.321
I just got through reading "The Great Gatsby,"

00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:21.420
and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.418
in my head, so my own version.

00:08:24.418 --> 00:08:26.421
The last one is organization and support.

00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:28.990
We are meaning-making machines. It's what we do.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.131
We try to make meaning out of
everything that happens to us.

00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:34.421
Organization helps, so we need to structure

00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:36.000
what we're doing in ways that make sense.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.586
If we are providing knowledge and experience,

00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:40.071
we need to structure that.

00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:42.570
And the last one is support.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.292
We all started as novices.

00:08:44.292 --> 00:08:47.333
Everything we do is an
approximation of sophistication.

00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:50.270
We should expect it to change over time.
We have to support that.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.926
The support may come in asking people questions,

00:08:52.926 --> 00:08:56.424
giving them a sheet of paper that has
an organizational chart on it

00:08:56.429 --> 00:08:58.977
or has some guiding images,

00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:00.877
but we need to support it.

00:09:00.877 --> 00:09:06.168
Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message

00:09:06.168 --> 00:09:09.094
from a working memory capacity standpoint is this:

00:09:09.094 --> 00:09:12.025
what we process, we learn.

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:16.826
If we're not processing life, we're not living it.

00:09:16.826 --> 00:09:18.718
Live life. Thank you.

00:09:18.718 --> 00:09:22.903
