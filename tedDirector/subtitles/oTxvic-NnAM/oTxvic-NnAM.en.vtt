00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:17.466
It's an amazing thing

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.472
that we're here to talk
about the year of patients rising.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.986
You heard stories earlier today

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.038
about patients who are taking
control of their cases,

00:00:27.062 --> 00:00:28.217
patients who are saying,

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:30.215
"You know what, I know what the odds are,

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.389
but I'm going to look
for more information.

00:00:32.413 --> 00:00:36.173
I'm going to define
what the terms of my success are."

00:00:36.197 --> 00:00:39.986
I'm going to be sharing with you
how, four years ago, I almost died --

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.893
found out I was, in fact,
already almost dead --

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.155
and what I then found out

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.381
about what's called
the e-Patient movement.

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.054
I'll explain what that term means.

00:00:49.078 --> 00:00:51.846
I had been blogging
under the name "Patient Dave,"

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.244
and when I discovered this,

00:00:53.268 --> 00:00:55.566
I just renamed myself e-Patient Dave.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:57.642
Regarding the word "patient":

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:01.602
When I first started a few years ago
getting involved in health care

00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:03.986
and attending meetings
as just a casual observer,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.249
I noticed that people
would talk about patients

00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:08.848
as if it was somebody
who's not in the room here --

00:01:08.872 --> 00:01:10.266
somebody out there.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.803
Some of our talks today,
we still act like that.

00:01:12.827 --> 00:01:14.739
But I'm here to tell you:

00:01:14.763 --> 00:01:17.485
"patient" is not a third-person word.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.308
All right?

00:01:19.332 --> 00:01:22.552
You yourself will find
yourself in a hospital bed --

00:01:22.576 --> 00:01:24.231
or your mother, your child --

00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:26.173
there are heads nodding, people who say,

00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:27.938
"Yes, I know exactly what you mean."

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:30.986
So when you hear what I'm going
to talk about here today,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.040
first of all, I want to say that I am here

00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:36.644
on behalf of all the patients
that I have ever met,

00:01:36.668 --> 00:01:38.371
all the ones I haven't met.

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:42.168
This is about letting patients
play a more active role

00:01:42.192 --> 00:01:45.169
in helping health care,
in fixing health care.

00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:47.192
One of the senior doctors at my hospital,

00:01:47.216 --> 00:01:49.790
Charlie Safran,
and his colleague, Warner Slack,

00:01:49.814 --> 00:01:51.332
have been saying for decades

00:01:51.356 --> 00:01:55.116
that the most underutilized
resource in all of health care

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.315
is the patient.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.525
They have been saying that
since the 1970s.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.505
Now, I'm going to step back in history.

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:03.415
This is from July, 1969.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.101
I was a freshman in college,

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.728
and this was when we first
landed on the Moon.

00:02:08.113 --> 00:02:09.544
And it was the first time

00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:12.331
we had ever seen from another surface --

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:14.599
that's the place
where you and I are right now,

00:02:14.623 --> 00:02:15.781
where we live.

00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:17.352
The world was changing.

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:20.353
It was about to change
in ways that nobody could foresee.

00:02:20.377 --> 00:02:24.035
A few weeks later, Woodstock happened.

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.725
Three days of fun and music.

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.849
Here, just for historical authenticity,

00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:30.672
is a picture of me in that year.

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:33.922
(Laughter)

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:35.923
Yeah, the wavy hair, the blue eyes --

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.160
it was really something.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.587
That fall of 1969,

00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:41.498
the Whole Earth Catalog came out.

00:02:41.522 --> 00:02:44.986
It was a hippie journal
of self-sufficiency.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.041
We think of hippies
of being just hedonists,

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:51.266
but there's a very strong component --
I was in that movement --

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.634
a very strong component
of being responsible for yourself.

00:02:54.658 --> 00:02:58.555
This book's title's subtitle
is "Access to Tools."

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.875
It talked about how to build
your own house,

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.304
how to grow your own food,
all kinds of things.

00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:04.732
In the 1980s,

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:06.890
this young doctor, Tom Ferguson,

00:03:06.914 --> 00:03:09.541
was the medical editor
of the Whole Earth Catalog.

00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:14.336
He saw that the great majority
of what we do in medicine and health care

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.835
is taking care of ourselves.

00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:18.622
In fact, he said it was 70 to 80 percent

00:03:18.646 --> 00:03:20.915
of how we actually
take care of our bodies.

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.617
Well, he also saw that when health care
turns to medical care

00:03:25.641 --> 00:03:27.551
because of a more serious disease,

00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:30.899
the key thing that holds us back
is access to information.

00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:34.189
And when the Web came along,
that changed everything,

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:36.806
because not only
could we find information,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.546
we could find other people like ourselves

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.161
who could gather,
who could bring us information.

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:44.700
And he coined this term "e-Patients" --

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:47.055
equipped, engaged, empowered, enabled.

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.780
Obviously, at this stage of life

00:03:48.804 --> 00:03:52.771
he was in a somewhat more dignified
form than he was back then.

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:56.749
Now, I was an engaged patient
long before I ever heard of the term.

00:03:56.773 --> 00:03:59.749
In 2006, I went to my doctor
for a regular physical,

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:02.072
and I had said, "I have a sore shoulder."

00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:03.669
Well, I got an X-ray,

00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:05.341
and the next morning --

00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:08.890
you may have noticed, those of you
who have been through a medical crisis

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:10.114
will understand this.

00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:14.600
This morning, some of the speakers
named the date when they found out

00:04:14.624 --> 00:04:15.895
about their condition.

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.332
For me, it was 9am

00:04:18.356 --> 00:04:21.060
on January 3, 2007.

00:04:21.084 --> 00:04:23.579
I was at the office; my desk was clean.

00:04:23.603 --> 00:04:26.910
I had the blue partition
carpet on the walls.

00:04:27.347 --> 00:04:29.397
The phone rang and it was my doctor.

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:32.986
He said, "Dave, I pulled
up the X-ray image

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.100
on the screen on the computer at home."

00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:37.191
He said, "Your shoulder
is going to be fine,

00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:39.300
but Dave, there's something in your lung."

00:04:39.324 --> 00:04:41.232
And if you look in that red oval,

00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:44.059
that shadow was not supposed to be there.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.986
To make a long story short,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.165
I said, "So you need me
to get back in there?"

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.440
He said, "Yeah, we're going to need
to do a CT scan of your chest."

00:04:52.464 --> 00:04:55.105
In parting, I said,
"Is there anything I should do?"

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:56.986
He said -- think about this one,

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.986
this is the advice your doctor gives you:

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.010
"Just go home and have a glass
of wine with your wife."

00:05:04.283 --> 00:05:06.109
I went in for the CAT scan.

00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:10.705
It turns out there were
five of these things in both my lungs.

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.891
So at that point we knew
that it was cancer.

00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:14.519
We knew it wasn't lung cancer.

00:05:14.978 --> 00:05:17.495
That meant it was metastasized
from somewhere.

00:05:18.388 --> 00:05:20.051
The question was, where from?

00:05:20.494 --> 00:05:23.120
So I went in for an ultrasound.

00:05:23.144 --> 00:05:25.637
I got to do what many women have --

00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:28.516
the jelly on the belly and the, "Bzzzz!"

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.648
My wife came with me.

00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:32.800
She's a veterinarian,

00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:34.621
so she's seen lots of ultrasounds.

00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:36.229
I mean, she knows I'm not a dog.

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:37.897
(Laughter)

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:40.898
This is an MRI image.

00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:43.344
This is much sharper
than an ultrasound would be.

00:05:43.368 --> 00:05:45.269
What we saw in that kidney

00:05:46.142 --> 00:05:47.653
was that big blob there.

00:05:47.677 --> 00:05:50.717
There were actually two of these:
one was growing out the front

00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:53.164
and had already erupted
and latched onto the bowel.

00:05:53.188 --> 00:05:56.407
One was growing out the back
and it attached to the psoas muscle,

00:05:56.431 --> 00:05:59.216
which is a big muscle in the back
that I'd never heard of,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.073
but all of a sudden I cared about it.

00:06:01.097 --> 00:06:02.096
(Laughter)

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.283
I went home.

00:06:03.307 --> 00:06:04.581
Now, I've been Googling --

00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:06.995
I've been online since 1989,
on CompuServe.

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:09.649
I went home, and I know
you can't read the details here;

00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:10.839
that's not important.

00:06:10.863 --> 00:06:15.067
My point is, I went to a respected
medical website, WebMD,

00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:17.349
because I know how to filter out junk.

00:06:17.373 --> 00:06:19.349
I also found my wife online.

00:06:19.898 --> 00:06:21.580
Before I met her,

00:06:21.604 --> 00:06:24.080
I went through some suboptimal
search results.

00:06:24.104 --> 00:06:25.652
(Laughter)

00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:28.830
So I looked for quality information.

00:06:28.854 --> 00:06:30.586
There's so much about trust --

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.113
what sources of information can we trust?

00:06:33.137 --> 00:06:37.901
Where does my body end
and an invader start?

00:06:37.925 --> 00:06:41.063
A cancer, a tumor, is something
you grow out of your own tissue.

00:06:41.087 --> 00:06:42.652
How does that happen?

00:06:42.676 --> 00:06:46.695
Where does medical ability end and start?

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:48.604
Well, so what I read on WebMD:

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:54.161
"The prognosis is poor
for progressing renal cell cancer.

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:56.399
Almost all patients are incurable."

00:06:57.567 --> 00:07:01.282
I've been online long enough to know
if I don't like the first results I get,

00:07:01.306 --> 00:07:02.459
I go look for more.

00:07:02.483 --> 00:07:05.145
And what I found on other websites was,

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.533
even by the third page of Google results:

00:07:07.557 --> 00:07:08.991
"Outlook is bleak."

00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:11.588
"Prognosis is grim."

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:14.295
And I'm thinking, "What the heck?"

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:16.051
I didn't feel sick at all.

00:07:16.075 --> 00:07:18.265
I mean, I'd been getting
tired in the evening,

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:20.305
but I was 56 years old, you know?

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:21.986
I was slowly losing weight,

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.900
but for me, that was what
the doctor told me to do.

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:27.930
It was really something.

00:07:27.954 --> 00:07:31.134
And this is the diagram
of stage 4 kidney cancer

00:07:31.158 --> 00:07:32.915
from the drug I eventually got.

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:35.505
Totally by coincidence,
there's that thing in my lung.

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:38.986
In the left femur, the left thigh bone,
there's another one.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.375
I had one. My leg eventually snapped.

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:44.321
I fainted and landed on it, and it broke.

00:07:44.345 --> 00:07:45.593
There's one in the skull,

00:07:45.617 --> 00:07:48.080
and then for good measure,
I had these other tumors,

00:07:48.104 --> 00:07:50.175
including, by the time
my treatment started,

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.788
one was growing out of my tongue.

00:07:51.812 --> 00:07:53.956
I had kidney cancer
growing out of my tongue.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.139
And what I read

00:07:55.163 --> 00:07:57.551
was that my median survival was 24 weeks.

00:07:58.424 --> 00:07:59.879
This was bad.

00:07:59.903 --> 00:08:01.699
I was facing the grave.

00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:04.877
I thought, "What's my mother's face
going to look like

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.211
on the day of my funeral?"

00:08:06.605 --> 00:08:12.090
I had to sit down with my daughter
and say, "Here's the situation."

00:08:12.114 --> 00:08:13.528
Her boyfriend was with her.

00:08:13.552 --> 00:08:16.353
I said, "I don't want you guys
to get married prematurely,

00:08:16.377 --> 00:08:19.159
just so you can do it
while Dad's still alive."

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:21.908
It's really serious.

00:08:21.932 --> 00:08:25.512
If you wonder why patients
are motivated and want to help,

00:08:25.536 --> 00:08:26.694
think about this.

00:08:26.718 --> 00:08:30.748
Well, my doctor prescribed
a patient community, ACOR.org,

00:08:30.772 --> 00:08:33.986
a network of cancer patients,
of all amazing things.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.986
Very quickly they told me,

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.986
"Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.987
Get yourself to a specialist center.

00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:43.010
There is no cure, but there's something
that sometimes works --

00:08:43.034 --> 00:08:44.590
it usually doesn't --

00:08:44.614 --> 00:08:46.428
called high-dosage interleukin.

00:08:46.452 --> 00:08:48.460
Most hospitals don't offer it,

00:08:48.484 --> 00:08:50.659
so they won't even tell you it exists.

00:08:50.683 --> 00:08:52.802
Don't let them give you
anything else first.

00:08:52.826 --> 00:08:56.199
And by the way, here are four doctors
in your part of the United States

00:08:56.223 --> 00:08:58.174
who offer it, and their phone numbers."

00:08:58.198 --> 00:09:00.636
How amazing is that?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.474
(Applause)

00:09:03.498 --> 00:09:04.694
Here's the thing:

00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:06.306
Here we are, four years later --

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.906
you can't find a website
that gives patients that information.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.463
Government-approved,
American Cancer Society,

00:09:12.487 --> 00:09:15.463
but patients know
what patients want to know.

00:09:16.094 --> 00:09:18.865
It's the power of patient networks.

00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:22.118
This amazing substance --
again, I mentioned:

00:09:22.142 --> 00:09:23.496
Where does my body end?

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.914
My oncologist and I talk a lot these days

00:09:25.938 --> 00:09:28.439
because I try to keep my talks
technically accurate.

00:09:28.463 --> 00:09:32.791
And he said, "You know, the immune
system is good at detecting invaders,

00:09:33.537 --> 00:09:35.854
bacteria coming from outside,

00:09:35.878 --> 00:09:38.352
but when it's your own tissue
that you've grown,

00:09:38.376 --> 00:09:39.895
it's a whole different thing."

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:42.875
And I went through
a mental exercise, actually,

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:47.717
because I started a patient support
community of my own on a website,

00:09:47.741 --> 00:09:50.775
and one of my friends --
one of my relatives, actually -- said,

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.549
"Look, Dave, who grew this thing?

00:09:54.154 --> 00:09:58.177
Are you going to set yourself up
as mentally attacking yourself?"

00:09:58.201 --> 00:09:59.805
So we went into it.

00:09:59.829 --> 00:10:02.546
The story of how all that
happened is in the book.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.994
Anyway, this is the way
the numbers unfolded.

00:10:05.018 --> 00:10:08.149
Me being me, I put the numbers
from my hospital's website,

00:10:08.173 --> 00:10:09.332
for my tumor sizes,

00:10:09.356 --> 00:10:10.507
into a spreadsheet.

00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:11.986
Don't worry about the numbers.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.762
You see, that's the immune system.

00:10:13.786 --> 00:10:15.763
Amazing thing, those two yellow lines

00:10:15.787 --> 00:10:19.986
are where I got the two doses
of interleukin two months apart.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.140
And look at how the tumor sizes
plummeted in between.

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:24.623
Just incredible.

00:10:24.647 --> 00:10:28.077
Who knows what we'll be able to do
when we learn to make more use of it?

00:10:28.101 --> 00:10:30.417
The punch line is that a year
and a half later,

00:10:30.441 --> 00:10:34.741
I was there when this magnificent
young woman, my daughter,

00:10:34.765 --> 00:10:35.928
got married.

00:10:35.952 --> 00:10:37.763
And when she came down those steps,

00:10:38.351 --> 00:10:40.581
and it was just her and me
for that moment,

00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:43.827
I was so glad that she didn't have
to say to her mother,

00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:45.907
"I wish Dad could have been here."

00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:49.811
And this is what we're doing
when we make health care better.

00:10:49.835 --> 00:10:52.738
Now, I want to talk briefly
about a couple of other patients

00:10:52.762 --> 00:10:55.771
who are doing everything
in their power to improve health care.

00:10:55.795 --> 00:10:57.434
This is Regina Holliday,

00:10:57.458 --> 00:11:01.657
a painter in Washington DC,
whose husband died of kidney cancer

00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:03.181
a year after my disease.

00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:04.986
She's painting, here, a mural

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.986
of his horrible
final weeks in the hospital.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.457
One of the things that she discovered

00:11:10.481 --> 00:11:14.765
was that her husband's medical record
in this paper folder

00:11:14.789 --> 00:11:16.315
was just disorganized.

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:19.604
And she thought, "You know,
if I have a nutrition facts label

00:11:19.628 --> 00:11:21.351
on the side of a cereal box,

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:23.330
why can't there be something that simple

00:11:23.354 --> 00:11:25.898
telling every new nurse who comes on duty,

00:11:25.922 --> 00:11:27.147
every new doctor,

00:11:27.171 --> 00:11:29.281
the basics about my husband's condition?"

00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:34.581
So she painted this medical facts mural
with a nutrition label,

00:11:34.605 --> 00:11:35.762
something like that,

00:11:35.786 --> 00:11:36.986
in a diagram of him.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.986
She then, last year, painted this diagram.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.894
She studied health care like me.

00:11:41.918 --> 00:11:44.354
She came to realize
there were a lot of people

00:11:44.378 --> 00:11:46.388
who'd written patient-advocate books

00:11:46.412 --> 00:11:49.255
that you just don't hear
about at medical conferences.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:52.034
Patients are such
an underutilized resource.

00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:54.664
Well, as it said in my introduction,

00:11:54.688 --> 00:11:56.470
I've gotten somewhat known for saying

00:11:56.494 --> 00:11:58.701
that patients should have
access to their data.

00:11:58.725 --> 00:12:01.401
I actually said at one conference
a couple of years ago,

00:12:01.425 --> 00:12:02.588
"Give me my damn data,

00:12:02.612 --> 00:12:05.215
because you people
can't be trusted to keep it clean."

00:12:05.239 --> 00:12:07.986
And here, she has our "damned" data --

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.304
it's a pun --

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:12.256
which is starting to break out,
starting to break through --

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.376
the water symbolizes our data.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.551
And in fact,

00:12:15.575 --> 00:12:18.279
I want to do a little something
improvisational for you.

00:12:18.303 --> 00:12:22.172
There's a guy on Twitter that I know,
a health IT guy outside Boston,

00:12:22.196 --> 00:12:24.728
and he wrote the e-Patient rap.

00:12:24.752 --> 00:12:26.450
And it goes like this.

00:12:26.474 --> 00:12:28.092
(Laughter)

00:12:28.116 --> 00:12:32.176
(Beatboxing)

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.225
(Rapping) Gimme my damn data

00:12:34.249 --> 00:12:36.717
I wanna be an e-Patient just like Dave

00:12:36.741 --> 00:12:39.277
Gimme my damn data,
'cause it's my life to save

00:12:39.301 --> 00:12:41.879
(Normal voice) Now, I'm not going
to go any further --

00:12:41.903 --> 00:12:48.434
(Applause) (Cheering)

00:12:56.265 --> 00:12:58.670
Well, thank you. That shot the timing.

00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:00.335
(Laughter)

00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:01.830
Think about the possibility.

00:13:01.854 --> 00:13:06.240
Why is it that iPhones and iPads
advance far faster

00:13:06.264 --> 00:13:08.504
than the health tools
that are available to you

00:13:08.528 --> 00:13:10.756
to help take care of your family?

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.900
Here's a website, VisibleBody.com,
that I stumbled across.

00:13:14.924 --> 00:13:17.858
And I thought, "You know,
I wonder what my psoas muscle is?"

00:13:17.882 --> 00:13:19.859
So you can click on things and remove it.

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:22.860
And I saw, "Aha! That's the kidney
and the psoas muscle."

00:13:22.884 --> 00:13:26.845
I was rotating it in 3D
and saying, "I understand now."

00:13:26.869 --> 00:13:29.804
And then I realized
it reminded me of Google Earth,

00:13:29.828 --> 00:13:32.141
where you can fly to any address.

00:13:32.605 --> 00:13:37.933
And I thought, "Why not take this
and connect it to my digital scan data

00:13:37.957 --> 00:13:40.241
and have Google Earth for my body?"

00:13:40.866 --> 00:13:42.986
What did Google come out with this year?

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.014
Now there's Google Body browser.

00:13:45.618 --> 00:13:47.595
But you see, it's still generic.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.499
It's not my data.

00:13:49.523 --> 00:13:52.597
But if we can get that data
out from behind the dam

00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:55.598
so software innovators can pounce on it

00:13:55.622 --> 00:13:57.898
the way software innovators like to do,

00:13:57.922 --> 00:14:00.108
who knows what we'll be able
to come up with.

00:14:00.132 --> 00:14:01.283
One final story.

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:05.882
This is Kelly Young, a rheumatoid
arthritis patient from Florida.

00:14:06.258 --> 00:14:09.777
This is a live story,
unfolding just in the last few weeks.

00:14:09.801 --> 00:14:15.345
RA patients, as they call themselves --
her blog is "RA Warrior" --

00:14:15.369 --> 00:14:16.726
have a big problem,

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.528
because 40 percent of them
have no visible symptoms.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.068
And that makes it really hard
to tell how the disease is going,

00:14:23.092 --> 00:14:26.249
and some doctors think,
"Yeah right, you're really in pain."

00:14:26.273 --> 00:14:28.986
Well, she found,
through her online research,

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.398
a nuclear bone scan
that's usually used for cancer,

00:14:32.422 --> 00:14:35.211
but it can also reveal inflammation.

00:14:35.235 --> 00:14:39.145
And she saw that
if there is no inflammation,

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:41.629
then the scan is a uniform gray.

00:14:41.653 --> 00:14:42.848
So she took it.

00:14:42.872 --> 00:14:47.153
And the radiologist's report
said, "No cancer found."

00:14:47.177 --> 00:14:49.656
Well, that's not what
he was supposed to do with it.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.101
So she wanted to have it read again,

00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:53.986
and her doctor fired her.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.893
She pulled up the CD.

00:14:55.917 --> 00:14:59.624
He said, "If you don't want to follow
my instructions, go away."

00:15:00.219 --> 00:15:02.986
So she pulled up the CD
of the scan images,

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.986
and look at all those hot spots.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.986
And she's now actively engaged on her blog

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.805
in looking for assistance
in getting better care.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.112
See, that is an empowered
patient -- no medical training.

00:15:14.136 --> 00:15:16.107
We are, you are,

00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:18.826
the most underused
resource in health care.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.366
What she was able to do

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.132
was because she had access
to the raw data.

00:15:23.156 --> 00:15:24.528
How big a deal was this?

00:15:24.552 --> 00:15:26.298
Well at TED2009,

00:15:26.322 --> 00:15:29.596
Tim Berners-Lee himself,
inventor of the Web,

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.597
gave a talk where he said
the next big thing

00:15:32.621 --> 00:15:37.296
is not to have your browser find
other people's articles about the data,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.502
but the raw data.

00:15:38.526 --> 00:15:41.296
And he got them chanting
by the end of the talk,

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.987
"Raw data now! Raw data now!"

00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:46.525
And I ask you,

00:15:46.549 --> 00:15:49.265
three words, please,
to improve health care:

00:15:49.827 --> 00:15:51.804
Let patients help!

00:15:51.828 --> 00:15:53.542
Let patients help!

00:15:53.566 --> 00:15:55.421
Let patients help!

00:15:55.445 --> 00:15:57.363
Let patients help!

00:15:57.387 --> 00:15:58.651
Thank you.

00:15:58.675 --> 00:16:05.443
(Applause)

00:16:15.422 --> 00:16:20.808
For all the patients around the world
watching this on the Webcast,

00:16:20.832 --> 00:16:23.153
God bless you, everyone.
Let patients help.

00:16:23.177 --> 00:16:25.815
Host: And bless yourself.
Thank you very much.
