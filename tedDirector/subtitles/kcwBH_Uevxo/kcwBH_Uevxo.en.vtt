00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
We invent.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
My company invents

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
all kinds of new technology

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
in lots of different areas.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And we do that for a couple of reasons.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
We invent for fun --

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
invention is a lot of fun to do --

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and we also invent for profit.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
The two are related because

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
you wouldn't have the time to do it.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
So we do this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
fun and profit-oriented inventing

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
for most of what we do,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
but we also have a program where we invent for humanity --

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
where we take some of our best inventors,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
and we say, "Are there problems

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has?" --

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
which is with dramatic, crazy,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
out-of-the-box solutions.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
that work on these problems

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and he also funds this work, so thank you.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
So I'm going to briefly discuss

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
a couple of problems that we have

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and a couple of problems where

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
we've got some solutions underway.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Vaccination is one of the

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
key techniques in public health,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
a fantastic thing.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
But in the developing world a lot of vaccines

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
spoil before they're administered,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
and that's because they need to be kept cold.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
They go bad very quickly if you don't,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and if you don't have stable power grid, this doesn't happen,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
so kids die.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters;

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
This is one of the ways that

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
vaccines are carried:

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
These are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
but they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
We've got a different solution.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Now, one of these Styrofoam chests

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
will last for about four hours with ice in it.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And we thought, well, that's not really good enough.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
So we made this thing.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
This lasts six months with no power;

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
absolutely zero power,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
because it loses less

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
than a half a watt.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Now, this is our second generations prototype.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
The third generation prototype is, right now,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
in Uganda being tested.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Now, the reason we were able to come up with this

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
is two key ideas:

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
They have incredible insulation,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
so let's put some incredible insulation here.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
The other idea is kind of interesting,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
which is, you can't reach inside anymore.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Because if you open it up and reach inside,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
you'd let the heat in, the game would be over.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
It vends out little individual vials.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So a simple idea,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
in Africa and around the world.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
We'll move on to malaria.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Malaria is one of the great public health problems.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Two hundred million people a year.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Every 43 seconds a child in Africa dies;

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
27 will die during my talk.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And there's no way for us here in this country

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
to grasp really what that means to the people involved.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Another comment of Esther's

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
was that we react when there's

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
a tragedy like Haiti,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
but that tragedy is ongoing.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
So what can we do about it?

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Well, there are a lot of things people have tried

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
for many years for solving malaria.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
You can spray; the problem is there are environmental issues.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
You can try to treat people and create awareness.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
That's great, except the places that have malaria really bad,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
they don't have health care systems.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
A vaccine would be a terrific thing,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
only they don't work yet.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
People have tried for a long time. There are a couple of interesting candidates.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
You can distribute bed nets,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and bed nets are very effective if you use them.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
You don't always use them for that. People fish with them.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
They don't always get to everyone.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And bed nets

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
have an effect on the epidemic,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Now, malaria is

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
an incredibly complicated disease.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
We could spend hours going over this.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
It's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle;

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
they have sex, they burrow into your liver,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
they tunnel into your blood cells ...

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
it's an incredibly complicated disease,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and why we work on malaria:

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
There's a lot of potential ways in.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
One of those ways might be better diagnosis.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
So we hope this year

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
to prototype each of these devices.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
One does an automatic malaria diagnosis

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works:

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
You take a drop of blood,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
you put it in there and it automatically tells you.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Today, you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
create a bunch of microscope slides

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and have a trained person examine it.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
The other thing is, you know,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And if you look through the eye,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
in fact, you may be able to do this

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
directly, without drawing any blood at all,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
or through your nail beds.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
We can see it because of this molecule

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
called hemozoin.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
It's produced by the malaria parasite

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and it's a very interesting crystalline substance.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Interesting, anyway, if you're a solid-state physicist.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
There's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
This is our femtosecond laser lab.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
So this creates pulses of light

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
that last a femtosecond.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
That's really, really, really short.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
This is a pulse of light that's

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
only about one wavelength of light long,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
so it's a whole bunch of photons

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
all coming and hitting simultaneously.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
It creates a very high peak power

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things;

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
in particular, it lets you find hemozoin.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
So here's an image of red blood cells,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
and now we can actually map

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
inside those red blood cells.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And using both this technique

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and other optical techniques,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
we think we can make those diagnostics.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
We also have another hemozoin-oriented

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
therapy for malaria:

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
a way, in acute cases, to actually

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Sort of like doing dialysis,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
but for relieving the parasite load.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
This is our thousand-core supercomputer.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
We're kind of software guys,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and so nearly any problem that you pose,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
we like to try to solve with some software.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
One of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
or reduce it

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
is you don't know what's the most effective thing to do.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
Okay, we heard about bed nets earlier.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
You spend a certain amount per bed net.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
Or you could spray.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
You can give drug administration.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
There's all these different interventions

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
but they have different kinds of effectiveness.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
How can you tell?

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
So we've created, using our supercomputer,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
the world's best computer model of malaria,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
which we'll show you now.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
We picked Madagascar.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
We have every road,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
every village,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
every, almost, square inch of Madagascar.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
We have all of the precipitation data

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
and the temperature data.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
That's very important because the humidity and precipitation

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
tell you whether you've got

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
So that sets the stage on which you do this.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
You then have to introduce the mosquitoes,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and you have to model that

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
and how they come and go.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
Ultimately, it gives you this.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
This is malaria spreading

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
across Madagascar.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And this is this latter part of the rainy season.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
We're going to the dry season now.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
It nearly goes away in the dry season,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And then, of course, the next year it comes roaring back.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
By doing these kinds of simulations,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
we want to eradicate or control malaria

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
thousands of times in software

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
before we actually have to do it in real life;

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs --

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
how many bed nets versus how much spraying? --

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
or the social trade-offs --

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
what happens if unrest breaks out?

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
We also try to study our foe.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
This is a high-speed camera view

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
of a mosquito.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And, in a moment,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
we're going to see a view of the airflow.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Here, we're trying to visualize the airflow

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
around the wings of the mosquito

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
with little particles we're illuminating with a laser.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
By understanding how mosquitoes fly,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
we hope to understand how to make them not fly.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Now, one of the ways you can make them not fly

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
is with DDT.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
This is a real ad.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
This is one of those things you just can't make up.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Once upon a time, this was the primary technique,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
and, in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
The United States did.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
In 1935, there were 150,000 cases a year

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
of malaria in the United States,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
but DDT and a massive public health effort

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
managed to squelch it.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
So we thought,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
"Well, we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
the parasite involved.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
What can we do to the mosquito?

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Well, let's try to kill it with consumer electronics."

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Now, that sounds silly,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
but each of these devices

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
has something interesting in it that maybe you could use.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Your Blu-ray player has

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
a very cheap blue laser.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
that's used to steer a laser beam very accurately;

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
that's what makes those little dots on the page.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
And, of course, there's signal processing

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and digital cameras.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
So what if we could put all that together

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
to shoot them out of the sky with lasers?

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
(Laughter)

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
(Applause)

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
Now, in our company, this is what we call

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
"the pinky-suck moment."

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
(Laughter)

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
What if we could do that?

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
Now, just suspend disbelief for a moment,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
and let's think of what could happen

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
if we could do that.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Well, we could protect very high-value targets like clinics.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Clinics are full of people that have malaria.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
They're sick, and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
You really want to protect them.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
Of course, if you do that,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
you could also protect your backyard.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
And farmers could protect their crops

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
that they want to sell to Whole Foods

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
because our photons

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
are 100 percent organic. (Laughter)

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
They're completely natural.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Now, it actually gets better than this.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
You could, if you're really smart,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
before you zap it,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
and you could listen to the wing beat frequency

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and you could measure the size.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
And then you could decide:

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
"Is this an insect I want to kill,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
or an insect I don't want to kill?"

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
Moore's law made computing cheap;

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
so cheap we can weigh

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
the life of an individual insect

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
and decide thumbs up

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
or thumbs down. (Laughter)

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Now, it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
They're the only ones that are dangerous.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Mosquitoes only drink blood

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
to lay eggs.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
Mosquitoes actually live ... their day-to-day nutrition

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
comes from nectar, from flowers --

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
in fact, in the lab, we feed ours raisins --

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
but the female needs the blood meal.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
So, this sounds really crazy, right?

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
Would you like to see it?

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
Audience: Yeah!

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Nathan Myhrvold: Okay, so our legal department prepared a disclaimer,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and here it is.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
(Laughter)

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Now, after thinking about this a little bit

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
we thought, you know, it probably would be simpler

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
to do this with a nonlethal laser.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
So, Eric Johanson, who built the device,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
actually, with parts from eBay;

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and Pablos Holman over here,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
he's got mosquitoes in the tank.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
We have the device over here.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And we're going to show you,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
instead of the kill laser,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
which will be a very brief, instantaneous pulse,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
we're going to have a green laser pointer

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
that's going to stay on the mosquito for, actually, quite a long period of time;

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
otherwise, you can't see it very well.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
Take it away Eric.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
Eric Johanson: What we have here

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
is a tank on the other side of the stage.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And we have ... this computer screen

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
And Pablos, if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
we can see them flying around.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
Now, that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
and let me show you how it works.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Here you can see that the insects are being tracked

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
as they're flying around,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
which is kind of fun.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Next we can actually light them up with a laser. (Laughter)

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
Now, this is a low powered laser,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
and we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
NM: That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
EJ: Finally, let's see what this looks like.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around, being lit up.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
This is slowed way down

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
so that you have an opportunity to see what's happening.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
Here we have it running at high-speed mode.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
and we're looking very hard at how to make it

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
highly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:55.260
(Applause)

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
NM: So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
(Laughter)

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
(Laughter)

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
This is very satisfying.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
(Laughter)

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
This is one of the first ones we did.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
The energy's a little bit high here.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
(Laughter)

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
We'll loop around here in just a second, and you'll see another one.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
Here's another one. Bang.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
An interesting thing is, we kill them all the time;

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
we've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
The wing motor is very resilient.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
I mean, here we're blowing wings off

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
but the wing motor keeps all the way down.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
So, that's what I have. Thanks very much.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:15:03.260
(Applause)
