00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
It's Monday morning.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
In Washington,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
the president of the United States

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
is sitting in the Oval Office,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
assessing whether or not

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
to strike Al Qaeda

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
in Yemen.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
At Number 10 Downing Street,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
David Cameron is trying to work out

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
whether to cut more public sector jobs

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
in order to stave off a double-dip recession.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
In Madrid, Maria Gonzalez

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
is standing at the door,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
listening to her baby crying and crying,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
trying to work out whether she should let it cry

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
until it falls asleep

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
or pick it up and hold it.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
trying to work out

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
whether I should let him drink

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that his doctors just came in and said,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
"You must make him drink today," --

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
my father's been nil by mouth for a week --

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
or whether, by giving him this bottle,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
I might actually kill him.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
We face momentous decisions

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
with important consequences

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
throughout our lives,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
We talk things over with our friends,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
we scour the Internet,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
we search through books.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
But still,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
even in this age

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
of Google and TripAdvisor

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
and Amazon Recommends,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
it's still experts

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
that we rely upon most --

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
especially when the stakes are high

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and the decision really matters.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Because in a world of data deluge

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and extreme complexity,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
we believe that experts

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
are more able to process information than we can --

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
that they are able to come to better conclusions

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
than we could come to on our own.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And in an age

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
that is sometimes nowadays frightening

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
or confusing,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
we feel reassured

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
by the almost parental-like authority

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
of experts

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
who tell us so clearly what it is

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
we can and cannot do.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
But I believe

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
that this is a big problem,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.260
a problem with potentially dangerous consequences

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
for us as a society,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
as a culture

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and as individuals.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
It's not that experts

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
have not massively contributed to the world --

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
of course they have.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
The problem lies with us:

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
we've become addicted to experts.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
We've become addicted to their certainty,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
their assuredness,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
their definitiveness,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and in the process,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
we have ceded our responsibility,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
substituting our intellect

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and our intelligence

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
for their supposed words of wisdom.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
We've surrendered our power,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
trading off our discomfort

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
with uncertainty

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
for the illusion of certainty

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
that they provide.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
This is no exaggeration.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
In a recent experiment,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
a group of adults

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
had their brains scanned in an MRI machine

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
as they were listening to experts speak.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
The results were quite extraordinary.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
As they listened to the experts' voices,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.260
the independent decision-making parts of their brains

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
switched off.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
It literally flat-lined.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And they listened to whatever the experts said

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and took their advice, however right or wrong.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
But experts do get things wrong.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Did you know that studies show

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
that doctors misdiagnose

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
four times out of 10?

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
Did you know

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
that if you file your tax returns yourself,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
you're statistically more likely

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
to be filing them correctly

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
than if you get a tax adviser

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
to do it for you?

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
And then there's, of course, the example

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
that we're all too aware of:

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
financial experts

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
getting it so wrong

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
that we're living through the worst recession

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
since the 1930s.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
For the sake of our health,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
our wealth

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
and our collective security,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
it's imperative that we keep

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.260
the independent decision-making parts of our brains

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
switched on.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And I'm saying this as an economist

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
who, over the past few years,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
has focused my research

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
on what it is we think

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and who it is we trust and why,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
but also --

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and I'm aware of the irony here --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
as an expert myself,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
as a professor,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
as somebody who advises prime ministers,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
heads of big companies,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
international organizations,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
but an expert who believes

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that the role of experts needs to change,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
that we need to become more open-minded,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
more democratic

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and be more open

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
to people rebelling against

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
our points of view.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
So in order to help you understand

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
where I'm coming from,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
let me bring you into my world,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
the world of experts.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Now there are, of course, exceptions,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.260
wonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
But what my research has shown me

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
is that experts tend on the whole

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
to form very rigid camps,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
that within these camps,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
a dominant perspective emerges

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
that often silences opposition,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
that experts move with the prevailing winds,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
often hero-worshipping

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
their own gurus.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Alan Greenspan's proclamations

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
that the years of economic growth

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
would go on and on,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
not challenged by his peers,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
until after the crisis, of course.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
You see,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
we also learn

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
that experts are located,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
are governed,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
by the social and cultural norms

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
of their times --

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
whether it be the doctors

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
in Victorian England, say,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
who sent women to asylums

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
for expressing sexual desire,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
or the psychiatrists in the United States

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
who, up until 1973,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.260
were still categorizing homosexuality

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
as a mental illness.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
And what all this means

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
is that paradigms

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
take far too long to shift,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.260
that complexity and nuance are ignored

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and also that money talks --

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
because we've all seen the evidence

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
of pharmaceutical companies

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
funding studies of drugs

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
that conveniently leave out

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
their worst side effects,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
or studies funded by food companies

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
of their new products,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
massively exaggerating the health benefits

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
of the products they're about to bring by market.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
The study showed that food companies exaggerated

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
typically seven times more

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
than an independent study.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And we've also got to be aware

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
that experts, of course,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
also make mistakes.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
They make mistakes every single day --

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
mistakes born out of carelessness.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
A recent study in the Archives of Surgery

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
reported surgeons

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
removing healthy ovaries,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
operating on the wrong side of the brain,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
carrying out procedures on the wrong hand,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
elbow, eye, foot,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
and also mistakes born out of thinking errors.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
A common thinking error

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
of radiologists, for example --

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
when they look at CT scans --

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
is that they're overly influenced

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
by whatever it is

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
that the referring physician has said

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
that he suspects

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
the patient's problem to be.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
So if a radiologist

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
is looking at the scan

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
of a patient with suspected pneumonia, say,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
what happens is that,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
if they see evidence

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
of pneumonia on the scan,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
they literally stop looking at it --

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
thereby missing the tumor

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
sitting three inches below

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
on the patient's lungs.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
I've shared with you so far

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
some insights into the world of experts.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
These are, of course,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
not the only insights I could share,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
but I hope they give you a clear sense at least

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
of why we need to stop kowtowing to them,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
why we need to rebel

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
and why we need to switch

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.260
our independent decision-making capabilities on.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
But how can we do this?

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Well for the sake of time,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
I want to focus on just three strategies.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
First, we've got to be ready and willing

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
to take experts on

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
and dispense with this notion of them

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
as modern-day apostles.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
in every single subject,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
you'll be relieved to hear.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
But it does mean persisting

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
in the face of their inevitable annoyance

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
when, for example,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
we want them to explain things to us

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.260
in language that we can actually understand.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Why was it that, when I had an operation,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
my doctor said to me,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
"Beware, Ms. Hertz,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
of hyperpyrexia,"

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
when he could have just as easily said,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
"Watch out for a high fever."

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.260
You see, being ready to take experts on

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
is about also being willing

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
to dig behind their graphs,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
their equations, their forecasts,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
their prophecies,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and being armed with the questions to do that --

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
questions like:

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
What are the assumptions that underpin this?

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
What is the evidence upon which this is based?

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.260
What has your investigation focused on?

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
And what has it ignored?

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
It recently came out

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
that experts trialing drugs

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
before they come to market

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
typically trial drugs

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.260
first, primarily on male animals

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
and then, primarily on men.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
that over half the world's population are women.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
And women have drawn the short medical straw

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
because it now turns out that many of these drugs

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
don't work nearly as well on women

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
as they do on men --

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
and the drugs that do work well work so well

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
that they're actively harmful for women to take.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
Being a rebel is about recognizing

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
that experts' assumptions

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
and their methodologies

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
can easily be flawed.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
Second,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
we need to create the space

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
for what I call "managed dissent."

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
If we are to shift paradigms,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
if we are to make breakthroughs,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
if we are to destroy myths,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
we need to create an environment

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
in which expert ideas are battling it out,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
in which we're bringing in

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
new, diverse, discordant, heretical views

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
into the discussion,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
fearlessly,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
in the knowledge that progress comes about,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.260
not only from the creation of ideas,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
but also from their destruction --

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
and also from the knowledge

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
that, by surrounding ourselves

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
by divergent, discordant,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
heretical views.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
All the research now shows us

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.260
that this actually makes us smarter.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
because it goes against our very instincts,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
which are to surround ourselves

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
with opinions and advice

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
that we already believe

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
or want to be true.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
And that's why I talk about the need

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
to actively manage dissent.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
Google CEO Eric Schmidt

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
is a practical practitioner

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
of this philosophy.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room --

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
arms crossed, looking a bit bemused --

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
and draws them into the discussion,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
trying to see if they indeed are

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
the person with a different opinion,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
so that they have dissent within the room.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
Managing dissent

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
is about recognizing the value

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
of disagreement, discord

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
and difference.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
But we need to go even further.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
We need to fundamentally redefine

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
who it is that experts are.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
The conventional notion

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
is that experts are people

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
with advanced degrees,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
fancy titles, diplomas,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
best-selling books --

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
high-status individuals.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
But just imagine

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
if we were to junk

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.260
this notion of expertise

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.260
as some sort of elite cadre

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
and instead embrace the notion

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
of democratized expertise --

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
whereby expertise was not just the preserve

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
of surgeons and CEO's,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
but also shop-girls -- yeah.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
Best Buy,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
the consumer electronics company,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
gets all its employees --

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
the cleaners, the shop assistants,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
the people in the back office,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
not just its forecasting team --

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
to place bets, yes bets,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
on things like whether or not

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
a product is going to sell well before Christmas,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
on whether customers' new ideas

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.260
are going to be or should be taken on by the company,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
on whether a project

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
will come in on time.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
By leveraging

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
and by embracing

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
the expertise within the company,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
Best Buy was able to discover, for example,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.260
that the store that it was going to open in China --

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
its big, grand store --

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
was not going to open on time.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
Because when it asked its staff,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
all its staff, to place their bets

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.260
on whether they thought the store would open on time or not,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
a group from the finance department

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
placed all their chips

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
on that not happening.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
It turned out that they were aware,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
as no one else within the company was,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
of a technological blip

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
that neither the forecasting experts,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
nor the experts on the ground in China,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
were even aware of.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
The strategies

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
that I have discussed this evening --

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
embracing dissent,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
taking experts on,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
democratizing expertise,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
rebellious strategies --

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
are strategies that I think

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
would serve us all well to embrace

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
as we try to deal with the challenges

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
of these very confusing, complex,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
difficult times.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
For if we keep

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
our independent decision-making part

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
of our brains switched on,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
if we challenge experts, if we're skeptical,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
if we devolve authority,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
if we are rebellious,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
but also

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
if we become much more comfortable

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
with nuance,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
uncertainty and doubt,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
and if we allow our experts

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
to express themselves

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
using those terms too,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
we will set ourselves up

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
much better

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.260
for the challenges of the 21st century.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
For now, more than ever,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
is not the time

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
to be blindly following,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
blindly accepting,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
blindly trusting.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
Now is the time to face the world

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
with eyes wide open --

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
yes, using experts

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
to help us figure things out, for sure --

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.260
I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here --

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
but being aware

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
of their limitations

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.260
and, of course, also our own.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
Thank you.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.260
(Applause)
