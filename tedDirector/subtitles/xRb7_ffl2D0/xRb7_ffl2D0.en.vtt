00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
I have a tough job to do.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.160
You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.160
with their connotations and design, in all its forms,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
and with so much and so many people working

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.160
on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.160
I wanted to build an argument for primary education

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
in a very specific context.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas --

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
it's like four pieces of a puzzle.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
And if I succeed in doing that,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
maybe you would go back with the thought

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
that you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
and the quality of education.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.160
Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
that as you go further and further away

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.160
from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
What happens to education?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
The second, or a different kind of remoteness

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.160
is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.160
you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
which are socially and economically remote

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
from the rest of the city, so it's us and them.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
What happens to education in that context?

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:59.160
So keep both of those ideas of remoteness.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
do not have good enough teachers.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
They do not have good enough infrastructure.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
And if they had some infrastructure,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
they have difficulty maintaining it.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.160
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160
we hired a car, looked up on Google,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.160
found a route into northern India from New Delhi

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.160
which, you know, which did not cross any big cities

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.160
or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.160
and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.160
and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.160
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.160
I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
But it was quite obvious, quite clear,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.160
that for this particular route that I had taken,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.160
the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
That seemed a little damning,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160
and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
or with the availability of electricity, and things like that.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
To my surprise, it did not correlate.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.160
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.160
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.160
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.160
to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.160
"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" --

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.160
69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.160
they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi --

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
because, you know, those are relatively better off areas --

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.160
and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.160
probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.160
So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.160
was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.160
and that sort of thing. It appears that way.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.160
When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
you know, things like websites, collaborative environments --

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
you've been listening to all that in the morning --

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.160
it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
and, according to me, biases the result.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.160
The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature --

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.160
consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.160
The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.160
You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
So the principal looks at it and says,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.160
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.160
where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent --

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
that will be a completely different thing.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.160
So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
but we seem to be doing it the other way about.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
the underprivileged first, not the other way about.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
the teacher's first reaction is,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.160
you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160
if you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.160
the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160
and he said something which completely solves this problem.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.160
He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.160
So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.160
whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
then you don't need an alternative education.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.160
So far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.160
There are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
I'm going to talk about children and self-organization,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.160
of what might an alternative education be like.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
They're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.160
I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.160
The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.160
And what we did over there was pretty much simple.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.160
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.160
so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
They cut a hole inside that wall --

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall --

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.160
and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.160
put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.160
And this is what we saw.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:29.160
So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:35.160
About eight hours later, we found this kid.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.160
To the right is this eight-year-old child who --

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.160
and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.160
And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.160
So it sort of raised more questions than it answered.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
Is this real? Does the language matter,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
because he's not supposed to know English?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
-- and did anyone teach them?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
The last question is what everybody said, but you know,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
and asked the people in your office,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:21.160
this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.160
where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.160
(Laughter)

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.160
So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.160
was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there;

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.160
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.160
something moves on the screen --

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
and later on he told me, "I have never seen a television

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.160
where you can do something."

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
to figure out that he was doing things to the television.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:12.160
by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.160
He did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.160
Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.160
and he was browsing: he was going back and forth.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.160
When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:38.160
like, children would come and see what's happening over here.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.160
And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.160
So eight minutes and an embedded computer

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.160
seemed to be all that we needed there.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
So we thought that this is what was happening:

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
that children in groups can self-instruct themselves

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:04.160
to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:10.160
At this time there was a -- the main question was about English.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.160
People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
into some Indian language? That's not possible.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160
So, it has to be the other way about.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
I took the experiment out to northeastern India,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
to a village called Madantusi,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.160
where, for some reason, there was no English teacher,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160
so the children had not learned English at all.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.160
And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums:

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.160
there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.160
In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.160
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet --

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.160
and came back three months later.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.160
So when I came back there, I found these two kids,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.160
And as soon as they saw me they said,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
"We need a faster processor and a better mouse."

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160
(Laughter)

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
I was real surprised.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
You know, how on earth did they know all this?

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.160
So I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?"

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
So they said, "Well, you've left this machine

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.160
which talks only in English, so we had to learn English."

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.160
So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
-- mispronounced, but correct usage --

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:48.160
words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.160
So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier;

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
if they really wanted to.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.160
Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.160
to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
India is a good place to do such an experiment in,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
and also all the socio-economic diversities.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.160
So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.160
that would cover practically the whole world.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.160
So I did this for almost five years, and this experiment

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.160
I also had to check or invent an engineering design

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.160
which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.160
so I needed different climates, for which India is also great,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
because we have very cold, very hot, and so on.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:14:04.160
This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.160
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages --

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
the first thing that these children did was to find a website

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
to teach themselves the English alphabet.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.160
Then to central India -- very warm, moist, fishing villages,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.160
where humidity is a very big killer of electronics.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.160
So we had to solve all the problems we had

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
without air conditioning and with very poor power,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.160
so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
put at the right places to keep the machines running.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.160
I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.160
This sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
telling his eldest sister what to do.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
And this happens very often with these computers,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.160
that the younger children are found teaching the older ones.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.160
What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
in a connected environment,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.160
irrespective of anything that we could measure.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.160
So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.160
I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.160
And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
because all of you are talking about groups.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.160
So here was the power of what a group of children can do,

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.160
if you lift the adult intervention.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.160
Just a quick idea of the measurements.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.160
We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.160
But we got a clean learning curve,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.160
almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.160
I'll leave it at that,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160
What could they learn to do?

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.160
Basic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.160
games and educational material, music downloads, playing video.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.160
In short, what all of us do.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.160
And over 300 children will become computer literate

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.160
and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.160
So, how do they do that?

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
If you calculated the actual time of access,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160
it would work out to minutes per day,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
so that's not how it's happening.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:22.160
What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.160
And surrounding him are usually three other children,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.160
who are advising him on what they should do.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.160
If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.160
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160
who are also advising, usually wrongly,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160
about everything that's going on on the computer.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.160
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.160
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.160
It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.160
but remember, eight-year-olds live in a society

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.160
where most of the time they are told, don't do this,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160
So what does the eight-year-old do?

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.160
He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.160
And if you tested him,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160
he would answer every question correctly on that topic.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:17.160
So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work?

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.160
It was that primary education can happen on its own,

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
or parts of it can happen on its own.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.160
It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:36.160
It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.160
the second bit that I wanted to tell you,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.160
that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:48.160
The third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.160
I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.160
and asked them -- I gave them about 68 different

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.160
values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.160
We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:09.160
I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes --

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.160
so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.160
These were areas where the children were clearly confused,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.160
because half said yes and half said no.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.160
A typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies."

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.160
They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question;

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.160
perhaps none of us do.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
So I leave you with this third question.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.160
Can technology alter the acquisition of values?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.160
Finally, self-organizing systems,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.160
about which, again, I won't say too much

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.160
because you've been hearing all about it.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.160
Natural systems are all self-organizing:

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.160
galaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies --

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.160
except for the debate about an intelligent designer.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.160
But at this point in time, as far as science goes,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.160
it's self-organization.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.160
But other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:06.160
and disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.160
And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.160
So here are my four sentences then.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.160
Remoteness affects the quality of education.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:22.160
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.160
and other areas later.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:31.160
Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed --

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.160
the two opposing mechanisms.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.160
And learning is most likely a self-organizing system.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.160
If you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me --

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.160
it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:53.160
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic,

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:59.160
fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.160
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.160
PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology,

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.160
but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.160
We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.160
I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.160
and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.160
And such a set of specs should produce the technology

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.160
to address remoteness, values and violence.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:35.160
So I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it "outdoctrination."

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.160
And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.160
So I want to leave that as a thought with you.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.160
Thank you.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.160
(Applause)
