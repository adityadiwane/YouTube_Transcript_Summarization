00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
But before I do that,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
which require huge amounts of energy to create

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and, because of their disposal issues,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
are slowly poisoning our planet.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I also want to tell you and share with you

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
how my team and I

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
have been using mushrooms over the last three years.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Not like that. (Laughter)

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
which perform a lot like plastics during their use,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
but are made from crop waste

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and are totally compostable at the end of their lives.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
(Cheering)

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
But first,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
in the disposable plastics category.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
This is a material you all know is Styrofoam,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
In a single cubic foot of this material --

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
about what would come around your computer or large television --

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
you have the same energy content

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
of about a liter and a half of petrol.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Yet, after just a few weeks of use,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
you'll throw this material in the trash.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
And this isn't just found in packaging.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
in everything from building materials to surfboards

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
to coffee cups to table tops.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And that's not the only place it's found.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
The EPA estimates, in the United States,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
by volume, this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment --

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
on the side of the road or next to a river.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Perhaps even worse

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
is when it finds its way into our oceans, like in the great plastic gyre,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
where these materials are being mechanically broken

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
into smaller and smaller bits,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
but they're not really going away.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
They're not biologically compatible.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
They're basically fouling up

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And because these materials are so prolific,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
because they're found in so many places,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
there's one other place you'll find this material, styrene,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
which is made from benzene, a known carcinogen.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
You'll find it inside of you.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
So, for all these reasons,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
I think we need better materials,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
The first is feedstocks.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Today, we use a single feedstock, petroleum,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
to heat our homes, power our cars

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and make most of the materials you see around you.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
We recognize this is a finite resource,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
every time you get a package.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Second of all, we should really strive to use far less energy

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
in creating these materials.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
I say far less, because 10 percent isn't going to cut it.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
We should be talking about half, a quarter,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
one-tenth the energy content.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And lastly, and I think perhaps most importantly,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
we should be creating materials

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
that fit into what I call nature's recycling system.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
I fit into it, you fit into it,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and a hundred years tops, my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
is going to last for thousands of years.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
This is crazy.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
But nature provides us with a really good model here.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
When a tree's done using its leaves --

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
its solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices --

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
at the end of a season,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
it doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and have them melted down to form new leaves.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
It just drops them, the shortest distance possible,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
to the forest floor,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And this gets us back to the mushrooms.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
Because in nature,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
mushrooms are the recycling system.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And what we've discovered

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
is, by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen --

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
analogous to its root structure; it's called mycelium --

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
we can actually grow materials

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Now, mycelium is an amazing material,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
because it's a self-assembling material.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
It actually takes things we would consider waste --

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
things like seed husks or woody biomass --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and can transform them into a chitinous polymer,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
which you can form into almost any shape.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
In our process,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
we basically use it as a glue.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
And by using mycelium as a glue,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and you can create materials with many different properties,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
materials that are insulating, fire-resistant,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
moisture-resistant, vapor-resistant --

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
materials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
not petroleum.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And because they're made of natural materials,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
they are 100 percent compostable

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
in you own backyard.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
required to make these materials.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
The first is selecting a feedstock,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
preferably something that's regional, that's in your area, right --

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
local manufacturing.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
physically filling an enclosure, a mold,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
in whatever shape you want to get.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and that's where the magic happens,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
because the organism is doing the work in this process,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
not the equipment.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
The final step is, of course, the product,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
whether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Our vision is local manufacturing,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
like the local food movement, for production.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
So we've created formulations for all around the world

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
using regional byproducts.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
If you're in China, you might use a rice husk

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
or a cottonseed hull.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
If you're in Northern Europe or North America,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
We then process these husks with some basic equipment.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And I want to share with you a quick video from our facility

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas, in this case.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
It's a waste product.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
And what they're doing in our equipment

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
is going through a continuous system,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
which cleans, cooks, cools

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and pasteurizes these materials,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
This gives us a continuous stream of material

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
that we can put into almost any shape,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
though today we're making corner blocks.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
And it's when this lid goes on the part,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
that the magic really starts.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Because the manufacturing process is our organism.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
It'll actually begin to digest these wastes

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and, over the next five days,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
assemble them into biocomposites.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Our entire facility

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
sitting indoors in the dark, quietly self-assembling materials --

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and everything from building materials

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
to, in this case,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
a packaging corner block.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
So I've said a number of times that we grow materials.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
So my team has taken five days-worth of growth,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
a typical growth cycle for us,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
And I want you to really watch closely

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
these little white dots on the screen,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
because, over the five-day period,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
what they do is extend out and through this material,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
using the energy that's contained in these seed husks

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
to build this chitinous polymer matrix.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
This matrix self-assembles,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
growing through and around the particles,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
making millions and millions of tiny fibers.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
actually become part of the final, physical composite.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
So in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
But it's much faster than conventional farming.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
The last step, of course, is application.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
In this case, we've grown a corner block.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
A major Fortune 500 furniture maker

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
They used to use a plastic packaging buffer,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
with our grown material.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
Best of all, when it gets to the customer,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
it's not trash.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and it's going to improve the local soil.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
So, why mycelium?

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
The first reason is local open feedstocks.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
because you have multiple choices.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
The next is self-assembly,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
So you can have lots of small facilities

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
spread all across the world.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Biological yield is really important.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
And because 100 percent of what we put in the tool become the final product,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
even the parts that aren't digested

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
become part of the structure,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
we're getting incredible yield rates.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Natural polymers, well ... I think that's what's most important,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
because these polymers have been tried and tested

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
in our ecosystem for the last billion years,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And while, today,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
is going to be here in 10,000 years,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
what I want to guarantee

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
is that in 10,000 years,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
our descendants, our children's children,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
will be living happily and in harmony

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
with a healthy Earth.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
And I think that can be some really good news.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Thank you.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
(Applause)
