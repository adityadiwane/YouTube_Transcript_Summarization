00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:14.111
I have a question.

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:17.365
Can a computer write poetry?

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:21.036
This is a provocative question.

00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:23.433
You think about it for a minute,

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:26.047
and you suddenly have a bunch
of other questions like:

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.150
What is a computer?

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.285
What is poetry?

00:00:30.707 --> 00:00:32.396
What is creativity?

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.822
But these are questions

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:37.916
that people spend their entire
lifetime trying to answer,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.164
not in a single TED Talk.

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:42.633
So we're going to have to try
a different approach.

00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:44.800
So up here, we have two poems.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.115
One of them is written by a human,

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:50.241
and the other one's written by a computer.

00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:53.164
I'm going to ask you to tell me
which one's which.

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:55.014
Have a go:

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:59.094
Poem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, /
My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away.

00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:02.512
Am I not / A fly like thee? /
Or art not thou / A man like me?

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:05.835
Poem 2: We can feel / Activist
through your life's / morning /

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:10.106
Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Non
all the night to start a / great otherwise (...)

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.489
Alright, time's up.

00:01:11.513 --> 00:01:15.609
Hands up if you think Poem 1
was written by a human.

00:01:17.547 --> 00:01:19.037
OK, most of you.

00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:22.084
Hands up if you think Poem 2
was written by a human.

00:01:23.172 --> 00:01:24.362
Very brave of you,

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:29.140
because the first one was written
by the human poet William Blake.

00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:32.733
The second one was written by an algorithm

00:01:32.757 --> 00:01:36.449
that took all the language
from my Facebook feed on one day

00:01:36.473 --> 00:01:39.236
and then regenerated it algorithmically,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.850
according to methods that I'll describe
a little bit later on.

00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:45.622
So let's try another test.

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.491
Again, you haven't got ages to read this,

00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:50.127
so just trust your gut.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:54.196
Poem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks.
It is interesting / and fascinating

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.523
that a bird will fly and not / roar
or bark. Enthralling stories about animals

00:01:58.547 --> 00:02:02.607
are in my dreams and I will sing them all
if I / am not exhausted or weary.

00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:06.616
Poem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate
sodas! / You are really beautiful!

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.998
Pearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins!
All / the stuff they've always talked about (...)

00:02:11.022 --> 00:02:12.180
Alright, time's up.

00:02:12.204 --> 00:02:15.341
So if you think the first poem
was written by a human,

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:16.580
put your hand up.

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:18.841
OK.

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:21.540
And if you think the second poem
was written by a human,

00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:22.719
put your hand up.

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:27.589
We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here.

00:02:28.157 --> 00:02:29.593
It was much harder.

00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:31.329
The answer is,

00:02:31.353 --> 00:02:34.836
the first poem was generated
by an algorithm called Racter,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.862
that was created back in the 1970s,

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:41.075
and the second poem was written
by a guy called Frank O'Hara,

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.767
who happens to be
one of my favorite human poets.

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.689
(Laughter)

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:51.274
So what we've just done now
is a Turing test for poetry.

00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:56.565
The Turing test was first proposed
by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950,

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.153
in order to answer the question,

00:02:58.177 --> 00:02:59.814
can computers think?

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:03.015
Alan Turing believed that if
a computer was able

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.117
to have a to have a text-based
conversation with a human,

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:08.911
with such proficiency
such that the human couldn't tell

00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:11.901
whether they are talking
to a computer or a human,

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:14.781
then the computer can be said
to have intelligence.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.565
So in 2013, my friend
Benjamin Laird and I,

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.577
we created a Turing test
for poetry online.

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:22.878
It's called bot or not,

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.946
and you can go and play it for yourselves.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.221
But basically, it's the game
we just played.

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:28.773
You're presented with a poem,

00:03:28.797 --> 00:03:31.825
you don't know whether it was written
by a human or a computer

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.015
and you have to guess.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.230
So thousands and thousands
of people have taken this test online,

00:03:36.254 --> 00:03:37.703
so we have results.

00:03:37.727 --> 00:03:39.155
And what are the results?

00:03:39.704 --> 00:03:42.583
Well, Turing said that if a computer
could fool a human

00:03:42.607 --> 00:03:45.626
30 percent of the time
that it was a human,

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.047
then it passes the Turing test
for intelligence.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:51.063
We have poems on the bot or not database

00:03:51.087 --> 00:03:54.066
that have fooled 65 percent
of human readers into thinking

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.485
it was written by a human.

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.776
So, I think we have an answer
to our question.

00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:01.894
According to the logic of the Turing test,

00:04:01.918 --> 00:04:03.846
can a computer write poetry?

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.221
Well, yes, absolutely it can.

00:04:07.782 --> 00:04:10.128
But if you're feeling
a little bit uncomfortable

00:04:10.152 --> 00:04:12.079
with this answer, that's OK.

00:04:12.103 --> 00:04:14.419
If you're having a bunch
of gut reactions to it,

00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:17.648
that's also OK because
this isn't the end of the story.

00:04:18.594 --> 00:04:20.918
Let's play our third and final test.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.750
Again, you're going to have to read

00:04:23.774 --> 00:04:25.683
and tell me which you think is human.

00:04:25.707 --> 00:04:29.425
Poem 1: Red flags the reason
for pretty flags. / And ribbons.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.770
Ribbons of flags / And wearing material /
Reasons for wearing material. (...)

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:37.712
Poem 2: A wounded deer leaps
highest, / I've heard the daffodil

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:41.182
I've heard the flag to-day /
I've heard the hunter tell; /

00:04:41.206 --> 00:04:44.908
'Tis but the ecstasy of death, /
And then the brake is almost done (...)

00:04:44.932 --> 00:04:46.531
OK, time is up.

00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:50.392
So hands up if you think Poem 1
was written by a human.

00:04:51.973 --> 00:04:55.011
Hands up if you think Poem 2
was written by a human.

00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:57.366
Whoa, that's a lot more people.

00:04:58.327 --> 00:05:01.295
So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.312
was written by the very
human poet Gertrude Stein.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.138
And Poem 2 was generated
by an algorithm called RKCP.

00:05:11.162 --> 00:05:14.481
Now before we go on, let me describe
very quickly and simply,

00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:16.286
how RKCP works.

00:05:16.873 --> 00:05:20.723
So RKCP is an algorithm
designed by Ray Kurzweil,

00:05:20.747 --> 00:05:22.969
who's a director of engineering at Google

00:05:22.993 --> 00:05:25.353
and a firm believer
in artificial intelligence.

00:05:25.822 --> 00:05:29.813
So, you give RKCP a source text,

00:05:29.837 --> 00:05:34.306
it analyzes the source text in order
to find out how it uses language,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.278
and then it regenerates language

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:38.830
that emulates that first text.

00:05:38.854 --> 00:05:40.967
So in the poem we just saw before,

00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:43.616
Poem 2, the one that you all
thought was human,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.190
it was fed a bunch of poems

00:05:45.214 --> 00:05:47.249
by a poet called Emily Dickinson

00:05:47.273 --> 00:05:49.462
it looked at the way she used language,

00:05:49.486 --> 00:05:50.651
learned the model,

00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:54.933
and then it regenerated a model
according to that same structure.

00:05:56.732 --> 00:05:58.910
But the important thing to know about RKCP

00:05:58.934 --> 00:06:01.772
is that it doesn't know the meaning
of the words it's using.

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:04.635
The language is just raw material,

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.819
it could be Chinese,
it could be in Swedish,

00:06:06.843 --> 00:06:11.022
it could be the collected language
from your Facebook feed for one day.

00:06:11.046 --> 00:06:12.698
It's just raw material.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.077
And nevertheless, it's able
to create a poem

00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:19.428
that seems more human
than Gertrude Stein's poem,

00:06:19.452 --> 00:06:21.605
and Gertrude Stein is a human.

00:06:22.846 --> 00:06:26.918
So what we've done here is,
more or less, a reverse Turing test.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.119
So Gertrude Stein, who's a human,
is able to write a poem

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:36.881
that fools a majority
of human judges into thinking

00:06:36.905 --> 00:06:38.731
that it was written by a computer.

00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:43.317
Therefore, according to the logic
of the reverse Turing test,

00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:45.257
Gertrude Stein is a computer.

00:06:45.281 --> 00:06:46.743
(Laughter)

00:06:47.358 --> 00:06:48.652
Feeling confused?

00:06:49.193 --> 00:06:50.708
I think that's fair enough.

00:06:51.546 --> 00:06:55.662
So far we've had humans
that write like humans,

00:06:55.686 --> 00:06:58.797
we have computers that write
like computers,

00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:01.876
we have computers that write like humans,

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.532
but we also have,
perhaps most confusingly,

00:07:05.556 --> 00:07:07.931
humans that write like computers.

00:07:08.938 --> 00:07:10.704
So what do we take from all of this?

00:07:11.611 --> 00:07:14.768
Do we take that William Blake
is somehow more of a human

00:07:14.792 --> 00:07:16.041
than Gertrude Stein?

00:07:16.065 --> 00:07:19.111
Or that Gertrude Stein is more
of a computer than William Blake?

00:07:19.135 --> 00:07:20.687
(Laughter)

00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:23.034
These are questions
I've been asking myself

00:07:23.058 --> 00:07:24.523
for around two years now,

00:07:24.547 --> 00:07:26.856
and I don't have any answers.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.210
But what I do have are a bunch of insights

00:07:29.234 --> 00:07:31.768
about our relationship with technology.

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:36.608
So my first insight is that,
for some reason,

00:07:36.632 --> 00:07:39.743
we associate poetry with being human.

00:07:40.197 --> 00:07:43.912
So that when we ask,
"Can a computer write poetry?"

00:07:43.936 --> 00:07:45.129
we're also asking,

00:07:45.153 --> 00:07:46.951
"What does it mean to be human

00:07:46.975 --> 00:07:50.147
and how do we put boundaries
around this category?

00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:53.829
How do we say who or what
can be part of this category?"

00:07:54.376 --> 00:07:57.727
This is an essentially
philosophical question, I believe,

00:07:57.751 --> 00:07:59.980
and it can't be answered
with a yes or no test,

00:08:00.004 --> 00:08:01.331
like the Turing test.

00:08:01.805 --> 00:08:04.850
I also believe that Alan Turing
understood this,

00:08:04.874 --> 00:08:08.179
and that when he devised
his test back in 1950,

00:08:08.203 --> 00:08:11.005
he was doing it
as a philosophical provocation.

00:08:13.124 --> 00:08:18.665
So my second insight is that,
when we take the Turing test for poetry,

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:22.149
we're not really testing
the capacity of the computers

00:08:22.173 --> 00:08:25.066
because poetry-generating algorithms,

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.653
they're pretty simple and have existed,
more or less, since the 1950s.

00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:34.173
What we are doing with the Turing
test for poetry, rather,

00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:38.812
is collecting opinions about what
constitutes humanness.

00:08:40.313 --> 00:08:43.042
So, what I've figured out,

00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:46.038
we've seen this when earlier today,

00:08:46.062 --> 00:08:48.540
we say that William Blake
is more of a human

00:08:48.564 --> 00:08:50.129
than Gertrude Stein.

00:08:50.153 --> 00:08:52.615
Of course, this doesn't mean
that William Blake

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:54.467
was actually more human

00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:56.818
or that Gertrude Stein
was more of a computer.

00:08:57.533 --> 00:09:02.247
It simply means that the category
of the human is unstable.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.524
This has led me to understand

00:09:05.548 --> 00:09:08.311
that the human is not a cold, hard fact.

00:09:08.832 --> 00:09:11.964
Rather, it is something
that's constructed with our opinions

00:09:11.988 --> 00:09:14.843
and something that changes over time.

00:09:16.671 --> 00:09:21.150
So my final insight is that
the computer, more or less,

00:09:21.174 --> 00:09:25.180
works like a mirror
that reflects any idea of a human

00:09:25.204 --> 00:09:26.579
that we show it.

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.842
We show it Emily Dickinson,

00:09:28.866 --> 00:09:31.187
it gives Emily Dickinson back to us.

00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:33.602
We show it William Blake,

00:09:33.626 --> 00:09:35.911
that's what it reflects back to us.

00:09:35.935 --> 00:09:37.774
We show it Gertrude Stein,

00:09:37.798 --> 00:09:40.268
what we get back is Gertrude Stein.

00:09:41.083 --> 00:09:43.451
More than any other bit of technology,

00:09:43.475 --> 00:09:48.640
the computer is a mirror that reflects
any idea of the human we teach it.

00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:52.348
So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing

00:09:52.372 --> 00:09:55.234
a lot about artificial
intelligence recently.

00:09:56.694 --> 00:09:59.524
And much of the conversation is,

00:10:00.292 --> 00:10:01.481
can we build it?

00:10:02.383 --> 00:10:05.518
Can we build an intelligent computer?

00:10:05.542 --> 00:10:08.305
Can we build a creative computer?

00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:10.442
What we seem to be asking over and over

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:13.190
is can we build a human-like computer?

00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:15.517
But what we've seen just now

00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:18.629
is that the human
is not a scientific fact,

00:10:18.653 --> 00:10:22.183
that it's an ever-shifting,
concatenating idea

00:10:22.207 --> 00:10:24.738
and one that changes over time.

00:10:24.762 --> 00:10:27.914
So that when we begin
to grapple with the ideas

00:10:27.938 --> 00:10:30.324
of artificial intelligence in the future,

00:10:30.348 --> 00:10:32.253
we shouldn't only be asking ourselves,

00:10:32.277 --> 00:10:33.645
"Can we build it?"

00:10:33.669 --> 00:10:35.563
But we should also be asking ourselves,

00:10:35.587 --> 00:10:39.300
"What idea of the human
do we want to have reflected back to us?"

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.513
This is an essentially philosophical idea,

00:10:42.537 --> 00:10:45.534
and it's one that can't be answered
with software alone,

00:10:45.558 --> 00:10:50.535
but I think requires a moment
of species-wide, existential reflection.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.193
Thank you.

00:10:52.217 --> 00:10:54.912
