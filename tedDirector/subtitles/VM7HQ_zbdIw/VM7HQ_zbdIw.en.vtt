00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:27.325
In the 1980s, in communist
Eastern Germany,

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.523
if you owned a typewriter,

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:33.348
you had to register it
with the government.

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:38.836
You had to register a sample sheet of text
out of the typewriter.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.411
And this was done
so the government could track

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:44.180
where the text was coming from.

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:49.899
If they found a paper
which had the wrong kind of thought,

00:00:49.923 --> 00:00:53.067
they could track down
who created that thought.

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:55.963
And we in the West

00:00:57.154 --> 00:00:59.836
couldn't understand
how anybody would do this,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.037
how much this would restrict
freedom of speech.

00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:06.337
We would never do that
in our own countries.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:14.736
But today, in 2011, if you go
and buy a color laser printer

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.599
from any major laser printer manufacturer

00:01:18.623 --> 00:01:20.060
and print a page,

00:01:20.084 --> 00:01:21.836
that page will end up

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.080
having slight yellow dots
printed on every single page,

00:01:27.104 --> 00:01:32.547
in a pattern which makes the page unique
to you and to your printer.

00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:37.716
This is happening to us today.

00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:42.440
And nobody seems
to be making a fuss about it.

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:46.279
And this is an example

00:01:46.303 --> 00:01:53.155
of the ways our own governments
are using technology

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.233
against us, the citizens.

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.513
And this is one of the main three sources
of online problems today.

00:02:01.537 --> 00:02:04.527
If we look at what's really
happening in the online world,

00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:07.456
we can group the attacks
based on the attackers.

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:09.836
We have three main groups.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.299
We have online criminals.

00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:13.526
Like here, we have Mr. Dmitry Golubov,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.526
from the city of Kiev in Ukraine.

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.836
And the motives of online criminals
are very easy to understand.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.454
These guys make money.

00:02:22.478 --> 00:02:26.732
They use online attacks
to make lots of money --

00:02:26.756 --> 00:02:28.733
and lots and lots of it.

00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:34.142
We actually have several cases
of millionaires online, multimillionaires,

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:35.926
who made money with their attacks.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.452
Here's Vladimir Tsastsin,
from Tartu in Estonia.

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:41.271
This is [Albert] Gonzalez.

00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:43.070
This is Stephen Watt.

00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:44.892
This is Bjorn Sundin.

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:46.857
This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour

00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.193
and so on and so on.

00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:54.475
These guys make their fortunes online,

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:56.836
but they make it through the illegal means

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.555
of using things like banking Trojans

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.032
to steal money from our bank accounts
while we do online banking,

00:03:03.056 --> 00:03:05.306
or with keyloggers

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.588
to collect our credit card information

00:03:07.612 --> 00:03:11.173
while we are doing online shopping
from an infected computer.

00:03:11.197 --> 00:03:13.551
The US Secret Service,

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:16.597
two months ago,
froze the Swiss bank account

00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:19.202
of Mr. Sam Jain right here,

00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:22.938
and that bank account
had 14.9 million US dollars in it

00:03:22.962 --> 00:03:24.353
when it was frozen.

00:03:24.377 --> 00:03:27.614
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose;
nobody knows where he is.

00:03:28.637 --> 00:03:31.081
And I claim it's already today

00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:38.057
that it's more likely for any of us
to become the victim of a crime online

00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.451
than here in the real world.

00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:44.636
And it's very obvious
that this is only going to get worse.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.036
In the future, the majority of crime
will be happening online.

00:03:51.488 --> 00:03:54.836
The second major group of attackers
that we are watching today

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.119
are not motivated by money.

00:03:57.143 --> 00:03:59.246
They're motivated by something else --

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.247
motivated by protests,

00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:03.483
motivated by an opinion,

00:04:03.507 --> 00:04:05.678
motivated by the laughs.

00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:11.227
Groups like Anonymous
have risen up over the last 12 months

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:15.207
and have become a major player
in the field of online attacks.

00:04:16.287 --> 00:04:18.119
So those are the three main attackers:

00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:20.198
criminals who do it for the money,

00:04:20.222 --> 00:04:24.721
hacktivists like Anonymous
doing it for the protest,

00:04:24.745 --> 00:04:27.947
but then the last group
are nation states --

00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:30.010
governments doing the attacks.

00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:36.044
And then we look at cases
like what happened in DigiNotar.

00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:39.954
This is a prime example of what happens
when governments attack

00:04:39.978 --> 00:04:41.674
against their own citizens.

00:04:42.412 --> 00:04:47.399
DigiNotar is a certificate
authority from the Netherlands --

00:04:47.423 --> 00:04:48.999
or actually, it was.

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:54.245
It was running into bankruptcy last fall,

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:56.037
because they were hacked into.

00:04:56.061 --> 00:04:59.425
Somebody broke in
and they hacked it thoroughly.

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:03.166
And I asked last week,

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.313
in a meeting with Dutch
government representatives,

00:05:07.337 --> 00:05:11.031
I asked one of the leaders of the team

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.480
whether he found plausible
that people died

00:05:17.504 --> 00:05:19.288
because of the DigiNotar hack.

00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:23.887
And his answer was: yes.

00:05:26.073 --> 00:05:28.112
So how do people die

00:05:28.136 --> 00:05:29.842
as the result of a hack like this?

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:32.836
Well, DigiNotar is a CA.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.836
They sell certificates.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.466
What do you do with certificates?

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.032
Well, you need a certificate
if you have a website

00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:42.659
that has https, SSL encrypted services,

00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:46.474
services like Gmail.

00:05:47.363 --> 00:05:51.024
Now we all, or a big part of us,
use Gmail or one of their competitors,

00:05:51.048 --> 00:05:56.836
but these services are especially popular
in totalitarian states like Iran,

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.836
where dissidents
use foreign services like Gmail

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.051
because they know they are more
trustworthy than the local services

00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:07.836
and they are encrypted
over SSL connections,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.164
so the local government
can't snoop on their discussions.

00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:13.540
Except they can,

00:06:13.564 --> 00:06:17.415
if they hack into a foreign CA
and issue rogue certificates.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:21.300
And this is exactly what happened
with the case of DigiNotar.

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:27.101
What about Arab Spring

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:30.436
and things that have been happening,
for example, in Egypt?

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.803
Well, in Egypt,

00:06:31.827 --> 00:06:35.534
the rioters looted the headquarters
of the Egyptian secret police

00:06:35.558 --> 00:06:38.148
in April 2011,

00:06:38.172 --> 00:06:41.316
and when they were looting the building,
they found lots of papers.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.197
Among those papers
was this binder entitled, "FinFisher."

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:50.057
And within that binder were notes
from a company based in Germany,

00:06:50.081 --> 00:06:53.603
which had sold to the Egyptian government

00:06:53.627 --> 00:06:58.330
a set of tools for intercepting,
at a very large scale,

00:06:58.354 --> 00:07:01.405
all the communication
of the citizens of the country.

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:06.305
They had sold this tool for 280,000 euros
to the Egyptian government.

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:09.249
The company headquarters are right here.

00:07:09.273 --> 00:07:13.690
So Western governments are providing
totalitarian governments with tools

00:07:13.714 --> 00:07:15.962
to do this against their own citizens.

00:07:17.293 --> 00:07:20.270
But Western governments
are doing it to themselves as well.

00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:22.465
For example, in Germany,

00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:27.052
just a couple of weeks ago,
the so-called "State Trojan" was found,

00:07:27.076 --> 00:07:30.828
which was a Trojan used
by German government officials

00:07:30.852 --> 00:07:33.055
to investigate their own citizens.

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:36.783
If you are a suspect in a criminal case,

00:07:36.807 --> 00:07:39.332
well, it's pretty obvious,
your phone will be tapped.

00:07:39.356 --> 00:07:41.598
But today, it goes beyond that.

00:07:41.622 --> 00:07:43.541
They will tap your Internet connection.

00:07:43.565 --> 00:07:46.301
They will even use tools like State Trojan

00:07:46.325 --> 00:07:48.837
to infect your computer with a Trojan,

00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:53.227
which enables them
to watch all your communication,

00:07:53.251 --> 00:07:56.068
to listen to your online discussions,

00:07:56.092 --> 00:07:58.193
to collect your passwords.

00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:07.036
Now, when we think deeper
about things like these,

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.374
the obvious response
from people should be,

00:08:12.398 --> 00:08:16.640
"OK, well, that sounds bad,
but that doesn't really affect me,

00:08:16.664 --> 00:08:18.840
because I'm a legal citizen.

00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:21.587
Why should I worry?
Because I have nothing to hide."

00:08:23.373 --> 00:08:25.820
And this is an argument
which doesn't make sense.

00:08:27.237 --> 00:08:30.046
Privacy is implied.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.735
Privacy is not up for discussion.

00:08:34.538 --> 00:08:36.410
This is not a question

00:08:36.434 --> 00:08:40.983
between privacy

00:08:41.007 --> 00:08:42.697
against security.

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:47.284
It's a question of freedom

00:08:47.308 --> 00:08:48.749
against control.

00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:56.909
And while we might trust our governments
right now, right here in 2011,

00:08:56.933 --> 00:09:00.372
any rights we give away
will be given away for good.

00:09:00.396 --> 00:09:04.977
And do we trust, do we blindly trust,
any future government,

00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:08.285
a government we might have
50 years from now?

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.246
And these are the questions

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.483
that we have to worry about
for the next 50 years.
