00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The advances that have taken place in astronomy,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
cosmology and biology, in the last 10 years,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
are really extraordinary --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to the point where we know more about our universe and how it works

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
than many of you might imagine.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But there was something else that I've noticed

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
as those changes were taking place, as people were starting to find out that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
hmm ... yeah, there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The science writers and editors -- I shouldn't say science writers,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I should say people who write about science --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and editors would sit down over a couple of beers,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
after a hard day of work, and start talking about

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
which is ways the world could end very suddenly.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And that's what I want to talk about today. (Laughter)

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Ah, you laugh, you fools. (Laughter)

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
(Voice: Can we finish up a little early?)

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter) Yeah, we need the time!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Stephen Petranek: At first, it all seemed a little fantastical to me, but after challenging a lot of these ideas,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I began to take a lot of them seriously. And then September 11 happened,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and I thought, ah, God,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I can't go to the TED conference and talk about how the world is going to end.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Nobody wants to hear that. Not after this!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And that got me into a discussion with some other people, other scientists,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
about maybe some other subjects, and one of the guys I talked to,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
who was a neuroscientist, said,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
"You know, I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up,"

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So, we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and lo and behold, we found them.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Which leads me to a videotape of a President Bush

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
press conference from a couple of weeks ago.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Can we run that, Andrew?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
President George W. Bush: Whatever it costs to defend our security,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and whatever it costs to defend our freedom, we must pay it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
SP: I agree with the president.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
He wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a two-trillion-dollar federal budget, which will land us back into deficit spending real fast.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But terrorists aren't the only threat we face.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
There are really serious calamities staring us in the eye

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that we're in the same kind of denial about

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that we were about terrorism, and what could've happened on September 11.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I would propose, therefore, that if we took 10 billion dollars

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
from that 2.13 trillion dollar budget --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
which is two one hundredths of that budget --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I'm going to talk to you about, the vast majority could be solved,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and the rest we could deal with. So, I hope you find this both fascinating --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I'm fascinated by this kind of stuff, I gotta admit --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
to me these are Richard's cockroaches.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
But I also hope, because I think the people in this room can literally change the world,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I hope you take some of this stuff away with you,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and when you have an opportunity to be influential,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
that you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So let's start. Number 10: we lose the will to survive.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
We live in an incredible age of modern medicine.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
We are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
People around the world are getting better medicine --

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
but mentally, we're falling apart.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
The World Health Organization now estimates

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And the World Health Organization also says that depression is the

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Soon, genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
are going to allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
A female child born tomorrow, on average -- median -- will live to age 83.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Our life longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Now the problem with all of this, getting older,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
is that people over 65 are the most likely people to commit suicide.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So, what are the solutions?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
We don't really have mental health insurance in this country,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and it's -- (Applause) -- it's really a crime.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Something like 98 percent of all people with depression,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and I mean really severe depression

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
-- I have a friend with stunningly severe depression

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
-- this is a curable disease, with present medicine and present technology.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Pills alone don't do it, especially in clinically depressed people.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
You ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and put down your 10-dollar copay, and get treated,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
just like you do when you got a cut on your arm. It's ridiculous.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Secondly, drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
psychoactive drugs. We know that most mental illnesses have a biological

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
component that can be dealt with.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
did 10 years ago. We need a pump-push from the federal government,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
through NIH and National Science -- NSF --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and places like that to start helping the drug companies

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
develop some advanced psychoactive drugs.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Moving on. Number nine -- don't laugh -- aliens invade Earth.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Ten years ago, you couldn't have found an astronomer --

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
well, very few astronomers -- in the world who would've told you that

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
1995, we found three. The count now is up to 80 --

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
we're finding about two or three a month.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
All of the ones we've found, by the way, are in this little, teeny, tiny corner where we live,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
in the Milky Way. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and as Carl Sagan insisted for many years,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and was laughed at for it, there must be billions and billions in the universe.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
In a few years, NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
where there's less dust, and start looking for Earth-like planets,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
which we cannot see with present technology, nor detect.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and probably fairly close to us, is a fairly remote idea.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Remember, we've only been an advanced civilization --

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
an industrial civilization, if you would -- for 200 years.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Although every time I go to Pompeii, I'm amazed that they had

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
the equivalent of a McDonald's on every street corner, too.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So, I don't know how much civilization really has progressed since AD 79,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
but there's a great likelihood. I really believe this,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and I don't believe in aliens, and I don't believe there are any aliens on the Earth

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
or anything like that. But there's a likelihood that we will confront a

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
civilization that is more intelligent than our own.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Now, what will happen? What if they come to, you know,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
suck up our oceans for the hydrogen?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And swat us away like flies, the way we swat away flies when we go into

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
the rainforest and start logging it.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
We can look at our own history. The late physicist Gerard O'Neill said,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
"Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
even in those cases where every attempt was made

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
to protect and guard the primitive civilization."

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
If the aliens come visiting, we're the primitive civilization.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So, what are the solutions to this? (Laughter)

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Thank God you can all read!

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
It may seem ridiculous, but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and actually being prepared for them.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
How much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
to negotiate with an advanced species?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Secondly -- and you're going to hear more from me about this --

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
we have to become an outward-looking, space-faring nation.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
We have got to develop the

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
idea that the Earth doesn't last forever,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
our sun doesn't last forever.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
If we want humanity to last forever, we have to colonize the Milky Way.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
(Applause)

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
It'll also help us a lot, if we meet an advanced civilization along the way,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
if we're trying to be an advanced civilization. Number eight --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
(Voice: Steve, that's what I'm doing after TED.) (Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
SP: You've got it! You've got the job.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Number eight: the ecosystem collapses.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Last July, in Science, the journal Science,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
19 oceanographers published a very, very unusual article.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
It wasn't really a research report; it was a screed.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
They said, we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and we want to tell you they're not in trouble, they're near collapse.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real, real danger.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
by a factor of 10,000.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
We have lost 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
California is expected to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 years.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Somewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
You cut down that tree, the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
There's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And when that ecosystem collapses, it could take a major ecosystem with it,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000
like our atmosphere. So, what do we do about this? What are the solutions?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
There is some modeling of ecosystems going on now.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
The problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
that we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And with the kind of computing power we have now,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
there is, as I say, some of this going on, but it needs money.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
National Science Foundation needs to say -- you know,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
almost all the money that's spent on science in this country

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
comes from the federal government, one way or another.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And they get to prioritize, you know?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
There are people at the National Science Foundation

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
who get to say, this is the most important thing.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
This is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Secondly, we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and start moving them around.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
There's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the Georges Bank,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
or the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland. It's a no-take fishing zone.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
They can't fish there for a radius of 200 miles.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And an amazing thing has happened: almost all the fish have come back,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and they're reproducing like crazy. We're going to have to start doing this

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
around the globe. We're going to have to have no-take zones.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We're going to have to say, no more logging in the Amazon for 20 years.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Let it recover, before we start logging again.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
(Applause)

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Number seven: particle accelerator mishap.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
You all remember Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
One of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
A lot of very sober-minded physicists, believe it or not,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
have had exactly the same thought.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
This spring -- there's a collider at Brookhaven, on Long Island --

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
this spring, it's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
They are expecting to create little, tiny black holes.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000
They expect them to evaporate. (Laughter)

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I hope they're right. (Laughter)

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Other collider experiments -- there's one that's going to take place next summer

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
at CERN -- have the possibility of creating something called strangelets,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
which are kind of like antimatter. Whenever they hit other matter, they destroy it

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and obliterate it. Most physicists say that the accelerators we have now

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
are not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
that we need to worry about, and they're probably right.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
But, all around the world, in Japan, in Canada,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
there's talk about this, of reviving this in the United States.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
We shut one down that was going to be big.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
But there's talk of building very big accelerators.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
What can we do about this? What are the solutions?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
We've got the fox watching the henhouse here.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
We need to -- we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and what should be done in particle physics,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
but we need some outside thinking and watchdogging

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
of what's going on with these experiments.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Secondly, we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
We have an electromagnetic field around the Earth,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and it's constantly bombarded by high-energy particles, like protons.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And in my opinion, we don't spend enough time

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what's safe to do on Earth.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Number six: biotech disaster.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
It's one of my favorite ones, because we've done several stories on Bt corn.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Bt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
You may of heard of it -- heard it called StarLink,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
especially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
about a year and a half ago.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
This stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and it got into the human food supply, and somebody should've figured out

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
that it would get in the human food supply very easily.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
But the thing that's alarming is a couple of months ago, in Mexico,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
where Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Now, corn originated, we think, in Mexico.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
This is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
from biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world's food supply

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
in very short order.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So, what do we do about that?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
It's that simple. This is an amazingly unregulated field.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
When the StarLink disaster happened, there was a battle between the

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
EPA and the FDA over who really had authority, and over what parts of this,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
and they didn't get it straightened out for months. That's kind of crazy.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Number five, one of my favorites: reversal of the Earth's magnetic field.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Believe it or not, this happens every few hundred thousand years,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and has happened many times in our history.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
North Pole goes to the South, South Pole goes to the North, and vice versa.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
But what happens, as this occurs,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 years,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
that are to come streaming at us from the sun,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:57.000
that this field protects us from, are -- well, basically, we're gonna fry. (Laughter)

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
(Voice: Steve, I have some additional hats downstairs.)

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
SP: So, what can we do about this? Oh, by the way, we're overdue.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
It's been 780,000 years since this happened.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So, it should have happened about 480,000 years ago.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Oh, and here's one other thing.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
So, maybe we're in the throes of it.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
One of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
is that we have -- you know, we don't have good weather data from 60 years ago,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
much less data on things like the ozone layer.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
So, there's a fairly simple solution to this.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
There's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that's going to come online

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
in about six or seven years

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
that gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
You know, we can make ozone from car tailpipes.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
It's not hard: it's just three oxygen atoms.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
If you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
it would be the thickness of two pennies, at 14 pounds per square inch.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
You don't need that much up there.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
We need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth's ozone layer.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
(Applause)

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Number four: giant solar flares.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the Sun

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
that bombard the Earth with high-speed subatomic particles.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
So far, our atmosphere has done, and our magnetic field has done

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
pretty well protecting us from this.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Occasionally, we get a flare from the Sun that causes havoc

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
with communications and so forth, and electricity.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
But the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
stars that are similar to our Sun,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
and they've found that a number of them, when they're about the age of our Sun,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
brighten by a factor of as much as 20. Doesn't last for very long.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And they think these are super-flares, millions of times more powerful

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
than any flares we've had from our Sun so far.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Obviously, we don't want one of those. (Laughter)

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
There's a flip side to it. In studying stars

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
like our Sun, we've found that they go through periods of diminishment,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
when their total amount of energy that's expelled from them

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
goes down by maybe one percent.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
One percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it would cause one hell of an ice age here.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
So, what can we do about this?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
(Laughter) Start terraforming Mars. This is one of my favorite subjects.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I wrote a story about this in Life magazine in 1993.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
This is rocket science, but it's not hard rocket science.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Everything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
and to make a livable planet on Mars, is probably there.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And you just, literally, have to send little nuclear factories up there

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
The problem is it takes 300 years to terraform Mars, minimum.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Really more like 500 years to do it right.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
There's no reason why we shouldn't start now. (Laughter)

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Number three -- isn't this stuff cool? (Laughter)

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
A new global epidemic. People have been at war with germs

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
ever since there have been people,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
and from time to time, the germs sure get the upper hand.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
In 1918, we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed 20 million people.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
That was back when the population was around 100 million people.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
The bubonic plague in Europe, in the Middle Ages,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
killed one out of four Europeans.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
AIDS is coming back. Ebola seems to be rearing its head

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
with much too much frequency,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
We've all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
when an old disease rears its head, like anthrax.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000
The worst possibility is that a very simple germ, like staph,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
for which we have one antibiotic that still works, mutates.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And we know staph can do amazing things.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
A staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
when antibiotics come, and change and mutate.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
The danger is that some germ like staph will be --

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
will mutate into something that's really virulent, very contagious,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
and will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
That's happened before. About 12,000 years ago,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
there was a massive wave of mammal extinctions in the Americas,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
and that is thought to have been a virulent disease.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
So, what can we do about it?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
It is nuts. We give antibiotics -- (Applause) --

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
every cow, every lamb, every chicken, they get antibiotics every day, all.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
You know, you go to a restaurant, you eat fish, I got news for you,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
it's all farmed. You know, you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
cause they're not going to tell you. We're giving away the code.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
This is like being at war and giving somebody your secret code.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
We're telling the germs out there how to fight us.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
We gotta fix that. We gotta outlaw that right away.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Secondly, our public health system, as we saw with anthrax, is a real disaster.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
We have a real, major outbreak of disease in the United States,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
we are not prepared to cope with it.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Now, there is money in the federal budget, next year,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
to build up the public health service.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
But I don't think to any extent that it really needs to be done.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Number two -- my favorite -- we meet a rogue black hole.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
You know, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, really,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
you walk into an astronomy convention, and you say,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
"You know, there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy,"

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
and they're going to hoot you off the stage.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And now, if you went into one of those conventions and you said,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
"Well, I don't think black holes are out there," they'd hoot you off the stage.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Our comprehension of the way the universe works is really --

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
has just gained unbelievably in recent years.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000
We think that there are about 10 million dead stars in the Milky Way alone, our galaxy.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And these stars have compressed down to maybe something like 12, 15 miles wide,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
and they are black holes. And they are gobbling up everything around them,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
including light, which is why we can't see them.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Most of them should be in orbit around something.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
But galaxies are very violent places, and things can be spun out of orbit.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
And also, space is incredibly vast.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
So even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:39.000
But it only has to get close, about a billion miles away, one of these things.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
About a billion miles away, here's what happens to Earth's orbit:

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
it becomes elliptical instead of circular.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
And for three months out of the year,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
the surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
For three months out of the year, they go to 50 below zero.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
That won't work too well. What can we do about this?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:04.000
And this is my scariest. (Laughter)

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
I don't have a good answer for this one.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Again, we gotta think about being a colonizing race.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And finally, number one: biggest danger to life as we know it, I think,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
a really big asteroid heads for Earth.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
The important thing to remember here -- this is not a question of if,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
this is a question of when, and how big.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
In 1908, just a 200-foot piece of a comet

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
exploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
It had the effect of about 1,000 Hiroshima bombs.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000
In 1989, a large asteroid passed 400,000 miles away from Earth.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Nothing to worry about, right?

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:06.000
It passed directly through Earth's orbit. We were in that that spot six hours earlier.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
A small asteroid, say a half mile wide, would touch off firestorms

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up --

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Carl Sagan's nuclear winter thing.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
An asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
We think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Where are they? There's something called the Kuiper belt,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
which -- some people think Pluto's not a planet,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
that's where Pluto is, it's in the Kuiper belt.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
There's also something a little farther out, called the Oort cloud.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000
There are about 100,000 balls of ice and rock -- comets, really --

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
out there, that are 50 miles in diameter or more,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
and they regularly take a little spin,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
in towards the Sun and pass reasonably close to us.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Of more concern, I think, is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
The folks at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey told us last fall --

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
they're making the first map of the universe, three-dimensional map of the universe --

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
that there are probably 700,000 asteroids between Mars and Jupiter

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
that are a half a mile big or bigger.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
So you say, yeah, well, what are really the chances of this happening?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Andrew, can you put that chart up?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
This is a chart that Dr. Clark Chapman at the Southwest Research Institute

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
presented to Congress a few years ago.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
You'll notice that the chance of an asteroid-slash-comet impact killing you

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
is about one in 20,000, according to the work they've done.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Now look at the one right below that.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Passenger aircraft crash, one in 20,000.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
We spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don't die in airplane accidents,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:03.000
and we're not spending hardly anything on this. And yet, this is completely preventable.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
We finally have, just in the last year, the technology to stop this cold.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Could we have the solutions?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
NASA's spending three million dollars a year, three million bucks --

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
that is like pocket change -- to search for asteroids.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Because we can actually figure out every asteroid that's out there,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
and if it might hit Earth, and when it might hit Earth.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
And they're trying to do that.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
But it's going to take them 10 years, at spending three million dollars a year,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
and even then, they claim they'll only have about 80 percent of them catalogued.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Comets are a tougher act.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
We don't really have the technology to predict comet trajectories,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
or when one with our name on it might arrive.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
But we would have lots of time, if we see it coming.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
We really need a dedicated observatory.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
You'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
amateur astronomers? That's because nobody's looking for them, except amateurs.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
We need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Part two of the solutions: we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
or alter its trajectory. Now, a year ago, we did an amazing thing.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
We sent a probe out to this asteroid belt,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
called NEAR, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:20.000
And these guys orbited a 30 -- or no, about a 22-mile long asteroid called Eros.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
And then, of course, you know, they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
and then, at the last minute, they landed.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
When the mission was over, they actually landed on the thing.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
We have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid. It's not a big deal.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Now, the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
is that you don't have anything to push against in space, because there's no air.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
A nuclear explosion is just as hot,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
but we don't really have anything big enough to melt a 22-mile long asteroid,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
or vaporize it, would be more like it.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
But we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
which would gently, slowly, after a period of time, push it into a different trajectory,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
which, if we've done our math right, would keep it from hitting Earth.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
This is just a matter of finding 'em, going there, and doing something about it.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
I know your head is spinning from all this stuff.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Yikes! So many big threats!

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
The thing, I think, to remember, is September 11.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
We don't want to get caught flat-footed again.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
We know about this stuff.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Science has the power to predict the future in many cases now.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Knowledge is power.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
The worst thing we can do is say, jeez, I got enough to worry about

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
without worrying about an asteroid. (Laughter)

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
That's a mistake that could literally cost us our future.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Thank you.
