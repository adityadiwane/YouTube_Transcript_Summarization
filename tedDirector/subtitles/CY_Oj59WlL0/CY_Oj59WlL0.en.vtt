00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:19.370
So, embryonic stem cells

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.670
are really incredible cells.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.458
They are our body's own repair kits,

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.422
and they're pluripotent, which means they can morph into

00:00:28.422 --> 00:00:30.854
all of the cells in our bodies.

00:00:30.854 --> 00:00:33.542
Soon, we actually will be able to use stem cells

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:36.527
to replace cells that are damaged or diseased.

00:00:36.527 --> 00:00:38.958
But that's not what I want to talk to you about,

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.636
because right now there are some really

00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:45.582
extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells

00:00:45.582 --> 00:00:47.189
that are completely changing

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:50.088
the way we look and model disease,

00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:52.607
our ability to understand why we get sick,

00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:55.038
and even develop drugs.

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:59.351
I truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:03.856
our children to look at Alzheimer's and diabetes

00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:08.247
and other major diseases the way we view polio today,

00:01:08.247 --> 00:01:11.448
which is as a preventable disease.

00:01:11.448 --> 00:01:14.671
So here we have this incredible field, which has

00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:19.058
enormous hope for humanity,

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:22.578
but much like IVF over 35 years ago,

00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:24.912
until the birth of a healthy baby, Louise,

00:01:24.912 --> 00:01:29.981
this field has been under siege politically and financially.

00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:34.253
Critical research is being challenged instead of supported,

00:01:34.253 --> 00:01:38.613
and we saw that it was really essential to have

00:01:38.613 --> 00:01:42.144
private safe haven laboratories where this work

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:44.974
could be advanced without interference.

00:01:44.974 --> 00:01:47.505
And so, in 2005,

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:50.117
we started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory

00:01:50.117 --> 00:01:53.706
so that we would have a small organization that could

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:57.018
do this work and support it.

00:01:57.018 --> 00:02:00.403
What we saw very quickly is the world of both medical

00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:03.779
research, but also developing drugs and treatments,

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:07.492
is dominated by, as you would expect, large organizations,

00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:10.611
but in a new field, sometimes large organizations

00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:12.779
really have trouble getting out of their own way,

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.215
and sometimes they can't ask the right questions,

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:18.571
and there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.782
between academic research on the one hand

00:02:21.782 --> 00:02:24.483
and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs

00:02:24.483 --> 00:02:27.749
that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.139
and many of our treatments, and so we knew that

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.085
to really accelerate cures and therapies, we were going

00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:36.892
to have to address this with two things:

00:02:36.892 --> 00:02:40.114
new technologies and also a new research model.

00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:43.873
Because if you don't close that gap, you really are

00:02:43.873 --> 00:02:45.480
exactly where we are today.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.147
And that's what I want to focus on.

00:02:47.147 --> 00:02:50.697
We've spent the last couple of years pondering this,

00:02:50.697 --> 00:02:53.088
making a list of the different things that we had to do,

00:02:53.088 --> 00:02:55.719
and so we developed a new technology,

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:56.970
It's software and hardware,

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.473
that actually can generate thousands and thousands of

00:03:00.473 --> 00:03:03.643
genetically diverse stem cell lines to create

00:03:03.643 --> 00:03:07.430
a global array, essentially avatars of ourselves.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.864
And we did this because we think that it's actually going

00:03:10.864 --> 00:03:14.279
to allow us to realize the potential, the promise,

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.359
of all of the sequencing of the human genome,

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.863
but it's going to allow us, in doing that,

00:03:19.863 --> 00:03:24.871
to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells,

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:29.030
not animal cells, to generate drugs and treatments

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.279
that are much more effective, much safer,

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.535
much faster, and at a much lower cost.

00:03:35.535 --> 00:03:37.919
So let me put that in perspective for you

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.335
and give you some context.

00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:44.167
This is an extremely new field.

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:46.999
In 1998, human embryonic stem cells

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:50.511
were first identified, and just nine years later,

00:03:50.511 --> 00:03:54.816
a group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells

00:03:54.816 --> 00:03:58.011
and reprogram them with very powerful viruses

00:03:58.011 --> 00:04:02.253
to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell

00:04:02.253 --> 00:04:04.343
called an induced pluripotent stem cell,

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:07.351
or what we refer to as an IPS cell.

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:10.549
This was really an extraordinary advance, because

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.093
although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells,

00:04:13.093 --> 00:04:14.887
which still remain the gold standard,

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:18.357
they are terrific to use for modeling disease

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:21.087
and potentially for drug discovery.

00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:24.127
So a few months later, in 2008, one of our scientists

00:04:24.127 --> 00:04:27.327
built on that research. He took skin biopsies,

00:04:27.327 --> 00:04:29.355
this time from people who had a disease,

00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:32.269
ALS, or as you call it in the U.K., motor neuron disease.

00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:33.967
He turned them into the IPS cells

00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:36.653
that I've just told you about, and then he turned those

00:04:36.653 --> 00:04:39.357
IPS cells into the motor neurons that actually

00:04:39.357 --> 00:04:40.818
were dying in the disease.

00:04:40.818 --> 00:04:43.837
So basically what he did was to take a healthy cell

00:04:43.837 --> 00:04:45.551
and turn it into a sick cell,

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:49.109
and he recapitulated the disease over and over again

00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:52.469
in the dish, and this was extraordinary,

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.717
because it was the first time that we had a model

00:04:54.717 --> 00:04:58.905
of a disease from a living patient in living human cells.

00:04:58.905 --> 00:05:02.025
And as he watched the disease unfold, he was able

00:05:02.025 --> 00:05:05.036
to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying

00:05:05.036 --> 00:05:07.163
in the disease in a different way than the field

00:05:07.163 --> 00:05:09.657
had previously thought. There was another kind of cell

00:05:09.657 --> 00:05:11.858
that actually was sending out a toxin

00:05:11.858 --> 00:05:14.369
and contributing to the death of these motor neurons,

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:15.727
and you simply couldn't see it

00:05:15.727 --> 00:05:17.517
until you had the human model.

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:20.184
So you could really say that

00:05:20.184 --> 00:05:24.090
researchers trying to understand the cause of disease

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.242
without being able to have human stem cell models

00:05:28.242 --> 00:05:31.002
were much like investigators trying to figure out

00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:34.243
what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash

00:05:34.243 --> 00:05:38.240
without having a black box, or a flight recorder.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.842
They could hypothesize about what had gone wrong,

00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:43.954
but they really had no way of knowing what led

00:05:43.954 --> 00:05:46.126
to the terrible events.

00:05:46.126 --> 00:05:50.309
And stem cells really have given us the black box

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:54.277
for diseases, and it's an unprecedented window.

00:05:54.277 --> 00:05:57.522
It really is extraordinary, because you can recapitulate

00:05:57.522 --> 00:06:00.769
many, many diseases in a dish, you can see

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:04.305
what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation

00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:06.729
well before you would ever see

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.265
symptoms appear in a patient.

00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:11.788
And this opens up the ability,

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.602
which hopefully will become something that

00:06:14.602 --> 00:06:17.249
is routine in the near term,

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:21.395
of using human cells to test for drugs.

00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:26.859
Right now, the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic.

00:06:26.859 --> 00:06:30.177
To bring a successful drug to market, it takes, on average,

00:06:30.177 --> 00:06:32.363
13 years — that's one drug —

00:06:32.363 --> 00:06:35.751
with a sunk cost of 4 billion dollars,

00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:40.618
and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road

00:06:40.618 --> 00:06:42.866
are actually going to get there.

00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:44.991
You can't imagine other businesses

00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:46.440
that you would think of going into

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.195
that have these kind of numbers.

00:06:48.195 --> 00:06:49.997
It's a terrible business model.

00:06:49.997 --> 00:06:53.986
But it is really a worse social model because of

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:57.314
what's involved and the cost to all of us.

00:06:57.314 --> 00:07:01.066
So the way we develop drugs now

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:04.266
is by testing promising compounds on --

00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:06.146
We didn't have disease modeling with human cells,

00:07:06.146 --> 00:07:09.610
so we'd been testing them on cells of mice

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.277
or other creatures or cells that we engineer,

00:07:13.277 --> 00:07:16.338
but they don't have the characteristics of the diseases

00:07:16.338 --> 00:07:18.674
that we're actually trying to cure.

00:07:18.674 --> 00:07:21.720
You know, we're not mice, and you can't go into

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.138
a living person with an illness

00:07:24.138 --> 00:07:27.066
and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells

00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:29.355
and then start fooling around in a lab to test

00:07:29.355 --> 00:07:32.916
for, you know, a promising drug.

00:07:32.916 --> 00:07:36.501
But what you can do with human stem cells, now,

00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:40.838
is actually create avatars, and you can create the cells,

00:07:40.838 --> 00:07:42.805
whether it's the live motor neurons

00:07:42.805 --> 00:07:45.815
or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells

00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:49.924
or other kinds of cells, and you can test for drugs,

00:07:49.924 --> 00:07:53.049
promising compounds, on the actual cells

00:07:53.049 --> 00:07:56.680
that you're trying to affect, and this is now,

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.494
and it's absolutely extraordinary,

00:07:59.494 --> 00:08:02.650
and you're going to know at the beginning,

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.394
the very early stages of doing your assay development

00:08:06.394 --> 00:08:09.783
and your testing, you're not going to have to wait 13 years

00:08:09.783 --> 00:08:13.102
until you've brought a drug to market, only to find out

00:08:13.102 --> 00:08:18.158
that actually it doesn't work, or even worse, harms people.

00:08:18.158 --> 00:08:22.498
But it isn't really enough just to look at

00:08:22.498 --> 00:08:26.280
the cells from a few people or a small group of people,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.924
because we have to step back.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.775
We've got to look at the big picture.

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:32.911
Look around this room. We are all different,

00:08:32.911 --> 00:08:35.651
and a disease that I might have,

00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:38.528
if I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease,

00:08:38.528 --> 00:08:42.294
it probably would affect me differently than if

00:08:42.294 --> 00:08:43.935
one of you had that disease,

00:08:43.935 --> 00:08:48.280
and if we both had Parkinson's disease,

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.548
and we took the same medication,

00:08:50.548 --> 00:08:53.295
but we had different genetic makeup,

00:08:53.295 --> 00:08:55.580
we probably would have a different result,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.311
and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully

00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:02.890
for me was actually ineffective for you,

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:07.582
and similarly, it could be that a drug that is harmful for you

00:09:07.582 --> 00:09:11.884
is safe for me, and, you know, this seems totally obvious,

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:14.612
but unfortunately it is not the way

00:09:14.612 --> 00:09:17.798
that the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs

00:09:17.798 --> 00:09:21.784
because, until now, it hasn't had the tools.

00:09:21.784 --> 00:09:24.076
And so we need to move away

00:09:24.076 --> 00:09:27.030
from this one-size-fits-all model.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.207
The way we've been developing drugs is essentially

00:09:30.207 --> 00:09:31.586
like going into a shoe store,

00:09:31.586 --> 00:09:33.869
no one asks you what size you are, or

00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:36.079
if you're going dancing or hiking.

00:09:36.079 --> 00:09:38.887
They just say, "Well, you have feet, here are your shoes."

00:09:38.887 --> 00:09:42.487
It doesn't work with shoes, and our bodies are

00:09:42.487 --> 00:09:45.959
many times more complicated than just our feet.

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:48.500
So we really have to change this.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.684
There was a very sad example of this in the last decade.

00:09:53.684 --> 00:09:56.332
There's a wonderful drug, and a class of drugs actually,

00:09:56.332 --> 00:09:59.012
but the particular drug was Vioxx, and

00:09:59.012 --> 00:10:03.388
for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain,

00:10:03.388 --> 00:10:06.780
the drug was an absolute lifesaver,

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.860
but unfortunately, for another subset of those people,

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.629
they suffered pretty severe heart side effects,

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:19.357
and for a subset of those people, the side effects were

00:10:19.357 --> 00:10:23.254
so severe, the cardiac side effects, that they were fatal.

00:10:23.254 --> 00:10:27.296
But imagine a different scenario,

00:10:27.296 --> 00:10:31.598
where we could have had an array, a genetically diverse array,

00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:35.224
of cardiac cells, and we could have actually tested

00:10:35.224 --> 00:10:40.305
that drug, Vioxx, in petri dishes, and figured out,

00:10:40.305 --> 00:10:44.049
well, okay, people with this genetic type are going to have

00:10:44.049 --> 00:10:49.049
cardiac side effects, people with these genetic subgroups

00:10:49.049 --> 00:10:54.193
or genetic shoes sizes, about 25,000 of them,

00:10:54.193 --> 00:10:56.953
are not going to have any problems.

00:10:56.953 --> 00:10:59.568
The people for whom it was a lifesaver

00:10:59.568 --> 00:11:01.245
could have still taken their medicine.

00:11:01.245 --> 00:11:05.631
The people for whom it was a disaster, or fatal,

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:07.722
would never have been given it, and

00:11:07.722 --> 00:11:10.305
you can imagine a very different outcome for the company,

00:11:10.305 --> 00:11:13.073
who had to withdraw the drug.

00:11:13.073 --> 00:11:15.889
So that is terrific,

00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:17.723
and we thought, all right,

00:11:17.723 --> 00:11:20.482
as we're trying to solve this problem,

00:11:20.482 --> 00:11:22.679
clearly we have to think about genetics,

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:25.513
we have to think about human testing,

00:11:25.513 --> 00:11:27.092
but there's a fundamental problem,

00:11:27.092 --> 00:11:29.791
because right now, stem cell lines,

00:11:29.791 --> 00:11:31.501
as extraordinary as they are,

00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:33.245
and lines are just groups of cells,

00:11:33.245 --> 00:11:37.577
they are made by hand, one at a time,

00:11:37.577 --> 00:11:39.801
and it takes a couple of months.

00:11:39.801 --> 00:11:44.167
This is not scalable, and also when you do things by hand,

00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:45.710
even in the best laboratories,

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.871
you have variations in techniques,

00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:52.052
and you need to know, if you're making a drug,

00:11:52.052 --> 00:11:53.950
that the Aspirin you're going to take out of the bottle

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.390
on Monday is the same as the Aspirin

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.471
that's going to come out of the bottle on Wednesday.

00:11:58.471 --> 00:12:02.262
So we looked at this, and we thought, okay,

00:12:02.262 --> 00:12:05.414
artisanal is wonderful in, you know, your clothing

00:12:05.414 --> 00:12:08.358
and your bread and crafts, but

00:12:08.358 --> 00:12:11.341
artisanal really isn't going to work in stem cells,

00:12:11.341 --> 00:12:13.731
so we have to deal with this.

00:12:13.731 --> 00:12:17.651
But even with that, there still was another big hurdle,

00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:21.215
and that actually brings us back to

00:12:21.215 --> 00:12:23.599
the mapping of the human genome, because

00:12:23.599 --> 00:12:26.310
we're all different.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.142
We know from the sequencing of the human genome

00:12:29.142 --> 00:12:31.699
that it's shown us all of the A's, C's, G's and T's

00:12:31.699 --> 00:12:34.167
that make up our genetic code,

00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:38.436
but that code, by itself, our DNA,

00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:43.035
is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code

00:12:43.035 --> 00:12:45.860
without having a computer that can read it.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.148
It's like having an app without having a smartphone.

00:12:49.148 --> 00:12:53.032
We needed to have a way of bringing the biology

00:12:53.032 --> 00:12:55.241
to that incredible data,

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:58.356
and the way to do that was to find

00:12:58.356 --> 00:13:01.043
a stand-in, a biological stand-in,

00:13:01.043 --> 00:13:05.068
that could contain all of the genetic information,

00:13:05.068 --> 00:13:07.596
but have it be arrayed in such a way

00:13:07.596 --> 00:13:10.460
as it could be read together

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.716
and actually create this incredible avatar.

00:13:13.716 --> 00:13:17.420
We need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub-types

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.372
that represent who we are.

00:13:20.372 --> 00:13:23.132
So this is what we've built.

00:13:23.132 --> 00:13:26.452
It's an automated robotic technology.

00:13:26.452 --> 00:13:29.060
It has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.299
of stem cell lines. It's genetically arrayed.

00:13:33.299 --> 00:13:37.048
It has massively parallel processing capability,

00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:40.368
and it's going to change the way drugs are discovered,

00:13:40.368 --> 00:13:44.203
we hope, and I think eventually what's going to happen

00:13:44.203 --> 00:13:46.402
is that we're going to want to re-screen drugs,

00:13:46.402 --> 00:13:48.893
on arrays like this, that already exist,

00:13:48.893 --> 00:13:50.764
all of the drugs that currently exist,

00:13:50.764 --> 00:13:53.675
and in the future, you're going to be taking drugs

00:13:53.675 --> 00:13:56.547
and treatments that have been tested for side effects

00:13:56.547 --> 00:13:58.850
on all of the relevant cells,

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.003
on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells.

00:14:02.003 --> 00:14:05.332
It really has brought us to the threshold

00:14:05.332 --> 00:14:07.546
of personalized medicine.

00:14:07.546 --> 00:14:11.987
It's here now, and in our family,

00:14:11.987 --> 00:14:14.925
my son has type 1 diabetes,

00:14:14.925 --> 00:14:17.573
which is still an incurable disease,

00:14:17.573 --> 00:14:21.015
and I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer,

00:14:21.015 --> 00:14:24.748
but I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you,

00:14:24.748 --> 00:14:28.978
because probably a version of it is your story.

00:14:28.978 --> 00:14:32.922
At some point in our lives, all of us,

00:14:32.922 --> 00:14:35.658
or people we care about, become patients,

00:14:35.658 --> 00:14:38.267
and that's why I think that stem cell research

00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:41.650
is incredibly important for all of us.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.318
Thank you. (Applause)

00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:52.426
