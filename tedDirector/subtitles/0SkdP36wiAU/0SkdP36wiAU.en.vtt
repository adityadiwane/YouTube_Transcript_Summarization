00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:15.980
I am a computer science and engineering
professor here at Carnegie Mellon,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.228
and my research focuses on
usable privacy and security,

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:22.996
and so my friends like to give me examples

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:25.198
of their frustrations with computing systems,

00:00:25.198 --> 00:00:28.552
especially frustrations related to

00:00:28.552 --> 00:00:32.664
unusable privacy and security.

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:35.375
So passwords are something that I hear a lot about.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.255
A lot of people are frustrated with passwords,

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:39.949
and it's bad enough

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.593
when you have to have one really good password

00:00:42.593 --> 00:00:44.415
that you can remember

00:00:44.415 --> 00:00:47.309
but nobody else is going to be able to guess.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.946
But what do you do when you have accounts

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:50.754
on a hundred different systems

00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:53.030
and you're supposed to have a unique password

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.067
for each of these systems?

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:58.251
It's tough.

00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:00.010
At Carnegie Mellon, they used to make it

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.309
actually pretty easy for us

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.046
to remember our passwords.

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:05.449
The password requirement up through 2009

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.828
was just that you had to have a password

00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:10.039
with at least one character.

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.927
Pretty easy. But then they changed things,

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:15.597
and at the end of 2009, they announced

00:01:15.597 --> 00:01:17.973
that we were going to have a new policy,

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:19.836
and this new policy required

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:22.517
passwords that were at least eight characters long,

00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:24.292
with an uppercase letter, lowercase letter,

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:25.580
a digit, a symbol,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.218
you couldn't use the same
character more than three times,

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:30.652
and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary.

00:01:30.652 --> 00:01:32.834
Now, when they implemented this new policy,

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:35.144
a lot of people, my colleagues and friends,

00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:36.998
came up to me and they said, "Wow,

00:01:36.998 --> 00:01:38.510
now that's really unusable.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.703
Why are they doing this to us,

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:41.414
and why didn't you stop them?"

00:01:41.414 --> 00:01:42.770
And I said, "Well, you know what?

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.278
They didn't ask me."

00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:47.743
But I got curious, and I decided to go talk

00:01:47.743 --> 00:01:49.680
to the people in charge of our computer systems

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.511
and find out what led them to introduce

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:54.359
this new policy,

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.943
and they said that the university

00:01:55.943 --> 00:01:58.309
had joined a consortium of universities,

00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:00.943
and one of the requirements of membership

00:02:00.943 --> 00:02:03.191
was that we had to have stronger passwords

00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:05.463
that complied with some new requirements,

00:02:05.463 --> 00:02:07.567
and these requirements were that our passwords

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:09.171
had to have a lot of entropy.

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:11.449
Now entropy is a complicated term,

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.247
but basically it measures the strength of passwords.

00:02:14.247 --> 00:02:16.226
But the thing is, there isn't actually

00:02:16.226 --> 00:02:18.175
a standard measure of entropy.

00:02:18.175 --> 00:02:20.574
Now, the National Institute
of Standards and Technology

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:22.127
has a set of guidelines

00:02:22.127 --> 00:02:24.695
which have some rules of thumb

00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:26.135
for measuring entropy,

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:29.030
but they don't have anything too specific,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.367
and the reason they only have rules of thumb

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:34.503
is it turns out they don't actually have any good data

00:02:34.503 --> 00:02:36.023
on passwords.

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:38.335
In fact, their report states,

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:40.663
"Unfortunately, we do not have much data

00:02:40.663 --> 00:02:43.505
on the passwords users
choose under particular rules.

00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:45.838
NIST would like to obtain more data

00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:48.300
on the passwords users actually choose,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.763
but system administrators
are understandably reluctant

00:02:50.763 --> 00:02:53.703
to reveal password data to others."

00:02:53.703 --> 00:02:56.800
So this is a problem, but our research group

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.940
looked at it as an opportunity.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.040
We said, "Well, there's a need
for good password data.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.188
Maybe we can collect some good password data

00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:06.892
and actually advance the state of the art here.

00:03:06.892 --> 00:03:08.564
So the first thing we did is,

00:03:08.564 --> 00:03:10.120
we got a bag of candy bars

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.206
and we walked around campus

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:14.004
and talked to students, faculty and staff,

00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:15.534
and asked them for information

00:03:15.534 --> 00:03:17.086
about their passwords.

00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:20.090
Now we didn't say, "Give us your password."

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.751
No, we just asked them about their password.

00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:24.229
How long is it? Does it have a digit?

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:25.297
Does it have a symbol?

00:03:25.297 --> 00:03:27.342
And were you annoyed at having to create

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:30.086
a new one last week?

00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:33.292
So we got results from 470 students,

00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:34.263
faculty and staff,

00:03:34.263 --> 00:03:36.777
and indeed we confirmed that the new policy

00:03:36.777 --> 00:03:38.230
was very annoying,

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.022
but we also found that people said

00:03:40.022 --> 00:03:43.152
they felt more secure with these new passwords.

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:45.458
We found that most people knew

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:47.610
they were not supposed to
write their password down,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.001
and only 13 percent of them did,

00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:52.417
but disturbingly, 80 percent of people

00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:54.541
said they were reusing their password.

00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:56.337
Now, this is actually more dangerous

00:03:56.337 --> 00:03:58.359
than writing your password down,

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.920
because it makes you much
more susceptible to attackers.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.038
So if you have to, write your passwords down,

00:04:05.038 --> 00:04:06.837
but don't reuse them.

00:04:06.837 --> 00:04:08.588
We also found some interesting things

00:04:08.588 --> 00:04:11.549
about the symbols people use in passwords.

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.348
So CMU allows 32 possible symbols,

00:04:14.348 --> 00:04:16.781
but as you can see, there's only a small number

00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.583
that most people are using,

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:21.524
so we're not actually getting very much strength

00:04:21.524 --> 00:04:23.990
from the symbols in our passwords.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.701
So this was a really interesting study,

00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:29.165
and now we had data from 470 people,

00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:30.470
but in the scheme of things,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.050
that's really not very much password data,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.495
and so we looked around to see

00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:37.055
where could we find additional password data?

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:39.231
So it turns out there are a lot of people

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:41.433
going around stealing passwords,

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:43.910
and they often go and post these passwords

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.247
on the Internet.

00:04:45.247 --> 00:04:46.920
So we were able to get access

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.890
to some of these stolen password sets.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.218
This is still not really ideal for research, though,

00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:55.255
because it's not entirely clear

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:57.439
where all of these passwords came from,

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:59.681
or exactly what policies were in effect

00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:01.789
when people created these passwords.

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.341
So we wanted to find some better source of data.

00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:06.975
So we decided that one thing we could do

00:05:06.975 --> 00:05:09.104
is we could do a study and have people

00:05:09.104 --> 00:05:12.344
actually create passwords for our study.

00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:15.165
So we used a service called
Amazon Mechanical Turk,

00:05:15.165 --> 00:05:17.499
and this is a service where you can post

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:19.803
a small job online that takes a minute,

00:05:19.803 --> 00:05:21.303
a few minutes, an hour,

00:05:21.303 --> 00:05:23.887
and pay people, a penny, ten cents, a few dollars,

00:05:23.887 --> 00:05:25.233
to do a task for you,

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:27.355
and then you pay them through Amazon.com.

00:05:27.355 --> 00:05:29.649
So we paid people about 50 cents

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:32.245
to create a password following our rules

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:33.655
and answering a survey,

00:05:33.655 --> 00:05:36.180
and then we paid them again to come back

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.251
two days later and log in

00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:40.825
using their password and answering another survey.

00:05:40.825 --> 00:05:45.289
So we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords,

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.984
and we gave people a bunch of different policies

00:05:47.984 --> 00:05:49.492
to create passwords with.

00:05:49.492 --> 00:05:51.402
So some people had a pretty easy policy,

00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:52.941
we call it Basic8,

00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:55.087
and here the only rule was that your password

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:58.503
had to have at least eight characters.

00:05:58.503 --> 00:06:00.754
Then some people had a much harder policy,

00:06:00.754 --> 00:06:03.291
and this was very similar to the CMU policy,

00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:05.225
that it had to have eight characters

00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:07.601
including uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol,

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:09.990
and pass a dictionary check.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.325
And one of the other policies we tried,

00:06:11.325 --> 00:06:12.595
and there were a whole bunch more,

00:06:12.595 --> 00:06:14.835
but one of the ones we tried was called Basic16,

00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:17.467
and the only requirement here

00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:20.620
was that your password had
to have at least 16 characters.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.078
All right, so now we had 5,000 passwords,

00:06:23.078 --> 00:06:26.641
and so we had much more detailed information.

00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:29.200
Again we see that there's only a small number

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.115
of symbols that people are actually using

00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:33.001
in their passwords.

00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:35.600
We also wanted to get an idea of how strong

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.371
the passwords were that people were creating,

00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:40.991
but as you may recall, there isn't a good measure

00:06:40.991 --> 00:06:42.745
of password strength.

00:06:42.745 --> 00:06:45.057
So what we decided to do was to see

00:06:45.057 --> 00:06:47.427
how long it would take to crack these passwords

00:06:47.427 --> 00:06:48.841
using the best cracking tools

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.649
that the bad guys are using,

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:52.665
or that we could find information about

00:06:52.665 --> 00:06:54.202
in the research literature.

00:06:54.202 --> 00:06:56.960
So to give you an idea of how bad guys

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.130
go about cracking passwords,

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.081
they will steal a password file

00:07:01.081 --> 00:07:03.234
that will have all of the passwords

00:07:03.234 --> 00:07:06.123
in kind of a scrambled form, called a hash,

00:07:06.123 --> 00:07:08.685
and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess

00:07:08.685 --> 00:07:10.397
as to what a password is,

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:12.294
run it through a hashing function,

00:07:12.294 --> 00:07:14.059
and see whether it matches

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:18.009
the passwords they have on
their stolen password list.

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:21.114
So a dumb attacker will try every password in order.

00:07:21.114 --> 00:07:24.682
They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB,

00:07:24.682 --> 00:07:27.100
and this is going to take a really long time

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.626
before they get any passwords

00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:31.323
that people are really likely to actually have.

00:07:31.323 --> 00:07:33.506
A smart attacker, on the other hand,

00:07:33.506 --> 00:07:34.892
does something much more clever.

00:07:34.892 --> 00:07:36.718
They look at the passwords

00:07:36.718 --> 00:07:38.518
that are known to be popular

00:07:38.518 --> 00:07:40.245
from these stolen password sets,

00:07:40.245 --> 00:07:41.434
and they guess those first.

00:07:41.434 --> 00:07:43.568
So they're going to start by guessing "password,"

00:07:43.568 --> 00:07:46.319
and then they'll guess "I love you," and "monkey,"

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.902
and "12345678,"

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:50.214
because these are the passwords

00:07:50.214 --> 00:07:52.119
that are most likely for people to have.

00:07:52.119 --> 00:07:55.380
In fact, some of you probably have these passwords.

00:07:57.191 --> 00:07:58.489
So what we found

00:07:58.489 --> 00:08:01.895
by running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected

00:08:01.895 --> 00:08:06.001
through these tests to see how strong they were,

00:08:06.001 --> 00:08:08.753
we found that the long passwords

00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:10.033
were actually pretty strong,

00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:13.295
and the complex passwords were pretty strong too.

00:08:13.295 --> 00:08:15.737
However, when we looked at the survey data,

00:08:15.737 --> 00:08:18.761
we saw that people were really frustrated

00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:21.100
by the very complex passwords,

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.730
and the long passwords were a lot more usable,

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.055
and in some cases, they were actually

00:08:25.055 --> 00:08:27.963
even stronger than the complex passwords.

00:08:27.963 --> 00:08:29.132
So this suggests that,

00:08:29.132 --> 00:08:30.835
instead of telling people that they need

00:08:30.835 --> 00:08:32.357
to put all these symbols and numbers

00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:35.199
and crazy things into their passwords,

00:08:35.199 --> 00:08:37.221
we might be better off just telling people

00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:39.873
to have long passwords.

00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:41.665
Now here's the problem, though:

00:08:41.665 --> 00:08:43.920
Some people had long passwords

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.475
that actually weren't very strong.

00:08:45.475 --> 00:08:47.472
You can make long passwords

00:08:47.472 --> 00:08:49.028
that are still the sort of thing

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.770
that an attacker could easily guess.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.135
So we need to do more than
just say long passwords.

00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:56.071
There has to be some additional requirements,

00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:59.040
and some of our ongoing research is looking at

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.479
what additional requirements we should add

00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:03.583
to make for stronger passwords

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:05.895
that also are going to be easy for people

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:08.593
to remember and type.

00:09:08.593 --> 00:09:10.719
Another approach to getting people to have

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:12.976
stronger passwords is to use a password meter.

00:09:12.976 --> 00:09:14.361
Here are some examples.

00:09:14.361 --> 00:09:15.762
You may have seen these on the Internet

00:09:15.762 --> 00:09:18.819
when you were creating passwords.

00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:21.067
We decided to do a study to find out

00:09:21.067 --> 00:09:23.954
whether these password meters actually work.

00:09:23.954 --> 00:09:25.375
Do they actually help people

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:26.828
have stronger passwords,

00:09:26.828 --> 00:09:28.914
and if so, which ones are better?

00:09:28.914 --> 00:09:31.421
So we tested password meters that were

00:09:31.421 --> 00:09:33.519
different sizes, shapes, colors,

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:34.935
different words next to them,

00:09:34.935 --> 00:09:38.210
and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.792
As you type a better password,

00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:42.331
the bunny dances faster and faster.

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.860
So this was pretty fun.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.427
What we found

00:09:46.427 --> 00:09:49.999
was that password meters do work.

00:09:49.999 --> 00:09:51.800
(Laughter)

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.133
Most of the password meters were actually effective,

00:09:55.133 --> 00:09:57.654
and the dancing bunny was very effective too,

00:09:57.654 --> 00:10:00.535
but the password meters that were the most effective

00:10:00.535 --> 00:10:02.890
were the ones that made you work harder

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.870
before they gave you that thumbs up and said

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.247
you were doing a good job,

00:10:06.247 --> 00:10:07.759
and in fact we found that most

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:10.040
of the password meters on the Internet today

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.992
are too soft.

00:10:10.992 --> 00:10:13.195
They tell you you're doing a good job too early,

00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:15.124
and if they would just wait a little bit

00:10:15.124 --> 00:10:17.173
before giving you that positive feedback,

00:10:17.173 --> 00:10:20.333
you probably would have better passwords.

00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:24.180
Now another approach to better passwords, perhaps,

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.070
is to use pass phrases instead of passwords.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.488
So this was an xkcd cartoon 
from a couple of years ago,

00:10:30.488 --> 00:10:32.162
and the cartoonist suggests

00:10:32.162 --> 00:10:34.358
that we should all use pass phrases,

00:10:34.358 --> 00:10:37.528
and if you look at the second row of this cartoon,

00:10:37.528 --> 00:10:39.385
you can see the cartoonist is suggesting

00:10:39.385 --> 00:10:42.826
that the pass phrase "correct horse battery staple"

00:10:42.826 --> 00:10:45.307
would be a very strong pass phrase

00:10:45.307 --> 00:10:47.223
and something really easy to remember.

00:10:47.223 --> 00:10:50.020
He says, in fact, you've already remembered it.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.170
And so we decided to do a research study

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.762
to find out whether this was true or not.

00:10:54.762 --> 00:10:56.537
In fact, everybody who I talk to,

00:10:56.537 --> 00:10:58.579
who I mention I'm doing password research,

00:10:58.579 --> 00:10:59.979
they point out this cartoon.

00:10:59.979 --> 00:11:01.553
"Oh, have you seen it? That xkcd.

00:11:01.553 --> 00:11:03.155
Correct horse battery staple."

00:11:03.155 --> 00:11:04.961
So we did the research study to see

00:11:04.961 --> 00:11:07.320
what would actually happen.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.380
So in our study, we used Mechanical Turk again,

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.547
and we had the computer pick the random words

00:11:14.547 --> 00:11:15.647
in the pass phrase.

00:11:15.647 --> 00:11:16.800
Now the reason we did this

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.386
is that humans are not very good

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.770
at picking random words.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.032
If we asked a human to do it,

00:11:21.032 --> 00:11:24.030
they would pick things that were not very random.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.062
So we tried a few different conditions.

00:11:26.062 --> 00:11:28.152
In one condition, the computer picked

00:11:28.152 --> 00:11:30.368
from a dictionary of the very common words

00:11:30.368 --> 00:11:31.730
in the English language,

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.494
and so you'd get pass phrases like

00:11:33.494 --> 00:11:35.418
"try there three come."

00:11:35.418 --> 00:11:37.150
And we looked at that, and we said,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.200
"Well, that doesn't really seem very memorable."

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.440
So then we tried picking words

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.961
that came from specific parts of speech,

00:11:44.961 --> 00:11:47.143
so how about noun-verb-adjective-noun.

00:11:47.143 --> 00:11:49.720
That comes up with something
that's sort of sentence-like.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.790
So you can get a pass phrase like

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.098
"plan builds sure power"

00:11:53.098 --> 00:11:55.884
or "end determines red drug."

00:11:55.884 --> 00:11:58.560
And these seemed a little bit more memorable,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.382
and maybe people would like those a little bit better.

00:12:01.382 --> 00:12:03.954
We wanted to compare them with passwords,

00:12:03.954 --> 00:12:07.150
and so we had the computer
pick random passwords,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.140
and these were nice and short, but as you can see,

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.946
they don't really look very memorable.

00:12:11.946 --> 00:12:13.342
And then we decided to try something called

00:12:13.342 --> 00:12:14.988
a pronounceable password.

00:12:14.988 --> 00:12:17.233
So here the computer picks random syllables

00:12:17.233 --> 00:12:18.367
and puts them together

00:12:18.367 --> 00:12:20.842
so you have something sort of pronounceable,

00:12:20.842 --> 00:12:23.444
like "tufritvi" and "vadasabi."

00:12:23.444 --> 00:12:25.591
That one kind of rolls off your tongue.

00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.807
So these were random passwords that were

00:12:27.807 --> 00:12:30.551
generated by our computer.

00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:33.529
So what we found in this study was that, surprisingly,

00:12:33.529 --> 00:12:37.297
pass phrases were not actually all that good.

00:12:37.297 --> 00:12:40.090
People were not really better at remembering

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.043
the pass phrases than these random passwords,

00:12:43.043 --> 00:12:45.797
and because the pass phrases are longer,

00:12:45.797 --> 00:12:47.023
they took longer to type

00:12:47.023 --> 00:12:50.033
and people made more errors while typing them in.

00:12:50.033 --> 00:12:53.260
So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.605
Sorry, all of you xkcd fans.

00:12:56.605 --> 00:12:58.497
On the other hand, we did find

00:12:58.497 --> 00:13:00.301
that pronounceable passwords

00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:01.772
worked surprisingly well,

00:13:01.772 --> 00:13:04.190
and so we actually are doing some more research

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.385
to see if we can make that
approach work even better.

00:13:07.385 --> 00:13:09.197
So one of the problems

00:13:09.197 --> 00:13:10.820
with some of the studies that we've done

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.503
is that because they're all done

00:13:12.503 --> 00:13:14.093
using Mechanical Turk,

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:15.905
these are not people's real passwords.

00:13:15.905 --> 00:13:18.010
They're the passwords that they created

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.505
or the computer created for them for our study.

00:13:20.505 --> 00:13:22.073
And we wanted to know whether people

00:13:22.073 --> 00:13:24.385
would actually behave the same way

00:13:24.385 --> 00:13:26.612
with their real passwords.

00:13:26.612 --> 00:13:30.293
So we talked to the information
security office at Carnegie Mellon

00:13:30.293 --> 00:13:34.096
and asked them if we could
have everybody's real passwords.

00:13:34.096 --> 00:13:35.850
Not surprisingly, they were a little bit reluctant

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.400
to share them with us,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.210
but we were actually able to work out

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:40.250
a system with them

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.359
where they put all of the real passwords

00:13:42.359 --> 00:13:45.450
for 25,000 CMU students, faculty and staff,

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.898
into a locked computer in a locked room,

00:13:47.898 --> 00:13:49.292
not connected to the Internet,

00:13:49.292 --> 00:13:51.140
and they ran code on it that we wrote

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.292
to analyze these passwords.

00:13:53.292 --> 00:13:54.618
They audited our code.

00:13:54.618 --> 00:13:55.930
They ran the code.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.668
And so we never actually saw

00:13:57.668 --> 00:14:00.485
anybody's password.

00:14:00.485 --> 00:14:02.000
We got some interesting results,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.696
and those of you Tepper students in the back

00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:06.571
will be very interested in this.

00:14:06.571 --> 00:14:10.302
So we found that the passwords created

00:14:10.302 --> 00:14:12.460
by people affiliated with the
school of computer science

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.784
were actually 1.8 times stronger

00:14:14.784 --> 00:14:18.522
than those affiliated with the business school.

00:14:18.522 --> 00:14:20.562
We have lots of other really interesting

00:14:20.562 --> 00:14:22.800
demographic information as well.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.646
The other interesting thing that we found

00:14:24.646 --> 00:14:27.086
is that when we compared
the Carnegie Mellon passwords

00:14:27.086 --> 00:14:29.369
to the Mechanical Turk-generated passwords,

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.988
there was actually a lot of similarities,

00:14:31.988 --> 00:14:33.936
and so this helped validate our research method

00:14:33.936 --> 00:14:36.446
and show that actually, collecting passwords

00:14:36.446 --> 00:14:38.254
using these Mechanical Turk studies

00:14:38.254 --> 00:14:41.042
is actually a valid way to study passwords.

00:14:41.042 --> 00:14:43.327
So that was good news.

00:14:43.327 --> 00:14:45.741
Okay, I want to close by talking about

00:14:45.741 --> 00:14:47.809
some insights I gained while on sabbatical

00:14:47.809 --> 00:14:51.010
last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.291
One of the things that I did

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:53.815
is I made a number of quilts,

00:14:53.815 --> 00:14:55.363
and I made this quilt here.

00:14:55.363 --> 00:14:57.262
It's called "Security Blanket."

00:14:57.262 --> 00:14:59.693
(Laughter)

00:14:59.693 --> 00:15:02.788
And this quilt has the 1,000

00:15:02.788 --> 00:15:05.116
most frequent passwords stolen

00:15:05.116 --> 00:15:07.687
from the RockYou website.

00:15:07.687 --> 00:15:09.748
And the size of the passwords is proportional

00:15:09.748 --> 00:15:11.649
to how frequently they appeared

00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:13.897
in the stolen dataset.

00:15:13.897 --> 00:15:16.529
And what I did is I created this word cloud,

00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:18.661
and I went through all 1,000 words,

00:15:18.661 --> 00:15:20.456
and I categorized them into

00:15:20.456 --> 00:15:22.836
loose thematic categories.

00:15:22.836 --> 00:15:24.739
And it was, in some cases,

00:15:24.739 --> 00:15:26.777
it was kind of difficult to figure out

00:15:26.777 --> 00:15:28.532
what category they should be in,

00:15:28.532 --> 00:15:30.431
and then I color-coded them.

00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:33.050
So here are some examples of the difficulty.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.231
So "justin."

00:15:34.231 --> 00:15:36.060
Is that the name of the user,

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.382
their boyfriend, their son?

00:15:37.382 --> 00:15:40.270
Maybe they're a Justin Bieber fan.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.495
Or "princess."

00:15:42.495 --> 00:15:44.130
Is that a nickname?

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.725
Are they Disney princess fans?

00:15:45.725 --> 00:15:49.419
Or maybe that's the name of their cat.

00:15:49.419 --> 00:15:51.074
"Iloveyou" appears many times

00:15:51.074 --> 00:15:52.619
in many different languages.

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:56.354
There's a lot of love in these passwords.

00:15:56.354 --> 00:15:58.034
If you look carefully, you'll see there's also

00:15:58.034 --> 00:16:00.301
some profanity,

00:16:00.301 --> 00:16:02.251
but it was really interesting to me to see

00:16:02.251 --> 00:16:04.558
that there's a lot more love than hate

00:16:04.558 --> 00:16:06.850
in these passwords.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.340
And there are animals,

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.700
a lot of animals,

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.004
and "monkey" is the most common animal

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:15.679
and the 14th most popular password overall.

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:17.910
And this was really curious to me,

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.433
and I wondered, "Why are monkeys so popular?"

00:16:20.433 --> 00:16:23.785
And so in our last password study,

00:16:23.785 --> 00:16:25.471
any time we detected somebody

00:16:25.471 --> 00:16:28.120
creating a password with the word "monkey" in it,

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.150
we asked them why they had
a monkey in their password.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.060
And what we found out --

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.163
we found 17 people so far, I think,

00:16:35.163 --> 00:16:36.446
who have the word "monkey" --

00:16:36.446 --> 00:16:38.258
We found out about a third of them said

00:16:38.258 --> 00:16:39.998
they have a pet named "monkey"

00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:42.289
or a friend whose nickname is "monkey,"

00:16:42.289 --> 00:16:43.949
and about a third of them said

00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:45.482
that they just like monkeys

00:16:45.482 --> 00:16:47.120
and monkeys are really cute.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.759
And that guy is really cute.

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:54.167
So it seems that at the end of the day,

00:16:54.167 --> 00:16:55.950
when we make passwords,

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.924
we either make something that's really easy

00:16:57.924 --> 00:17:00.933
to type, a common pattern,

00:17:00.933 --> 00:17:03.419
or things that remind us of the word password

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:06.731
or the account that we've created the password for,

00:17:06.731 --> 00:17:09.348
or whatever.

00:17:09.348 --> 00:17:11.990
Or we think about things that make us happy,

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.294
and we create our password

00:17:13.294 --> 00:17:15.532
based on things that make us happy.

00:17:15.532 --> 00:17:18.395
And while this makes typing

00:17:18.395 --> 00:17:21.265
and remembering your password more fun,

00:17:21.265 --> 00:17:23.072
it also makes it a lot easier

00:17:23.072 --> 00:17:24.578
to guess your password.

00:17:24.578 --> 00:17:26.326
So I know a lot of these TED Talks

00:17:26.326 --> 00:17:27.960
are inspirational

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.421
and they make you think about nice, happy things,

00:17:30.421 --> 00:17:32.318
but when you're creating your password,

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:34.309
try to think about something else.

00:17:34.309 --> 00:17:35.416
Thank you.

00:17:35.416 --> 00:17:35.969
(Applause)
