00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.330
Everybody in our society's life is touched by cancer --

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
if not personally,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.330
then through a loved one, a family member,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
colleague, friend.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
And once our lives are touched by cancer,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
we quickly learn

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
that there are basically

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
three weapons, or three tools, that are available

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
to fight the disease:

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
And once we get involved

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
in the therapeutic decisions,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
again either personally

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
or with our loved ones and family members,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
we also very quickly learn

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
the benefits, the trade-offs and the limitations

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
of these tools.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
I'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
and the TEDMED team

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
for inviting me today

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
to describe a fourth tool, a new tool,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
that we call Tumor Treating Fields.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
Tumor Treating Fields

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
And they use low-intensity

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
electric fields

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
to fight cancer.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
To understand how Tumor Treating Fields work,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
we first need to understand

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
what are electric fields.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
Let me first address

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
a few popular misconceptions.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
First of all, electric fields

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
are not an electric current

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
that is coursing through the tissue.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
Electric fields

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
are not ionizing radiation,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
like X-rays or proton beams,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
that bombard tissue

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
to disrupt DNA.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
And electric fields

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
are not magnetism.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
What electric fields are

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
are a field of forces.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
And these forces

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
act on, attract, bodies

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
that have an electrical charge.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
The best way to visualize an electric field

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
is to think of gravity.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Gravity is also a field of forces

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
that act on masses.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
We can all picture astronauts in space.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
They float freely in three dimensions

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
without any forces acting on them.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
But as that space shuttle

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
returns to Earth,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
they begin to see the effects of gravity.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
They begin to be attracted towards Earth.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
And as they land,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
they're fully aligned in the gravitational field.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
We're, of course, all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
That's why you're all in your chairs.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
And that's why we have to use our muscle energy

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
to stand up, to walk around

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
and to lift things.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
In cancer,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
cells rapidly divide

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
We can think of a cell

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
from an electrical perspective

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
as if it's a mini space station.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
And in that space station

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
we have the genetic material, the chromosomes,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
within a nucleus.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
And out in the cytoplasmic soup

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
we have special proteins

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
that are required for cell division

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
that float freely in this soup

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
in three dimensions.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
Importantly, those special proteins

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
are among the most highly charged objects

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
in our body.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
As cell division begins

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
the nucleus disintegrates,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
the chromosomes line up

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
in the middle of the cell

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
and those special proteins

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.330
undergo a three-dimensional sequence

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
whereby they attach

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330
and they literally click into place end-on-end

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
to form chains.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
These chains

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
then progress and attach

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
to the genetic material

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
and pull the genetic material

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
from one cell into two cells.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
And this is exactly how

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
two cancer cells become four cancer cells,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
and we have ultimately

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
uncontrolled tumor growth.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
Tumor Treating Fields

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.330
use externally placed transducers

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
attached to a field generator

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.330
to create an artificial electric field

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
on that space station.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
And when that cellular space station

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
is within the electric field,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.330
it acts on those highly charged proteins

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
and aligns them.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
And it prevents them from forming those chains,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
those mitotic spindles,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.330
that are necessary to pull the genetic material

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
into the daughter cells.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
What we see is that the cells will attempt to divide

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
for several hours.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
And they will either enter into

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
this so-called cellular suicide,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
programmed cell death,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
or they will form unhealthy daughter cells

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
and enter into apoptosis

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
once they have divided.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
And we can observe this.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
What I'm going to show you next

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
are two in vitro experiments.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
This is cultures, identical cultures,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
of cervical cancer cells.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
And we've stained these cultures

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
with a green florescent dye

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
so that we can look at these proteins

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
that form these chains.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
The first clip shows

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.330
a normal cell division

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
without the Tumor Treating Fields.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
What we see

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
are, first of all, a very active culture,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
a lot of divisions,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
and then very clear nuclei

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
once the cells have separated.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
And we can see them dividing throughout.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
When we apply the fields --

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
again, in the identical time-scale

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
to the identical culture --

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
you're going to see something different.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
The cells round up for division,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
but they're very static in that position.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
We'll see two cells

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.330
in the upper part of the screen

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
attempting to divide.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
The one within the circle manages.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
But see how much of the protein

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
is still throughout the nucleus,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
even in the dividing cell.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
The one up there can't divide at all.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
And then this bubbling, this membrane bubbling,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
is the hallmark

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
of apoptosis in this cell.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.330
Formation of healthy mitotic spindles

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
is necessary for division

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
in all cell types.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
We've applied Tumor Treating Fields

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
to over 20 different cancers in the lab,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
and we see this effect

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
in all of them.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
Now importantly,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
these Tumor Treating Fields have no effect

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
on normal undividing cells.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
10 years ago,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
to develop his discovery

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
into a practical therapy for patients.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.330
In that time, Novocure's developed two systems --

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
one system for cancers in the head

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
The first cancer that we have focused on

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
is the deadly brain cancer, GBM.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
GBM affects about 10,000 people

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
in the U.S. each year.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
It's a death sentence.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
The expected five year survival

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.330
is less than five percent.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.330
And the typical patient

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
with optimal therapy

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
survives just a little over a year,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
and only about seven months

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
from the time that the cancer is first treated

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
and then comes back and starts growing again.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
Novocure conducted

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
its first phase three randomized trial

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
in patients with recurrent GBM.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
So these are patients

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.330
who had received surgery,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
high dose radiation to the head

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
and first-line chemotherapy,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
and that had failed and their tumors had grown back.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.330
We divided the patients into two groups.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
The first group received second-line chemotherapy,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
which is expected to double the life expectancy,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
versus no treatment at all.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.330
And then the second group

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
received only Tumor Treating Field therapy.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
What we saw in that trial

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.330
is that that the life expectancies of both groups --

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
so the chemotherapy treated group

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
and the Tumor Treating Field group --

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
was the same.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
But importantly,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
the Tumor Treating Field group

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
suffered none of the side effects

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
typical of chemotherapy patients.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
They had no pain,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
suffered none of the infections.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
They had no nausea, diarrhea,

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.330
constipation, fatigue

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
that would be expected.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
Based on this trial,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
in April of this year,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.330
the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
for the treatment of patients

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
with recurrent GBM.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
Importantly, it was the first time ever

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
that the FDA included

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.330
in their approval of an oncology treatment

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
a quality of life claim.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
So I'm going to show you now

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
one of the patients

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
from this trial.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
Robert Dill-Bundi

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
is a famous Swiss cycling champion.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
He won the gold medal in Moscow

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.330
in the 4,000 meter pursuit.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.330
And five years ago,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
Robert was diagnosed with GBM.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
He received the standard treatments.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
He received surgery.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
He received high dose radiation to the head.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
And he received first-line chemotherapy.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
A year after this treatment --

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
in fact, this is his baseline MRI.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
You can see that the black regions

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
in the upper right quadrant

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
are the areas where he had surgery.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
And a year after that treatment,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
his tumor grew back with a vengeance.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
That cloudy white mass that you see

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.330
is the recurrence of the tumor.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
At this point, he was told by his doctors

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
that he had about 3 months to live.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
He entered our trial.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.330
And here we can see him getting the therapy.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.330
First of all, these electrodes are noninvasive.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
They're attached to the skin

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
in the area of the tumor.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
Here you can see

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
that a technician is placing them on there much like bandages.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
The patients learn to do this themselves

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
And then the patients

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
can undergo all the activities of their daily life.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
There's none of the tiredness.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.330
There's none of what is called the "chemo head."

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
There's no sensation.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
It doesn't interfere

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
with computers or electrical equipment.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
And the therapy is delivered continuously

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
at home,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
without having to go into the hospital

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330
either periodically or continually.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
These are Robert's MRIs,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.330
again, under only TTField treatment.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
This is a therapy that takes time to work.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
It's a medical device;

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.330
it works when it's on.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
But what we can see is, by month six,

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
the tumor has responded

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
and it's begun to melt away.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
It's still there.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
By month 12,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
we could argue whether

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
there's a little bit of material around the edges,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
but it's essentially completely gone.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
It's now five years

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
since Robert's diagnosis,

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
and he's alive,

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
but importantly, he's healthy

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
and he's at work.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
I'm going to let him, in this very short clip,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
describe his impressions of the therapy

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
in his own words.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
(Video) Robert Dill-Bundi: My quality of life,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
I rate what I have today

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.330
a bit different than what most people would assume.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:28.330
I am the happiest, the happiest person in the world.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.330
And every single morning I appreciate life.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
Every night I fall asleep very well,

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
and I am, I repeat,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.330
the happiest man in the world,

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.330
and I'm thankful I am alive.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
BD: Novocure's also working on lung cancer

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
as the second target.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
We've run a phase two trial

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
in Switzerland

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.330
on, again, recurrent patients --

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
patients who have received standard therapy

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
and whose cancer has come back.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.330
I'm going to show you another clip

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.330
of a woman named Lydia.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
Lydia's a 66 year-old farmer

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.330
in Switzerland.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
She was diagnosed with lung cancer

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
five years ago.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.330
She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
over two years,

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.330
none of which had an effect.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
Her cancer continued to grow.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
Three years ago,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.330
she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
You can see, in her case,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
she's wearing her transducer arrays,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
one of the front of her chest, one on the back,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
and then the second pair side-to-side over the liver.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.330
You can see the Tumor Treating Field field generator,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.330
but importantly you can also see that she is living her life.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.330
She is managing her farm.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
And when we talked to her,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.330
she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.330
she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
Her whole family suffered

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
as her side effect profile came and went.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
Now she can run

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
all of the activities of her farm.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
It's only the beginning.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:16.330
(Applause)

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.330
In the lab, we've observed tremendous synergies

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.330
between chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.330
There's research underway now at Harvard Medical School

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
to pick the optimum pairs

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
to maximize that benefit.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.330
We also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.330
and interrupt the self-repair mechanisms that we have.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
There's now a new research project underway

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.330
at the Karolinska in Sweden

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
to prove that hypothesis.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
We have more trials planned

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
for lung cancer,

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.330
and breast cancer.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
And I firmly believe

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
that in the next 10 years

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
Tumor Treating Fields

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.330
will be a weapon available to doctors and patients

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.330
for all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
I'm also very hopeful

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.330
that in the next decades,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
we will make big strides

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
on reducing that death rate

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.330
that has been so challenging in this disease.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.330
Thank you.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:29.330
(Applause)
