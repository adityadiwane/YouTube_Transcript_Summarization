00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.928
I'm a lexicographer.

00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:15.682
I make dictionaries.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.121
And my job as a lexicographer

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:20.841
is to try to put all the words possible 
into the dictionary.

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:26.924
My job is not to decide what a word is;
that is your job.

00:00:26.924 --> 00:00:29.821
Everybody who speaks English 
decides together

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.153
what's a word and what's not a word.

00:00:32.153 --> 00:00:37.305
Every language is just a group of people
who agree to understand each other.

00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:41.909
Now, sometimes when people are trying 
to decide whether a word is good or bad,

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.677
they don't really have a good reason.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:46.488
So they say something like,
"Because grammar!"

00:00:46.488 --> 00:00:48.422
(Laughter)

00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:52.425
I don't actually really care about grammar
too much -- don't tell anybody.

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:55.564
But the word "grammar," actually,
there are two kinds of grammar.

00:00:55.564 --> 00:00:58.434
There's the kind of grammar
that lives inside your brain,

00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:00.543
and if you're a native 
speaker of a language

00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:02.132
or a good speaker of a language,

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:05.531
it's the unconscious rules that you follow
when you speak that language.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.552
And this is what you learn when
you learn a language as a child.

00:01:08.552 --> 00:01:10.189
And here's an example:

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:11.714
This is a wug, right?

00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:13.775
It's a wug.

00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:15.471
Now there is another one.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:16.634
There are two of these.

00:01:16.634 --> 00:01:17.923
There are two ...

00:01:17.923 --> 00:01:19.107
Audience: Wugs.

00:01:19.107 --> 00:01:22.820
Erin McKean: Exactly! You know 
how to make the plural of wug.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.301
That rule lives in your brain.

00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:27.250
You never had to be taught this rule, 
you just understand it.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.879
This is an experiment that was invented
by a professor at [Boston University]

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:34.024
named Jean Berko Gleason back in 1958.

00:01:34.024 --> 00:01:37.049
So we've been talking about this 
for a long time.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.563
Now, these kinds of natural rules 
that exist in your brain,

00:01:40.563 --> 00:01:44.785
they're not like traffic laws,
they're more like laws of nature.

00:01:44.785 --> 00:01:48.140
And nobody has to remind you to obey 
a law of nature, right?

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.093
When you leave the house in the morning, 
your mom doesn't say,

00:01:51.093 --> 00:01:53.972
"Hey, honey, I think
it's going to be cold, take a hoodie,

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:56.439
don't forget to obey the law of gravity."

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.325
Nobody says this.

00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:05.182
Now, there are other rules that are more
about manners than they are about nature.

00:02:05.182 --> 00:02:08.046
So you can think of a word as like a hat.

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:10.296
Once you know how hats work,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:13.163
nobody has to tell you, 
"Don't wear hats on your feet."

00:02:13.163 --> 00:02:16.507
What they have to tell you is, 
"Can you wear hats inside?

00:02:16.507 --> 00:02:18.264
Who gets to wear a hat?

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:21.396
What are the kinds of hats
you get to wear?"

00:02:21.396 --> 00:02:23.818
Those are more of the second kind 
of grammar,

00:02:23.818 --> 00:02:28.121
which linguists often call usage, 
as opposed to grammar.

00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:32.255
Now, sometimes people use this kind of 
rules-based grammar

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:35.043
to discourage people from making up words.

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:37.727
And I think that is, well, stupid.

00:02:37.727 --> 00:02:40.993
So, for example, 
people are always telling you,

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:46.233
"Be creative, make new music, do art, 
invent things, science and technology."

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.271
But when it comes to 
words, they're like,

00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:52.991
"Don't! No. Creativity stops right here,
whippersnappers. Give it a rest."

00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:54.421
(Laughter)

00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:56.142
But that makes no sense to me.

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:58.474
Words are great.
We should have more of them.

00:02:58.474 --> 00:03:02.530
I want you to make
as many new words as possible.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.538
And I'm going to tell you six ways that
you can use to make new words in English.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.639
The first way is the simplest way.

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.862
Basically, steal them from other 
languages.

00:03:11.862 --> 00:03:14.686
["Go rob other people"]
(Laughter)

00:03:15.936 --> 00:03:17.764
Linguists call this borrowing,

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:20.824
but we never give the words back ,
so I'm just going to be honest

00:03:20.824 --> 00:03:22.784
and call it stealing.

00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:26.154
We usually take words for things 
that we like, like delicious food.

00:03:26.154 --> 00:03:29.944
We took "kumquat" from Chinese,
we took "caramel" from French.

00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:32.851
We also take words 
for cool things like "ninja," right?

00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:34.301
We took that from Japanese,

00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:37.570
which is kind of a cool trick because 
ninjas are hard to steal from.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.684
(Laughter)

00:03:39.684 --> 00:03:42.944
So another way that you 
can make words in English

00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:45.885
is by squishing two 
other English words together.

00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:47.572
This is called compounding.

00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:49.082
Words in English are like Lego:

00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:52.447
If you use enough force, 
you can put any two of them together.

00:03:52.447 --> 00:03:54.112
(Laughter)

00:03:54.832 --> 00:03:56.627
We do this all the time in English:

00:03:56.627 --> 00:04:02.105
Words like "heartbroken," "bookworm," 
"sandcastle" all are compounds.

00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:05.606
So go ahead and make words like
"duckface," just don't make duckface.

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:07.085
(Laughter)

00:04:07.835 --> 00:04:11.848
Another way that you can make words 
in English is kind of like compounding,

00:04:11.848 --> 00:04:16.899
but instead you use so much force
when you squish the words together

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.534
that some parts fall off.

00:04:18.534 --> 00:04:20.215
So these are blend words, 

00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:24.064
like "brunch" is a blend 
of "breakfast" and "lunch."

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:26.796
"Motel" is a blend of "motor" and "hotel."

00:04:26.796 --> 00:04:29.737
Who here knew that "motel" 
was a blend word?

00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:31.581
Yeah, that word is so old in English

00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:34.692
that lots of people don't know that 
there are parts missing.

00:04:34.692 --> 00:04:38.987
"Edutainment" is a blend 
of "education" and "entertainment."

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:44.197
And of course, "electrocute" is a
blend of "electric" and "execute."

00:04:44.197 --> 00:04:46.007
(Laughter)

00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:49.328
You can also make words
by changing how they operate.

00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:50.941
This is called functional shift.

00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:53.242
You take a word that acts 
as one part of speech,

00:04:53.242 --> 00:04:55.522
and you change it into another 
part of speech.

00:04:55.522 --> 00:04:59.541
Okay, who here knew that "friend"
hasn't always been a verb?

00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:05.076
"Friend" used to be noun 
and then we verbed it.

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:08.345
Almost any word in English can be verbed.

00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:10.978
You can also take adjectives 
and make them into nouns.

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:14.705
"Commercial" used to be an adjective 
and now it's a noun.

00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:17.151
And of course, you can "green" things.

00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:20.489
Another way to make words
in English is back-formation.

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:23.747
You can take a word and you can
kind of squish it down a little bit.

00:05:23.747 --> 00:05:28.568
So for example, in English we had the word
"editor" before we had the word "edit."

00:05:28.568 --> 00:05:30.320
"Edit" was formed from "editor."

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.065
Sometimes these back-formations 
sound a little silly:

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:37.453
Bulldozers bulldoze, butlers butle 
and burglers burgle.

00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:39.078
(Laughter)

00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:41.050
Another way to make words in English

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.220
is to take the first letters of something
and squish them together.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.251
So National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration becomes NASA.

00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:50.963
And of course you can do this 
with anything, OMG!

00:05:50.963 --> 00:05:56.602
So it doesn't matter how silly 
the words are.

00:05:56.602 --> 00:05:58.608
They can be really good words of English.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:02.626
"Absquatulate" is a perfectly 
good word of English.

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:05.489
"Mugwump" is a perfectly 
good word of English.

00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:10.067
So the words don't have have to sound 
normal, they can sound really silly.

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:12.256
Why should you make words?

00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:14.397
You should make words because every word

00:06:14.397 --> 00:06:18.918
is a chance to express your idea and get 
your meaning across.

00:06:18.918 --> 00:06:21.514
And new words grab people's attention.

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:24.163
They get people to focus on what 
you're saying

00:06:24.163 --> 00:06:27.427
and that gives you a better chance to get 
your meaning across.

00:06:27.427 --> 00:06:30.376
A lot of people 
on this stage today have said,

00:06:30.376 --> 00:06:31.938
"In the future, you can do this,

00:06:31.938 --> 00:06:35.471
you can help with this, you can 
help us explore, you can help us invent."

00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:37.100
You can make a new word right now.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.433
English has no age limit.

00:06:39.433 --> 00:06:41.859
Go ahead, start making words today,

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:45.546
send them to me, and I will put them 
in my online dictionary, Wordnik.

00:06:45.546 --> 00:06:46.835
Thank you so much.

00:06:46.835 --> 00:06:51.642
(Applause)
