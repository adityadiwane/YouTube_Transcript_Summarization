00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.330
This is the Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
It's 27 kilometers in circumference.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
Over 10,000 physicists and engineers

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
from 85 countries around the world

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
have come together over several decades

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
to build this machine.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
What we do is we accelerate protons --

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
so, hydrogen nuclei --

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.330
around 99.999999

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
percent the speed of light.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
Right? At that speed, they go around

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.330
that 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
And we collide them with another beam of protons

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
going in the opposite direction.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
We collide them inside giant detectors.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
They're essentially digital cameras.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
And this is the one that I work on, ATLAS.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
You get some sense of the size --

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
you can just see these EU standard-size

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
people underneath.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
(Laughter)

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
You get some sense of the size: 44 meters wide,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
22 meters in diameter, 7,000 tons.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
And we re-create the conditions that were present

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
up to 600 million times a second

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
inside that detector -- immense numbers.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
And if you see those metal bits there --

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
those are huge magnets that bend

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
electrically charged particles,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
so it can measure how fast they're traveling.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
This is a picture about a year ago.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
Those magnets are in there.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
And, again, a EU standard-size, real person,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
so you get some sense of the scale.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
And it's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
sometime in the summer this year.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
And actually, this morning, I got an email

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
saying that we've just finished, today,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
building the last piece of ATLAS.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
So as of today, it's finished. I'd like to say

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
that I planned that for TED,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
but I didn't. So it's been completed as of today.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.330
(Applause)

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
Yeah, it's a wonderful achievement.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
So, you might be asking, "Why?

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
Why create the conditions that were present

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began?"

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
Well, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
And the aim of particle physics is to understand

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
what everything's made of, and how everything sticks together.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
And by everything I mean, of course,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
me and you, the Earth, the Sun,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
the 100 billion suns in our galaxy

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
and the 100 billion galaxies

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
in the observable universe.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
Absolutely everything.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
Now you might say, "Well, OK, but why not just look at it?

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
You know? If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me."

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
Well, we found that as you look back in time,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
the universe gets hotter and hotter,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
denser and denser, and simpler and simpler.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
Now, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
but that seems to be the case.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
So, way back in the early times of the universe,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
we believe it was very simple and understandable.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
All this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things --

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
human brains -- are a property of an old

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
and cold and complicated universe.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
Back at the start, in the first billionth of a second,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
we believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
It's almost like ...

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
imagine a snowflake in your hand,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
beautiful object. But as you heat it up,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
it'll melt into a pool of water,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
and you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
of H20, water.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
So it's in that same sense that we look back in time

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
to understand what the universe is made of.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
And, as of today, it's made of these things.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
Just 12 particles of matter,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
stuck together by four forces of nature.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
The quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
that make up the atomic nuclei in your body.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
The electron -- the thing that goes around

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
the atomic nucleus --

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.330
held around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
that's carried by this thing, the photon.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
And these guys, here, they're the weak nuclear force,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
probably the least familiar.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
But, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
And when the sun shines, you get copious quantities

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
of these things, called neutrinos, pouring out.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
Actually, if you just look at your thumbnail --

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
about a square centimeter --

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
from the sun, passing

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
through every square centimeter of your body.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
But you don't feel them, because the weak force

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
is correctly named --

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
very short range and very weak,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
so they just fly through you.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
And these particles have been discovered

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
over the last century, pretty much.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
The first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
and the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
in the year 2000. Actually just --

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
I was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
America, isn't it?

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
Just up the road.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
Relative to the universe, it's just up the road.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
(Laughter)

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
So, this thing was discovered in the year 2000,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
so it's a relatively recent picture.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
One of the wonderful things, actually, I find,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
is that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
You know, they're a step in size

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
from the entire observable universe.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
So, 100 billion galaxies,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
13.7 billion light years away --

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
a step in size from that to Monterey, actually,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
is about the same as from Monterey to these things.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
Absolutely, exquisitely minute,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
So, one of my most illustrious forebears

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
at Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
discoverer of the atomic nucleus,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
once said, "All science is either physics

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
or stamp collecting."

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
Now, I don't think he meant to insult

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330
the rest of science,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
although he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
(Laughter)

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
But what he meant was that what we've done, really,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
is stamp collect there.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
OK, we've discovered the particles,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
but unless you understand the underlying

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
reason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is --

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
Fortunately, we have

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
that underpins that pattern.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
It's the Newton's laws, if you want,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
of particle physics.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.330
It's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt,

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
which is always the sign of elegance.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
This is it.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
(Laughter)

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
I've been a little disingenuous, because I've expanded it out

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
in all its gory detail.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
This equation, though, allows you to calculate everything --

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
other than gravity -- that happens in the universe.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
So, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together --

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
in principle, you've got a big enough computer --

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
why DNA is the shape it is.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
In principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
But there's a problem.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
Can anyone see what it is?

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
I'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.330
Basically, each of these terms

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
refers to some of the particles.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
So those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
These carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
But there's an extra symbol in this equation: H.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
Right, H.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
H stands for Higgs particle.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
Higgs particles have not been discovered.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
But they're necessary: they're necessary

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
to make that mathematics work.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.330
So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
with that wonderful equation

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
wouldn't be possible without an extra bit.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
So it's a prediction:

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
a prediction of a new particle.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
What does it do?

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
And back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.330
for the LHC from the U.K. government,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
Margaret Thatcher, at the time, said,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
"If you guys can explain, in language

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
a politician can understand,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.330
what the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
I want to know what this Higgs particle does."

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.330
Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
And the picture is that the whole universe --

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.330
and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you --

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
Higgs particles, if you will.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
The analogy is that these people in a room

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
are the Higgs particles.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
Now when a particle moves through the universe,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.330
it can interact with these Higgs particles.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
Then everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.330
essentially at the speed of light. They're massless.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
And imagine someone incredibly important

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
and popular and intelligent

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
walks into the room.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.330
They're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
It's almost like they get heavy. They get massive.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.330
And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
in your body and in the universe that we see around us

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
are heavy, in a sense, and massive,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
because they're surrounded by Higgs particles.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
They're interacting with the Higgs field.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
If that picture's true,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
If it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism,

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.330
although it's the simplest we've been able to think of --

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
we know have to turn up

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
at the LHC.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.330
So, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
Actually, I thought about making it more culturally relevant, but --

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
(Laughter)

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
anyway.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
So that's one thing.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.330
That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
There are many other things. You've heard

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
many of the big problems in particle physics.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
One of them you heard about: dark matter, dark energy.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
There's another issue,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
which is that the forces in nature -- it's quite beautiful, actually --

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
seem, as you go back in time,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
they seem to change in strength.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
Well, they do change in strength.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
So, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.330
gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.330
The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together,

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.330
gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model --

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
you can calculate how these change -- is the forces,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
the three forces, other than gravity,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
almost seem to come together at one point.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
It's almost as if there was one beautiful

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
kind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
But they just miss.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
Now there's a theory called super-symmetry,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
which doubles the number of particles in the standard model,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
But actually, with this theory,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
we find that the forces of nature

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
do seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang --

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.330
absolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
but it seems to do it.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
Also, those super-symmetric particles

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
are very strong candidates for the dark matter.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
So a very compelling theory

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
that's really mainstream physics.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on --

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
in a very unscientific way -- that

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
that these things would also crop up at the LHC.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
Many other things that the LHC could discover.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.330
a different perspective

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
of what I think -- what particle physics

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.330
really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.330
And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.330
narrative -- almost a creation story,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
if you'd like -- about the universe,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
from modern science over the last few decades.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
And I'd say that it deserves,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.330
to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.330
of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
This is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
The story goes like this: we know that

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
the universe began 13.7 billion years ago,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
in an immensely hot, dense state,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.330
much smaller than a single atom.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
It began to expand about

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
a million, billion, billion, billion billionth

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.330
of a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
Gravity separated away from the other forces.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
The universe then underwent

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
an exponential expansion called inflation.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
In about the first billionth of a second or so,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
the Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
and the gluons and the electrons

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
that make us up got mass.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
The universe continued to expand and cool.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
After about a few minutes,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.330
there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.330
25 percent helium. It still is today.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.330
It continued to expand

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
about 300 million years.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
Then light began to travel through the universe.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
It was big enough to be transparent to light,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
that George Smoot described

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
as looking at the face of God.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
After about 400 million years, the first stars formed,

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
and that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
into the heavier elements.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
So the elements of life --

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
carbon, and oxygen and iron,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
all the elements that we need to make us up --

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
were cooked in those first generations of stars,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
which then ran out of fuel, exploded,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
threw those elements back into the universe.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
They then re-collapsed into another generation

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.330
of stars and planets.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.330
And on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.330
in that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.330
to form water, liquid water on the surface.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
primitive life evolved,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
which evolved over millions of years into

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
things that walked upright and left footprints

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.330
and eventually

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
left a footprint on another world.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
And built this civilization,

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
this wonderful picture,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
that turned the darkness into light,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
and you can see the civilization from space.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
As one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
these are the things -- and actually, not only these,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
but I was looking around -- these are the things,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
like Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik,

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
and DNA, and literature and science --

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.330
these are the things that hydrogen atoms do

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.330
when given 13.7 billion years.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
Absolutely remarkable.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.330
And, the laws of physics. Right?

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
So, the right laws of physics --

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
they're beautifully balanced.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
If the weak force had been a little bit different,

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.330
inside the hearts of stars,

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.330
and there would be none of that in the universe.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
And I think that's

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
a wonderful and significant story.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
because we didn't know it.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.330
It makes me really feel that

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
that civilization --

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.330
which, as I say, if you believe

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
the scientific creation story,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
and a few hydrogen atoms --

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
then I think, to me anyway,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
it makes me feel incredibly valuable.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
So that's the LHC.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.330
The LHC is certainly, when it turns on in summer,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330
going to write the next chapter of that book.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
And I'm certainly looking forward with

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
immense excitement to it being turned on.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
Thanks.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:53.330
(Applause)
