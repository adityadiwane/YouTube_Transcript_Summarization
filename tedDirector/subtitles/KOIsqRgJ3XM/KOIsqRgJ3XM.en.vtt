00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:16.660
My grandfather was a cobbler.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.899
Back in the day, he made custom-made shoes.

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:22.110
I never got to meet him.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.910
He perished in the Holocaust.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.988
But I did inherit his love for making,

00:00:28.988 --> 00:00:32.926
except that it doesn't exist that much anymore.

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:35.436
You see, while the Industrial Revolution

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:38.179
did a great deal to improve humanity,

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.116
it eradicated the very skill

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:44.136
that my grandfather loved,

00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:47.437
and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it.

00:00:47.437 --> 00:00:52.740
But all of that is about to change with 3D printing,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.818
and it all started with this,

00:00:57.818 --> 00:00:59.650
the very first part

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.910
that was ever printed.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.473
It's a little older than TED.

00:01:04.473 --> 00:01:07.120
It was printed in 1983

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.840
by Chuck Hull,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.448
who invented 3D printing.

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.631
But the thing that I want to talk to you about today,

00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:17.561
the big idea that I want to discuss with you,

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:19.464
is not that 3D printing

00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:22.724
is going to catapult us into the future,

00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:25.120
but rather that it's actually going

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.213
to connect us with our heritage,

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:31.237
and it's going to usher in a new era

00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:35.121
of localized, distributed manufacturing

00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:36.853
that is actually based

00:01:36.853 --> 00:01:39.312
on digital fabrication.

00:01:39.312 --> 00:01:45.110
So think about useful things.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.953
You all know your shoe size.

00:01:46.953 --> 00:01:48.631
How many of you know the size

00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:50.116
of the bridge of your nose

00:01:50.116 --> 00:01:53.379
or the distance between your temples?

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.910
Anybody?

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.708
Wouldn't it be awesome if you could,

00:01:57.708 --> 00:01:59.980
for the first time, get eyewear

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.190
that actually fits you perfectly

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.865
and doesn't require any hinge assembly,

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:10.422
so chances are, the hinges are not going to break?

00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:13.020
But the implications of 3D printing

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.477
go well beyond the tips of our noses.

00:02:16.477 --> 00:02:18.805
When I met Amanda for the first time,

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.400
she could already stand up and walk a little bit

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.355
even though she was paralyzed from the waist down,

00:02:24.355 --> 00:02:27.070
but she complained to me that her suit

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.995
was uncomfortable.

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:30.446
It was a beautiful robotic suit

00:02:30.446 --> 00:02:32.134
made by Ekso Bionics,

00:02:32.134 --> 00:02:35.902
but it wasn't inspired by her body.

00:02:35.902 --> 00:02:38.219
It wasn't made to measure.

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.942
So she challenged me to make her something

00:02:40.942 --> 00:02:44.103
that was a little bit more feminine,

00:02:44.103 --> 00:02:47.331
a little bit more elegant,

00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:48.585
and lightweight,

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.117
and like good tailors,

00:02:50.117 --> 00:02:54.497
we thought that we would measure her digitally.

00:02:54.497 --> 00:02:57.586
And we did. We built her an amazing suit.

00:02:57.586 --> 00:03:00.594
The incredible part about what I learned

00:03:00.594 --> 00:03:03.744
from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing

00:03:03.744 --> 00:03:05.442
and we say to ourselves,

00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:08.300
it's going to replace traditional methods.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.280
Amanda looked at it and she said,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.170
it's an opportunity for me

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.375
to reclaim my symmetry

00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:17.353
and to embrace my authenticity.

00:03:17.353 --> 00:03:19.482
And you know what? She's not standing still.

00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:22.283
She now wants to walk in high heels.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.339
It doesn't stop there.

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.290
3D printing is changing

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.641
personalized medical devices as we know them,

00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:37.086
from new, beautiful, conformal,

00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:40.167
ventilated scoliosis braces

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:43.529
to millions of dental restorations

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:47.026
and to beautiful bracings

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:50.189
for amputees,

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.361
another opportunity to emotionally reconnect

00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:55.881
with your symmetry.

00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:58.332
And as we sit here today,

00:03:58.332 --> 00:04:01.179
you can go wireless on your braces

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:03.260
with clear aligners,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.399
or your dental restorations.

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:07.591
Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids

00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:10.358
are already 3D printed today.

00:04:10.358 --> 00:04:12.723
Millions of people are served today

00:04:12.723 --> 00:04:15.419
from these devices.

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.179
What about full knee replacements,

00:04:19.179 --> 00:04:22.246
from your data, made to measure,

00:04:22.246 --> 00:04:26.708
where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed?

00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:30.216
G.E. is using 3D printing

00:04:30.216 --> 00:04:32.894
to make the next generation LEAP engine

00:04:32.894 --> 00:04:36.590
that will save fuel to the tune

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.306
of about 15 percent

00:04:39.306 --> 00:04:41.498
and cost for an airline

00:04:41.498 --> 00:04:43.893
of about 14 million dollars.

00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:45.575
Good for G.E., right?

00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:48.108
And their customers and the environment.

00:04:48.108 --> 00:04:50.568
But, you know, the even better news

00:04:50.568 --> 00:04:53.799
is that this technology is no longer reserved

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:56.465
for deep-pocketed corporations.

00:04:56.465 --> 00:04:59.700
Planetary Resources, a startup

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.194
for space explorations

00:05:01.194 --> 00:05:05.750
is going to put out its first 
space probe later this year.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.200
It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.669
it costs a fraction of its cost,

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.360
and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.039
and it's going to be out in space later this year.

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.402
Google is taking on this very audacious project

00:05:23.402 --> 00:05:26.104
of making the block phone, the Ara.

00:05:26.104 --> 00:05:28.617
It's only possible because of the development

00:05:28.617 --> 00:05:31.166
of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:35.526
will make functional, usable modules

00:05:35.526 --> 00:05:36.922
that will go into it.

00:05:36.922 --> 00:05:40.220
A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.768
How about food?

00:05:42.768 --> 00:05:45.292
What if we could, for the first time,

00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:48.279
make incredible delectables

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:53.000
like this beautiful TED Teddy here,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.826
that are edible?

00:05:54.826 --> 00:05:58.510
What if we could completely
change the experience,

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.315
like you see with that absinthe serving

00:06:02.315 --> 00:06:06.065
that is completely 3D printed?

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:10.868
And what if we could begin to put ingredients

00:06:10.868 --> 00:06:14.309
and colors and flavors in every taste,

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:17.107
which means not only delicious foods

00:06:17.107 --> 00:06:20.924
but the promise of personalized nutrition

00:06:20.924 --> 00:06:22.278
around the corner?

00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:25.423
And that gets me to one of the
biggest deals about 3D printing.

00:06:25.423 --> 00:06:28.284
With 3D printing, complexity is free.

00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:31.146
The printer doesn't care

00:06:31.146 --> 00:06:33.790
if it makes the most rudimentary shape

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.990
or the most complex shape,

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.148
and that is completely turning design

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:42.694
and manufacturing on its head as we know it.

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:45.021
Many people think that 3D printing will be

00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:48.759
the end of manufacturing as we know it.

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.272
I think that it's the opportunity to put

00:06:51.272 --> 00:06:54.933
tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters

00:06:54.933 --> 00:06:57.536
that will create endless abundance

00:06:57.536 --> 00:06:59.456
of job opportunities,

00:06:59.456 --> 00:07:01.420
and with that,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.314
everybody can become an expert maker

00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:06.418
and an expert manufacturer.

00:07:06.418 --> 00:07:08.304
That will take new tools.

00:07:08.304 --> 00:07:11.037
Not everybody knows how to use CAD,

00:07:11.037 --> 00:07:13.080
so we're developing haptics,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.019
perceptual devices

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:16.920
that will allow you to touch

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.685
and feel your designs

00:07:18.685 --> 00:07:21.563
as if you play with digital clay.

00:07:21.563 --> 00:07:23.260
When you do things like that,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.263
and we also developed things that take

00:07:25.263 --> 00:07:27.817
physical photographs that are instantly printable,

00:07:27.817 --> 00:07:30.467
it will make it easier to create content,

00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:33.498
but with all of the unimagined,

00:07:33.498 --> 00:07:35.890
we will also have the unintended,

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:41.166
like democratized counterfeiting

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:44.150
and ubiquitous illegal possession.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.633
So many people ask me,

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:48.141
will we have a 3D printer in every home?

00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:50.394
I think it's the wrong question to ask.

00:07:50.394 --> 00:07:51.775
The right question to ask is,

00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:55.540
how will 3D printing change my life?

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.730
Or, in other words, what room in my house

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.894
will 3D printing fit in?

00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:01.890
So everything that you see here

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.001
has been 3D printed,

00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:07.080
including these shoes

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.322
at the Amsterdam fashion show.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:13.018
Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes.

00:08:13.018 --> 00:08:14.710
These are shoes that represent

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.908
the continuation of his passion

00:08:16.908 --> 00:08:19.288
for hyper-local manufacturing.

00:08:19.288 --> 00:08:24.531
My grandfather didn't get to see Nike

00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:29.080
printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.487
and my father didn't get to see me standing

00:08:32.487 --> 00:08:35.597
in my hybridized 3D printed shoes.

00:08:35.597 --> 00:08:38.348
He passed away three years ago.

00:08:38.348 --> 00:08:41.591
But Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all,

00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:43.960
is right here in the house today,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.742
and thanks to him,

00:08:45.742 --> 00:08:48.460
I can say, thanks to his invention, I can say

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.437
that I am a cobbler too,

00:08:50.437 --> 00:08:52.891
and by standing in these shoes

00:08:52.891 --> 00:08:55.225
I am honoring my past

00:08:55.225 --> 00:08:57.377
while manufacturing the future.

00:08:57.377 --> 00:08:58.900
Thank you.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.390
(Applause)
