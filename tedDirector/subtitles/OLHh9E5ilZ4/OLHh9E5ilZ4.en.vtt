00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
the future of the world was bleak.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
The population explosion was unstoppable.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
Global famine was inevitable.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
was going to shorten our lives.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
The acid rain was falling on the forests.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
The oil was running out,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and a nuclear winter would finish us off.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
None of those things happened,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
(Laughter)

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
the average per-capita income

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
of the average person on the planet,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
in real terms, adjusted for inflation,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
has tripled.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Child mortality is down by two-thirds.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Per-capita food production

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
is up by a third.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And all this at a time when the population has doubled.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
How did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
How did we achieve that?

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
How did we become

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
the only species

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
that becomes more prosperous

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
as it becomes more populous?

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and the level of the graph

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
represents GDP per capita.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
I think to answer that question

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
you need to understand

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
how human beings bring together their brains

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and enable their ideas to combine and recombine,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
to meet and, indeed, to mate.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
In other words, you need to understand

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
how ideas have sex.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I want you to imagine

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
how we got from making objects like this

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
to making objects like this.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
These are both real objects.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
of the kind made by Homo erectus.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
The other is obviously a computer mouse.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
I've tried to work out which is bigger,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and it's almost impossible.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
The differences are what interest me,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
for about a million years --

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Homo erectus made the same tool

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
for 30,000 generations.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Of course there were a few changes,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
There was no progress, no innovation.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
And there's another difference too,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
which is the object on the left is made from one substance.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
The object on the right is made from

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
a confection of different substances,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
from silicon and metal and plastic and so on.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And more than that, it's a confection of different ideas,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
the idea of plastic, the idea of a laser,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
the idea of transistors.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
They've all been combined together in this technology.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And it's this combination,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
this cumulative technology, that intrigues me,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
because I think it's the secret to understanding

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
what's happening in the world.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
My body's an accumulation of ideas too:

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
They've come together.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Well, it uses sexual reproduction.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
a green one and a red one,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
then one has to be better than the other.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
One goes extinct for the other to survive.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
But if you have a sexual species,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
then it's possible for an individual

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
to inherit both mutations

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
from different lineages.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
So what sex does is it enables the individual

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
to draw upon

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
the genetic innovations of the whole species.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
It's not confined to its own lineage.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
What's the process that's having the same effect

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
in cultural evolution

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
as sex is having in biological evolution?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And I think the answer is exchange,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
the habit of exchanging one thing for another.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
It's a unique human feature.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
No other animal does it.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange --

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals --

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
But the exchange of one object for another never happens.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
As Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dog

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog."

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
(Laughter)

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
You can have culture without exchange.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
You can have, as it were, asexual culture.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
They teach each other traditions

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
which are handed down from parent to offspring.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
In this case, chimpanzees teaching each other

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
how to crack nuts with rocks.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
But the difference is

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
that these cultures never expand, never grow,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
never accumulate, never become combinatorial,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and the reason is because

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
there is no sex, as it were,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
there is no exchange of ideas.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
There's no exchange of ideas between them.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And why does exchange raise living standards?

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And here is a Stone Age version of his story,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
although he told it in terms of trade between countries.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
He doesn't need Adam.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
He can make his own spears and axes.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Well no, because if you think about it,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and then they trade,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
then they will each have saved an hour of work.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
And the more they do this, the more true it's going to be,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
because the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and the better Oz is going to get at making spears.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
So the gains from trade are only going to grow.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
And this is one of the beauties of exchange,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
is it actually creates the momentum

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
for more specialization,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
That is prosperity, the saving of time

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
in satisfying your needs.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Ask yourself how long you would have to work

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
to provide for yourself

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
How long do you actually have to work

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
to earn an hour of reading light

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
if you're on the average wage in Britain today?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
And the answer is about half a second.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Back in 1950,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
to acquire that much light.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
since 1950, as it were,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
or you can acquire another good or service.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And back in 1880,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
it would have been 15 minutes

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
to earn that amount of light on the average wage.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Back in 1800,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
you'd have had to work six hours

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
to earn a candle that could burn for an hour.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
In other words, the average person on the average wage

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
could not afford a candle in 1800.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
and ask yourself: "Who made them and for who?"

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
The stone axe was made by someone for himself.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
It was self-sufficiency.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
We call that poverty these days.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
But the object on the right

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
was made for me by other people.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
How many other people?

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
Tens? Hundreds? Thousands?

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
You know, I think it's probably millions.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
They were all working for me,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
to make a mouse for me.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
And that's the way society works.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
That's what we've achieved as a species.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
In the old days, if you were rich,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
you literally had people working for you.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
That's how you got to be rich; you employed them.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
They made his silly outfits, like this,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
(Laughter)

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
He had 498 people

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
to prepare his dinner every night.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and looking at Louis XIV's pictures,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
and shops all over Paris,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
that's probably got higher quality

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
than Louis XIV even had.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
And that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
to raise each other's living standards.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Now, you do get other animals working for each other too.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Ants are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
But there's a big difference,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
which is that it only happens within the colony.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
There's no working for each other across the colonies.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
The queen does it all.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
In our species, we don't like doing that.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
(Laughter)

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Even in England, we don't leave reproduction to the Queen.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.260
(Applause)

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
So when did this habit start?

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
And how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Well, I think, probably, the oldest version of this

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
is probably the sexual division of labor.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
But I've got no evidence for that.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
It just looks like the first thing we did

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
was work male for female and female for male.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
In all hunter-gatherer societies today,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
there's a foraging division of labor

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
between, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
It isn't always quite that simple,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
but there's a distinction between

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
specialized roles for males and females.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And the beauty of this system

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
is that it benefits both sides.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
The woman knows

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
that, in the Hadzas' case here --

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat --

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
and try and kill a warthog.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
to get roots.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
it's big enough to share some.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
And so both sides raise each other's standards of living

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
through the sexual division of labor.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
When did this happen? We don't know, but it's possible

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
that Neanderthals didn't do this.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
They were a highly cooperative species.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
They were a highly intelligent species.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
Their brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and mine

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
in this room today.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
They were imaginative. They buried their dead.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
They had language, probably,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
which was discovered here in Oxford.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
But there's no evidence

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
of a sexual division of labor.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
And the other thing there's no evidence for

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
is exchange between groups,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
the tools they made,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
are always made from local materials.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
For example, in the Caucasus

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
They're always made from local chert.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
In the same valley there are modern human remains

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
from about the same date, 30,000 years ago,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
and some of those are from local chert,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
but more -- but many of them are made

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
from obsidian from a long way away.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
And when human beings began

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
moving objects around like this,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Trade is 10 times as old as farming.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
Exchange between groups has been going on

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
for a hundred thousand years.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And the earliest evidence for it crops up

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
when you see obsidian and jasper and other things

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
moving long distances in Ethiopia.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
You also see seashells --

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
as discovered by a team here in Oxford --

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
moving 125 miles inland

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
from the Mediterranean in Algeria.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
And that's evidence that people

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
have started exchanging between groups.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
And that will have led to specialization.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
How do you know that long-distance movement

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
means trade rather than migration?

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
Well, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
They traded them with their neighbors

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
for things like stingray barbs,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
and the consequence was that stone axes

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
ended up over a large part of Australia.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
So long-distance movement of tools

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
is a sign of trade, not migration.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
What happens when you cut people off from exchange,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
from the ability to exchange and specialize?

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And the answer is that

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
not only do you slow down technological progress,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
you can actually throw it into reverse.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
An example is Tasmania.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
the people on it not only experienced

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
slower progress than people on the mainland,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
they actually experienced regress.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
They gave up the ability to make stone tools

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
and fishing equipment and clothing

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
because the population of about 4,000 people

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
was simply not large enough

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
to maintain the specialized skills

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
necessary to keep the technology they had.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
How many of the things in our pockets

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
could we continue to make after 10,000 years?

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego --

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
similar island, similar people.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
The reason: because Tierra del Fuego

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
is separated from South America by a much narrower straight,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
and there was trading contact across that straight

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
throughout 10,000 years.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
The Tasmanians were isolated.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Go back to this image again

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
but who knew how to make it.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
But who knows how to make a computer mouse?

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
Nobody, literally nobody.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
I mean this quite seriously.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
He just knows how to run a company.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
The person on the assembly line doesn't know

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
to get oil out to make plastic, and so on.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
I am of course quoting from a famous essay

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
by Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
called "I, Pencil"

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
And what we've done in human society,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
through exchange and specialization,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
is we've created

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
the ability to do things that we don't even understand.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
It's not the same with language.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
With language we have to transfer ideas

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
that we understand with each other.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
But with technology,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
to an extraordinary degree.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
And by the way,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
in the debate about I.Q.,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
It's completely irrelevant.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
What's relevant to a society

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
is how well people are communicating their ideas,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
and how well they're cooperating,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
not how clever the individuals are.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
So we've created something called the collective brain.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
We're just the nodes in the network.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
We're the neurons in this brain.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
It's the interchange of ideas,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
the meeting and mating of ideas between them,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
that is causing technological progress,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
incrementally, bit by bit.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
However, bad things happen.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
And in the future, as we go forward,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
we will, of course, experience terrible things.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
There will be wars; there will be depressions;

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
there will be natural disasters.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
But I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
and the ability of ideas

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
to meet and to mate

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
as never before,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
I'm also sure

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
that technology will advance,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and therefore living standards will advance.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
Because through the cloud,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
through crowd sourcing,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
through the bottom-up world that we've created,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
where not just the elites but everybody

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
is able to have their ideas

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
and make them meet and mate,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
Thank you.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.260
(Applause)
