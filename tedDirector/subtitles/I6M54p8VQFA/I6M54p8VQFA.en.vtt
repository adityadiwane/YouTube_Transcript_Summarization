00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Hawa Abdi: Many people -- 20 years for Somalia --

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
[were] fighting.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
So there was no job, no food.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Children, most of them,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
became very malnourished, like this.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
Deqo Mohamed: So as you know,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
always in a civil war,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
the ones affected most [are] the women and children.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
So our patients are women and children.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And they are in our backyard.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
It's our home. We welcome them.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
That's the camp that we have in now

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
90,000 people,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
where 75 percent of them are women and children.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Pat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
HA: We are doing C-sections and different operations

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
because people need some help.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
There is no government to protect them.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
DM: Every morning we have about 400 patients,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
maybe more or less.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
But sometimes we are only five doctors

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and 16 nurses,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
But we take the severe ones,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and we reschedule the other ones the next day.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
It is very tough.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
And as you can see, it's the women who are carrying the children;

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
it's the women who come into the hospitals;

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
it's the women [are] building the houses.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
That's their house.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And we have a school. This is our bright --

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
we opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
where we have 850 children,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and the majority are women and girls.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.260
(Applause)

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
PM: And the doctors have some very big rules

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
about who can get treated at the clinic.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Would you explain the rules for admission?

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
HA: The people who are coming to us,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
we are welcoming.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
We are sharing with them

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
whatever we have.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
But there are only two rules.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
First rule:

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
there is no clan distinguished and political division

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
in Somali society.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
[Whomever] makes those things we throw out.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
The second:

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
no man can beat his wife.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
If he beat,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
we will put [him] in jail,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and we will call the eldest people.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Until they identify this case,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
we'll never release him.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
That's our two rules.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.260
(Applause)

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
The other thing that I have realized,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
that the woman is the most strong person

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
all over the world.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Because the last 20 years,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
the Somali woman has stood up.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
They were the leaders,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and we are the leaders

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
of our community

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and the hope of our future generations.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
We are not just the helpless

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and the victims of the civil war.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
We can reconcile.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
We can do everything.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.260
(Applause)

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
DM: As my mother said, we are the future hope,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and the men are only killing in Somalia.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
So we came up with these two rules.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
In a camp with 90,000 people,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
So there is no clan division,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and no man can beat his wife.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And we have a little storage room

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
where we converted a jail.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
So if you beat your wife, you're going to be there.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
(Applause)

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
So empowering the women and giving the opportunity --

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
we are there for them. They are not alone for this.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
PM: You're running a medical clinic.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
It brought much, much needed medical care

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
to people who wouldn't get it.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
You're also running a civil society.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
You've created your own rules,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
in which women and children

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
are getting a different sense of security.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Talk to me about your decision, Dr. Abdi,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and your decision, Dr. Mohamed,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
to work together --

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
for you to become a doctor

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and to work with your mother in these circumstances.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
HA: My age --

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
because I was born in 1947 --

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
we were having, at that time,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
government, law and order.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
But one day, I went to the hospital --

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
my mother was sick --

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and I saw the hospital, how they [were] treating the doctors,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
how they [are] committed

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
to help the sick people.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
I admired them,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
and I decided to become a doctor.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
My mother died, unfortunately,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
when I was 12 years [old].

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Then my father allowed me

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
to proceed [with] my hope.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
My mother died

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
in [a] gynecology complication,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
so I decided to become

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
a gynecology specialist.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
That's why I became a doctor.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
So Dr. Deqo has to explain.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
DM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
to become a doctor, but I really didn't want to.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Maybe I should become an historian,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
or maybe a reporter.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
I loved it, but it didn't work.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
When the war broke out -- civil war --

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
I saw how my mother was helping

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and how she really needed the help,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and how the care is essential to the woman

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
to be a woman doctor in Somalia

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
and help the women and children.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And I thought, maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
(Laughter)

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
So I went to Russia, and my mother also,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
[during the] time of [the] Soviet Union.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
So some of our character,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
So that's how I decided [to do] the same.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
My sister was different.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
She's here. She's also a doctor.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
She graduated in Russia also.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
(Applause)

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And to go back and to work with our mother

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
is just what we saw in the civil war --

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
when I was 16, and my sister was 11,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
when the civil war broke out.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
So it was the need and the people we saw

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
in the early '90s --

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
that's what made us go back

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and work for them.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
PM: So what is the biggest challenge

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
working, mother and daughter,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
in such dangerous

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and sometimes scary situations?

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.260
HA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
very dangerous.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And when I saw the people who needed me,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
I was staying with them to help,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
because I [could] do something for them.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Most people fled abroad.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
But I remained with those people,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and I was trying to do something --

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
[any] little thing I [could] do.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
I succeeded in my place.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.260
Now my place is 90,000 people

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
who are respecting each other,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
who are not fighting.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.260
But we try to stand on our feet,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.260
to do something, little things, we can for our people.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
And I'm thankful for my daughters.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
When they come to me,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
they help me to treat the people,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
to help.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
They do everything for them.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
They have done what I desire to do for them.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
PM: What's the best part

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
of working with your mother,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and the most challenging part for you?

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
DM: She's very tough; it's most challenging.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
She always expects us to do more.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And really when you think [you] cannot do it,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
she will push you, and I can do it.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
That's the best part.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
She shows us, trains us how to do

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and how to be better [people]

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and how to do long hours in surgery --

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
300 patients per day,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
10, 20 surgeries,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and still you have to manage the camp --

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
that's how she trains us.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
It is not like beautiful offices here,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
20 patients, you're tired.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
You see 300 patients, 20 surgeries

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
and 90,000 people to manage.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
PM: But you do it for good reasons.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.260
(Applause)

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Wait. Wait.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
HA: Thank you.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
DM: Thank you.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.260
(Applause)

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
HA: Thank you very much. DM: Thank you very much.
