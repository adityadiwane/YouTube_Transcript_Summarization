00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.291
A couple of years ago,

00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:20.424
when I was attending
the TED conference in Long Beach,

00:00:20.448 --> 00:00:21.813
I met Harriet.

00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:25.236
We'd actually met online before --
not the way you're thinking.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.695
We were introduced
because we both knew Linda Avey,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.023
one of the founders of the first
online personal genomic companies.

00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:33.744
And because we shared
our genetic information with Linda,

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:35.675
she could see that Harriet and I shared

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.589
a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA,
haplotype K1a1b1a,

00:00:39.613 --> 00:00:41.608
which meant we were distantly related.

00:00:41.632 --> 00:00:44.465
We actually share the same
genealogy with Ötzi the Iceman.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.000
So -- Ötzi, Harriet and me.

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:49.425
And being the current day, of course,
we started our own Facebook group.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.748
You're all welcome to join.

00:00:50.772 --> 00:00:53.852
When I met Harriet in person
the next year at the TED conference,

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:56.864
she'd gone online and ordered
our own happy haplotype T-shirts.

00:00:56.888 --> 00:00:57.899
(Laughter)

00:00:57.923 --> 00:00:59.466
Why am I telling you this story?

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.832
What does it have to do
with the future of health?

00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:03.832
Well, the way I met Harriet is an example

00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:07.607
of how leveraging cross-disciplinary,
exponentially growing technologies

00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:09.942
is affecting our future
of health and wellness --

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.316
from low-cost gene analysis

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.458
to the ability to do
powerful bioinformatics

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:16.291
to the connection of the Internet
and social networking.

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:18.449
What I'd like to talk about today

00:01:18.473 --> 00:01:20.733
is understanding
these exponential technologies.

00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:22.314
We often think linearly.

00:01:22.338 --> 00:01:24.926
But if you think about it,
if you have a lily pad

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.913
and it just divided every single day --

00:01:26.937 --> 00:01:30.593
two, four, eight, sixteen --
in 15 days, you'd have 32,000.

00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:32.552
What do you think you'd have in a month?

00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:33.727
We're at a billion.

00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:35.423
If we start to think exponentially,

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:38.899
we can see how this is starting to affect
all the technologies around us.

00:01:38.923 --> 00:01:42.026
Many of these technologies,
speaking as a physician and innovator,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.142
we can start to leverage,
to impact the future of our own health

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.317
and of health care,

00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:49.426
and to address many of the major
challenges in health care today,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.615
ranging from the exponential costs
to the aging population,

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:55.339
the way we really don't use
information very well today,

00:01:55.363 --> 00:01:56.853
the fragmentation of care

00:01:56.877 --> 00:02:00.607
and the often very difficult course
of adoption of innovation.

00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:04.426
And one of the major things we can do
is move the curve to the left.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.167
We spend most of our money
on the last 20 percent of life.

00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:10.251
What if we could incentivize physicians
in the health care system

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:11.431
and our own selves

00:02:11.455 --> 00:02:13.970
to move the curve to the left
and improve our health,

00:02:13.994 --> 00:02:15.438
leveraging technology as well?

00:02:15.462 --> 00:02:17.886
Now my favorite example
of exponential technology,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.210
we all have in our pocket.

00:02:19.234 --> 00:02:22.505
If you think about it,
these are really dramatically improving.

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.435
I mean, this is the iPhone 4.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.647
Imagine what the iPhone 8
will be able to do.

00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:29.589
Now, I've gained some insight into this.

00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:32.188
I've been the track share
for the medicine portion

00:02:32.212 --> 00:02:34.719
of a new institution
called Singularity University,

00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:36.132
based in Silicon Valley.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.116
We bring together each summer
about 100 very talented students

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.306
from around the world.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.196
And we look at these exponential
technologies from medicine,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.366
biotech, artificial intelligence,
robotics, nanotechnology, space,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.869
and address how we can cross-train
and leverage these

00:02:48.893 --> 00:02:50.233
to impact major unmet goals.

00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:52.264
We also have seven-day executive programs.

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:54.671
And coming up next month is FutureMed,

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:58.069
a program to help cross-train
and leverage technologies into medicine.

00:02:58.093 --> 00:02:59.614
Now, I mentioned the phone.

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:02.949
These mobile phones have over 20,000
different mobile apps available.

00:03:02.973 --> 00:03:06.215
There's one out of the UK
where you can pee on a little chip,

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.520
connect it to your iPhone,

00:03:07.544 --> 00:03:08.699
and check for an STD.

00:03:08.723 --> 00:03:11.026
I don't know if I'd try that,
but it's available.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.875
There are other sorts of applications.

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.175
Merging your phone
and diagnostics, for example,

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.240
measuring your blood glucose
on your iPhone

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:18.971
and sending that to your physician,

00:03:18.995 --> 00:03:21.762
so they can better understand
and you can better understand

00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:23.366
your blood sugars as a diabetic.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.511
So let's see how exponential
technologies are taking health care.

00:03:26.535 --> 00:03:27.701
Let's start with faster.

00:03:27.725 --> 00:03:30.134
It's no secret that computers,
through Moore's law,

00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:31.801
are speeding up faster and faster.

00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:33.886
We can do more powerful things with them.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.711
They're really approaching --
in many cases, surpassing --

00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:38.181
the ability of the human mind.

00:03:38.205 --> 00:03:42.039
But where I think computational speed
is most applicable is in imaging.

00:03:42.063 --> 00:03:44.695
The ability now to look
inside the body in real time

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.177
with very high resolution

00:03:46.201 --> 00:03:47.661
is really becoming incredible.

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:50.721
And we're layering multiple
technologies -- PET scans, CT scans

00:03:50.745 --> 00:03:52.767
and molecular diagnostics --

00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:55.056
to find and seek things
at different levels.

00:03:55.616 --> 00:03:59.067
Here you're going to see the very highest
resolution MRI scan done today,

00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:01.910
of Marc Hodosh, the curator of TEDMED.

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:04.077
And now we can see inside of the brain

00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:06.693
at a resolution and ability
never before available,

00:04:06.717 --> 00:04:10.783
and essentially learn how to reconstruct
and maybe even reengineer

00:04:10.807 --> 00:04:12.491
or backwards engineer the brain,

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:15.492
so we can better understand
pathology, disease and therapy.

00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:18.808
We can look inside with real-time
fMRI in the brain at real time.

00:04:18.832 --> 00:04:22.121
And by understanding these sorts
of processes and these connections,

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:25.208
we're going to understand the effects
of medication or meditation

00:04:25.232 --> 00:04:27.839
and better personalize
and make effective, for example,

00:04:27.863 --> 00:04:29.466
psychoactive drugs.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.258
The scanners for these are getting
smaller, less expensive

00:04:32.282 --> 00:04:33.433
and more portable.

00:04:33.457 --> 00:04:35.928
And this sort of data explosion
available from these

00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:37.886
is really almost becoming a challenge.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.887
The scan of today takes up
about 800 books, or 20 gigabytes.

00:04:40.911 --> 00:04:44.182
The scan in a couple of years
will be one terabyte, or 800,000 books.

00:04:44.206 --> 00:04:45.975
How do you leverage that information?

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:47.150
Let's get personal.

00:04:47.174 --> 00:04:50.381
I won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy,
but if you're over age 50,

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:52.398
it's time for your screening colonoscopy.

00:04:52.422 --> 00:04:54.853
How'd you like to avoid
the pointy end of the stick?

00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:56.928
Now there's essentially
virtual colonoscopy.

00:04:56.952 --> 00:04:58.243
Compare those two pictures.

00:04:58.267 --> 00:05:01.534
As a radiologist, you can basically
fly through your patient's colon,

00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:03.853
and augmenting that
with artificial intelligence,

00:05:03.877 --> 00:05:06.506
potentially identify a lesion
that we might have missed,

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.106
but using AI on top of radiology,

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.181
we can find lesions
that were missed before.

00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:12.732
Maybe this will encourage
people to get colonoscopies

00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:14.139
that wouldn't have otherwise.

00:05:14.163 --> 00:05:16.175
This is an example of this paradigm shift.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.600
We're moving to this integration
of biomedicine, information technology,

00:05:19.624 --> 00:05:22.930
wireless and, I would say, mobile now --
this era of digital medicine.

00:05:22.954 --> 00:05:26.498
Even my stethoscope is now digital,
and of course, there's an app for that.

00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:29.057
We're moving, obviously,
to the era of the tricorder.

00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:31.530
So the handheld ultrasound
is basically surpassing

00:05:31.554 --> 00:05:33.552
and supplanting the stethoscope.

00:05:33.576 --> 00:05:36.538
These are now at a price point
of what used to be 100,000 euros

00:05:36.562 --> 00:05:38.401
or a couple hundred-thousand dollars.

00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:39.578
For about 5,000 dollars,

00:05:39.602 --> 00:05:42.928
I can have the power of a very powerful
diagnostic device in my hand.

00:05:42.952 --> 00:05:46.044
Merging this now with the advent
of electronic medical records --

00:05:46.068 --> 00:05:48.649
in the US, we're still
less than 20 percent electronic;

00:05:48.673 --> 00:05:51.469
here in the Netherlands,
I think it's more than 80 percent.

00:05:51.493 --> 00:05:53.781
Now that we're switching
to merging medical data,

00:05:53.805 --> 00:05:55.480
making it available electronically,

00:05:55.504 --> 00:05:58.152
we can crowd-source the information,
and as a physician,

00:05:58.176 --> 00:06:00.512
I can access my patients' data
from wherever I am,

00:06:00.536 --> 00:06:01.966
just through my mobile device.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.103
And now, of course, we're in the era
of the iPad, even the iPad 2.

00:06:05.127 --> 00:06:06.278
Just last month,

00:06:06.302 --> 00:06:08.517
the first FDA-approved
application was approved

00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:12.034
to allow radiologists to do actual
reading on these sorts of devices.

00:06:12.058 --> 00:06:14.679
So certainly, the physicians
of today, including myself,

00:06:14.703 --> 00:06:16.680
are completely reliable on these devices.

00:06:16.704 --> 00:06:18.523
And as you saw just about a month ago,

00:06:18.547 --> 00:06:21.040
Watson from IBM beat
the two champions in "Jeopardy."

00:06:21.064 --> 00:06:23.502
So I want you to imagine
when, in a couple of years,

00:06:23.526 --> 00:06:25.986
we've started to apply
this cloud-based information,

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.610
when we really have the AI physician
and leverage our brains to connectivity

00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:32.584
to make decisions and diagnostics
at a level never done.

00:06:32.608 --> 00:06:35.807
Already today, you don't need to go
to your physician in many cases.

00:06:35.831 --> 00:06:39.373
Only in about 20 percent of visits
do you need to lay hands on the patient.

00:06:39.397 --> 00:06:41.258
We're now in the era of virtual visits.

00:06:41.282 --> 00:06:43.775
From Skype-type visits
you can do with American Well,

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:46.856
to Cisco, that's developed a very complex
health presence system,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.087
the ability to interact with
your health care provider is different.

00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:53.136
And these are being augmented
even by our devices, again, today.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.929
My friend Jessica sent me
a picture of her head laceration,

00:06:55.953 --> 00:06:58.161
so I can save her a trip
to the emergency room,

00:06:58.185 --> 00:06:59.614
and do diagnostics that way.

00:06:59.638 --> 00:07:02.032
Or maybe we can leverage
today's gaming technology,

00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:03.302
like the Microsoft Kinect,

00:07:03.326 --> 00:07:06.503
hack that to enable diagnostics,
for example, in diagnosing stroke,

00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:09.116
using simple motion detection,
using $100 devices.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.325
We can actually now visit
our patients robotically.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:13.500
This is the RP7;

00:07:13.524 --> 00:07:16.482
if I'm a hematologist,
I can visit another clinic or hospital.

00:07:16.506 --> 00:07:18.901
These are being augmented
by a whole suite of tools

00:07:18.925 --> 00:07:20.121
actually in the home now.

00:07:20.145 --> 00:07:21.999
We already have wireless scales.

00:07:22.023 --> 00:07:24.728
You step on the scale,
tweet your weight to your friends,

00:07:24.752 --> 00:07:25.994
they can keep you in line.

00:07:26.018 --> 00:07:27.836
We have wireless blood pressure cuffs.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.367
A whole gamut of technologies
are being put together.

00:07:30.391 --> 00:07:33.205
Instead of wearing kludgy devices,
we put on a simple patch.

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:34.722
This was developed at Stanford.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:37.825
It's called iRhythm; it completely
supplants the prior technology

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:40.501
at a much lower price point,
with much more effectivity.

00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:43.000
We're also in the era today
of quantified self.

00:07:43.024 --> 00:07:46.629
Consumers now can basically buy
$100 devices, like this little Fitbit.

00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:48.674
I can measure my steps,
my caloric outtake.

00:07:48.698 --> 00:07:50.751
I can get insight into that
on a daily basis

00:07:50.775 --> 00:07:52.783
and share it with my friends or physician.

00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:55.886
There's watches that measure
your heart rate, Zeo sleep monitors,

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.993
a suite of tools
that enable you to leverage

00:07:58.017 --> 00:07:59.831
and have insight into your own health.

00:07:59.855 --> 00:08:01.863
As we start to integrate this information,

00:08:01.887 --> 00:08:04.768
we'll know better what to do with it,
and have better insight

00:08:04.792 --> 00:08:07.219
into our own pathologies,
health and wellness.

00:08:07.243 --> 00:08:09.886
There's even mirrors
that can pick up your pulse rate.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.669
And I would argue, in the future,

00:08:11.693 --> 00:08:14.855
we'll have wearable devices
in our clothes, monitoring us 24/7.

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:18.296
And just like the OnStar system
in cars, your red light might go on.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.365
It won't say "check engine";
it'll be a "check your body" light,

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:23.073
and you'll go get it taken care of.

00:08:23.097 --> 00:08:24.270
Probably in a few years,

00:08:24.294 --> 00:08:27.100
you'll look in your mirror
and it'll be diagnosing you.

00:08:27.124 --> 00:08:28.346
(Laughter)

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.449
For those of you with kiddos at home,

00:08:30.473 --> 00:08:33.418
how would you like a wireless
diaper that supports your --

00:08:33.442 --> 00:08:34.502
(Laughter)

00:08:34.526 --> 00:08:36.723
More information, I think,
than you might need,

00:08:36.747 --> 00:08:38.184
but it's going to be here.

00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:41.308
Now, we've heard a lot today
about technology and connection.

00:08:41.332 --> 00:08:43.144
And I think some of these technologies

00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:46.586
will enable us to be more connected
with our patients, to take more time

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.191
and do the important
human-touch elements of medicine,

00:08:49.215 --> 00:08:50.893
as augmented by these technologies.

00:08:50.917 --> 00:08:53.286
Now, we've talked about
augmenting the patient.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.986
How about augmenting the physician?

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.400
We're now in the era
of super-enabling the surgeon,

00:08:57.424 --> 00:09:00.886
who can now go into the body and do
robotic surgery, which is here today,

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.373
at a level that was not really possible
even five years ago.

00:09:04.397 --> 00:09:07.517
And now this is being augmented
with further layers of technology,

00:09:07.541 --> 00:09:08.696
like augmented reality.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.651
So the surgeon can see
inside the patient, through their lens,

00:09:11.675 --> 00:09:13.986
where the tumor is,
where the blood vessels are.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.115
This can be integrated
with decision support.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:19.300
A surgeon in New York can help
a surgeon in Amsterdam, for example.

00:09:19.324 --> 00:09:22.700
And we're entering an era
of truly scarless surgery called NOTES,

00:09:22.724 --> 00:09:25.315
where the robotic endoscope
can come out the stomach

00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:26.787
and pull out that gallbladder,

00:09:26.811 --> 00:09:29.162
all in a scarless way and robotically.

00:09:29.186 --> 00:09:32.502
This is called NOTES, and it's coming --
basically scarless surgery,

00:09:32.526 --> 00:09:34.584
as mediated by robotic surgery.

00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:36.704
Now, how about controlling other elements?

00:09:36.728 --> 00:09:39.158
For those who have
disabilities -- the paraplegic,

00:09:39.182 --> 00:09:41.969
there's the brain-computer
interface, or BCI,

00:09:41.993 --> 00:09:44.182
where chips have been put
on the motor cortex

00:09:44.206 --> 00:09:46.026
of completely quadriplegic patients,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.710
and they can control
a cursor or a wheelchair

00:09:48.734 --> 00:09:50.267
or, potentially, a robotic arm.

00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:51.887
These devices are getting smaller

00:09:51.911 --> 00:09:54.138
and going into more and more
of these patients.

00:09:54.162 --> 00:09:55.374
Still in clinical trials,

00:09:55.398 --> 00:09:57.799
but imagine when we can connect
these, for example,

00:09:57.823 --> 00:09:59.439
to the amazing bionic limb,

00:09:59.463 --> 00:10:02.285
such as the DEKA Arm,
built by Dean Kamen and colleagues,

00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:04.329
which has 17 degrees
of motion and freedom,

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.381
and can allow the person who's lost a limb

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:09.740
to have much higher dexterity or control
than they've had in the past.

00:10:09.764 --> 00:10:12.808
So we're really entering the era
of wearable robotics, actually.

00:10:12.832 --> 00:10:15.046
If you haven't lost a limb
but had a stroke,

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.757
you can wear these augmented limbs.

00:10:16.781 --> 00:10:20.277
Or if you're a paraplegic -- I've visited
the folks at Berkeley Bionics --

00:10:20.301 --> 00:10:21.470
they've developed eLEGS.

00:10:21.494 --> 00:10:22.860
I took this video last week.

00:10:22.884 --> 00:10:26.669
Here's a paraplegic patient, walking
by strapping on these exoskeletons.

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:28.704
He's otherwise completely
wheelchair-bound.

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:30.744
This is the early era
of wearable robotics.

00:10:30.768 --> 00:10:33.047
And by leveraging
these sorts of technologies,

00:10:33.071 --> 00:10:35.408
we're going to change
the definition of disability

00:10:35.432 --> 00:10:37.962
to, in some cases, be superability,
or super-enabling.

00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:41.176
This is Aimee Mullins, who lost
her lower limbs as a young child,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.513
and Hugh Herr, who's a professor at MIT,

00:10:43.537 --> 00:10:45.538
who lost his limbs in a climbing accident.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:48.957
And now both of them can climb better,
move faster, swim differently

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:52.468
with their prosthetics
than us normal-abled persons.

00:10:52.492 --> 00:10:53.932
How about other exponentials?

00:10:53.956 --> 00:10:57.366
Clearly the obesity trend is exponentially
going in the wrong direction,

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.825
including with huge costs.

00:10:58.849 --> 00:11:01.972
But the trend in medicine
is to get exponentially smaller.

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:05.571
A few examples: we're now in the era
of "Fantastic Voyage," the iPill.

00:11:05.595 --> 00:11:07.996
You can swallow this
completely integrated device.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.886
It can take pictures of your GI system,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.666
help diagnose and treat
as it moves through your GI tract.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.509
We get into even smaller micro-robots

00:11:14.533 --> 00:11:17.430
that will eventually, autonomously,
move through your system,

00:11:17.454 --> 00:11:19.511
and be able to do things surgeons can't do

00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:21.071
in a much less invasive manner.

00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:23.684
Sometimes these might
self-assemble in your GI system,

00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:25.432
and be augmented in that reality.

00:11:25.456 --> 00:11:27.948
On the cardiac side,
pacemakers are getting smaller

00:11:27.972 --> 00:11:29.309
and much easier to place,

00:11:29.333 --> 00:11:32.416
so no need to train an interventional
cardiologist to place them.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.376
And they'll be wirelessly telemetered
to your mobile devices,

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.886
so you can go places
and be monitored remotely.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.508
These are shrinking even further.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.788
This one is in prototyping
by Medtronic; it's smaller than a penny.

00:11:42.812 --> 00:11:46.237
Artificial retinas, the ability to put
arrays on the back of the eyeball

00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:47.685
and allow the blind to see --

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:50.020
also in early trials,
but moving into the future.

00:11:50.044 --> 00:11:51.775
These are going to be game-changing.

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:53.487
Or for those of us who are sighted,

00:11:53.511 --> 00:11:55.873
how about having
the assisted-living contact lens?

00:11:55.897 --> 00:11:58.719
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi available --
beams back images to your eye.

00:11:58.743 --> 00:11:59.766
(Laughter)

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.993
Now, if you have trouble
maintaining your diet,

00:12:02.017 --> 00:12:03.973
it might help to have some extra imagery

00:12:03.997 --> 00:12:07.631
to remind you how many calories
are going to be coming at you.

00:12:07.655 --> 00:12:10.406
How about enabling the pathologist
to use their cell phone

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.976
to see at a microscopic level

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.314
and to lumber that data back to the cloud
and make better diagnostics?

00:12:15.338 --> 00:12:17.624
In fact, the whole era
of laboratory medicine

00:12:17.648 --> 00:12:18.800
is completely changing.

00:12:18.824 --> 00:12:20.777
We can now leverage microfluidics,

00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:23.018
like this chip made
by Steve Quake at Stanford.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:25.678
Microfluidics can replace
an entire lab of technicians;

00:12:25.702 --> 00:12:28.841
put it on a chip, enable thousands
of tests at the point of care,

00:12:28.865 --> 00:12:30.017
anywhere in the world.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.445
This will really leverage technology
to the rural and the underserved

00:12:33.469 --> 00:12:36.984
and enable what used to be thousand-dollar
tests to be done for pennies,

00:12:37.008 --> 00:12:38.360
and at the point of care.

00:12:38.384 --> 00:12:40.885
If we go down the small
pathway a little bit further,

00:12:40.909 --> 00:12:42.808
we're entering the era of nanomedicine,

00:12:42.832 --> 00:12:44.754
the ability to make devices super-small,

00:12:44.778 --> 00:12:47.098
to the point where we can
design red blood cells

00:12:47.122 --> 00:12:50.197
or microrobots that monitor
our blood system or immune system,

00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:53.309
or even those that might clear out
the clots from our arteries.

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:55.073
Now how about exponentially cheaper?

00:12:55.097 --> 00:12:57.930
Not something we usually think
about in the era of medicine,

00:12:57.954 --> 00:13:01.858
but hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars
for 10 megabytes -- exponentially cheaper.

00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:04.544
In genomics now, the genome
cost about a billion dollars

00:13:04.568 --> 00:13:06.827
about 10 years ago,
when the first one came out.

00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:10.215
We're now approaching essentially
a $1,000 genome, probably next year.

00:13:10.239 --> 00:13:11.772
And in two years, a $100 genome.

00:13:11.796 --> 00:13:13.520
What will we do with $100 genomes?

00:13:13.544 --> 00:13:15.898
Soon we'll have millions
of these tests available.

00:13:15.922 --> 00:13:19.413
Then it gets interesting, when we start
to crowd-source that information,

00:13:19.437 --> 00:13:21.683
and enter the era
of true personalized medicine:

00:13:21.707 --> 00:13:24.239
the right drug for the right person
at the right time,

00:13:24.263 --> 00:13:27.556
instead of what we're doing now,
which is the same drug for everybody,

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.686
blockbuster drug medications,
which don't work for the individual.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.929
Many different companies are working
on leveraging these approaches.

00:13:33.953 --> 00:13:36.358
I'll show you a simple example,
from 23andMe again.

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:38.492
My data indicates
I've got about average risk

00:13:38.516 --> 00:13:41.207
for developing macular degeneration,
a kind of blindness.

00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:43.857
But if I take that same data,
upload it to deCODEme,

00:13:43.881 --> 00:13:48.136
I can look at my risk for type 2 diabetes;
I'm at almost twice the risk.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.377
I might want to watch how much dessert
I have at lunch, for example.

00:13:51.401 --> 00:13:52.752
It might change my behavior.

00:13:52.776 --> 00:13:55.018
Leveraging my knowledge
of my pharmacogenomics:

00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:58.377
how my genes modulate,
what my drugs do and what doses I need

00:13:58.401 --> 00:14:00.092
will become increasingly important,

00:14:00.116 --> 00:14:02.467
and once in the hands
of individuals and patients,

00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:05.013
will make better drug dosing
and selection available.

00:14:05.037 --> 00:14:07.879
So again, it's not just genes,
it's multiple details --

00:14:07.903 --> 00:14:10.022
our habits, our environmental exposures.

00:14:10.046 --> 00:14:12.857
When was the last time your doctor
asked where you've lived?

00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:15.592
Geomedicine: where you live,
what you've been exposed to,

00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:17.333
can dramatically affect your health.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:18.888
We can capture that information.

00:14:18.912 --> 00:14:20.821
Genomics, proteomics, the environment --

00:14:20.845 --> 00:14:23.710
all this data streaming at us
individually and as physicians:

00:14:23.734 --> 00:14:24.886
How do we manage it?

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.972
We're now entering the era
of systems medicine, systems biology,

00:14:27.996 --> 00:14:30.497
where we can start to integrate
all this information.

00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:33.329
And by looking at the patterns,
for example, in our blood,

00:14:33.353 --> 00:14:35.166
of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test,

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.725
we can look at patterns and detect disease
at a much earlier stage.

00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:42.183
This is called by Lee Hood,
the father of the field, P4 Medicine.

00:14:42.207 --> 00:14:44.833
We'll be predictive and know
what you're likely to have.

00:14:44.857 --> 00:14:47.680
We can be preventative;
that prevention can be personalized.

00:14:47.704 --> 00:14:50.233
More importantly,
it'll be increasingly participatory.

00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:52.096
Through websites like PatientsLikeMe

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.231
or managing your data on Microsoft
HealthVault or Google Health,

00:14:55.255 --> 00:14:57.402
leveraging this together
in participatory ways

00:14:57.426 --> 00:14:58.910
will be increasingly important.

00:14:58.934 --> 00:15:00.890
I'll finish up with exponentially better.

00:15:00.914 --> 00:15:03.431
We'd like to get therapies
better and more effective.

00:15:03.455 --> 00:15:05.936
Today we treat high blood pressure
mostly with pills.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.347
What if we take a new device,

00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:10.257
knock out the nerve vessels
that help mediate blood pressure,

00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:12.886
and in a single therapy,
basically cure hypertension?

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.971
This is a new device
doing essentially that.

00:15:14.995 --> 00:15:17.057
It should be on the market
in a year or two.

00:15:17.081 --> 00:15:19.185
How about more targeted
therapies for cancer?

00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:22.758
I'm an oncologist and know that most
of what we give is essentially poison.

00:15:22.782 --> 00:15:26.571
We learned at Stanford and other places
that we can discover cancer stem cells,

00:15:26.595 --> 00:15:29.823
the ones that seem to be really
responsible for disease relapse.

00:15:29.847 --> 00:15:31.766
So if you think of cancer as a weed,

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.683
we often can whack the weed away
and it seems to shrink,

00:15:34.707 --> 00:15:35.875
but it often comes back.

00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:37.636
So we're attacking the wrong target.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.122
The cancer stem cells remain,

00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:41.402
and the tumor can return
months or years later.

00:15:41.426 --> 00:15:43.907
We're now learning to identify
the cancer stem cells

00:15:43.931 --> 00:15:47.047
and identify those as targets
and go for the long-term cure.

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:49.364
We're entering the era
of personalized oncology,

00:15:49.388 --> 00:15:51.751
the ability to leverage
all of this data together,

00:15:51.775 --> 00:15:52.926
analyze the tumor

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:56.264
and come up with a real, specific cocktail
for the individual patient.

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:58.121
I'll close with regenerative medicine.

00:15:58.145 --> 00:15:59.887
I've studied a lot about stem cells.

00:15:59.911 --> 00:16:02.113
Embryonic stem cells
are particularly powerful.

00:16:02.137 --> 00:16:04.248
We have adult stem cells
throughout our body;

00:16:04.272 --> 00:16:06.397
we use those in bone marrow
transplantation.

00:16:06.421 --> 00:16:10.223
Geron, last year, started the first trial
using human embryonic stem cells

00:16:10.247 --> 00:16:11.812
to treat spinal cord injuries.

00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:13.886
Still a phase I trial, but evolving.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.683
We've been using adult stem cells
in clinical trials for about 15 years

00:16:17.707 --> 00:16:21.286
to approach a whole range of topics,
particularly cardiovascular disease.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.026
If we take our own bone marrow cells
and treat a patient with a heart attack,

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.962
we can see much improved
heart function and better survival

00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:30.939
using our own bone marrow derived cells
after a heart attack.

00:16:30.963 --> 00:16:32.999
I invented a device
called the MarrowMiner,

00:16:33.023 --> 00:16:35.460
a much less invasive way
for harvesting bone marrow.

00:16:35.484 --> 00:16:38.743
It's now been FDA approved;
hopefully on the market in the next year.

00:16:38.767 --> 00:16:40.644
Hopefully you can appreciate the device

00:16:40.668 --> 00:16:44.438
going through the patient's body removing
bone marrow, not with 200 punctures,

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:46.855
but with a single puncture,
under local anesthesia.

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:48.463
Where is stem-cell therapy going?

00:16:48.487 --> 00:16:49.638
If you think about it,

00:16:49.662 --> 00:16:53.137
every cell in your body has the same DNA
you had when you were an embryo.

00:16:53.161 --> 00:16:55.105
We can now reprogram your skin cells

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:58.042
to actually act like a pluripotent
embryonic stem cell

00:16:58.066 --> 00:17:01.714
and utilize those, potentially, to treat
multiple organs in the same patient,

00:17:01.738 --> 00:17:03.461
making personalized stem cell lines.

00:17:03.485 --> 00:17:06.270
I think there'll be a new era
of your own stem cell banking

00:17:06.294 --> 00:17:09.762
to have in the freezer your own cardiac
cells, myocytes and neural cells

00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:12.139
to use them in the future,
should you need them.

00:17:12.163 --> 00:17:15.385
We're integrating this now
with a whole era of cellular engineering,

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:18.977
and integrating exponential technologies
for essentially 3D organ printing,

00:17:19.001 --> 00:17:20.685
replacing the ink with cells,

00:17:20.709 --> 00:17:23.506
and essentially building
and reconstructing a 3D organ.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.056
That's where things are heading.

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.241
Still very early days,

00:17:26.265 --> 00:17:29.012
but I think, as integration
of exponential technologies,

00:17:29.036 --> 00:17:30.200
this is the example.

00:17:30.224 --> 00:17:32.711
So in closing, as you think
about technology trends

00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:34.575
and how to impact health and medicine,

00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:36.576
we're entering an era of miniaturization,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.822
decentralization and personalization.

00:17:38.846 --> 00:17:40.654
And by pulling these things together,

00:17:40.678 --> 00:17:43.663
if we start to think about
how to understand and leverage them,

00:17:43.687 --> 00:17:47.038
we're going to empower the patient,
enable the doctor, enhance wellness

00:17:47.062 --> 00:17:49.509
and begin to cure the well
before they get sick.

00:17:49.533 --> 00:17:53.071
Because I know as a doctor, if someone
comes to me with stage I disease,

00:17:53.095 --> 00:17:54.886
I'm thrilled; we can often cure them.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.080
But often it's too late,

00:17:56.104 --> 00:17:58.233
and it's stage III or IV
cancer, for example.

00:17:58.257 --> 00:18:00.372
So by leveraging
these technologies together,

00:18:00.396 --> 00:18:03.633
I think we'll enter a new era
that I like to call stage 0 medicine.

00:18:03.657 --> 00:18:06.926
And as a cancer doctor,
I'm looking forward to being out of a job.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.172
Thanks very much.

00:18:08.196 --> 00:18:10.174
(Applause)

00:18:10.198 --> 00:18:11.895
Host: Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:13.719
(Applause)

00:18:13.743 --> 00:18:15.743
Take a bow, take a bow.
