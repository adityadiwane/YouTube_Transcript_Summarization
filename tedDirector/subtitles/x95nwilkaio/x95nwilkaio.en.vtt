00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.158
So when I was in Morocco,

00:00:15.158 --> 00:00:17.692
in Casablanca, not so long ago,

00:00:17.692 --> 00:00:22.168
I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza.

00:00:22.168 --> 00:00:25.505
Faiza showed me photos of her infant son

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:31.640
and she told me the story of his conception,
pregnancy, and delivery.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.600
It was a remarkable tale,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.280
but Faiza saved the best for last.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.850
"You know, I am a virgin," she told me.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.254
"I have two medical certificates to prove it."

00:00:45.254 --> 00:00:47.878
This is the modern Middle East,

00:00:47.878 --> 00:00:50.510
where two millennia after the coming of Christ,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.738
virgin births are still a fact of life.

00:00:54.738 --> 00:01:00.395
Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard 
over the years, traveling across the Arab region

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:03.683
talking to people about sex.

00:01:03.683 --> 00:01:06.899
Now, I know this might sound like a dream job,

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.167
or possibly a highly dubious occupation,

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:13.523
but for me, it's something else altogether.

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:16.111
I'm half Egyptian, and I'm Muslim.

00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.902
But I grew up in Canada, far from my Arab roots.

00:01:19.902 --> 00:01:22.536
Like so many who straddle East and West,

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:27.459
I've been drawn, over the years, to try to better
understand my origins.

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:31.579
That I chose to look at sex comes from 
my background in HIV/AIDS,

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.666
as a writer and a researcher and an activist.

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:40.790
Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic
in the Middle East and North Africa,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.335
which is one of only two regions in the world
where HIV/AIDS is still on the rise.

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:50.376
Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:53.100
with which to study any society,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.609
because what happens in our intimate lives

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.783
is reflected by forces on a bigger stage:

00:01:59.783 --> 00:02:05.857
in politics and economics, in religion and tradition, 
in gender and generations.

00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:09.144
As I found, if you really want to know a people,

00:02:09.144 --> 00:02:13.668
you start by looking inside their bedrooms.

00:02:13.668 --> 00:02:17.860
Now to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.521
But running across it are three red lines --

00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:25.735
these are topics you are not supposed 
to challenge in word or deed.

00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:28.150
The first of these is politics.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.578
But the Arab Spring has changed all that,

00:02:30.578 --> 00:02:35.600
in uprisings which have blossomed 
across the region since 2011.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.461
Now while those in power, old and new,

00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:41.263
continue to cling to business as usual,

00:02:41.263 --> 00:02:43.869
millions are still pushing back,

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:48.984
and pushing forward to what they hope
will be a better life.

00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:52.164
That second red line is religion.

00:02:52.164 --> 00:02:54.995
But now religion and politics are connected,

00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:58.139
with the rise of such groups as the 
Muslim Brotherhood.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.599
And some people, at least, are starting 
to ask questions

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.667
about the role of Islam in public and private life.

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:10.418
You know, as for that third red line, 
that off-limits subject,

00:03:10.418 --> 00:03:12.196
what do you think it might be?

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:13.258
Audience: Sex.

00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:14.558
Shereen El Feki: Louder, I can't hear you.

00:03:14.558 --> 00:03:15.414
Audience: Sex.

00:03:15.414 --> 00:03:17.036
SEF: Again, please don't be shy.

00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:18.088
Audience: Sex.

00:03:18.088 --> 00:03:25.145
SEF: Absolutely, that's right, it's sex. (Laughter)

00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:31.353
Across the Arab region, the only accepted
context for sex is marriage --

00:03:31.353 --> 00:03:35.131
approved by your parents, sanctioned by religion

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:37.671
and registered by the state.

00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:40.554
Marriage is your ticket to adulthood.

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:44.379
If you don't tie the knot, you can't 
move out of your parents' place,

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.680
and you're not supposed to be having sex,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.827
and you're definitely not supposed 
to be having children.

00:03:49.827 --> 00:03:53.193
It's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress

00:03:53.193 --> 00:03:57.658
which resists any assault, any alternative.

00:03:57.658 --> 00:04:01.666
And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:06.639
against premarital sex, against condoms,

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.583
against abortion, against homosexuality,

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.754
you name it.

00:04:11.754 --> 00:04:14.978
Faiza was living proof of this.

00:04:14.978 --> 00:04:19.259
Her virginity statement was 
not a piece of wishful thinking.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.582
Although the major religions of the region
extoll premarital chastity,

00:04:24.582 --> 00:04:27.886
in a patriarchy, boys will be boys.

00:04:27.886 --> 00:04:29.839
Men have sex before marriage,

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:33.629
and people more or less turn a blind eye.

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.845
Not so for women,

00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:38.889
who are expected to be virgins 
on their wedding night --

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.139
that is, to turn up with your hymen intact.

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.814
This is not a question of individual concern,

00:04:46.814 --> 00:04:51.956
this is a matter of family honor, 
and in particular, men's honor.

00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:53.714
And so women and their relatives

00:04:53.714 --> 00:04:58.073
will go to great lengths to preserve 
this tiny piece of anatomy --

00:04:58.073 --> 00:05:00.278
from female genital mutilation,

00:05:00.278 --> 00:05:04.639
to virginity testing, to hymen repair surgery.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.645
Faiza chose a different route:

00:05:07.645 --> 00:05:10.028
non-vaginal sex.

00:05:10.028 --> 00:05:12.637
Only she became pregnant all the same.

00:05:12.637 --> 00:05:15.377
But Faiza didn't actually realize this,

00:05:15.377 --> 00:05:19.152
because there's so little 
sexuality education in schools,

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:23.174
and so little communication in the family.

00:05:23.174 --> 00:05:25.929
When her condition became hard to hide,

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:30.376
Faiza's mother helped her flee 
her father and brothers.

00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:33.397
This is because honor killings are a real threat

00:05:33.397 --> 00:05:37.171
for untold numbers of women in the Arab region.

00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:42.221
And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at 
a hospital in Casablanca,

00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:44.898
the man who offered to help her,

00:05:44.898 --> 00:05:48.262
instead tried to rape her.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.459
Sadly, Faiza is not alone.

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.245
In Egypt, where my research is focused,

00:05:55.245 --> 00:06:00.843
I have seen plenty of trouble 
in and out of the citadel.

00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:04.182
There are legions of young men

00:06:04.182 --> 00:06:06.289
who can't afford to get married,

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.713
because marriage has become 
a very expensive proposition.

00:06:09.713 --> 00:06:13.272
They are expected to bear the burden
of costs in married life,

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:15.576
but they can't find jobs.

00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:18.750
This is one of the major drivers 
of the recent uprisings,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.915
and it is one of the reasons for the 
rising age of marriage

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:24.946
in much of the Arab region.

00:06:24.946 --> 00:06:27.721
There are career women who want to get married,

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.319
but can't find a husband,

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.504
because they defy gender expectations,

00:06:32.504 --> 00:06:36.291
or as one young female doctor 
in Tunisia put it to me,

00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.998
"The women, they are becoming more and more open.

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:44.801
But the man, he is still at the prehistoric stage."

00:06:44.801 --> 00:06:48.691
And then there are men and women who 
cross the heterosexual line,

00:06:48.691 --> 00:06:50.593
who have sex with their own sex,

00:06:50.593 --> 00:06:53.602
or who have a different gender identity.

00:06:53.602 --> 00:06:57.555
They are on the receiving end of laws
which punish their activities,

00:06:57.555 --> 00:06:59.613
even their appearance.

00:06:59.613 --> 00:07:03.448
And they face a daily struggle with social stigma,

00:07:03.448 --> 00:07:05.083
with family despair,

00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:09.251
and with religious fire and brimstone.

00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:13.449
Now, it's not as if it's all rosy 
in the marital bed either.

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:15.975
Couples who are looking for greater happiness,

00:07:15.975 --> 00:07:18.614
greater sexual happiness in their married lives,

00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:20.973
but are at a loss of how to achieve it,

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:25.495
especially wives, who are afraid 
of being seen as bad women

00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:28.699
if they show some spark in the bedroom.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.623
And then there are those whose marriages

00:07:30.623 --> 00:07:33.729
are actually a veil for prostitution.

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:35.887
They have been sold by their families,

00:07:35.887 --> 00:07:38.768
often to wealthy Arab tourists.

00:07:38.768 --> 00:07:44.369
This is just one face of a booming 
sex trade across the Arab region.

00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:48.557
Now raise your hand if any of 
this is sounding familiar to you,

00:07:48.557 --> 00:07:52.527
from your part of the world.

00:07:52.527 --> 00:07:58.537
Yeah. It's not as if the Arab world
has a monopoly on sexual hangups.

00:07:58.537 --> 00:08:01.507
And although we don't yet have
an Arab Kinsey Report

00:08:01.507 --> 00:08:05.920
to tell us exactly what's happening 
inside bedrooms across the Arab region,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.863
It's pretty clear that 
something is not right.

00:08:09.863 --> 00:08:12.551
Double standards for men and women,

00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:15.810
sex as a source of shame,

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.961
family control limiting individual choices,

00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:23.708
and a vast gulf between appearance and reality:

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:25.278
what people are doing

00:08:25.294 --> 00:08:27.639
and what they're willing to admit to,

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:31.615
and a general reluctance to move 
beyond private whispers

00:08:31.615 --> 00:08:35.703
to a serious and sustained public discussion.

00:08:35.703 --> 00:08:39.192
As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me,

00:08:39.192 --> 00:08:42.517
"Here, sex is the opposite of sport.

00:08:42.517 --> 00:08:44.683
Football, everybody talks about it,

00:08:44.683 --> 00:08:46.653
but hardly anyone plays.

00:08:46.653 --> 00:08:48.626
But sex, everybody is doing it,

00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:52.775
but nobody wants to talk about it."
(Laughter)

00:08:52.775 --> 00:09:03.348
(Music) (In Arabic)

00:09:03.348 --> 00:09:06.007
SEF: I want to give you a piece of advice,

00:09:06.007 --> 00:09:10.101
which if you follow it,
will make you happy in life.

00:09:10.101 --> 00:09:12.476
When your husband reaches out to you,

00:09:12.476 --> 00:09:15.288
when he seizes a part of your body,

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:18.654
sigh deeply and look at him lustily.

00:09:18.654 --> 00:09:21.177
When he penetrates you with his penis,

00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:26.470
try to talk flirtatiously and 
move yourself in harmony with him.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.913
Hot stuff!

00:09:27.928 --> 00:09:29.922
And it might sound that these handy hints

00:09:29.922 --> 00:09:33.033
come from "The Joy of Sex" or YouPorn.

00:09:33.033 --> 00:09:36.885
But in fact, they come from
a 10th-century Arabic book

00:09:36.885 --> 00:09:39.217
called "The Encyclopedia of Pleasure,"

00:09:39.217 --> 00:09:43.365
which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia,

00:09:43.365 --> 00:09:46.438
and everything in between.

00:09:46.438 --> 00:09:50.496
The Encyclopedia is just one 
in a long line of Arabic erotica,

00:09:50.496 --> 00:09:53.725
much of it written by religious scholars.

00:09:53.725 --> 00:09:56.086
Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad,

00:09:56.086 --> 00:09:58.503
there is a rich tradition in Islam

00:09:58.503 --> 00:10:01.083
of talking frankly about sex:

00:10:01.083 --> 00:10:04.378
not just its problems, but also its pleasures,

00:10:04.378 --> 00:10:08.953
and not just for men, but also for women.

00:10:08.953 --> 00:10:14.820
A thousand years ago, we used to have 
whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.973
Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature,

00:10:18.973 --> 00:10:22.565
position and preference, a body of language

00:10:22.565 --> 00:10:29.096
that was rich enough to make up the body 
of the woman you see on this page.

00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:32.699
Today, this history is largely unknown 
in the Arab region.

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:37.503
Even by educated people, who often
feel more comfortable talking about sex

00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:42.481
in a foreign language than they do
in their own tongue.

00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:46.204
Today's sexual landscape looks
a lot like Europe and America

00:10:46.204 --> 00:10:48.937
on the brink of the sexual revolution.

00:10:48.937 --> 00:10:51.985
But while the West has opened on sex,

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:58.618
what we found is that Arab societies appear
to have been moving in the opposite direction.

00:10:58.618 --> 00:11:00.873
In Egypt and many of its neighbors,

00:11:00.873 --> 00:11:03.750
this closing down is part of a wider closing

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.333
in political, social and cultural thought.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:11.389
And it is the product of a complex historical process,

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:15.182
one which has gained ground with the rise 
of Islamic conservatism

00:11:15.182 --> 00:11:18.183
since the late 1970s.

00:11:18.183 --> 00:11:21.858
"Just say no" is what conservatives 
around the world

00:11:21.858 --> 00:11:26.320
say to any challenge to the sexual status quo.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.606
In the Arab region, they brand these attempts
as a Western conspiracy

00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:34.908
to undermine traditional Arab
and Islamic values.

00:11:34.908 --> 00:11:36.907
But what's really at stake here

00:11:36.907 --> 00:11:40.801
is one of their most powerful tools of control:

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:44.958
sex wrapped up in religion.

00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.103
But history shows us that 
even as recently

00:11:48.103 --> 00:11:51.012
as our fathers' and grandfathers' day,

00:11:51.012 --> 00:11:53.961
there have been times of greater pragmatism,

00:11:53.961 --> 00:11:59.481
and tolerance, and a willingness
to consider other interpretations:

00:11:59.481 --> 00:12:06.400
be it abortion, or masturbation, or even 
the incendiary topic of homosexuality.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.266
It is not black and white,
as conservatives would have us believe.

00:12:11.266 --> 00:12:14.473
In these, as in so many other matters,

00:12:14.473 --> 00:12:17.894
Islam offers us at least 50 shades of gray.

00:12:17.894 --> 00:12:20.308
(Laughter)

00:12:20.308 --> 00:12:21.457
Over my travels,

00:12:21.457 --> 00:12:24.065
I've met men and women 
across the Arab region

00:12:24.065 --> 00:12:27.058
who've been exploring that spectrum --

00:12:27.058 --> 00:12:29.762
sexologists who are trying
to help couples

00:12:29.762 --> 00:12:33.684
find greater happiness in their marriages,

00:12:33.684 --> 00:12:39.366
innovators who are managing to get 
sexuality education into schools,

00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:41.733
small groups of men and women,

00:12:41.733 --> 00:12:44.449
lesbian, gay, transgendered, transsexual,

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:46.130
who are reaching out to their peers

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:50.788
with online initiatives and real-world support.

00:12:50.788 --> 00:12:54.751
Women, and increasingly men,
who are starting to speak out

00:12:54.751 --> 00:12:57.837
and push back against sexual violence

00:12:57.837 --> 00:13:01.393
on the streets and in the home.

00:13:01.393 --> 00:13:06.126
Groups that are trying to help sex workers
protect themselves against HIV

00:13:06.126 --> 00:13:08.993
and other occupational hazards,

00:13:08.993 --> 00:13:12.921
and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza

00:13:12.921 --> 00:13:18.702
find a place in society, and critically,
stay with their kids.

00:13:18.702 --> 00:13:22.113
Now these efforts are small, 
they're often underfunded,

00:13:22.113 --> 00:13:25.416
and they face formidable opposition.

00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:28.944
But I am optimistic that, in the long run,

00:13:28.944 --> 00:13:32.321
times are changing, and they and their ideas

00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:34.250
will gain ground.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:39.902
Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region
through dramatic confrontation,

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:43.289
beating or indeed baring of breasts,

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:45.754
but rather through negotiation.

00:13:45.754 --> 00:13:49.424
What we're talking here is not about a 
sexual revolution,

00:13:49.424 --> 00:13:53.898
but a sexual evolution, 
learning from other parts of the world,

00:13:53.898 --> 00:13:56.274
adapting to local conditions,

00:13:56.274 --> 00:14:02.161
forging our own path,
not following one blazed by another.

00:14:02.161 --> 00:14:08.604
That path, I hope, will one day lead us 
to the right to control our own bodies,

00:14:08.604 --> 00:14:11.674
and to access the information 
and services we need

00:14:11.674 --> 00:14:16.078
to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives.

00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:18.648
The right to express our ideas freely,

00:14:18.648 --> 00:14:23.303
to marry whom we choose, 
to choose our own partners,

00:14:23.303 --> 00:14:28.155
to be sexually active or not,
to decide whether to have children and when,

00:14:28.155 --> 00:14:34.534
all this without violence or force or discrimination.

00:14:34.534 --> 00:14:37.938
Now we are very far from this 
across the Arab region,

00:14:37.938 --> 00:14:41.045
and so much needs to change:

00:14:41.045 --> 00:14:44.973
law, education, media, the economy,

00:14:44.973 --> 00:14:47.846
the list goes on and on,

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:52.164
and it is the work of a generation, at least.

00:14:52.164 --> 00:14:55.326
But it begins with a journey that I myself have made,

00:14:55.326 --> 00:14:58.295
asking hard questions of received wisdoms

00:14:58.295 --> 00:15:00.103
in sexual life.

00:15:00.103 --> 00:15:04.616
And it is a journey which has
only served to strengthen my faith,

00:15:04.616 --> 00:15:08.134
and my appreciation of local histories and cultures

00:15:08.134 --> 00:15:13.929
by showing me possibilities 
where I once only saw absolutes.

00:15:13.929 --> 00:15:17.386
Now given the turmoil in many
countries in the Arab region,

00:15:17.386 --> 00:15:20.463
talking about sex, 
challenging the taboos,

00:15:20.463 --> 00:15:25.799
seeking alternatives might sound like
something of a luxury.

00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:28.591
But at this critical moment in history,

00:15:28.591 --> 00:15:32.969
if we do not anchor freedom and justice,

00:15:32.969 --> 00:15:34.601
dignity and equality,

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:39.843
privacy and autonomy in our personal lives,
in our sexual lives,

00:15:39.843 --> 00:15:44.144
we will find it very hard to achieve in public life.

00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:50.899
The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows,
and that is true for us all.

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:54.310
no matter where we live and love.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.826
Thank you.

00:15:55.826 --> 00:16:00.267
(Applause)
