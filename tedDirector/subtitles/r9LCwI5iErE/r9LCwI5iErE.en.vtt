00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:15.687
Probably a lot of you know
the story of the two salesmen

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:18.629
who went down to Africa in the 1900s.

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:21.293
They were sent down to find
if there was any opportunity

00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:22.525
for selling shoes,

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:24.877
and they wrote telegrams
back to Manchester.

00:00:25.473 --> 00:00:26.711
And one of them wrote,

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.897
"Situation hopeless. Stop.
They don't wear shoes."

00:00:30.452 --> 00:00:32.064
And the other one wrote,

00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:35.096
"Glorious opportunity.
They don't have any shoes yet."

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.420
(Laughter)

00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:39.603
Now, there's a similar situation
in the classical music world,

00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:43.536
because there are some people who think
that classical music is dying.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.872
And there are some of us
who think you ain't seen nothing yet.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.136
And rather than go
into statistics and trends,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.897
and tell you about all the orchestras
that are closing,

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.377
and the record companies that are folding,

00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:00.753
I thought we should do
an experiment tonight.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.479
Actually, it's not really an experiment,
because I know the outcome.

00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:05.762
(Laughter)

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:07.182
But it's like an experiment.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.031
Now, before we start --

00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:12.136
(Laughter)

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.598
Before we start, I need to do two things.

00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:18.697
One is I want to remind you
of what a seven-year-old child

00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:20.732
sounds like when he plays the piano.

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:22.865
Maybe you have this child at home.

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:24.346
He sounds something like this.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.936
(Music)

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:44.449
(Music ends)

00:01:44.473 --> 00:01:46.647
I see some of you recognize this child.

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:50.696
Now, if he practices for a year
and takes lessons, he's now eight

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.902
and he sounds like this.

00:01:51.926 --> 00:01:53.251
(Music)

00:01:58.054 --> 00:01:59.245
(Music ends)

00:01:59.269 --> 00:02:02.136
He practices for another year
and takes lessons -- he's nine.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.788
(Music)

00:02:07.323 --> 00:02:08.801
(Music ends)

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:12.109
Then he practices for another year
and takes lessons -- now he's 10.

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.354
(Music)

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.041
(Music ends)

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:19.818
At that point, they usually give up.

00:02:19.842 --> 00:02:21.136
(Laughter)

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.429
(Applause)

00:02:23.453 --> 00:02:27.136
Now, if you'd waited for one more year,
you would have heard this.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.265
(Music)

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.565
(Music ends)

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.769
Now, what happened was not
maybe what you thought,

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:42.592
which is, he suddenly
became passionate, engaged,

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:46.499
involved, got a new teacher,
he hit puberty, or whatever it is.

00:02:46.523 --> 00:02:50.021
What actually happened
was the impulses were reduced.

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:53.642
You see, the first time, he was playing
with an impulse on every note.

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:56.546
(Music)

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.918
And the second,
with an impulse every other note.

00:02:58.942 --> 00:03:01.056
(Music)

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.976
You can see it by looking at my head.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.716
(Laughter)

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.012
The nine-year-old put
an impulse on every four notes.

00:03:08.036 --> 00:03:10.136
(Music)

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.029
The 10-year-old, on every eight notes.

00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:14.136
(Music)

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.545
And the 11-year-old,
one impulse on the whole phrase.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.288
(Music)

00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:22.780
I don't know how
we got into this position.

00:03:22.804 --> 00:03:24.846
(Laughter)

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.993
I didn't say, "I'm going to move
my shoulder over, move my body."

00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:29.607
No, the music pushed me over,

00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:31.956
which is why I call it
one-buttock playing.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.683
(Music)

00:03:33.707 --> 00:03:35.063
It can be the other buttock.

00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:38.064
(Music)

00:03:38.548 --> 00:03:42.032
You know, a gentleman was once
watching a presentation I was doing,

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:43.976
when I was working with a young pianist.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.335
He was the president
of a corporation in Ohio.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.622
I was working with
this young pianist, and said,

00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:51.126
"The trouble with you
is you're a two-buttock player.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.910
You should be a one-buttock player."

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:54.814
I moved his body while he was playing.

00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:57.236
And suddenly, the music took off.
It took flight.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.708
The audience gasped
when they heard the difference.

00:03:59.732 --> 00:04:01.708
Then I got a letter from this gentleman.

00:04:01.732 --> 00:04:02.993
He said, "I was so moved.

00:04:03.017 --> 00:04:05.236
I went back and I transformed
my entire company

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.664
into a one-buttock company."

00:04:06.688 --> 00:04:10.136
(Laughter)

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.056
Now, the other thing I wanted
to do is to tell you about you.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.136
There are 1,600 people, I believe.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.850
My estimation is that probably 45 of you

00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:21.760
are absolutely passionate
about classical music.

00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:26.506
You adore classical music.
Your FM is always on that classical dial.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.136
You have CDs in your car,
and you go to the symphony,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.056
your children are playing instruments.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.755
You can't imagine your life
without classical music.

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.803
That's the first group, quite small.

00:04:35.827 --> 00:04:37.651
Then there's another bigger group.

00:04:37.675 --> 00:04:39.786
The people who don't mind classical music.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.820
(Laughter)

00:04:40.844 --> 00:04:42.889
You know, you've come home
from a long day,

00:04:42.913 --> 00:04:45.596
and you take a glass of wine,
and you put your feet up.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.240
A little Vivaldi in the background
doesn't do any harm.

00:04:48.264 --> 00:04:49.605
That's the second group.

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:50.937
Now comes the third group:

00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:53.161
people who never listen
to classical music.

00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:55.136
It's just simply not part of your life.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.005
You might hear it like second-hand
smoke at the airport ...

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:59.136
(Laughter)

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.446
-- and maybe a little bit
of a march from "Aida"

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.850
when you come into the hall.

00:05:02.874 --> 00:05:04.461
But otherwise, you never hear it.

00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:06.120
That's probably the largest group.

00:05:06.144 --> 00:05:07.889
And then there's a very small group.

00:05:07.913 --> 00:05:10.731
These are the people
who think they're tone-deaf.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.485
Amazing number of people think
they're tone-deaf.

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.866
Actually, I hear a lot,
"My husband is tone-deaf."

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:16.891
(Laughter)

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:18.970
Actually, you cannot be tone-deaf.

00:05:18.994 --> 00:05:20.216
Nobody is tone-deaf.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.720
If you were tone-deaf,
you couldn't change the gears

00:05:22.744 --> 00:05:24.623
on your car, in a stick shift car.

00:05:24.647 --> 00:05:26.560
You couldn't tell the difference between

00:05:26.584 --> 00:05:28.584
somebody from Texas
and somebody from Rome.

00:05:29.324 --> 00:05:31.118
And the telephone. The telephone.

00:05:31.142 --> 00:05:32.476
If your mother calls

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.676
on the miserable telephone,
she calls and says, "Hello,"

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.413
you not only know who it is,
you know what mood she's in.

00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:42.748
You have a fantastic ear.
Everybody has a fantastic ear.

00:05:42.772 --> 00:05:44.670
So nobody is tone-deaf.

00:05:44.694 --> 00:05:45.845
But I tell you what.

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:48.823
It doesn't work for me
to go on with this thing,

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:52.593
with such a wide gulf
between those who understand,

00:05:52.617 --> 00:05:55.023
love and are passionate
about classical music,

00:05:55.047 --> 00:05:57.769
and those who have
no relationship to it at all.

00:05:57.793 --> 00:06:00.276
The tone-deaf people,
they're no longer here.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.270
But even between those three categories,

00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:03.598
it's too wide a gulf.

00:06:03.622 --> 00:06:08.040
So I'm not going to go on
until every single person in this room,

00:06:08.064 --> 00:06:12.755
downstairs and in Aspen,
and everybody else looking,

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.624
will come to love
and understand classical music.

00:06:17.135 --> 00:06:18.843
So that's what we're going to do.

00:06:18.867 --> 00:06:24.441
Now, you notice that there is not
the slightest doubt in my mind

00:06:24.465 --> 00:06:27.185
that this is going to work,
if you look at my face, right?

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:31.136
It's one of the characteristics
of a leader that he not doubt

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.136
for one moment the capacity
of the people he's leading

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.323
to realize whatever he's dreaming.

00:06:38.053 --> 00:06:40.974
Imagine if Martin Luther King
had said, "I have a dream.

00:06:40.998 --> 00:06:43.208
Of course, I'm not sure
they'll be up to it."

00:06:43.232 --> 00:06:46.136
(Laughter)

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.501
All right. So I'm going
to take a piece of Chopin.

00:06:48.525 --> 00:06:50.786
This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.

00:06:51.358 --> 00:06:52.826
Some of you will know it.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.668
(Music)

00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:25.594
Do you know what I think
probably happened here?

00:07:25.618 --> 00:07:28.296
When I started, you thought,
"How beautiful that sounds."

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.692
(Music)

00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:43.231
"I don't think we should
go to the same place

00:07:43.255 --> 00:07:45.060
for our summer holidays next year."

00:07:45.084 --> 00:07:47.704
(Laughter)

00:07:47.728 --> 00:07:49.093
It's funny, isn't it?

00:07:49.117 --> 00:07:54.363
It's funny how those thoughts
kind of waft into your head.

00:07:54.387 --> 00:07:55.617
And of course --

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.501
(Applause)

00:07:57.525 --> 00:08:00.336
Of course, if the piece is long
and you've had a long day,

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.779
you might actually drift off.

00:08:01.803 --> 00:08:03.972
Then your companion
will dig you in the ribs

00:08:03.996 --> 00:08:07.027
and say, "Wake up! It's culture!"
And then you feel even worse.

00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:08.113
(Laughter)

00:08:08.137 --> 00:08:11.126
But has it ever occurred to you
that the reason you feel sleepy

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.962
in classical music is not
because of you, but because of us?

00:08:13.986 --> 00:08:15.823
Did anybody think while I was playing,

00:08:15.847 --> 00:08:17.807
"Why is he using so many impulses?"

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.938
If I'd done this with my head you
certainly would have thought it.

00:08:20.962 --> 00:08:23.102
(Music)

00:08:26.708 --> 00:08:27.858
(Music ends)

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:31.038
And for the rest of your life,
every time you hear classical music,

00:08:31.062 --> 00:08:34.842
you'll always be able to know
if you hear those impulses.

00:08:35.253 --> 00:08:37.236
So let's see what's really going on here.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.173
We have a B. This is a B.

00:08:40.197 --> 00:08:41.482
The next note is a C.

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.136
And the job of the C is to make the B sad.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.761
And it does, doesn't it?

00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:47.533
(Laughter)

00:08:47.557 --> 00:08:48.768
Composers know that.

00:08:48.792 --> 00:08:51.371
If they want sad music,
they just play those two notes.

00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:55.136
(Music)

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.691
But basically, it's just a B,
with four sads.

00:08:57.715 --> 00:09:00.136
(Laughter)

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.562
Now, it goes down to A.

00:09:03.055 --> 00:09:04.596
Now to G.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.846
And then to F.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.929
So we have B, A, G, F.

00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:10.136
And if we have B, A, G, F,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.747
what do we expect next?

00:09:11.771 --> 00:09:14.881
(Music)

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.748
That might have been a fluke.

00:09:16.772 --> 00:09:17.934
Let's try it again.

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.723
(Music)

00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:22.882
Oh, the TED choir.

00:09:22.906 --> 00:09:26.064
(Laughter)

00:09:26.088 --> 00:09:28.954
And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?

00:09:28.978 --> 00:09:30.180
Nobody is.

00:09:30.204 --> 00:09:32.049
You know, every village in Bangladesh

00:09:32.073 --> 00:09:36.931
and every hamlet in China
-- everybody knows:

00:09:36.955 --> 00:09:39.396
da, da, da, da -- da.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.372
Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.

00:09:41.396 --> 00:09:43.595
Chopin didn't want to reach the E there,

00:09:43.619 --> 00:09:45.150
because what will have happened?

00:09:45.974 --> 00:09:48.341
It will be over, like Hamlet.
Do you remember?

00:09:48.365 --> 00:09:49.573
Act One, scene three,

00:09:49.597 --> 00:09:51.615
he finds out his uncle killed his father.

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:54.377
He keeps on going up
to his uncle and almost killing him.

00:09:54.401 --> 00:09:57.568
And then he backs away,
he goes up to him again, almost kills him.

00:09:57.592 --> 00:09:59.636
The critics sitting in the back row there,

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.136
they have to have an opinion,
so they say, "Hamlet is a procrastinator."

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.685
Or they say, "Hamlet has
an Oedipus complex."

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:07.958
No, otherwise the play
would be over, stupid.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.067
(Laughter)

00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:11.683
That's why Shakespeare puts
all that stuff in Hamlet --

00:10:11.707 --> 00:10:13.772
Ophelia going mad,
the play within the play,

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:15.756
and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.423
That's in order to delay --

00:10:17.447 --> 00:10:19.082
until Act Five, he can kill him.

00:10:19.106 --> 00:10:21.017
It's the same with the Chopin.

00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:23.453
He's just about to reach the E,

00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:26.080
and he says, "Oops, better
go back up and do it again."

00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:28.223
So he does it again.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.928
Now, he gets excited.

00:10:29.952 --> 00:10:32.145
(Music)

00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:34.136
That's excitement, don't worry about it.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.991
Now, he gets to F-sharp,
and finally he goes down to E,

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.296
but it's the wrong chord --

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.533
because the chord
he's looking for is this one,

00:10:42.979 --> 00:10:44.129
and instead he does ...

00:10:44.764 --> 00:10:47.312
Now, we call that a deceptive cadence,

00:10:47.336 --> 00:10:48.548
because it deceives us.

00:10:48.572 --> 00:10:51.063
I tell my students,
"If you have a deceptive cadence,

00:10:51.087 --> 00:10:53.306
raise your eyebrows,
and everybody will know."

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.238
(Laughter)

00:10:55.262 --> 00:10:58.943
(Applause)

00:10:58.967 --> 00:11:00.634
Right.

00:11:00.658 --> 00:11:02.580
He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.

00:11:02.604 --> 00:11:03.799
Now, he tries E again.

00:11:03.823 --> 00:11:05.285
That chord doesn't work.

00:11:05.309 --> 00:11:07.705
Now, he tries the E again.
That chord doesn't work.

00:11:07.729 --> 00:11:09.838
Now, he tries E again,
and that doesn't work.

00:11:10.284 --> 00:11:11.434
And then finally ...

00:11:14.326 --> 00:11:17.179
There was a gentleman
in the front row who went, "Mmm."

00:11:17.203 --> 00:11:18.453
(Laughter)

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:21.833
It's the same gesture
he makes when he comes home

00:11:21.857 --> 00:11:24.543
after a long day, turns off
the key in his car and says,

00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:25.819
"Aah, I'm home."

00:11:25.843 --> 00:11:27.469
Because we all know where home is.

00:11:27.493 --> 00:11:30.733
So this is a piece which goes
from away to home.

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:33.956
I'm going to play it all the way through
and you're going to follow.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.604
B, C, B, C, B, C, B --

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:37.320
down to A, down to G, down to F.

00:11:37.344 --> 00:11:39.932
Almost goes to E, but otherwise
the play would be over.

00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:41.971
He goes back up to B,
he gets very excited.

00:11:41.995 --> 00:11:43.459
Goes to F-sharp. Goes to E.

00:11:43.483 --> 00:11:45.537
It's the wrong chord.
It's the wrong chord.

00:11:45.561 --> 00:11:47.902
And finally goes to E, and it's home.

00:11:47.926 --> 00:11:51.362
And what you're going to see
is one-buttock playing.

00:11:51.386 --> 00:11:53.136
(Laughter)

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.336
Because for me, to join the B to the E,

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.279
I have to stop thinking
about every single note along the way,

00:12:02.303 --> 00:12:07.057
and start thinking about the long,
long line from B to E.

00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:12.172
You know, we were just in South Africa,
and you can't go to South Africa

00:12:12.196 --> 00:12:14.792
without thinking of Mandela
in jail for 27 years.

00:12:15.483 --> 00:12:17.308
What was he thinking about? Lunch?

00:12:17.698 --> 00:12:21.136
No, he was thinking
about the vision for South Africa

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.705
and for human beings.

00:12:22.729 --> 00:12:25.682
This is about vision.
This is about the long line.

00:12:25.706 --> 00:12:27.967
Like the bird who flies over the field

00:12:27.991 --> 00:12:31.733
and doesn't care about the fences
underneath, all right?

00:12:31.757 --> 00:12:34.852
So now, you're going to follow
the line all the way from B to E.

00:12:34.876 --> 00:12:38.225
And I've one last request before I play
this piece all the way through.

00:12:38.788 --> 00:12:42.607
Would you think of somebody who you adore,

00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:44.007
who's no longer there?

00:12:44.676 --> 00:12:47.036
A beloved grandmother, a lover --

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.183
somebody in your life
who you love with all your heart,

00:12:51.207 --> 00:12:53.276
but that person is no longer with you.

00:12:54.422 --> 00:12:56.384
Bring that person into your mind,

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:58.385
and at the same time,

00:12:58.409 --> 00:13:01.867
follow the line all the way from B to E,

00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:04.949
and you'll hear everything
that Chopin had to say.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.520
(Music)

00:14:57.239 --> 00:14:58.721
(Music ends)

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
(Applause)

00:15:08.682 --> 00:15:10.676
Now, you may be wondering --

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.700
(Applause)

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:16.980
(Applause ends)

00:15:17.004 --> 00:15:18.893
You may be wondering why I'm clapping.

00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:20.831
Well, I did this at a school in Boston

00:15:20.855 --> 00:15:24.052
with about 70 seventh
graders, 12-year-olds.

00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:26.413
I did exactly what I did with you,

00:15:26.437 --> 00:15:28.294
and I explained the whole thing.

00:15:28.318 --> 00:15:30.136
At the end, they went crazy, clapping.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.946
I was clapping. They were clapping.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.828
Finally, I said, "Why am I clapping?"

00:15:33.852 --> 00:15:36.186
And one of them said,
"Because we were listening."

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.136
(Laughter)

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.354
Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people,

00:15:43.378 --> 00:15:45.718
involved in all sorts of different things,

00:15:45.742 --> 00:15:49.567
listening, understanding and being moved

00:15:49.591 --> 00:15:50.908
by a piece by Chopin.

00:15:51.671 --> 00:15:52.917
Now, that is something.

00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:55.648
Am I sure that every single
person followed that,

00:15:55.672 --> 00:15:57.267
understood it, was moved by it?

00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:58.592
Of course, I can't be sure.

00:15:58.616 --> 00:16:00.877
But I'll tell you what happened
to me in Ireland

00:16:00.901 --> 00:16:02.552
during the Troubles, 10 years ago,

00:16:02.576 --> 00:16:05.501
and I was working with some Catholic
and Protestant kids

00:16:05.525 --> 00:16:07.956
on conflict resolution.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.662
And I did this with them --

00:16:09.686 --> 00:16:12.169
a risky thing to do,
because they were street kids.

00:16:13.136 --> 00:16:15.625
And one of them came to me
the next morning

00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:16.850
and he said,

00:16:16.874 --> 00:16:19.747
"You know, I've never listened
to classical music in my life,

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:21.880
but when you played
that shopping piece ..."

00:16:21.904 --> 00:16:23.674
(Laughter)

00:16:23.698 --> 00:16:27.160
He said, "My brother was shot last year
and I didn't cry for him.

00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:29.943
But last night,
when you played that piece,

00:16:29.967 --> 00:16:31.781
he was the one I was thinking about.

00:16:32.672 --> 00:16:34.740
And I felt the tears
streaming down my face.

00:16:34.764 --> 00:16:37.293
And it felt really
good to cry for my brother."

00:16:37.886 --> 00:16:40.342
So I made up my mind at that moment

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:44.223
that classical music is for everybody.

00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:46.239
Everybody.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.657
Now, how would you walk --

00:16:49.681 --> 00:16:53.490
my profession, the music profession
doesn't see it that way.

00:16:53.934 --> 00:16:57.149
They say three percent of the population
likes classical music.

00:16:57.173 --> 00:17:00.427
If only we could move it to four percent,
our problems would be over.

00:17:00.451 --> 00:17:01.490
(Laughter)

00:17:01.514 --> 00:17:05.140
How would you walk?
How would you talk? How would you be?

00:17:05.164 --> 00:17:08.499
If you thought, "Three percent
of the population likes classical music,

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:10.523
if only we could move it to four percent."

00:17:10.547 --> 00:17:12.664
How would you walk or talk?
How would you be?

00:17:12.688 --> 00:17:15.123
If you thought, "Everybody
loves classical music --

00:17:15.147 --> 00:17:17.158
they just haven't found out about it yet."

00:17:17.563 --> 00:17:20.150
See, these are totally different worlds.

00:17:20.547 --> 00:17:22.822
Now, I had an amazing experience.

00:17:22.846 --> 00:17:24.088
I was 45 years old,

00:17:24.112 --> 00:17:25.895
I'd been conducting for 20 years,

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:28.119
and I suddenly had a realization.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.773
The conductor of an orchestra
doesn't make a sound.

00:17:32.638 --> 00:17:34.995
My picture appears
on the front of the CD --

00:17:35.019 --> 00:17:37.921
(Laughter)

00:17:37.945 --> 00:17:39.946
But the conductor doesn't make a sound.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.793
He depends, for his power,

00:17:41.817 --> 00:17:44.669
on his ability to make
other people powerful.

00:17:45.645 --> 00:17:47.549
And that changed everything for me.

00:17:47.573 --> 00:17:49.306
It was totally life-changing.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.843
People in my orchestra said,

00:17:50.867 --> 00:17:53.099
"Ben, what happened?"
That's what happened.

00:17:53.123 --> 00:17:57.823
I realized my job was to awaken
possibility in other people.

00:17:58.853 --> 00:18:01.562
And of course, I wanted to know
whether I was doing that.

00:18:01.586 --> 00:18:02.775
How do you find out?

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:04.110
You look at their eyes.

00:18:04.134 --> 00:18:07.086
If their eyes are shining,
you know you're doing it.

00:18:08.033 --> 00:18:10.396
You could light up a village
with this guy's eyes.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.436
(Laughter)

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.709
Right. So if the eyes are shining,
you know you're doing it.

00:18:14.733 --> 00:18:17.421
If the eyes are not shining,
you get to ask a question.

00:18:17.445 --> 00:18:18.851
And this is the question:

00:18:18.875 --> 00:18:21.439
who am I being

00:18:21.463 --> 00:18:23.732
that my players' eyes are not shining?

00:18:23.756 --> 00:18:25.613
We can do that with our children, too.

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:28.509
Who am I being,

00:18:28.533 --> 00:18:30.699
that my children's eyes are not shining?

00:18:31.223 --> 00:18:33.611
That's a totally different world.

00:18:33.635 --> 00:18:38.700
Now, we're all about to end
this magical, on-the-mountain week,

00:18:38.724 --> 00:18:40.460
we're going back into the world.

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:44.740
And I say, it's appropriate
for us to ask the question,

00:18:44.764 --> 00:18:49.037
who are we being as we go back
out into the world?

00:18:49.731 --> 00:18:52.081
And you know, I have
a definition of success.

00:18:52.105 --> 00:18:53.341
For me, it's very simple.

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.371
It's not about wealth and fame and power.

00:18:55.395 --> 00:18:57.824
It's about how many shining eyes
I have around me.

00:18:58.374 --> 00:19:00.734
So now, I have one last thought,

00:19:00.758 --> 00:19:05.090
which is that it really makes
a difference what we say --

00:19:05.114 --> 00:19:06.907
the words that come out of our mouth.

00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:10.441
I learned this from a woman
who survived Auschwitz,

00:19:10.465 --> 00:19:11.933
one of the rare survivors.

00:19:11.957 --> 00:19:14.854
She went to Auschwitz
when she was 15 years old.

00:19:16.163 --> 00:19:17.313
And ...

00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:21.167
And her brother was eight,

00:19:21.191 --> 00:19:22.924
and the parents were lost.

00:19:23.944 --> 00:19:28.312
And she told me this, she said,

00:19:28.336 --> 00:19:30.788
"We were in the train going to Auschwitz,

00:19:30.812 --> 00:19:33.685
and I looked down and saw
my brother's shoes were missing.

00:19:34.255 --> 00:19:37.565
I said, 'Why are you so stupid,
can't you keep your things together

00:19:37.589 --> 00:19:38.807
for goodness' sake?'"

00:19:38.831 --> 00:19:41.498
The way an elder sister might speak
to a younger brother.

00:19:43.445 --> 00:19:46.160
Unfortunately, it was the last
thing she ever said to him,

00:19:46.184 --> 00:19:47.708
because she never saw him again.

00:19:47.732 --> 00:19:48.999
He did not survive.

00:19:49.532 --> 00:19:52.057
And so when she came out
of Auschwitz, she made a vow.

00:19:52.388 --> 00:19:53.618
She told me this.

00:19:53.642 --> 00:19:57.062
She said, "I walked out
of Auschwitz into life

00:19:57.086 --> 00:19:58.469
and I made a vow.

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:00.093
And the vow was,

00:20:00.117 --> 00:20:05.255
"I will never say anything that couldn't
stand as the last thing I ever say."

00:20:06.733 --> 00:20:08.330
Now, can we do that? No.

00:20:08.354 --> 00:20:11.210
And we'll make ourselves wrong
and others wrong.

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:14.754
But it is a possibility to live into.

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:17.071
Thank you.

00:20:17.095 --> 00:20:20.095
(Applause)

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:25.055
Shining eyes.

00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:26.496
(Applause)

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.896
Shining eyes.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.920
(Applause)

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.628
Thank you, thank you.
