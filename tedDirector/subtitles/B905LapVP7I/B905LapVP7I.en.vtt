00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:14.846
So there's a lot of valid
concern these days

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.075
that our technology is getting so smart

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.847
that we've put ourselves
on the path to a jobless future.

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:23.654
And I think the example
of a self-driving car

00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:25.352
is actually the easiest one to see.

00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:28.704
So these are going to be fantastic
for all kinds of different reasons.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:32.166
But did you know that "driver"
is actually the most common job

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.979
in 29 of the 50 US states?

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:38.340
What's going to happen to these jobs
when we're no longer driving our cars

00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:39.529
or cooking our food

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:41.512
or even diagnosing our own diseases?

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:44.872
Well, a recent study
from Forrester Research

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:48.059
goes so far to predict
that 25 million jobs

00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:50.245
might disappear over the next 10 years.

00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:52.702
To put that in perspective,

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:56.872
that's three times as many jobs lost
in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

00:00:58.426 --> 00:01:00.898
And it's not just blue-collar jobs
that are at risk.

00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:04.975
On Wall Street and across Silicon Valley,
we are seeing tremendous gains

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:07.181
in the quality of analysis
and decision-making

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:08.859
because of machine learning.

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:12.407
So even the smartest, highest-paid people
will be affected by this change.

00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:16.204
What's clear is that no matter
what your job is,

00:01:16.228 --> 00:01:18.200
at least some, if not all of your work,

00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:21.616
is going to be done by a robot
or software in the next few years.

00:01:22.738 --> 00:01:25.809
And that's exactly why people
like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:29.221
are talking about the need for
government-funded minimum income levels.

00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:32.587
But if our politicians can't agree
on things like health care

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:33.890
or even school lunches,

00:01:33.914 --> 00:01:36.344
I just don't see a path
where they'll find consensus

00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:39.694
on something as big and as expensive
as universal basic life income.

00:01:40.436 --> 00:01:44.081
Instead, I think the response
needs to be led by us in industry.

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:46.629
We have to recognize
the change that's ahead of us

00:01:46.653 --> 00:01:48.628
and start to design the new kinds of jobs

00:01:48.652 --> 00:01:51.347
that will still be relevant
in the age of robotics.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.472
The good news is that we have
faced down and recovered

00:01:55.496 --> 00:01:57.682
two mass extinctions of jobs before.

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:00.553
From 1870 to 1970,

00:02:00.577 --> 00:02:04.985
the percent of American workers
based on farms fell by 90 percent,

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.554
and then again from 1950 to 2010,

00:02:07.578 --> 00:02:09.721
the percent of Americans
working in factories

00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:11.421
fell by 75 percent.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.344
The challenge we face this time,
however, is one of time.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:18.382
We had a hundred years
to move from farms to factories,

00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:20.981
and then 60 years to fully build out
a service economy.

00:02:21.498 --> 00:02:22.823
The rate of change today

00:02:22.847 --> 00:02:25.821
suggests that we may only have
10 or 15 years to adjust,

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:27.548
and if we don't react fast enough,

00:02:27.572 --> 00:02:30.328
that means by the time
today's elementary-school students

00:02:30.352 --> 00:02:32.237
are college-aged,

00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:34.402
we could be living
in a world that's robotic,

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:38.109
largely unemployed and stuck
in kind of un-great depression.

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:41.556
But I don't think it has to be this way.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.280
You see, I work in innovation,

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:47.458
and part of my job is to shape how
large companies apply new technologies.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:49.880
Certainly some of these technologies

00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:52.808
are even specifically designed
to replace human workers.

00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:56.361
But I believe that if we start
taking steps right now

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.206
to change the nature of work,

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.116
we can not only create environments
where people love coming to work

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.258
but also generate
the innovation that we need

00:03:04.282 --> 00:03:07.455
to replace the millions of jobs
that will be lost to technology.

00:03:08.352 --> 00:03:12.151
I believe that the key
to preventing our jobless future

00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:14.521
is to rediscover what makes us human,

00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:17.503
and to create a new generation
of human-centered jobs

00:03:17.527 --> 00:03:20.133
that allow us to unlock
the hidden talents and passions

00:03:20.157 --> 00:03:21.810
that we carry with us every day.

00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:26.114
But first, I think
it's important to recognize

00:03:26.138 --> 00:03:28.290
that we brought this problem on ourselves.

00:03:28.314 --> 00:03:31.771
And it's not just because, you know,
we are the one building the robots.

00:03:32.327 --> 00:03:35.511
But even though most jobs
left the factory decades ago,

00:03:35.535 --> 00:03:37.472
we still hold on to this factory mindset

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:39.455
of standardization and de-skilling.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.696
We still define jobs
around procedural tasks

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.208
and then pay people for the number
of hours that they perform these tasks.

00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:47.988
We've created narrow job definitions

00:03:48.012 --> 00:03:51.252
like cashier, loan processor
or taxi driver

00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:53.759
and then asked people
to form entire careers

00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:55.413
around these singular tasks.

00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:59.604
These choices have left us with
actually two dangerous side effects.

00:03:59.628 --> 00:04:02.378
The first is that these
narrowly defined jobs

00:04:02.402 --> 00:04:04.825
will be the first
to be displaced by robots,

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.834
because single-task robots
are just the easiest kinds to build.

00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:10.994
But second, we have accidentally made it

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:13.146
so that millions of workers
around the world

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.480
have unbelievably boring working lives.

00:04:15.877 --> 00:04:17.748
(Laughter)

00:04:18.247 --> 00:04:20.649
Let's take the example
of a call center agent.

00:04:20.673 --> 00:04:23.676
Over the last few decades,
we brag about lower operating costs

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.127
because we've taken most
of the need for brainpower

00:04:26.151 --> 00:04:28.295
out of the person
and put it into the system.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.840
For most of their day,
they click on screens,

00:04:30.864 --> 00:04:32.065
they read scripts.

00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:35.960
They act more like machines than humans.

00:04:37.098 --> 00:04:39.214
And unfortunately,
over the next few years,

00:04:39.238 --> 00:04:41.097
as our technology gets more advanced,

00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:43.705
they, along with people
like clerks and bookkeepers,

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.141
will see the vast majority
of their work disappear.

00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:50.019
To counteract this,
we have to start creating new jobs

00:04:50.043 --> 00:04:52.582
that are less centered
on the tasks that a person does

00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:55.472
and more focused on the skills
that a person brings to work.

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:59.596
For example, robots are great
at repetitive and constrained work,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.569
but human beings have an amazing ability

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.872
to bring together
capability with creativity

00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:06.596
when faced with problems
that we've never seen before.

00:05:06.942 --> 00:05:09.922
It's when every day
brings a little bit of a surprise

00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:11.950
that we have designed work for humans

00:05:11.974 --> 00:05:13.243
and not for robots.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.848
Our entrepreneurs and engineers
already live in this world,

00:05:16.872 --> 00:05:19.464
but so do our nurses and our plumbers

00:05:19.488 --> 00:05:20.951
and our therapists.

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.626
You know, it's the nature
of too many companies and organizations

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.340
to just ask people to come to work
and do your job.

00:05:28.364 --> 00:05:30.550
But if you work is better done by a robot,

00:05:30.574 --> 00:05:33.371
or your decisions better made by an AI,

00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:35.107
what are you supposed to be doing?

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:38.317
Well, I think for the manager,

00:05:38.341 --> 00:05:41.738
we need to realistically think about
the tasks that will be disappearing

00:05:41.762 --> 00:05:42.913
over the next few years

00:05:42.937 --> 00:05:46.809
and start planning for more meaningful,
more valuable work that should replace it.

00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:48.262
We need to create environments

00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:50.525
where both human beings and robots thrive.

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:53.085
I say, let's give more work to the robots,

00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:56.012
and let's start with the work
that we absolutely hate doing.

00:05:57.248 --> 00:05:58.412
Here, robot,

00:05:58.436 --> 00:06:00.287
process this painfully idiotic report.

00:06:00.311 --> 00:06:01.734
(Laughter)

00:06:01.758 --> 00:06:03.183
And move this box. Thank you.

00:06:03.207 --> 00:06:04.906
(Laughter)

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.459
And for the human beings,

00:06:06.483 --> 00:06:10.037
we should follow the advice from Harry
Davis at the University of Chicago.

00:06:10.061 --> 00:06:13.710
He says we have to make it so that people
don't leave too much of themselves

00:06:13.734 --> 00:06:15.065
in the trunk of their car.

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:17.978
I mean, human beings
are amazing on weekends.

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:21.146
Think about the people that you know
and what they do on Saturdays.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.146
They're artists, carpenters,
chefs and athletes.

00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:28.802
But on Monday, they're back
to being Junior HR Specialist

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:30.925
and Systems Analyst 3.

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:34.730
(Laughter)

00:06:34.754 --> 00:06:38.072
You know, these narrow job titles
not only sound boring,

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:40.192
but they're actually
a subtle encouragement

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:43.256
for people to make narrow
and boring job contributions.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.396
But I've seen firsthand
that when you invite people to be more,

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.810
they can amaze us
with how much more they can be.

00:06:50.147 --> 00:06:52.380
A few years ago,
I was working at a large bank

00:06:52.404 --> 00:06:55.500
that was trying to bring more innovation
into its company culture.

00:06:55.524 --> 00:06:57.865
So my team and I designed
a prototyping contest

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.859
that invited anyone to build
anything that they wanted.

00:07:01.524 --> 00:07:03.357
We were actually trying to figure out

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.649
whether or not
the primary limiter to innovation

00:07:05.673 --> 00:07:08.163
was a lack of ideas or a lack of talent,

00:07:08.187 --> 00:07:10.048
and it turns out it was neither one.

00:07:10.072 --> 00:07:11.827
It was an empowerment problem.

00:07:12.518 --> 00:07:14.760
And the results
of the program were amazing.

00:07:16.198 --> 00:07:18.575
We started by inviting
people to reenvision

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:20.714
what it is they could bring to a team.

00:07:20.738 --> 00:07:24.476
This contest was not only a chance
to build anything that you wanted

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.836
but also be anything that you wanted.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.146
And when people were no longer
limited by their day-to-day job titles,

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.317
they felt free to bring all kinds
of different skills and talents

00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:35.827
to the problems
that they were trying to solve.

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:39.761
We saw technology people being designers,
marketing people being architects,

00:07:39.785 --> 00:07:43.150
and even finance people showing off
their ability to write jokes.

00:07:43.427 --> 00:07:44.577
(Laughter)

00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:46.006
We ran this program twice,

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.826
and each time more than 400 people
brought their unexpected talents to work

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.989
and solved problems that they had been
wanting to solve for years.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.329
Collectively, they created
millions of dollars of value,

00:07:56.353 --> 00:08:00.918
building things like a better
touch-tone system for call centers,

00:08:00.942 --> 00:08:02.610
easier desktop tools for branches

00:08:02.634 --> 00:08:04.159
and even a thank you card system

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:07.497
that has become a cornerstone
of the employee working experience.

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:09.324
Over the course of the eight weeks,

00:08:09.348 --> 00:08:12.881
people flexed muscles that they never
dreamed of using at work.

00:08:14.173 --> 00:08:15.750
People learned new skills,

00:08:15.774 --> 00:08:18.142
they met new people,

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:20.959
and at the end, somebody
pulled me aside and said,

00:08:20.983 --> 00:08:22.552
"I have to tell you,

00:08:22.576 --> 00:08:25.352
the last few weeks has been
one of the most intense,

00:08:25.376 --> 00:08:28.655
hardest working experiences
of my entire life,

00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:30.720
but not one second of it felt like work."

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.198
And that's the key.

00:08:33.222 --> 00:08:36.932
For those few weeks, people
got to be creators and innovators.

00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:40.298
They had been dreaming of solutions

00:08:40.322 --> 00:08:42.806
to problems that had been
bugging them for years,

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.684
and this was a chance to turn
those dreams into a reality.

00:08:46.489 --> 00:08:50.931
And that dreaming is an important part
of what separates us from machines.

00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:53.973
For now, our machines
do not get frustrated,

00:08:53.997 --> 00:08:55.404
they do not get annoyed,

00:08:55.428 --> 00:08:57.688
and they certainly don't imagine.

00:08:57.712 --> 00:08:59.411
But we, as human beings --

00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:00.642
we feel pain,

00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:02.066
we get frustrated.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.206
And it's when we're most annoyed
and most curious

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.493
that we're motivated to dig
into a problem and create change.

00:09:09.366 --> 00:09:13.276
Our imaginations are the birthplace
of new products, new services,

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.533
and even new industries.

00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:17.098
I believe that the jobs of the future

00:09:17.122 --> 00:09:18.835
will come from the minds of people

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:21.575
who today we call
analysts and specialists,

00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:25.077
but only if we give them the freedom
and protection that they need to grow

00:09:25.101 --> 00:09:27.570
into becoming explorers and inventors.

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:30.677
If we really want to robot-proof our jobs,

00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:32.936
we, as leaders, need
to get out of the mindset

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.790
of telling people what to do

00:09:34.814 --> 00:09:38.635
and instead start asking them
what problems they're inspired to solve

00:09:38.659 --> 00:09:41.024
and what talents
they want to bring to work.

00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:44.944
Because when you can bring
your Saturday self to work on Wednesdays,

00:09:44.968 --> 00:09:46.962
you'll look forward to Mondays more,

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:49.668
and those feelings
that we have about Mondays

00:09:49.692 --> 00:09:51.450
are part of what makes us human.

00:09:52.287 --> 00:09:55.295
And as we redesign work
for an era of intelligent machines,

00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:57.535
I invite you all to work alongside me

00:09:57.559 --> 00:10:00.201
to bring more humanity
to our working lives.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.376
Thank you.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.801
(Applause)
