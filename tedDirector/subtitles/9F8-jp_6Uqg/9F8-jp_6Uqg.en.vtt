00:00:12.587 --> 00:00:15.650
Humanity takes center stage at TED,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.313
but I would like to add 
a voice for the animals,

00:00:19.313 --> 00:00:25.112
whose bodies and minds 
and spirits shaped us.

00:00:25.112 --> 00:00:28.358
Some years ago, it was my good fortune

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:30.306
to meet a tribal elder on an island

00:00:30.306 --> 00:00:32.860
not far from Vancouver.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.238
His name is Jimmy Smith,

00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:37.487
and he shared a story with me

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:39.840
that is told among his people,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.035
who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw.

00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:45.730
Once upon a time, he told me,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.587
all animals on Earth were one.

00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:51.511
Even though they look different on the outside,

00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.751
inside, they're all the same,

00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:57.406
and from time to time they would gather

00:00:57.406 --> 00:01:00.156
at a sacred cave deep inside the forest

00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:02.648
to celebrate their unity.

00:01:02.648 --> 00:01:04.392
When they arrived,

00:01:04.392 --> 00:01:06.920
they would all take off their skins.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.444
Raven shed his feathers, bear his fur,

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:12.907
and salmon her scales,

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:15.829
and then, they would dance.

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.130
But one day, a human made it to the cave

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.714
and laughed at what he saw

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:23.838
because he did not understand.

00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:26.707
Embarrassed, the animals fled,

00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:28.934
and that was the last time

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:32.556
they revealed themselves this way.

00:01:32.556 --> 00:01:35.240
The ancient understanding that underneath

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.143
their separate identities, all animals are one,

00:01:38.143 --> 00:01:41.881
has been a powerful inspiration to me.

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.944
I like to get past the fur, the feathers

00:01:44.944 --> 00:01:46.573
and the scales.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.801
I want to get under the skin.

00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:51.601
No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:53.749
or a tiny tree frog,

00:01:53.749 --> 00:02:00.641
my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye.

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.780
You may wonder, do I ever photograph people?

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.615
Sure. People are always present in my photos,

00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:09.742
no matter whether they appear

00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:12.561
to portray tortoises

00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:14.374
or cougars

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:16.253
or lions.

00:02:16.253 --> 00:02:20.751
You just have to learn how 
to look past their disguise.

00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:22.485
As a photographer,

00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:25.300
I try to reach beyond the differences

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.264
in our genetic makeup

00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:30.861
to appreciate all we have in common

00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:34.239
with every other living thing.

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.568
When I use my camera,

00:02:36.568 --> 00:02:38.491
I drop my skin

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.191
like the animals at that cave

00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:45.128
so I can show who they really are.

00:02:45.128 --> 00:02:47.378
As animals blessed

00:02:47.378 --> 00:02:50.752
with the power of rational thought,

00:02:50.752 --> 00:02:55.285
we can marvel at the intricacies of life.

00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:58.121
As citizens of a planet in trouble,

00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:00.685
it is our moral responsibility

00:03:00.685 --> 00:03:06.240
to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.107
But as humans with hearts,

00:03:08.107 --> 00:03:12.040
we can all rejoice in the unity of life,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.880
and perhaps we can change

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.760
what once happened in that sacred cave.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.992
Let's find a way to join the dance.

00:03:23.992 --> 00:03:26.775
Thank you.

00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:29.439
(Applause)
