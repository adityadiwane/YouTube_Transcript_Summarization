00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:19.261
I would be willing to bet
I'm the dumbest guy in the room,

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:22.247
because I couldn't get through school;
I struggled with school.

00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:25.481
But I knew at a very early age
that I loved money, I loved business

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:27.392
and I loved this entrepreneurial thing.

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:29.201
I was raised to be an entrepreneur.

00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:31.678
What I've been really
passionate about ever since --

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:34.519
and I've never spoken
about this ever, until now --

00:00:34.543 --> 00:00:36.600
so this is the first time
anyone's heard it,

00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:38.122
except my wife, three days ago.

00:00:38.146 --> 00:00:40.044
She said, "What are you talking about?"

00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:43.007
I told her that I think
we miss an opportunity

00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:46.236
to find these kids
who have the entrepreneurial traits,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.236
and to groom them or show them

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.938
that being an entrepreneur
is actually a cool thing.

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:54.295
It's not something
that is a bad thing and is vilified,

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.743
which is what happens in a lot of society.

00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:59.902
Kids, when we grow up, have dreams,

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.932
and we have passions, and we have visions,

00:01:01.956 --> 00:01:03.889
and somehow we get those things crushed.

00:01:03.913 --> 00:01:05.928
We get told that we need to study harder

00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:08.220
or be more focused or get a tutor.

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:12.172
My parents got me a tutor in French,
and I still suck in French.

00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:14.885
Two years ago,

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.503
I was the highest-rated lecturer
at MIT's Entrepreneurial Master's Program.

00:01:18.527 --> 00:01:21.330
It was a speaking event
in front of groups of entrepreneurs

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:22.511
from around the world.

00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:25.498
When I was in grade two,
I won a citywide speaking competition,

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:28.276
but nobody had ever said,
"Hey, this kid's a good speaker.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.818
He can't focus, but he loves walking
around and getting people energized."

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:33.862
No one said, "Get him
a coach in speaking."

00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:35.993
They said, get me a tutor
in what I suck at.

00:01:36.017 --> 00:01:39.766
So as kids show these traits --
and we need to start looking for them --

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.644
I think we should be raising kids
to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.727
Unfortunately, the school system
is grooming this world to say,

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:49.875
"Let's be a lawyer,"
or, "Let's be a doctor."

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.377
We're missing that opportunity,

00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:53.834
because no one ever says,
"Hey, be an entrepreneur."

00:01:53.858 --> 00:01:56.909
Entrepreneurs are people --
we have a lot of them in this room --

00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.750
who have ideas and passions
or see these needs in the world

00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:01.424
and decide to stand up and do it.

00:02:01.448 --> 00:02:04.298
And we put everything on the line
to make that stuff happen.

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:07.051
We have the ability
to get the groups of people around us

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:08.948
that want to build that dream with us.

00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:12.655
And I think if we could get kids
to embrace the idea at a young age,

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:13.893
of being entrepreneurial,

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:16.904
we could change everything
in the world that's a problem today.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:19.334
Every problem out there,
somebody has the idea for.

00:02:19.358 --> 00:02:21.965
And as a young kid,
nobody can say it can't happen,

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.241
because you're too dumb to realize
that you couldn't figure it out.

00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:28.341
I think we have an obligation
as parents and a society

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:32.531
to start teaching our kids to fish
instead of giving them the fish --

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:35.420
the old parable: "Give a man
a fish, you feed him for a day.

00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:37.794
Teach a man to fish,
you feed him for a lifetime."

00:02:37.818 --> 00:02:40.026
If we can teach our kids
to be entrepreneurial,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.780
the ones that show the traits to be,

00:02:41.804 --> 00:02:44.931
like we teach the ones who have
science gifts to go on in science,

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:47.368
what if we saw the ones
with entrepreneurial traits

00:02:47.392 --> 00:02:49.128
and taught them to be entrepreneurs?

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:51.256
We could have these kids
spreading businesses

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.309
instead of waiting
for government handouts.

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:56.063
What we do is teach our kids
the things they shouldn't do:

00:02:56.087 --> 00:02:57.875
don't hit; don't bite; don't swear.

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.933
Right now we teach our kids
to go after really good jobs;

00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:03.537
the school system teaches them
to go after things like

00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:06.942
being a doctor and being a lawyer
and being an accountant and a dentist

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:08.220
and a teacher and a pilot.

00:03:08.244 --> 00:03:10.904
And the media says it's really cool
if we could go out

00:03:10.928 --> 00:03:12.427
and be a model or a singer

00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:15.386
or a sports hero like Luongo or Crosby.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.986
Our MBA programs do not teach kids
to be entrepreneurs.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.572
The reason I avoided an MBA program,
other than that I didn't get into any,

00:03:22.596 --> 00:03:25.059
since I had a 61 percent
average out of high school,

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:26.278
then a 61 percent average

00:03:26.302 --> 00:03:28.977
at the only school in Canada
that accepted me, Carlton,

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.967
is that our MBA programs don't teach
kids to be entrepreneurs.

00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:33.918
They teach them to work in corporations.

00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:37.045
So who's starting these companies?
It's these random few people.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.072
Even in popular literature,
the only book I've ever found --

00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:42.295
and this should be
on all your reading lists --

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.709
the only book I've ever found

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:46.313
that makes the entrepreneur
a hero is "Atlas Shrugged."

00:03:46.337 --> 00:03:48.751
Everything else in the world
looks at entrepreneurs

00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:50.046
and says we're bad people.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.278
I look at even my family.

00:03:51.302 --> 00:03:53.753
Both my grandfathers and my dad
were entrepreneurs.

00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:56.800
My brother, sister and I,
all three of us own companies as well.

00:03:56.824 --> 00:04:00.391
We all decided to start these things
because it's the only place we fit.

00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:03.487
We didn't fit in normal work;
we couldn't work for somebody else,

00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:05.851
we're stubborn and we have
all these other traits.

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.788
But kids could be entrepreneurs as well.

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:09.725
I'm a big part of a couple organizations

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.421
called the Entrepreneurs' Organization
and the Young Presidents' Organization.

00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:16.890
I just came back from speaking
in Barcelona at the YPO global conference.

00:04:16.914 --> 00:04:20.236
And everyone I met over there
who's an entrepreneur

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.776
struggled with school.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.379
I have 18 out of the 19 signs
of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.

00:04:25.403 --> 00:04:28.212
So this thing right here
is freaking me out.

00:04:28.236 --> 00:04:30.640
(Laughter)

00:04:30.664 --> 00:04:32.463
It's probably why I'm a bit panicked,

00:04:32.487 --> 00:04:34.891
other than all the caffeine
I've had and the sugar.

00:04:34.915 --> 00:04:37.236
But this is really creepy
for an entrepreneur.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.403
Attention deficit disorder,
bipolar disorder.

00:04:39.427 --> 00:04:42.427
Do you know that bipolar disorder
is nicknamed the CEO disease?

00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:45.125
Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:48.541
All three of the founders
of Netscape had it.

00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:49.948
I could go on and on.

00:04:49.972 --> 00:04:52.236
Kids -- you can see these signs in kids.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.388
And we're giving them Ritalin and saying,

00:04:54.412 --> 00:04:56.505
"Don't be an entrepreneurial type.

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.179
Fit into this other system
and try to become a student."

00:04:59.203 --> 00:05:00.975
Sorry, entrepreneurs aren't students.

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.832
We fast-track. We figure out the game.

00:05:02.856 --> 00:05:04.904
I stole essays. I cheated on exams.

00:05:04.928 --> 00:05:07.705
I hired kids to do my accounting
assignments in university

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.236
for 13 consecutive assignments.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.615
But as an entrepreneur, you don't do
accounting, you hire accountants.

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.546
So I just figured that out earlier.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.236
(Laughter)

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.045
(Applause)

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.259
At least I can admit I cheated
in university; most of you won't.

00:05:21.283 --> 00:05:24.617
I'm also quoted -- and I told
the person who wrote the textbook --

00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:27.173
I'm now quoted in that exact same
university textbook

00:05:27.197 --> 00:05:30.003
in every Canadian university
and college studies --

00:05:30.027 --> 00:05:32.236
in managerial accounting,
I'm chapter eight.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.546
I open up chapter eight,
talking about budgeting.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.765
I told the author,
after they did my interview,

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.487
that I cheated in that same course.

00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:40.902
She thought it was too funny
to not include it.

00:05:40.926 --> 00:05:43.275
But kids, you can see these signs in them.

00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:46.598
The definition of entrepreneur
is "a person who organizes, operates

00:05:46.622 --> 00:05:48.836
and assumes the risk
of a business venture."

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.266
That doesn't mean you have
to go to an MBA program,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.160
or that you have to get through school.

00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:56.355
It just means that those few things
have to feel right in your gut.

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.845
We've heard, "Is it nurture
or is it nature?" Right?

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:00.847
Is it thing one or thing two? What is it?

00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:03.500
Well, I don't think it's either.
I think it can be both.

00:06:03.524 --> 00:06:05.127
I was groomed as an entrepreneur.

00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:07.911
When I was growing up
as a young kid, I had no choice,

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:09.911
because I was taught at a very early age,

00:06:09.935 --> 00:06:12.545
when my dad realized I didn't fit
into everything else

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:14.404
that was being taught to me in school,

00:06:14.428 --> 00:06:17.379
that he could teach me
to figure out business at an early age.

00:06:17.403 --> 00:06:20.651
He groomed us, the three of us,
to hate the thought of having a job

00:06:20.675 --> 00:06:22.684
and to love the fact of creating companies

00:06:22.708 --> 00:06:24.383
where we could employ other people.

00:06:24.407 --> 00:06:27.341
My first business venture:
I was seven years old, in Winnipeg.

00:06:27.365 --> 00:06:30.138
I was in my bedroom
with one of those long extension cords,

00:06:30.162 --> 00:06:32.089
calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg

00:06:32.113 --> 00:06:34.545
to find out how much they'd pay
me for coat hangers.

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:36.546
And my mom came into the room and said,

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.870
"Where are you going to get the hangers
to sell to the dry cleaners?"

00:06:39.894 --> 00:06:41.993
And I said, "Let's go look
in the basement."

00:06:42.017 --> 00:06:44.843
We went down to the basement,
and I opened up this cupboard.

00:06:44.867 --> 00:06:47.185
There was about 1,000 hangers
that I'd collected,

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:49.511
because, when I told her
I was going out to play,

00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:51.591
I was going door to door
in the neighborhood

00:06:51.615 --> 00:06:53.677
to collect hangers to put in the basement,

00:06:53.701 --> 00:06:56.297
because I saw her
a few weeks before that --

00:06:56.321 --> 00:06:59.299
you could get paid, they used to pay
two cents per coat hanger.

00:06:59.323 --> 00:07:01.685
So I was like, well,
there's all kinds of hangers,

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:02.911
so I'll just go get them.

00:07:02.935 --> 00:07:04.847
I knew she wouldn't want me to get them,

00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:06.076
so I just did it anyway.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.911
And I learned that you could
actually negotiate with people.

00:07:08.935 --> 00:07:12.407
This one guy offered me three cents
and I got him up to three and a half.

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:13.877
I even knew at seven years old

00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:16.155
that I could get
a fractional percent of a cent,

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:18.526
and people would pay it,
because it multiplied up.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.281
At seven years old I figured it out.

00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:22.514
I got three and a half cents
for 1,000 hangers.

00:07:22.538 --> 00:07:24.650
I sold license plate
protectors door to door.

00:07:24.674 --> 00:07:26.561
My dad actually made me go find someone

00:07:26.585 --> 00:07:28.345
who would sell me them at wholesale.

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:31.058
At nine years old, I walked
around in the city of Sudbury

00:07:31.082 --> 00:07:33.240
selling license-plate
protectors door to door.

00:07:33.264 --> 00:07:35.444
And I remember
this one customer so vividly --

00:07:35.468 --> 00:07:39.019
I also did some other stuff
with these clients, I sold newspapers,

00:07:39.043 --> 00:07:41.195
and he wouldn't buy
a newspaper from me, ever.

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:44.799
But I was convinced I was going to get him
to buy a license-plate protector.

00:07:44.823 --> 00:07:46.500
And he's like, "We don't need one."

00:07:46.524 --> 00:07:48.172
I said, "But you've got two cars."

00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:49.602
Remember, I'm nine years old.

00:07:49.626 --> 00:07:53.134
I'm like, "You have two cars and they
don't have license-plate protectors.

00:07:53.158 --> 00:07:55.972
And this car has one license plate
that's all crumpled up."

00:07:55.996 --> 00:07:57.550
He said, "That's my wife's car."

00:07:57.574 --> 00:08:00.911
I said, "Why don't we test one on her car
and see if it lasts longer?"

00:08:00.935 --> 00:08:03.911
So I knew there were two cars
with two license plates on each.

00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:06.529
If I couldn't sell all four,
I could at least get one.

00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:08.001
I learned that at a young age.

00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:09.319
I did comic book arbitrage.

00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:11.663
When I was about 10 years old,
I sold comic books

00:08:11.687 --> 00:08:13.427
out of our cottage on Georgian Bay.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.556
I would go biking
up to the end of the beach,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.454
buy all the comics from the poor kids,

00:08:17.478 --> 00:08:20.911
then go back to the other end of the beach
to sell them to the rich kids.

00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:22.911
It was obvious to me: buy low, sell high.

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:25.183
You've got this demand
over here that has money.

00:08:25.207 --> 00:08:27.953
Don't try to sell to the poor kids;
they don't have cash.

00:08:27.977 --> 00:08:29.820
The rich people do. Obvious, right?

00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:31.007
It's like a recession.

00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:32.198
So there's a recession.

00:08:32.222 --> 00:08:35.238
There's still 13 trillion dollars
circulating in the US economy.

00:08:35.262 --> 00:08:37.850
Go get some of that.
I learned that at a young age.

00:08:37.874 --> 00:08:39.864
I also learned, don't reveal your source:

00:08:39.888 --> 00:08:41.771
I got beat up after four weeks of this,

00:08:41.795 --> 00:08:45.102
because one of the rich kids found out
where I was buying my comics,

00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:47.047
and didn't like that he was paying more.

00:08:47.071 --> 00:08:49.434
I was forced to get
a paper route at 10 years old.

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:52.978
I didn't want a paper route, but my dad
said, "That's your next business."

00:08:53.002 --> 00:08:55.326
Not only did he get me one,
but I had to get two.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.041
He wanted me to hire someone
to deliver half the papers,

00:08:58.065 --> 00:08:59.216
which I did.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.248
Then I realized: collecting tips
is how you made all the money.

00:09:02.272 --> 00:09:04.000
So I'd collect tips and get payment.

00:09:04.024 --> 00:09:06.911
I would collect for the papers --
he could just deliver them.

00:09:06.935 --> 00:09:08.950
Because then I realized
I could make money.

00:09:08.974 --> 00:09:11.808
By this point, I was definitely
not going to be an employee.

00:09:11.832 --> 00:09:13.204
(Laughter)

00:09:13.228 --> 00:09:15.760
My dad owned an automotive
and industrial repair shop.

00:09:15.784 --> 00:09:18.200
He had all these old
automotive parts lying around.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.899
They had this old brass and copper.

00:09:19.923 --> 00:09:22.900
I asked what he did with it,
and he said he just throws it out.

00:09:22.924 --> 00:09:25.910
I said, "Wouldn't somebody pay
for that?" And he goes, "Maybe."

00:09:25.934 --> 00:09:27.863
Remember: at 10 years old, 34 years ago,

00:09:27.887 --> 00:09:30.986
I saw opportunity in this stuff,
I saw there was money in garbage.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.362
And I collected it from the automotive
shops in the area on my bicycle.

00:09:34.386 --> 00:09:37.471
Then my dad would drive me on Saturdays
to a scrap metal recycler

00:09:37.495 --> 00:09:38.650
where I got paid.

00:09:38.674 --> 00:09:40.394
And I thought that was kind of cool.

00:09:40.418 --> 00:09:43.467
Strangely enough, 30 years later,
we're building 1-800-GOT-JUNK?

00:09:43.491 --> 00:09:44.979
and making money off that, too.

00:09:45.003 --> 00:09:48.057
I built these little pincushions
when I was 11 years old in Cubs.

00:09:48.081 --> 00:09:50.677
We made these pincushions
for our moms for Mother's Day

00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:52.357
out of wooden clothespins --

00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:54.875
when we used to hang clothes
on clotheslines outside.

00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:56.265
And you'd make these chairs.

00:09:56.289 --> 00:09:58.687
And I had these little pillows
that I would sew up.

00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:00.309
And you could stuff pins in them.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.212
Because people used to sew
and they needed a pincushion.

00:10:04.317 --> 00:10:06.414
But I realized you had to have options,

00:10:06.438 --> 00:10:08.658
so I spray-painted
a whole bunch of them brown,

00:10:08.682 --> 00:10:11.686
so when I went to the door,
it wasn't, "Do you want to buy one?"

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.486
It was, "Which color would you like?"

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.618
I'm 10 years old;
you're not going to say no,

00:10:15.642 --> 00:10:18.823
especially if you have two options,
the brown one or the clear one.

00:10:18.847 --> 00:10:20.772
So I learned that lesson at a young age.

00:10:20.796 --> 00:10:23.154
I learned that manual labor really sucks.

00:10:23.178 --> 00:10:25.459
Right, like cutting lawns is brutal.

00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:29.305
But because I had to cut lawns
all summer for all of our neighbors

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:30.512
and get paid to do that,

00:10:30.536 --> 00:10:34.006
I realized that recurring revenue
from one client is amazing,

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.426
that if I land this client once,

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.573
and every week I get paid by that person,

00:10:38.597 --> 00:10:42.911
that's way better than trying to sell
one clothespin thing to one person,

00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:44.556
because you can't sell them more.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.049
So I love that recurring revenue model
I started to learn at a young age.

00:10:48.073 --> 00:10:51.533
Remember, I was being groomed to do this.
I was not allowed to have jobs.

00:10:51.557 --> 00:10:53.975
I would go to the golf course
and caddy for people,

00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:57.489
but I realized there was this one hill
on our golf course, the 13th hole,

00:10:57.513 --> 00:10:58.687
that had this huge hill,

00:10:58.711 --> 00:11:00.784
and people could never
get their bags up it.

00:11:00.808 --> 00:11:03.697
So I'd sit there in a lawn chair
and carry for all the people

00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:04.897
who didn't have caddies.

00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:07.792
I'd carry their golf bags to the top;
they'd pay me a dollar,

00:11:07.816 --> 00:11:10.777
while my friends worked for hours
hauling some guy's bag around

00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:11.959
for 10 bucks.

00:11:11.983 --> 00:11:14.704
I'm like, "That's stupid.
You have to work for five hours.

00:11:14.728 --> 00:11:17.929
That doesn't make sense. Figure out
a way to make more money faster.

00:11:17.953 --> 00:11:20.864
Every week, I'd go to the corner store
and buy all these pops,

00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:23.911
Then I'd deliver them
to these 70-year-old women playing bridge.

00:11:23.935 --> 00:11:26.379
They'd give me their orders
for the following week.

00:11:26.403 --> 00:11:28.037
I'd deliver pop and charge twice.

00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:29.370
I had this captured market.

00:11:29.394 --> 00:11:33.054
You didn't need contracts, you just needed
to have a supply and demand

00:11:33.078 --> 00:11:34.911
and this audience who bought into you.

00:11:34.935 --> 00:11:37.131
These women weren't going
to go to anybody else

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.633
because they liked me,
and I kind of figured it out.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:41.775
I went and got golf balls
from golf courses.

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:43.911
But everybody else was looking in the bush

00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:45.987
and looking in the ditches for golf balls.

00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:49.718
I'm like, screw that. They're in the pond.
And nobody's going into the pond.

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:53.130
So I'd go into the ponds and crawl
around and pick them up with my toes,

00:11:53.154 --> 00:11:54.747
just pick them up with both feet.

00:11:54.771 --> 00:11:56.581
You can't do it onstage.

00:11:56.605 --> 00:11:59.534
You get the golf balls,
throw them in your bathing suit trunks

00:11:59.558 --> 00:12:02.297
and when you're done, you've got
a couple hundred of them.

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:05.078
But the problem is, people
didn't want all the golf balls.

00:12:05.102 --> 00:12:07.198
So I just packaged them.
I'm like 12, right?

00:12:07.222 --> 00:12:08.659
I packaged them up three ways.

00:12:08.683 --> 00:12:11.082
I had the Pinnacles, DDHs
and the really cool ones.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.637
Those sold for two dollars each.

00:12:12.661 --> 00:12:15.707
Then I had the good ones
that didn't look crappy: 50 cents each.

00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:18.309
And then I'd sell 50 at a time
of all the crappy ones.

00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:20.585
And they could use those
for practice balls.

00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:22.695
I sold sunglasses when I was in school,

00:12:23.487 --> 00:12:25.084
to all the kids in high school.

00:12:25.108 --> 00:12:27.695
This is what really kind of gets
everybody hating you,

00:12:27.719 --> 00:12:31.217
because you're trying to extract money
from all your friends all the time.

00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:32.423
But it paid the bills.

00:12:32.447 --> 00:12:34.316
So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.094
Then when the school shut me down --

00:12:36.118 --> 00:12:39.047
they called me into the office
and told me I couldn't do it --

00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:42.622
I went to the gas stations and sold
lots of them to the gas stations

00:12:42.646 --> 00:12:45.193
and had the gas stations
sell them to their customers.

00:12:45.217 --> 00:12:47.581
That was cool because then,
I had retail outlets.

00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:48.756
I think I was 14.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.036
Then I paid my entire way through
first year of university at Carlton

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.692
by selling wineskins door to door.

00:12:53.716 --> 00:12:55.876
You know you can hold
a 40-ounce bottle of rum

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.733
and two bottles of coke in a wineskin?

00:12:57.757 --> 00:12:59.391
So what, right? But you know what?

00:12:59.415 --> 00:13:02.181
Stuff that down your shorts
when you go to a football game,

00:13:02.205 --> 00:13:03.643
you can get booze in for free.

00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:04.867
Everybody bought them.

00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:07.187
Supply, demand, big opportunity.

00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:10.312
I also branded it, so I sold them
for five times the normal cost.

00:13:10.336 --> 00:13:11.911
It had our university logo on it.

00:13:11.935 --> 00:13:14.304
You know, we teach our kids
and we buy them games,

00:13:14.328 --> 00:13:17.425
but why don't we get them games,
if they're entrepreneurial kids,

00:13:17.449 --> 00:13:19.936
that nurture the traits
you need to be entrepreneurs?

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.250
Why don't you teach them
not to waste money?

00:13:22.274 --> 00:13:25.186
I remember being told to walk
out into the middle of a street

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.380
in Banff, Alberta.

00:13:26.404 --> 00:13:28.214
I'd thrown a penny out in the street,

00:13:28.238 --> 00:13:29.771
and my dad said, "Go pick it up.

00:13:29.795 --> 00:13:33.407
I work too damn hard for my money.
I'm not going to see you waste a penny."

00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:35.115
I remember that lesson to this day.

00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:37.033
Allowances teach kids the wrong habits.

00:13:37.057 --> 00:13:40.628
Allowances, by nature,
are teaching kids to think about a job.

00:13:40.652 --> 00:13:43.629
An entrepreneur doesn't expect
a regular paycheck.

00:13:43.653 --> 00:13:47.334
Allowance is breeding kids at a young age
to expect a regular paycheck.

00:13:47.358 --> 00:13:50.047
That's wrong, for me,
if you want to raise entrepreneurs.

00:13:50.071 --> 00:13:52.058
What I do with my kids, nine and seven,

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:54.552
is teach them to walk
around the house and the yard,

00:13:54.576 --> 00:13:56.553
looking for stuff that needs to get done.

00:13:56.577 --> 00:13:57.964
Come and tell me what it is.

00:13:57.988 --> 00:13:59.911
Or I'll say, "Here's what I need done."

00:13:59.935 --> 00:14:02.033
And then, you know
what we do? We negotiate.

00:14:02.057 --> 00:14:03.911
They go around looking for what it is,

00:14:03.935 --> 00:14:05.911
then we negotiate what they'll get paid.

00:14:05.935 --> 00:14:07.561
They don't have a regular check,

00:14:07.585 --> 00:14:09.823
but they have opportunities
to find more stuff,

00:14:09.847 --> 00:14:12.911
and learn the skill of negotiating
and of finding opportunities.

00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:14.341
You breed that kind of stuff.

00:14:14.365 --> 00:14:16.134
Each of my kids has two piggy banks.

00:14:16.158 --> 00:14:19.613
Fifty percent of all the money they earn
goes in their house account,

00:14:19.637 --> 00:14:21.415
50 percent goes in their toy account.

00:14:21.439 --> 00:14:23.810
The toy account,
they spend on whatever they want.

00:14:23.834 --> 00:14:27.342
The 50 percent in their house account,
every six months, goes to the bank.

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.517
they walk up with me.

00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:31.339
Every year, all the money
in the bank goes to their broker.

00:14:31.363 --> 00:14:34.331
Both my nine- and seven-year-olds
have a stockbroker already.

00:14:34.355 --> 00:14:36.555
I'm teaching them
to force that savings habit.

00:14:36.579 --> 00:14:38.866
It drives me crazy
that 30-year-olds are saying,

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.082
"Maybe I'll start contributing
to my RSP now."

00:14:41.106 --> 00:14:42.837
Shit, you've missed 25 years.

00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:44.826
You can teach those habits to young kids,

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.724
when they don't even feel the pain yet.

00:14:46.748 --> 00:14:50.910
Don't read bedtime stories every night --
maybe four nights of the week,

00:14:50.934 --> 00:14:53.213
and three nights, have them tell stories.

00:14:53.237 --> 00:14:55.997
Why don't you sit down with kids
and give them four items,

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:58.911
a red shirt, a blue tie,
a kangaroo and a laptop,

00:14:58.935 --> 00:15:01.364
and have them tell a story
about those four things?

00:15:01.388 --> 00:15:02.786
My kids do that all the time.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.127
It teaches them to sell,
teaches them creativity,

00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:06.966
teaches them to think on their feet.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.911
Do that kind of stuff, have fun with it.

00:15:08.935 --> 00:15:11.253
Get kids to stand up
in front of groups and talk,

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:13.352
even if it's just
in front of their friends,

00:15:13.376 --> 00:15:14.858
and do plays and have speeches.

00:15:14.882 --> 00:15:17.627
Those are entrepreneurial traits
you want to be nurturing.

00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:20.299
Show kids what bad customers
or bad employees look like.

00:15:20.323 --> 00:15:21.657
Show them grumpy employees.

00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:24.161
When you see grumpy
customer service, point it out.

00:15:24.185 --> 00:15:26.507
Say, "By the way,
that guy is a crappy employee."

00:15:26.531 --> 00:15:28.091
And say, "These are good ones."

00:15:28.115 --> 00:15:30.148
(Laughter)

00:15:30.172 --> 00:15:32.906
If you go into a restaurant
and have bad customer service,

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.170
show them what bad
customer service looks like.

00:15:35.194 --> 00:15:37.086
(Laughter)

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.086
We have all these lessons in front of us,

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.346
but we don't take those opportunities;
we teach kids to get a tutor.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.744
Imagine if you actually took
all the kids' junk in the house right now,

00:15:45.768 --> 00:15:47.650
all the toys they outgrew two years ago

00:15:47.674 --> 00:15:50.895
and said, "Why don't we sell
some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?"

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:54.610
And they actually sell it and learn
how to find scammers when offers come in.

00:15:54.634 --> 00:15:57.518
They can come into your account
or a sub account or whatever.

00:15:57.542 --> 00:16:00.027
But teach them how to fix
the price, guess the price,

00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:01.911
pull up the photos.

00:16:01.935 --> 00:16:04.591
Teach them how to do
that kind of stuff and make money.

00:16:04.615 --> 00:16:06.680
Then 50 percent
goes in their house account,

00:16:06.704 --> 00:16:08.262
50 percent in their toy account.

00:16:08.286 --> 00:16:09.494
My kids love this stuff.

00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:12.584
Some of the entrepreneurial traits
you've got to nurture in kids:

00:16:12.608 --> 00:16:16.054
attainment, tenacity, leadership,
introspection, interdependence, values.

00:16:16.078 --> 00:16:19.675
All these traits, you can find in young
kids, and you can help nurture them.

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:21.039
Look for that kind of stuff.

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:23.453
There's two traits I want you
to also look out for

00:16:23.477 --> 00:16:25.668
that we don't get out of their system.

00:16:25.692 --> 00:16:28.074
Don't medicate kids
for attention deficit disorder

00:16:28.098 --> 00:16:30.075
unless it is really, really freaking bad.

00:16:30.099 --> 00:16:31.671
(Applause)

00:16:31.695 --> 00:16:34.813
The same with the whole things
on mania and stress and depression,

00:16:34.837 --> 00:16:36.814
unless it is so clinically brutal, man.

00:16:36.838 --> 00:16:39.297
Bipolar disorder is nicknamed
"the CEO disease."

00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:43.871
When Steve Jurvetson, Jim Clark
and Jim Barksdale have all got it,

00:16:43.895 --> 00:16:45.311
and they built Netscape --

00:16:45.335 --> 00:16:47.045
imagine if they were given Ritalin.

00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:48.911
We wouldn't have that stuff, right?

00:16:48.935 --> 00:16:51.688
Al Gore really would have had
to invented the Internet.

00:16:51.712 --> 00:16:53.450
(Laughter)

00:16:53.474 --> 00:16:56.389
These are the skills
we should be teaching in the classroom,

00:16:56.413 --> 00:16:57.708
as well as everything else.

00:16:57.732 --> 00:17:00.228
I'm not saying don't get kids
to want to be lawyers.

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:03.405
But how about getting entrepreneurship
to be ranked right up there

00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:04.581
with the rest of them?

00:17:04.605 --> 00:17:06.635
Because there's huge
opportunities in that.

00:17:06.659 --> 00:17:08.366
I want to close with a quick video

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.621
that was done by one
of the companies I mentor.

00:17:10.645 --> 00:17:12.139
These guys, Grasshopper.

00:17:12.163 --> 00:17:13.328
It's about kids.

00:17:13.352 --> 00:17:14.718
It's about entrepreneurship.

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:17.667
Hopefully, this inspires you
to take what you've heard from me

00:17:17.691 --> 00:17:19.852
and do something with it
to change the world.

00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:22.458
[Kid... "And you thought
you could do anything?"]

00:17:22.482 --> 00:17:24.459
[You still can.]

00:17:24.483 --> 00:17:27.316
[Because a lot of what
we consider impossible]

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.911
[is easy to overcome]

00:17:29.935 --> 00:17:32.935
[Because in case you haven't
noticed, we live in a place where]

00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:35.697
[one individual can make a difference]

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:36.920
[Want proof?]

00:17:36.944 --> 00:17:39.231
[Just look at the people
who built our country:]

00:17:39.255 --> 00:17:41.448
[Our parents, grandparents,
our aunts, uncles]

00:17:41.472 --> 00:17:44.242
[They were immigrants, newcomers
ready to make their mark]

00:17:44.266 --> 00:17:46.911
[Maybe they came with very little]

00:17:46.935 --> 00:17:49.195
[or perhaps they didn't own
anything except for]

00:17:49.219 --> 00:17:52.085
[a single brilliant idea]

00:17:52.109 --> 00:17:54.357
[These people were thinkers, doers]

00:17:55.768 --> 00:17:57.244
[innovators]

00:17:57.649 --> 00:17:59.598
[until they came up with the name]

00:18:01.409 --> 00:18:04.400
[entrepreneurs]

00:18:04.424 --> 00:18:06.978
[They change the way we think
about what is possible.]

00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:09.549
[They have a clear vision
of how life can be better]

00:18:09.573 --> 00:18:11.768
[for all of us, even when
times are tough.]

00:18:11.792 --> 00:18:13.224
[Right now, it's hard to see]

00:18:13.248 --> 00:18:15.979
[when our view is cluttered
with obstacles.]

00:18:16.003 --> 00:18:20.249
[But turbulence creates opportunities]

00:18:20.273 --> 00:18:23.550
[for success, achievement, and pushes us]

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:25.815
[to discover new ways of doing things]

00:18:26.226 --> 00:18:28.963
[So what opportunities
will you go after and why?]

00:18:28.987 --> 00:18:31.410
[If you're an entrepreneur]

00:18:31.434 --> 00:18:34.316
[you know that risk isn't the reward.]

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.436
[No. The rewards are driving innovation]

00:18:37.208 --> 00:18:39.225
[changing people's lives. Creating jobs.]

00:18:39.609 --> 00:18:41.767
[Fueling growth.]

00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:44.911
[And making a better world.]

00:18:44.935 --> 00:18:46.440
[Entrepreneurs are everywhere.]

00:18:46.464 --> 00:18:48.997
[They run small businesses
that support our economy,]

00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:50.263
[design tools to help you]

00:18:50.287 --> 00:18:52.725
[stay connected with friends,
family and colleagues]

00:18:52.749 --> 00:18:56.385
[And they're finding new ways of helping
to solve society's oldest problems.]

00:18:56.409 --> 00:18:57.844
[Do you know an entrepreneur?]

00:18:57.868 --> 00:18:59.919
[Entrepreneurs can be anyone
Even... you]

00:18:59.943 --> 00:19:02.992
[So seize the opportunity to create
the job you always wanted]

00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:04.580
[Help heal the economy]

00:19:04.604 --> 00:19:05.756
[Make a difference.]

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.500
[Take your business to new heights,]

00:19:08.863 --> 00:19:10.132
[but most importantly,]

00:19:10.156 --> 00:19:12.736
[remember when you were a kid]

00:19:13.776 --> 00:19:16.784
[when everything was within your reach,]

00:19:16.808 --> 00:19:20.808
[and then say to yourself
quietly, but with determination:]

00:19:22.855 --> 00:19:24.601
[it still is.]

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.062
Thank you very much for having me.

00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:30.966
(Applause)
