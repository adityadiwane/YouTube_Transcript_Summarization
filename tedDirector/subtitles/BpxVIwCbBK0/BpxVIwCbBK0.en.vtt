00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
and I professionally watch YouTube videos.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
It's true.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and then why that even matters.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
We all want to be stars --

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
celebrities, singers, comedians --

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
But now Web video has made it

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
can become completely famous

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
in a part of our world's culture.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
by next Saturday.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
every minute.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And of that, only a tiny percentage

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
So how does it happen?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Three things:

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
tastemakers, communities of participation

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and unexpectedness.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
All right, let's go.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.260
(Video) Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Oh, my God!

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Wooo!

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Ohhhhh, wowwww!

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
(Laughter)

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
This is a chart of what it looked like

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
when it first became popular last summer.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
He just wanted to share a rainbow.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
(Laughter)

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And this video had actually been posted

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
all the way back in January.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
So what happened here?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Jimmy Kimmel actually.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
introduce us to new and interesting things

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and bring them to a larger audience.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.260
(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. ♫

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.260
♫ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. ♫

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.260
♫ Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday. ♫

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
without talking about this video I hope.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
This is a chart of what it looked like.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And similar to "Double Rainbow,"

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.260
it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
So what happened on this day?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Well it was a Friday, this is true.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.260
(Laughter)

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
But what about this day,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
this one particular Friday?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
took a point of view

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And so then this community formed

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
of people who shared this big inside joke

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and they started talking about it and doing things with it.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Even in the first seven days,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
there was one parody for every other day of the week.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.260
(Laughter)

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
this community participation

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
is how we become a part of the phenomenon --

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:51.260
(Music)

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
with looped music.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
It's this, just like this.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.260
It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And if you think that that is weird,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
you should know that there is a three-hour version of this

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
that's been viewed four million times.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
(Laughter)

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
Even cats were watching this video.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.260
(Laughter)

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Cats were watching other cats watch this video.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:29.260
(Laughter)

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
But what's important here

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
is the creativity that it inspired

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
There were remixes.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
(Laughter)

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Someone made an old timey version.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
(Laughter)

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
And then it went international.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:05:03.260
(Laughter)

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
An entire remix community sprouted up

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
that brought it from being just a stupid joke

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
to something that we can all actually be a part of.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Because we don't just enjoy now,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
we participate.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
And who could have predicted any of this?

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
or "Nyan Cat?"

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
What scripts could you have written

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
that would have contained this in it?

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
In a world where over two days of video

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
get uploaded every minute,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
only that which is truly unique and unexpected

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
can stand out in the way that these things have.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
I admit I wasn't very interested.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
(Video) Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
but often there are obstructions

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:08.260
(Laughter)

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
KA: By being totally surprising and humorous,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
seen five million times.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
And so this approach holds

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
for anything new that we do creatively.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And so it all brings us

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
to one big question ...

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
(Video) Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Ohhhh.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
(Laughter)

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
KA: What does it mean?

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Tastemakers, creative participating communities,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
complete unexpectedness,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
where anyone has access

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and the audience defines the popularity.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
I mean, as mentioned earlier,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
got his start on YouTube.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
No one has to green-light your idea.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
And we all now feel some ownership

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
in our own pop culture.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And these are not characteristics of old media,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
and they're barely true of the media of today,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
but they will define the entertainment of the future.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Thank you.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.260
(Applause)
