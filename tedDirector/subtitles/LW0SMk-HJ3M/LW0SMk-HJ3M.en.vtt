00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa --

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And, of course, I’m dedicating it also to my grandmother,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
especially for me when I was an activist, and being harassed by the police.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You will recall that in 1976, June 16, the students of South Africa boycotted

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
as they were sort of like really told

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that they must do everything in Afrikaans --

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
biology, mathematics -- and what about our languages?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And the students wanted to speak to the government,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and police answered with bullets.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So every year, June 16, we will commemorate

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
all those comrades or students who died.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and I started asking questions,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and that’s when my political education started.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And I joined, later on, the youth organization

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
under the African National Congress.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So as part of organizing this and whatever,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
this commemoration, the police will round us up

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
as they call us leaders.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And I used to run away from home,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
when I know that maybe the police might be coming

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
around the ninth or 10th of June or so.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And my grandmother one time said,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
"No, look, you’re not going to run away.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is your place, you stay here."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And indeed, the police came -- because they’ll just arrest us

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So it was on the 10th of June, and they came, and they surrounded the house,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and opened the kitchen door.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And she said to them, "Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm tired of you having to come here, harassing us,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
He is here, and you're not going to take him.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I've got a bowl full of boiling water -- the first one who comes in here, gets it."

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And they left.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
(Applause) (Music)

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
♫ Thula Mama, Thula Mama, Thula Mama, Thula Mama. ♫

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
♫ Through the mist of the tears in your eyes on my childhood memory, ♫

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
♫ I know the truth in your smile, ♫

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
♫ I know the truth in your smile, ♫

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
♫ piercing through the gloom of my ignorance. ♫

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
♫ Oh, there is a mama lying down sleeping ♫

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
♫ you're very ill and your heart crying. ♫

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000
♫ Wondering, wondering, wondering, wondering where is this world coming to. ♫

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
♫ Is it right the children have to fend for themselves? No, no, no, no, no. no. ♫

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
♫ Is it right heaping trouble on an old lady's head? ♫

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
♫ So unlucky faceless people. ♫

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
♫ Thula Mama Mama, Thula Mama. Thula Mama Mama. ♫

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
♫ Thula Mama, Thula Mama, Thula Mama Mama, Thula Mama ♫

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
♫ Tomorrow it’s going to be better. ♫

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
♫ Tomorrow it's going to be better to climb, Mama. ♫

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
♫ Thula Mama, Thula Mama. ♫

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
♫ Am I to break into the song like the blues man or troubadour. ♫

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
♫ And then from long distance in no blues club am I to sing, ♫

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:09.000
♫ baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. ♫

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
♫ Should I now stop singing of love, ♫

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
♫ now that my memory’s surrounded by blood? ♫

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:28.000
♫ Sister, why oh why do we at times mistake a pimple for a cancer? ♫

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
♫ So who are they who says, no more love poems now? ♫

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
♫ I want to sing a song of love ♫

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
♫ for that woman who jumped the fences pregnant ♫

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
♫ and still gave birth to a healthy child. ♫

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
♫ Softly I walk into the sun rays of the smile ♫

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000
♫ that will ignite my love song, my song of life, ♫

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000
♫ my song of love, my song of life, my song of love, ♫

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:36.000
♫ my song of life, my song of love, my song of life. ♫

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
♫ Ooh, I’ve not tried to run away from song, ♫

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
♫ I hear a persistent voice, more powerful than the enemy bombs. ♫

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
♫ The song that washed our lives and the rains of our blood. ♫

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
♫ My song of love and my song of life, my song of love, ♫

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
♫ my song of life, my song of love, ♫

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
♫ my song of life, my song of love -- I want everybody to sing with me -- ♫

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000
♫ my song of life, my song of love, my song of life -- everybody sing with me -- ♫

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
♫ my song of life, my song of love -- I can’t hear you -- ♫

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
♫ my song of love, my song of life -- you can do better -- ♫

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
