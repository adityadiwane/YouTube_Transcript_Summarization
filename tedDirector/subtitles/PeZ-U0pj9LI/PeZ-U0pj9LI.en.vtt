00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.491
So let's start with some good news,

00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:17.840
and the good news has to do with what do we know

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.107
based on biomedical research

00:00:20.107 --> 00:00:23.561
that actually has changed the outcomes

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:26.660
for many very serious diseases?

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.907
Let's start with leukemia,

00:00:28.907 --> 00:00:31.435
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL,

00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:33.873
the most common cancer of children.

00:00:33.873 --> 00:00:35.835
When I was a student,

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.675
the mortality rate was about 95 percent.

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:42.808
Today, some 25, 30 years later, we're talking about

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:46.435
a mortality rate that's reduced by 85 percent.

00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:49.051
Six thousand children each year

00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:53.240
who would have previously died of this disease are cured.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.031
If you want the really big numbers,

00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:57.859
look at these numbers for heart disease.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.651
Heart disease used to be the biggest killer,

00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:01.155
particularly for men in their 40s.

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:04.649
Today, we've seen a 63-percent reduction in mortality

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.710
from heart disease --

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.595
remarkably, 1.1 million deaths averted every year.

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:14.316
AIDS, incredibly, has just been named,

00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:16.597
in the past month, a chronic disease,

00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:19.512
meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:23.583
is expected not to live weeks, months, or a couple of years,

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.853
as we said only a decade ago,

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:28.245
but is thought to live decades,

00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:32.741
probably to die in his '60s or '70s from other causes altogether.

00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:35.766
These are just remarkable, remarkable changes

00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:38.355
in the outlook for some of the biggest killers.

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:40.434
And one in particular

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:42.479
that you probably wouldn't know about, stroke,

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.080
which has been, along with heart disease,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.258
one of the biggest killers in this country,

00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:48.049
is a disease in which now we know

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.978
that if you can get people into the emergency room

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:53.152
within three hours of the onset,

00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:55.757
some 30 percent of them will be able to leave the hospital

00:01:55.757 --> 00:01:58.876
without any disability whatsoever.

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:01.133
Remarkable stories,

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.164
good-news stories,

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:06.229
all of which boil down to understanding

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.581
something about the diseases that has allowed us

00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:12.904
to detect early and intervene early.

00:02:12.904 --> 00:02:15.039
Early detection, early intervention,

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.109
that's the story for these successes.

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.845
Unfortunately, the news is not all good.

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:23.194
Let's talk about one other story

00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:24.885
which has to do with suicide.

00:02:24.885 --> 00:02:27.537
Now this is, of course, not a disease, per se.

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:30.625
It's a condition, or it's a situation

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:32.414
that leads to mortality.

00:02:32.414 --> 00:02:35.494
What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is.

00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:39.703
There are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States.

00:02:39.703 --> 00:02:42.461
That means one about every 15 minutes.

00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:45.237
Third most common cause of death amongst people

00:02:45.237 --> 00:02:48.013
between the ages of 15 and 25.

00:02:48.013 --> 00:02:50.261
It's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize

00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:52.773
that this is twice as common as homicide

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:55.422
and actually more common as a source of death

00:02:55.422 --> 00:02:58.757
than traffic fatalities in this country.

00:02:58.757 --> 00:03:01.389
Now, when we talk about suicide,

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.501
there is also a medical contribution here,

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:06.933
because 90 percent of suicides

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:08.703
are related to a mental illness:

00:03:08.703 --> 00:03:11.749
depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.807
anorexia, borderline personality. There's a long list

00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:16.917
of disorders that contribute,

00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:20.941
and as I mentioned before, often early in life.

00:03:20.941 --> 00:03:24.145
But it's not just the mortality from these disorders.

00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:25.787
It's also morbidity.

00:03:25.787 --> 00:03:28.048
If you look at disability,

00:03:28.048 --> 00:03:30.200
as measured by the World Health Organization

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.725
with something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years,

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:35.821
it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of

00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:37.135
except an economist,

00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:40.577
except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost

00:03:40.577 --> 00:03:43.760
in terms of disability from medical causes,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.653
and as you can see, virtually 30 percent

00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:48.917
of all disability from all medical causes

00:03:48.917 --> 00:03:51.477
can be attributed to mental disorders,

00:03:51.477 --> 00:03:53.861
neuropsychiatric syndromes.

00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:56.013
You're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense.

00:03:56.013 --> 00:03:58.685
I mean, cancer seems far more serious.

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:01.717
Heart disease seems far more serious.

00:04:01.717 --> 00:04:04.757
But you can see actually they are further down this list,

00:04:04.757 --> 00:04:07.037
and that's because we're talking here about disability.

00:04:07.037 --> 00:04:09.829
What drives the disability for these disorders

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.733
like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression?

00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:16.708
Why are they number one here?

00:04:16.708 --> 00:04:18.217
Well, there are probably three reasons.

00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:20.189
One is that they're highly prevalent.

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.484
About one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders

00:04:23.484 --> 00:04:26.061
in the course of their lifetime.

00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:28.381
A second, of course, is that, for some people,

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:29.965
these become truly disabling,

00:04:29.965 --> 00:04:33.093
and it's about four to five percent, perhaps one in 20.

00:04:33.093 --> 00:04:37.357
But what really drives these numbers, this high morbidity,

00:04:37.357 --> 00:04:39.786
and to some extent the high mortality,

00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:43.734
is the fact that these start very early in life.

00:04:43.734 --> 00:04:46.829
Fifty percent will have onset by age 14,

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:49.949
75 percent by age 24,

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.414
a picture that is very different than what one would see

00:04:53.414 --> 00:04:55.685
if you're talking about cancer or heart disease,

00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:59.085
diabetes, hypertension -- most of the major illnesses

00:04:59.085 --> 00:05:03.181
that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality.

00:05:03.181 --> 00:05:09.491
These are, indeed, the chronic disorders of young people.

00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:12.358
Now, I started by telling you that there were some good-news stories.

00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:13.806
This is obviously not one of them.

00:05:13.806 --> 00:05:16.685
This is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult,

00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:19.269
and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me.

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:24.621
My job is to actually make sure that we make progress

00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:26.973
on all of these disorders.

00:05:26.973 --> 00:05:28.683
I work for the federal government.

00:05:28.683 --> 00:05:30.701
Actually, I work for you. You pay my salary.

00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:33.085
And maybe at this point, when you know what I do,

00:05:33.085 --> 00:05:35.205
or maybe what I've failed to do,

00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:37.414
you'll think that I probably ought to be fired,

00:05:37.414 --> 00:05:39.569
and I could certainly understand that.

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.901
But what I want to suggest, and the reason I'm here

00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:45.156
is to tell you that I think we're about to be

00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:49.819
in a very different world as we think about these illnesses.

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:52.925
What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders,

00:05:52.925 --> 00:05:54.641
diseases of the mind.

00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:58.037
That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days,

00:05:58.037 --> 00:06:00.237
and people feel that, for whatever reason,

00:06:00.237 --> 00:06:03.614
it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders

00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:07.525
and to talk about these as disorders of behavior.

00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:09.792
Fair enough. They are disorders of behavior,

00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:11.792
and they are disorders of the mind.

00:06:11.792 --> 00:06:14.197
But what I want to suggest to you

00:06:14.197 --> 00:06:15.949
is that both of those terms,

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.967
which have been in play for a century or more,

00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:21.787
are actually now impediments to progress,

00:06:21.787 --> 00:06:26.117
that what we need conceptually to make progress here

00:06:26.117 --> 00:06:31.325
is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders.

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:33.187
Now, for some of you, you're going to say,

00:06:33.187 --> 00:06:35.406
"Oh my goodness, here we go again.

00:06:35.406 --> 00:06:38.034
We're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance

00:06:38.034 --> 00:06:39.769
or we're going to hear about drugs

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:44.595
or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion

00:06:44.595 --> 00:06:47.535
that will take our subjective experience

00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:53.607
and turn it into molecules, or maybe into some sort of

00:06:53.607 --> 00:06:56.825
very flat, unidimensional understanding

00:06:56.825 --> 00:07:00.927
of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia.

00:07:00.927 --> 00:07:05.425
When we talk about the brain, it is anything but

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.688
unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic.

00:07:08.688 --> 00:07:11.647
It depends, of course, on what scale

00:07:11.647 --> 00:07:13.943
or what scope you want to think about,

00:07:13.943 --> 00:07:20.223
but this is an organ of surreal complexity,

00:07:20.223 --> 00:07:23.694
and we are just beginning to understand

00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:25.867
how to even study it, whether you're thinking about

00:07:25.867 --> 00:07:28.449
the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:30.594
or the 100 trillion synapses

00:07:30.594 --> 00:07:32.953
that make up all the connections.

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:36.529
We have just begun to try to figure out

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:40.057
how do we take this very complex machine

00:07:40.057 --> 00:07:42.801
that does extraordinary kinds of information processing

00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:45.518
and use our own minds to understand

00:07:45.518 --> 00:07:49.049
this very complex brain that supports our own minds.

00:07:49.049 --> 00:07:51.609
It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution

00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:55.439
that we simply don't have a brain

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:58.337
that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself.

00:07:58.337 --> 00:08:00.651
In a sense, it actually makes you feel that

00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:03.489
when you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition,

00:08:03.489 --> 00:08:04.812
something you can observe,

00:08:04.812 --> 00:08:07.817
that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic

00:08:07.817 --> 00:08:12.785
than trying to engage this very complex, mysterious organ

00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:15.213
that we're beginning to try to understand.

00:08:15.213 --> 00:08:18.869
Now, already in the case of the brain disorders

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:20.597
that I've been talking to you about,

00:08:20.597 --> 00:08:22.870
depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.032
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:08:25.032 --> 00:08:27.974
while we don't have an in-depth understanding

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:31.700
of how they are abnormally processed

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.805
or what the brain is doing in these illnesses,

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:36.860
we have been able to already identify

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.436
some of the connectional differences, or some of the ways

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:41.940
in which the circuitry is different

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.756
for people who have these disorders.

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.514
We call this the human connectome,

00:08:45.514 --> 00:08:47.895
and you can think about the connectome

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:49.767
sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain.

00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:51.871
You'll hear more about this in a few minutes.

00:08:51.871 --> 00:08:54.822
The important piece here is that as you begin to look

00:08:54.822 --> 00:08:58.799
at people who have these disorders, the one in five of us

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:00.627
who struggle in some way,

00:09:00.627 --> 00:09:02.915
you find that there's a lot of variation

00:09:02.915 --> 00:09:06.131
in the way that the brain is wired,

00:09:06.131 --> 00:09:08.733
but there are some predictable patterns, and those patterns

00:09:08.733 --> 00:09:12.547
are risk factors for developing one of these disorders.

00:09:12.547 --> 00:09:15.539
It's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders

00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:18.307
like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease

00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:20.699
where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex.

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:23.959
Here we're talking about traffic jams, or sometimes detours,

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:26.706
or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected

00:09:26.706 --> 00:09:27.953
and the way that the brain functions.

00:09:27.953 --> 00:09:31.123
You could, if you want, compare this to,

00:09:31.123 --> 00:09:34.172
on the one hand, a myocardial infarction, a heart attack,

00:09:34.172 --> 00:09:35.995
where you have dead tissue in the heart,

00:09:35.995 --> 00:09:39.592
versus an arrhythmia, where the organ simply isn't functioning

00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:41.843
because of the communication problems within it.

00:09:41.843 --> 00:09:43.812
Either one would kill you; in only one of them

00:09:43.812 --> 00:09:46.412
will you find a major lesion.

00:09:46.412 --> 00:09:49.244
As we think about this, probably it's better to actually go

00:09:49.244 --> 00:09:52.467
a little deeper into one particular disorder, and that would be schizophrenia,

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.603
because I think that's a good case

00:09:54.603 --> 00:09:58.128
for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters.

00:09:58.128 --> 00:10:02.006
These are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues

00:10:02.006 --> 00:10:04.178
at the National Institute of Mental Health

00:10:04.178 --> 00:10:07.894
in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia,

00:10:07.894 --> 00:10:09.364
and you can see already in the top

00:10:09.364 --> 00:10:11.901
there's areas that are red or orange, yellow,

00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:14.039
are places where there's less gray matter,

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:15.577
and as they followed them over five years,

00:10:15.577 --> 00:10:17.815
comparing them to age match controls,

00:10:17.815 --> 00:10:19.637
you can see that, particularly in areas like

00:10:19.637 --> 00:10:21.953
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

00:10:21.953 --> 00:10:26.283
or the superior temporal gyrus, there's a profound loss of gray matter.

00:10:26.283 --> 00:10:27.826
And it's important, if you try to model this,

00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:29.782
you can think about normal development

00:10:29.782 --> 00:10:33.035
as a loss of cortical mass, loss of cortical gray matter,

00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:36.699
and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark,

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:38.268
and at some point, when you overshoot,

00:10:38.268 --> 00:10:41.259
you cross a threshold, and it's that threshold

00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:44.835
where we say, this is a person who has this disease,

00:10:44.835 --> 00:10:47.123
because they have the behavioral symptoms

00:10:47.123 --> 00:10:49.244
of hallucinations and delusions.

00:10:49.244 --> 00:10:50.721
That's something we can observe.

00:10:50.721 --> 00:10:56.363
But look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold.

00:10:56.363 --> 00:10:59.359
They've crossed a brain threshold much earlier,

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:02.499
that perhaps not at age 22 or 20,

00:11:02.499 --> 00:11:05.267
but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see

00:11:05.267 --> 00:11:07.627
the trajectory for development is quite different

00:11:07.627 --> 00:11:11.142
at the level of the brain, not at the level of behavior.

00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:13.237
Why does this matter? Well first because,

00:11:13.237 --> 00:11:16.379
for brain disorders, behavior is the last thing to change.

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:19.289
We know that for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, for Huntington's.

00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:21.723
There are changes in the brain a decade or more

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:26.763
before you see the first signs of a behavioral change.

00:11:26.763 --> 00:11:29.707
The tools that we have now allow us to detect

00:11:29.707 --> 00:11:34.004
these brain changes much earlier, long before the symptoms emerge.

00:11:34.004 --> 00:11:37.403
But most important, go back to where we started.

00:11:37.403 --> 00:11:40.619
The good-news stories in medicine

00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:43.563
are early detection, early intervention.

00:11:43.563 --> 00:11:47.227
If we waited until the heart attack,

00:11:47.227 --> 00:11:51.202
we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives

00:11:51.202 --> 00:11:53.611
every year in this country to heart disease.

00:11:53.611 --> 00:11:56.019
That is precisely what we do today

00:11:56.019 --> 00:12:00.531
when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders,

00:12:00.531 --> 00:12:03.733
brain circuit disorders, has a behavioral disorder.

00:12:03.733 --> 00:12:06.957
We wait until the behavior becomes manifest.

00:12:06.957 --> 00:12:11.516
That's not early detection. That's not early intervention.

00:12:11.516 --> 00:12:13.321
Now to be clear, we're not quite ready to do this.

00:12:13.321 --> 00:12:16.475
We don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know

00:12:16.475 --> 00:12:19.024
what the tools will be,

00:12:19.024 --> 00:12:23.283
nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able

00:12:23.283 --> 00:12:27.488
to get there before the behavior emerges as different.

00:12:27.488 --> 00:12:30.425
But this tells us how we need to think about it,

00:12:30.425 --> 00:12:31.914
and where we need to go.

00:12:31.914 --> 00:12:33.116
Are we going to be there soon?

00:12:33.116 --> 00:12:35.794
I think that this is something that will happen

00:12:35.794 --> 00:12:38.625
over the course of the next few years, but I'd like to finish

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:41.160
with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.521
by somebody who's thought a lot about changes

00:12:43.521 --> 00:12:45.849
in concepts and changes in technology.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:48.113
"We always overestimate the change that will occur

00:12:48.113 --> 00:12:50.336
in the next two years and underestimate

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:54.212
the change that will occur in the next 10." -- Bill Gates.

00:12:54.212 --> 00:12:55.575
Thanks very much.

00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:58.258
