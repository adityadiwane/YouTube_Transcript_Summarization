00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:13.795
I'm a historian.

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:17.912
Steve told us about the future
of little technology;

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:21.973
I'm going to show you some
of the past of big technology.

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:27.433
This was a project to build a 4,000-ton
nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship

00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:30.005
and go to Saturn and Jupiter.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.700
This took place in my childhood, 1957-65.

00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:36.003
It was deeply classified.

00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:40.099
I'm going to show you some stuff
that not only has not been declassified,

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.629
but has now been reclassified.

00:00:42.653 --> 00:00:46.345
(Laughter)

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:48.413
If all goes well, next year I'll be back,

00:00:48.437 --> 00:00:51.568
and I'll have a lot more to show you,
and if all doesn't go well,

00:00:51.592 --> 00:00:53.887
I'll be in jail, like Wen Ho Lee.

00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:57.657
(Laughter)

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:02.429
So, this ship was basically
the size of the Marriott Hotel,

00:01:02.453 --> 00:01:04.736
a little taller and a little bigger.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.419
And one of the people
who worked on it at the beginning

00:01:07.443 --> 00:01:09.511
was my father, Freeman,
there in the middle.

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.417
That's me and my sister, Esther,
who's a frequent TEDster.

00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:15.603
I didn't like nuclear
bomb-propelled spaceships.

00:01:15.627 --> 00:01:18.892
I mean, I thought it was a great idea,
but I started building kayaks.

00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:20.080
So we had a few kayaks.

00:01:20.104 --> 00:01:22.819
Just so you know
that I am not Dr. Strangelove.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.509
But all the time I was out there
doing these strange kayak voyages

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.403
in odd, beautiful parts of this planet,

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:33.736
I always thought in the back
of my mind about Project Orion,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.736
and how my father and his friends
were going to build these big ships.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.803
They were actually going to go --

00:01:39.827 --> 00:01:42.864
Ted Taylor, who led the project,
was going to take his children.

00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:45.015
My father was not going
to take his children,

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.678
that was one of the reasons we sort
of had a falling out for a few years.

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:52.412
(Laughter)

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:54.936
The project began in '57
at General Atomics there,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.902
that's right on the coast at La Jolla.

00:01:56.926 --> 00:01:59.999
Look at that central building
right in the middle of the picture.

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:03.359
That's the 130-foot diameter library.

00:02:03.383 --> 00:02:06.336
That is exactly the size
of the base of the spaceship.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.782
So put that library
at the bottom of that ship --

00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:10.775
that's how big the thing was going to be.

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.845
It would take two or three thousand bombs.

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.846
The people who worked on it
were a lot of the Los Alamos people

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.595
who had done the hydrogen bomb work.

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.746
It was the first project funded by ARPA.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.633
That's the contract where ARPA
gave the first million dollars

00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:23.904
to get this thing started.

00:02:23.928 --> 00:02:27.691
"Spaceship project officially begun.
Job waiting for you. Dyson."

00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:29.136
That's July '58.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.394
Two days later, the space traveler's
manifesto explaining why --

00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:36.296
just like we heard yesterday --
why we need to go into space:

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.487
"... trips to satellites
of the outer planets.

00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:40.231
August 20, 1958."

00:02:40.255 --> 00:02:44.612
These are the statistics of what would be
the good places to go and stop.

00:02:44.636 --> 00:02:46.125
Some of the sizes of the ships,

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:50.331
ranging all the way up
to ship mass of 8 million tons.

00:02:50.355 --> 00:02:51.788
So that was the outer extreme.

00:02:51.812 --> 00:02:55.673
Here was version two: 2,000 bombs.

00:02:55.697 --> 00:03:00.990
These are five-kiloton yield bombs,
about the size of small Volkswagens;

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.473
it would take 800 to get into orbit.

00:03:03.497 --> 00:03:07.917
Here we see a 10,000-ton ship
will deliver 1,300 tons

00:03:07.941 --> 00:03:10.755
to Saturn and back --
essentially, a five-year trip.

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:15.660
Possible departure dates:
October 1960 to February 1967.

00:03:15.684 --> 00:03:18.303
These are trajectories going to Mars.

00:03:18.327 --> 00:03:20.445
All this was done by hand,
with slide rules.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.033
The little Orion ship,

00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:24.909
and what it would take
to do what Orion does with chemicals:

00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:27.470
you have a ship the size
of the Empire State Building.

00:03:27.494 --> 00:03:29.974
NASA had no interest;
they tried to kill the project.

00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:32.197
The people who supported it
were the Air Force,

00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:33.895
which meant that it was all secret.

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.599
And that's why when you get something
declassified, that's what it looks like.

00:03:37.623 --> 00:03:40.139
Military weapon versions
that carried hydrogen bombs

00:03:40.163 --> 00:03:41.844
that could destroy half the planet.

00:03:41.868 --> 00:03:45.692
There's another version there that sends
retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.

00:03:45.716 --> 00:03:47.248
This is the really secret stuff:

00:03:47.272 --> 00:03:49.384
how to get directed energy explosions.

00:03:49.408 --> 00:03:51.957
So you're sending the energy
of a nuclear explosion --

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:55.343
not like just a stick of dynamite,
but you're directing it at the ship.

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:57.631
And this is still a very active subject.

00:03:57.655 --> 00:03:58.861
It's quite dangerous,

00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:01.838
but I believe it's better to have
dangerous things in the open

00:04:01.862 --> 00:04:03.918
than think you're going
to keep them secret.

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:05.998
This is what happened
at 600 microseconds.

00:04:06.022 --> 00:04:08.797
The Air Force started
to build smaller models

00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:10.515
and actually started doing this.

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:13.262
The guys in La Jolla said,
"We've got to get started now."

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.686
They built a high-explosive
propelled model.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.432
These are stills from
film footage that was saved

00:04:19.456 --> 00:04:22.011
by someone who was supposed
to destroy it but didn't,

00:04:22.035 --> 00:04:24.473
and kept it in their basement
for the last 40 years.

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.413
So, these are three-pound charges of C4;

00:04:26.437 --> 00:04:29.110
that's about 10 times
what the guy had in his shoes.

00:04:29.134 --> 00:04:30.314
(Laughter)

00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:31.760
This is Ed Day putting --

00:04:31.784 --> 00:04:35.033
So each of these coffee cans
has three pounds of C4 in it.

00:04:35.057 --> 00:04:39.193
They're building a system that ejects
these at quarter-second intervals.

00:04:39.217 --> 00:04:42.495
That's my dad in the sport coat there,
holding the briefcase.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:44.647
So, they had a lot of fun doing this.

00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:46.156
But no children were allowed;

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.783
my dad could tell me he was building
a spaceship and going to go to Saturn,

00:04:49.807 --> 00:04:51.925
but he could not say
anything more about it.

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.557
So all my life I have wanted
to find this stuff out,

00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:57.533
and spent the last four years
tracking these old guys down.

00:04:57.557 --> 00:04:59.084
These are stills from the video.

00:04:59.108 --> 00:05:01.887
Jeff Bezos kindly, yesterday,
said he'll put this video up

00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:04.303
on the Amazon site --
some little clip of it.

00:05:04.327 --> 00:05:05.335
(Applause)

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:06.616
So, thanks to him.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.236
They got quite serious
about the engineering of this.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.281
The size of that mass, for us,

00:05:11.305 --> 00:05:15.233
is really large technology in a way
we're never going to go back to.

00:05:15.257 --> 00:05:17.011
If you saw the 1959 --

00:05:17.035 --> 00:05:19.895
this is what it would feel
like in the passenger compartment;

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.292
that's acceleration profile.

00:05:21.316 --> 00:05:22.324
(Laughter)

00:05:22.348 --> 00:05:26.201
And pulse-system yield:
we're looking at 20-kiloton yield

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:28.536
for an effective thrust
of 10 million newtons.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.197
Well, here we have a little problem,
the radiation doses at the crew station:

00:05:32.221 --> 00:05:34.968
700 rads per shot.

00:05:34.992 --> 00:05:36.699
(Laughter)

00:05:36.723 --> 00:05:38.476
Fission yields during development:

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.806
they were hoping to get
clean bombs; they didn't.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.086
Eyeburn: this is what happens
to the people in Miami who are looking up.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.534
(Laughter)

00:05:47.558 --> 00:05:51.113
Personnel compartment noise: that's
not too bad; it's very low frequencies,

00:05:51.137 --> 00:05:52.955
it's basically like these sub-woofers.

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.613
And now we have ground-hazard assessments
when you have a blow-up on the pad.

00:05:56.637 --> 00:05:59.565
Finally, at the very end in 1964,
NASA steps in and says,

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:03.158
"OK, we'll support a feasibility study
for a small version

00:06:03.182 --> 00:06:07.282
that could be launched with Saturn Vs
in sections and pieced together."

00:06:07.306 --> 00:06:09.331
So this is what NASA did,

00:06:09.355 --> 00:06:14.306
getting an eight-man version
that would go to Mars.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.526
They liked it because the guys could
kind of live there and be like,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.176
"It's like living in a submarine."

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.462
This is crew compartment.

00:06:20.486 --> 00:06:22.869
It switches, so what's
upside down is right side up

00:06:22.893 --> 00:06:24.756
when you go to artificial gravity mode.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.842
The scientists were still
going to go along;

00:06:26.866 --> 00:06:29.391
they would take seven astronauts
and seven scientists.

00:06:29.415 --> 00:06:31.567
This is a 20-man version
for going to Jupiter:

00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:33.363
bunks, storm cellars, exercise room.

00:06:33.387 --> 00:06:36.034
You know, it was going
to be a nice, long trip.

00:06:36.058 --> 00:06:40.247
The Air Force version:
here we have a military version.

00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:42.861
This is the kind of stuff
that's not been declassified,

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:45.663
just that people managed to sneak
home and after, you know,

00:06:45.687 --> 00:06:48.266
on their deathbed,
basically, gave me that.

00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:50.732
The sort of artist conceptions.

00:06:50.756 --> 00:06:52.938
These are basically
PowerPoint presentations

00:06:52.962 --> 00:06:55.023
given to the Air Force 40 years ago.

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:58.745
Look at the little guys there
outside the vehicle.

00:06:59.712 --> 00:07:02.680
And one part of NASA was interested in it,

00:07:02.704 --> 00:07:05.667
but the headquarters in NASA,
they killed the project.

00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:09.210
So finally, at the end,

00:07:09.234 --> 00:07:14.451
we can see the thing followed
its sort of design path right up to 1965,

00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:16.426
and then all those paths came to a halt.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.911
Results: none.

00:07:17.935 --> 00:07:19.939
This project is hereby terminated.

00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:21.841
So that's the end.

00:07:21.865 --> 00:07:23.466
All I can say in closing is:

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.793
we heard yesterday that one of the 10
bad things that could happen to us

00:07:27.817 --> 00:07:30.407
is an asteroid with our name on it.

00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:32.820
And one of the bad things
that could happen to NASA

00:07:32.844 --> 00:07:35.959
is if that asteroid shows up
with our name on it nine months out,

00:07:35.983 --> 00:07:37.578
and everybody says,

00:07:37.602 --> 00:07:39.155
"Well, what are we going to do?"

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:42.122
And Orion is really one
of the only, if not the only,

00:07:42.146 --> 00:07:46.227
off-the-shelf technologies
that could do something.

00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:48.102
(Laughter)

00:07:48.126 --> 00:07:50.760
So I'm going to tell you
the good news and the bad news.

00:07:50.784 --> 00:07:56.535
The good news is that NASA has a small,
secret contingency-plan division

00:07:56.559 --> 00:08:01.098
that is looking at this, trying
to keep knowledge of Orion preserved

00:08:01.122 --> 00:08:03.170
in the event of such a misfortune.

00:08:03.194 --> 00:08:06.202
Maybe keep a few little
bombs of plutonium on the side.

00:08:06.226 --> 00:08:07.377
That's the good news.

00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:10.028
The bad news is, when I got
in contact with these people

00:08:10.052 --> 00:08:13.139
to try and get some documents
from them, they went crazy

00:08:13.163 --> 00:08:15.510
because I had all this stuff
that they don't have,

00:08:15.534 --> 00:08:20.579
and NASA purchased 1,759 pages
of this stuff from me.

00:08:20.603 --> 00:08:23.286
So that's the state we're at;
it's not very good.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.572
(Laughter)

00:08:24.596 --> 00:08:26.596
(Applause)
