00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.462
I read poetry all the time

00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:17.022
and write about it frequently

00:00:17.022 --> 00:00:18.630
and take poems apart

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.273
to see how they work

00:00:20.273 --> 00:00:21.980
because I'm a word person.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.757
I understand the world best, most fully,

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:27.650
in words rather than, say, pictures or numbers,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.218
and when I have a new experience or a new feeling,

00:00:30.218 --> 00:00:31.368
I'm a little frustrated

00:00:31.368 --> 00:00:34.563
until I can try to put it into words.

00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:36.874
I think I've always been that way.

00:00:36.874 --> 00:00:39.720
I devoured science fiction as a child. I still do.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.000
And I found poems by Andrew Marvell

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.718
and Matthew Arnold and Emily Dickinson

00:00:43.718 --> 00:00:45.122
and William Butler Yeats

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.402
because they were quoted in science fiction,

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:48.563
and I loved their sounds

00:00:48.563 --> 00:00:51.970
and I went on to read about ottava rima

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.979
and medial caesuras and enjambment

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.810
and all that other technical stuff

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.930
that you care about if you already care about poems,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.176
because poems already made me happier

00:01:04.176 --> 00:01:06.259
and sadder and more alive.

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.088
And I became a poetry critic

00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:12.828
because I wanted to know how and why.

00:01:12.828 --> 00:01:17.620
Now, poetry isn't one thing that serves one purpose

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.724
any more than music or computer programming

00:01:20.724 --> 00:01:22.586
serve one purpose.

00:01:22.586 --> 00:01:26.554
The greek word poem, it just means "a made thing,"

00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:28.567
and poetry is a set of techniques,

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:30.518
ways of making patterns

00:01:30.518 --> 00:01:32.607
that put emotions into words.

00:01:32.607 --> 00:01:34.617
The more techniques you know,

00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:37.069
the more things you can make,

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.289
and the more patterns you can recognize

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.454
in things you might already like or love.

00:01:44.454 --> 00:01:47.491
That said, poetry does seem to be

00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.425
especially good at certain things.

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:56.930
For example, we are all going to die.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.653
Poetry can help us live with that.

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:02.226
Poems are made of words, nothing but words.

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:04.618
The particulars in poems are like

00:02:04.618 --> 00:02:06.114
the particularities, the personalities,

00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:09.391
that distinguish people from one another.

00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:12.162
Poems are easy to share, easy to pass on,

00:02:12.162 --> 00:02:13.982
and when you read a poem, you can imagine

00:02:13.982 --> 00:02:17.990
someone's speaking to you or for you,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.905
maybe even someone far away

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:24.337
or someone made up or someone deceased.

00:02:24.337 --> 00:02:28.782
That's why we can go to poems when we want to

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:31.220
remember something or someone,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.332
to celebrate or to look beyond death

00:02:34.332 --> 00:02:36.192
or to say goodbye,

00:02:36.192 --> 00:02:40.012
and that's one reason poems can seem important,

00:02:40.012 --> 00:02:42.035
even to people who aren't me,

00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:46.740
who don't so much live in a world of words.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.836
The poet Frank O'Hara said,

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:52.090
"If you don't need poetry, bully for you,"

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.722
but he also said when he didn't
want to be alive anymore,

00:02:55.722 --> 00:02:58.232
the thought that he wouldn't write any more poems

00:02:58.232 --> 00:03:00.100
had stopped him.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.137
Poetry helps me want to be alive,

00:03:02.137 --> 00:03:05.256
and I want to show you why by showing you how,

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:08.334
how a couple of poems react to the fact that

00:03:08.334 --> 00:03:11.270
we're alive in one place at one time in one culture,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.646
and in another we won't be alive at all.

00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:20.710
So here's one of the first poems I memorized.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.200
It could address a child or an adult.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.551
"From far, from eve and morning

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:31.377
From yon twelve-winded sky,

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.477
The stuff of life to knit me

00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:35.647
Blew hither; here am I.

00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:37.913
Now — for a breath I tarry

00:03:37.913 --> 00:03:40.033
Nor yet disperse apart —

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.109
Take my hand quick and tell me,

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.212
What have you in your heart.

00:03:44.212 --> 00:03:46.669
Speak now, and I will answer;

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.249
How shall I help you, say;

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.413
Ere to the wind's twelve quarters

00:03:51.413 --> 00:03:54.508
I take my endless way."

00:03:54.508 --> 00:03:56.677
[A. E. Housman]

00:03:56.677 --> 00:03:58.121
Now, this poem has appealed

00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:59.524
to science fiction writers.

00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:02.693
It's furnished at least three science fiction titles,

00:04:02.693 --> 00:04:05.421
I think because it says poems can brings us news

00:04:05.421 --> 00:04:07.414
from the future or the past

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:10.221
or across the world,

00:04:10.221 --> 00:04:12.926
because their patterns can seem to tell you

00:04:12.926 --> 00:04:14.677
what's in somebody's heart.

00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:17.549
It says poems can bring people together temporarily,

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.629
which I think is true,

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:23.166
and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:24.604
but for how it rhymes,

00:04:24.604 --> 00:04:26.991
cleanly and simply on the two and four,

00:04:26.991 --> 00:04:28.228
"say" and "way,"

00:04:28.228 --> 00:04:31.035
with anticipatory hints on the one and three,

00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:32.660
"answer" and "quarters,"

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.535
as if the poem itself were coming together.

00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:38.547
It plays up the fact that we die

00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:40.850
by exaggerating the speed of our lives.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.128
A few years on Earth become

00:04:43.128 --> 00:04:45.367
one speech, one breath.

00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:47.526
It's a poem about loneliness --

00:04:47.526 --> 00:04:50.629
the "I" in the poem feels no connection will last —

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.541
and it might look like a plea for help

00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:55.051
'til you get to the word "help,"

00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:57.593
where this "I" facing you, taking your hand,

00:04:57.593 --> 00:04:59.574
is more like a teacher or a genie,

00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:02.298
or at least that's what he wants to believe.

00:05:02.298 --> 00:05:05.413
It would not be the first time a poet had

00:05:05.413 --> 00:05:10.275
written the poem that he wanted to hear.

00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:13.018
Now, this next poem really changed

00:05:13.018 --> 00:05:15.014
what I liked and what I read

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:17.373
and what I felt I could read as an adult.

00:05:17.373 --> 00:05:19.012
It might not make any sense to you

00:05:19.012 --> 00:05:22.942
if you haven't seen it before.

00:05:22.942 --> 00:05:25.150
"The Garden"

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.541
"Oleander: coral

00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:30.101
from lipstick ads in the 50's.

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:33.069
Fruit of the tree of such knowledge

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.013
To smack
(thin air)

00:05:35.013 --> 00:05:37.111
meaning kiss or hit.

00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:38.230
It appears

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.249
in the guise of outworn usages

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:43.120
because we are bad?

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.957
Big masculine threat,

00:05:44.957 --> 00:05:47.507
insinuating and slangy."

00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:49.705
[Rae Armantrout]

00:05:49.705 --> 00:05:52.453
Now, I found this poem in an anthology

00:05:52.453 --> 00:05:55.275
of almost equally confusing poems in 1989.

00:05:55.275 --> 00:05:57.293
I just heard that there were these scandalous writers

00:05:57.293 --> 00:05:59.920
called Language poets who didn't make any sense,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.188
and I wanted to go and see
for myself what they were like,

00:06:02.188 --> 00:06:03.878
and some of them didn't do much for me,

00:06:03.878 --> 00:06:05.430
but this writer, Rae Armantrout,

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.037
did an awful lot, and I kept reading her

00:06:08.037 --> 00:06:11.228
until I felt I knew what was going on,

00:06:11.228 --> 00:06:12.493
as I do with this poem.

00:06:12.493 --> 00:06:15.614
It's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall

00:06:15.614 --> 00:06:19.170
and the Biblical story of the Fall,

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.322
in which sex as we know it

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:22.600
and death and guilt

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.609
come into the world at the same time.

00:06:24.609 --> 00:06:26.818
It's also about how appearances deceive,

00:06:26.818 --> 00:06:29.242
how our culture can sweep us along

00:06:29.242 --> 00:06:31.610
into doing and saying things we didn't intend

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.080
or don't like, and Armantrout's style

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.518
is trying to help us stop or slow down.

00:06:37.518 --> 00:06:41.952
"Smack" can mean "kiss" as in air kisses,

00:06:41.952 --> 00:06:42.917
as in lip-smacking,

00:06:42.917 --> 00:06:45.279
but that can lead to "smack" as in "hit"

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.394
as in domestic abuse,

00:06:47.394 --> 00:06:51.202
because sexual attraction can seem threatening.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:53.468
The red that means fertility

00:06:53.468 --> 00:06:55.170
can also mean poison.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.263
Oleander is poisonous.

00:06:56.263 --> 00:06:59.950
And outworn usages like "smack" for "kiss"

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.607
or "hit" can help us see

00:07:02.607 --> 00:07:04.925
how our unacknowledged assumptions

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:06.920
can make us believe we are bad,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.962
either because sex is sinful

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:11.802
or because we tolerate so much sexism.

00:07:11.802 --> 00:07:14.898
We let guys tell women what to do.

00:07:14.898 --> 00:07:17.511
The poem reacts to old lipstick ads,

00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:19.572
and its edginess about statement,

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.894
its reversals and halts, have everything to do

00:07:21.894 --> 00:07:24.115
with resisting the language of ads

00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:27.323
that want to tell us so easily what to want,

00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:28.723
what to do, what to think.

00:07:28.723 --> 00:07:31.267
That resistance is a lot of the point of the poem,

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:33.435
which shows me, Armantrout shows me

00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:35.401
what it's like to hear grave threats

00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:37.949
and mortal dishonesty in the language

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:40.516
of everyday life, and once she's done that,

00:07:40.516 --> 00:07:44.976
I think she can show other people, women and men,

00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:46.451
what it's like to feel that way

00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:49.157
and say to other people, women and men

00:07:49.157 --> 00:07:52.070
who feel so alienated or so threatened

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.011
that they're not alone.

00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:57.479
Now, how do I know that I'm right

00:07:57.479 --> 00:07:59.457
about this somewhat confusing poem?

00:07:59.457 --> 00:08:02.198
Well in this case, I emailed
the poet a draft of my talk

00:08:02.198 --> 00:08:05.034
and she said, "Yeah, yeah, that's about it."

00:08:05.034 --> 00:08:08.949
Yeah. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:11.875
But usually, you can't know. You never know.

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:14.429
You can't be sure, and that's okay.

00:08:14.429 --> 00:08:16.030
All we can do we is listen to poems

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.689
and look at poems and guess

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:20.171
and see if they can bring us what we need,

00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:23.140
and if you're wrong about some part of a poem,

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.071
nothing bad will happen.

00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:29.854
Now, this next poem is older than Armantrout's,

00:08:29.854 --> 00:08:33.618
but a little younger than A. E. Housman's.

00:08:33.618 --> 00:08:35.486
"The Brave Man"

00:08:35.486 --> 00:08:38.170
"The sun, that brave man,

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.890
Comes through boughs that lie in wait,

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.315
That brave man.

00:08:43.315 --> 00:08:44.900
Green and gloomy eyes

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.728
In dark forms of the grass

00:08:46.728 --> 00:08:48.245
Run away.

00:08:48.245 --> 00:08:49.970
The good stars,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.657
Pale helms and spiky spurs,

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.047
Run away.

00:08:54.047 --> 00:08:55.402
Fears of my bed,

00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.880
Fears of life and fears of death,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.360
Run away.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.656
That brave man comes up

00:09:01.656 --> 00:09:04.576
From below and walks without meditation,

00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:06.353
That brave man."

00:09:06.353 --> 00:09:09.343
[Wallace Stevens]

00:09:09.343 --> 00:09:11.696
Now, the sun in this poem,

00:09:11.696 --> 00:09:14.185
in Wallace Stevens' poem, seems so grave

00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:17.656
because the person in the poem is so afraid.

00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:20.143
The sun comes up in the morning through branches,

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:23.082
dispels the dew, the eyes, on the grass,

00:09:23.082 --> 00:09:26.487
and defeats stars envisioned as armies.

00:09:26.487 --> 00:09:28.456
"Brave" has its old sense of showy

00:09:28.456 --> 00:09:30.700
as well as its modern sense, courage.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.040
This sun is not afraid to show his face.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.392
But the person in the poem is afraid.

00:09:37.392 --> 00:09:38.931
He might have been up all night.

00:09:38.931 --> 00:09:42.913
That is the reveal Stevens
saves for that fourth stanza,

00:09:42.913 --> 00:09:45.691
where run away has become a refrain.

00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:47.883
This person might want to run away too,

00:09:47.883 --> 00:09:50.173
but fortified by the sun's example,

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:52.898
he might just rise.

00:09:52.898 --> 00:09:57.176
Stevens saves that sonically odd word "meditation"

00:09:57.176 --> 00:09:58.850
for the end.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.751
Unlike the sun, human beings think.

00:10:01.751 --> 00:10:05.848
We meditate on past and future, life and death,

00:10:05.848 --> 00:10:08.394
above and below.

00:10:08.394 --> 00:10:12.178
And it can make us afraid.

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:14.248
Poems, the patterns in poems,

00:10:14.248 --> 00:10:16.190
show us not just what somebody thought

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.862
or what someone did or what happened

00:10:17.862 --> 00:10:22.658
but what it was like to be a person like that,

00:10:22.658 --> 00:10:26.348
to be so anxious, so lonely, so inquisitive,

00:10:26.348 --> 00:10:32.234
so goofy, so preposterous, so brave.

00:10:32.234 --> 00:10:35.880
That's why poems can seem at once so durable,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.921
so personal, and so ephemeral,

00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:41.048
like something inside and outside you at once.

00:10:41.048 --> 00:10:44.383
The Scottish poet Denise Riley compares poetry

00:10:44.383 --> 00:10:48.501
to a needle, a sliver of outside I cradle inside,

00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:50.909
and the American poet Terrance Hayes

00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:53.992
wrote six poems called "Wind in a Box."

00:10:53.992 --> 00:10:55.428
One of them asks, "Tell me,

00:10:55.428 --> 00:10:58.062
what am I going to do when I'm dead?"

00:10:58.062 --> 00:11:00.792
And the answer is that he'll stay with us

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:03.668
or won't stay with us inside us as wind,

00:11:03.668 --> 00:11:06.890
as air, as words.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.548
It is easier than ever to find poems

00:11:09.548 --> 00:11:13.140
that might stay inside you, that might stay with you,

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.598
from long, long ago, or from right this minute,

00:11:15.598 --> 00:11:18.172
from far away or from right close to where you live,

00:11:18.172 --> 00:11:21.498
almost no matter where you live.

00:11:21.498 --> 00:11:24.967
Poems can help you say, help
you show how you're feeling,

00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:27.407
but they can also introduce you

00:11:27.407 --> 00:11:29.690
to feelings, ways of being in the world,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.067
people, very much unlike you,

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:36.648
maybe even people from long, long ago.

00:11:36.648 --> 00:11:38.735
Some poems even tell you

00:11:38.735 --> 00:11:43.286
that that is what they can do.

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.956
That's what John Keats is doing

00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:50.324
in his most mysterious, perhaps, poem.

00:11:50.324 --> 00:11:54.236
It's mysterious because it's probably unfinished,

00:11:54.236 --> 00:11:56.565
he probably left it unfinished,

00:11:56.565 --> 00:11:58.162
and because it might be meant

00:11:58.162 --> 00:12:00.788
for a character in a play,

00:12:00.788 --> 00:12:02.465
but it might just be Keats' thinking

00:12:02.465 --> 00:12:04.100
about what his own writing,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.300
his handwriting, could do,

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.190
and in it I hear, at least I hear, mortality,

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.719
and I hear the power of older poetic techniques,

00:12:13.719 --> 00:12:16.250
and I have the feeling, you might have the feeling,

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.236
of meeting even for an instant, almost becoming,

00:12:19.236 --> 00:12:20.758
someone else from long ago,

00:12:20.758 --> 00:12:23.473
someone quite memorable.

00:12:23.473 --> 00:12:26.649
"This living hand, now warm and capable

00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:30.359
Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold

00:12:30.359 --> 00:12:32.750
And in the icy silence of the tomb,

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.326
So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights

00:12:36.326 --> 00:12:40.260
That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.911
So in my veins red life might stream again,

00:12:43.911 --> 00:12:48.810
And thou be conscience-calm’d -- see here it is --

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.798
I hold it towards you."

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.417
Thanks.

00:12:55.417 --> 00:13:02.206
(Applause)
