00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:14.881
Imagine that you invented a device

00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:16.577
that can record my memories,

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:18.638
my dreams, my ideas,

00:00:18.662 --> 00:00:20.325
and transmit them to your brain.

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:23.830
That would be a game-changing
technology, right?

00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:26.892
But in fact, we already
possess this device,

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:29.560
and it's called human communication system

00:00:29.584 --> 00:00:31.432
and effective storytelling.

00:00:31.874 --> 00:00:34.334
To understand how this device works,

00:00:34.358 --> 00:00:36.773
we have to look into our brains.

00:00:36.797 --> 00:00:40.383
And we have to formulate the question
in a slightly different manner.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:41.870
Now we have to ask

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.925
how these neuron patterns in my brain

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.151
that are associated
with my memories and ideas

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:50.694
are transmitted into your brains.

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:55.070
And we think there are two factors
that enable us to communicate.

00:00:55.094 --> 00:00:59.149
First, your brain is now
physically coupled to the sound wave

00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:01.648
that I'm transmitting to your brain.

00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:05.050
And second, we developed
a common neural protocol

00:01:05.074 --> 00:01:06.832
that enabled us to communicate.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:08.721
So how do we know that?

00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:11.185
In my lab in Princeton,

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:14.714
we bring people to the fMRI scanner
and we scan their brains

00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:18.638
while they are either telling
or listening to real-life stories.

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:21.286
And to give you a sense
of the stimulus we are using,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.294
let me play 20 seconds
from a story that we used,

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.642
told by a very talented storyteller,

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.817
Jim O'Grady.

00:01:30.244 --> 00:01:33.577
(Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out
my story and I know it's good,

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:35.891
and then I start to make it better --

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:38.399
(Laughter)

00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:40.758
by adding an element of embellishment.

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:44.810
Reporters call this "making shit up."

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.105
(Laughter)

00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:50.851
And they recommend
against crossing that line.

00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:56.812
But I had just seen the line crossed
between a high-powered dean

00:01:56.836 --> 00:01:58.262
and assault with a pastry.

00:01:58.286 --> 00:01:59.778
And I kinda liked it."

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:02.176
Uri Hasson: OK, so now
let's look into your brain

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.428
and see what's happening
when you listen to these kinds of stories.

00:02:05.452 --> 00:02:09.496
And let's start simple -- let's start
with one listener and one brain area:

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.009
the auditory cortex that processes
the sounds that come from the ear.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.477
And as you can see,
in this particular brain area,

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:18.993
the responses are going up and down
as the story is unfolding.

00:02:19.017 --> 00:02:20.610
Now we can take these responses

00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:23.435
and compare them to the responses
in other listeners

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.934
in the same brain area.

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.125
And we can ask:

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.384
How similar are the responses
across all listeners?

00:02:30.018 --> 00:02:32.380
So here you can see five listeners.

00:02:32.983 --> 00:02:36.436
And we start to scan their brains
before the story starts,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.999
when they're simply lying in the dark
and waiting for the story to begin.

00:02:40.023 --> 00:02:41.177
As you can see,

00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:43.959
the brain area is going up and down
in each one of them,

00:02:43.983 --> 00:02:45.758
but the responses are very different,

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:47.449
and not in sync.

00:02:47.473 --> 00:02:50.179
However, immediately
as the story is starting,

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.889
something amazing is happening.

00:02:52.857 --> 00:02:55.786
(Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story
and I know it's good,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.338
and then I start to make it --

00:02:57.362 --> 00:03:00.659
UH: Suddenly, you can see
that the responses in all of the subjects

00:03:00.683 --> 00:03:01.835
lock to the story,

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.288
and now they are going up and down
in a very similar way

00:03:05.312 --> 00:03:06.866
across all listeners.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.939
And in fact, this is exactly
what is happening now in your brains

00:03:09.963 --> 00:03:12.836
when you listen to my sound speaking.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.868
We call this effect "neural entrainment."

00:03:16.374 --> 00:03:18.686
And to explain to you
what is neural entrainment,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.320
let me first explain
what is physical entrainment.

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:24.826
So, we'll look and see five metronomes.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.846
Think of these five metronomes
as five brains.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.620
And similar to the listeners
before the story starts,

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:32.457
these metronomes are going to click,

00:03:32.481 --> 00:03:34.640
but they're going to click out of phase.

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:39.455
(Clicking)

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.480
Now see what will happen
when I connect them together

00:03:42.504 --> 00:03:44.645
by placing them on these two cylinders.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.101
(Clicking)

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.737
Now these two cylinders start to rotate.

00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:54.890
This rotation vibration
is going through the wood

00:03:54.914 --> 00:03:57.919
and is going to couple
all the metronomes together.

00:03:57.943 --> 00:03:59.555
And now listen to the click.

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.246
(Synchronized clicking)

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:12.458
This is what you call
physical entrainment.

00:04:12.482 --> 00:04:14.725
Now let's go back to the brain and ask:

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.893
What's driving this neural entrainment?

00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:19.702
Is it simply the sounds
that the speaker is producing?

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.049
Or maybe it's the words.

00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:24.719
Or maybe it's the meaning
that the speaker is trying to convey.

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:27.503
So to test it, we did
the following experiment.

00:04:27.527 --> 00:04:30.728
First, we took the story
and played it backwards.

00:04:30.752 --> 00:04:33.878
And that preserved many
of the original auditory features,

00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:35.915
but removed the meaning.

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.610
And it sounds something like that.

00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:42.772
(Audio) JO: (Unintelligible)

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:45.648
And we flashed colors in the two brains

00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:49.584
to indicate brain areas that respond
very similarly across people.

00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:50.762
And as you can see,

00:04:50.786 --> 00:04:54.554
this incoming sound induced entrainment
or alignment in all of the brains

00:04:54.578 --> 00:04:57.310
in auditory cortices
that process the sounds,

00:04:57.334 --> 00:04:59.558
but it didn't spread
deeper into the brain.

00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:03.455
Now we can take these sounds
and build words out of it.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.135
So if we take Jim O'Grady
and scramble the words,

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:07.399
we'll get a list of words.

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:09.685
(Audio) JO: ... an animal ...
assorted facts ...

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:12.601
and right on ... pie man ...
potentially ... my stories

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:15.567
UH: And you can see that these words
start to induce alignment

00:05:15.591 --> 00:05:18.196
in early language areas,
but not more than that.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.037
Now we can take the words
and start to build sentences out of them.

00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:26.561
(Audio) JO: And they recommend
against crossing that line.

00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:31.663
He says: "Dear Jim,
Good story. Nice details.

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:34.521
Didn't she only know
about him through me?"

00:05:34.545 --> 00:05:37.680
UH: Now you can see that the responses
in all the language areas

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:39.395
that process the incoming language

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.798
become aligned or similar
across all listeners.

00:05:42.218 --> 00:05:46.895
However, only when we use
the full, engaging, coherent story

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.144
do the responses spread
deeper into the brain

00:05:49.168 --> 00:05:50.699
into higher-order areas,

00:05:50.723 --> 00:05:53.824
which include the frontal cortex
and the parietal cortex,

00:05:53.848 --> 00:05:56.436
and make all of them
respond very similarly.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.729
And we believe that these responses
in higher-order areas are induced

00:05:59.753 --> 00:06:01.879
or become similar across listeners

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.643
because of the meaning
conveyed by the speaker,

00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:06.268
and not by words or sound.

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:09.350
And if we are right,
there's a strong prediction over here

00:06:09.374 --> 00:06:11.736
if I tell you the exact same ideas

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.404
using two very different sets of words,

00:06:14.428 --> 00:06:16.979
your brain responses
will still be similar.

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.513
And to test it, we did
the following experiment in my lab.

00:06:21.142 --> 00:06:22.950
We took the English story

00:06:22.974 --> 00:06:25.110
and translated it to Russian.

00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:29.358
Now you have two different sounds
and linguistic systems

00:06:29.382 --> 00:06:31.676
that convey the exact same meaning.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.348
And you play the English story
to the English listeners

00:06:35.372 --> 00:06:37.724
and the Russian story
to the Russian listeners,

00:06:37.748 --> 00:06:40.793
and we can compare their responses
across the groups.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:44.388
And when we did that, we didn't see
responses that are similar

00:06:44.412 --> 00:06:46.693
in auditory cortices in language,

00:06:46.717 --> 00:06:49.095
because the language
and sound are very different.

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:51.887
However, you can see
that the responses in high-order areas

00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:54.415
were still similar
across these two groups.

00:06:55.068 --> 00:06:59.160
We believe this is because they understood
the story in a very similar way,

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:03.210
as we confirmed, using a test
after the story ended.

00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:08.008
And we think that this alignment
is necessary for communication.

00:07:08.032 --> 00:07:10.658
For example, as you can tell,

00:07:10.682 --> 00:07:12.709
I am not a native English speaker.

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:14.614
I grew up with another language,

00:07:14.638 --> 00:07:17.292
and the same might be for many
of you in the audience.

00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:19.315
And still, we can communicate.

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:20.490
How come?

00:07:20.514 --> 00:07:23.593
We think we can communicate
because we have this common code

00:07:23.617 --> 00:07:25.044
that presents meaning.

00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:29.367
So far, I've only talked about
what's happening in the listener's brain,

00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:31.638
in your brain, when
you're listening to talks.

00:07:31.662 --> 00:07:34.361
But what's happening
in the speaker's brain, in my brain,

00:07:34.385 --> 00:07:36.192
when I'm speaking to you?

00:07:36.216 --> 00:07:38.073
To look in the speaker's brain,

00:07:38.097 --> 00:07:41.193
we asked the speaker
to go into the scanner,

00:07:41.217 --> 00:07:42.819
we scan his brain

00:07:42.843 --> 00:07:46.850
and then compare his brain responses
to the brain responses of the listeners

00:07:46.874 --> 00:07:48.676
listening to the story.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.910
You have to remember that producing speech
and comprehending speech

00:07:52.934 --> 00:07:54.657
are very different processes.

00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:56.925
Here we're asking: How similar are they?

00:07:58.164 --> 00:07:59.571
To our surprise,

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:04.466
we saw that all these complex
patterns within the listeners

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.197
actually came from the speaker brain.

00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:10.906
So production and comprehension
rely on very similar processes.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.502
And we also found

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:16.232
the stronger the similarity
between the listener's brain

00:08:16.256 --> 00:08:17.755
and the speaker's brain,

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:19.684
the better the communication.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:23.673
So I know that if you
are completely confused now,

00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:25.718
and I do hope that this is not the case,

00:08:25.742 --> 00:08:28.135
your brain responses
are very different than mine.

00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:31.266
But I also know that if you really
understand me now,

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.181
then your brain ... and your brain
... and your brain

00:08:34.205 --> 00:08:35.933
are really similar to mine.

00:08:37.793 --> 00:08:40.888
Now, let's take all
this information together and ask:

00:08:40.912 --> 00:08:44.249
How can we use it to transmit
a memory that I have

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:46.459
from my brain to your brains?

00:08:47.037 --> 00:08:49.155
So we did the following experiment.

00:08:49.648 --> 00:08:52.221
We let people watch,
for the first time in their life,

00:08:52.245 --> 00:08:56.379
a TV episode from the BBC series
"Sherlock," while we scanned their brains.

00:08:56.403 --> 00:08:59.204
And then we asked them
to go back to the scanner

00:08:59.228 --> 00:09:03.127
and tell the story to another person
that never watched the movie.

00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.811
So let's be specific.

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:06.882
Think about this exact scene,

00:09:06.906 --> 00:09:09.490
when Sherlock is entering
the cab in London

00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:11.810
driven by the murderer he is looking for.

00:09:12.398 --> 00:09:14.894
With me, as a viewer,

00:09:14.918 --> 00:09:18.418
there is a specific brain pattern
in my brain when I watch it.

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:22.951
Now, the exact same pattern,
I can reactivate in my brain again

00:09:22.975 --> 00:09:26.631
by telling the word:
Sherlock, London, murderer.

00:09:27.369 --> 00:09:30.479
And when I'm transmitting
these words to your brains now,

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.988
you have to reconstruct it in your mind.

00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:37.561
In fact, we see that pattern
emerging now in your brains.

00:09:37.585 --> 00:09:40.100
And we were really surprised to see

00:09:40.124 --> 00:09:42.379
that the pattern you have
now in your brains

00:09:42.403 --> 00:09:44.315
when I'm describing to you these scenes

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:48.161
would be very similar to the pattern
I had when I watched this movie

00:09:48.185 --> 00:09:50.323
a few months ago in the scanner.

00:09:50.347 --> 00:09:52.451
This starts to tell you
about the mechanism

00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:55.217
by which we can tell stories
and transmit information.

00:09:55.733 --> 00:09:57.609
Because, for example,

00:09:57.633 --> 00:10:01.145
now you're listening really hard
and trying to understand what I'm saying.

00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:02.719
And I know that it's not easy.

00:10:02.743 --> 00:10:06.779
But I hope that at one point
in the talk we clicked, and you got me.

00:10:06.803 --> 00:10:10.701
And I think that in a few hours,
a few days, a few months,

00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:12.869
you're going to meet someone at a party,

00:10:12.893 --> 00:10:16.441
and you're going to tell him
about this lecture,

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:20.103
and suddenly it will be as if
he is standing now here with us.

00:10:20.127 --> 00:10:22.977
Now you can see
how we can take this mechanism

00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:26.932
and try to transmit memories
and knowledge across people,

00:10:26.956 --> 00:10:29.003
which is wonderful, right?

00:10:29.027 --> 00:10:32.194
But our ability to communicate
relies on our ability

00:10:32.218 --> 00:10:34.784
to have common ground.

00:10:34.808 --> 00:10:36.013
Because, for example,

00:10:36.037 --> 00:10:39.804
if I'm going to use the British synonym

00:10:39.828 --> 00:10:42.206
"hackney carriage" instead of "cab,"

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.269
I know that I'm going to be misaligned
with most of you in the audience.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.911
This alignment depends
not only on our ability

00:10:48.935 --> 00:10:50.969
to understand the basic concept;

00:10:50.993 --> 00:10:55.788
it also depends on our ability to develop
common ground and understanding

00:10:55.812 --> 00:10:57.599
and shared belief systems.

00:10:57.623 --> 00:10:59.457
Because we know that in many cases,

00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:03.524
people understand the exact
same story in very different ways.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.501
So to test it in the lab,
we did the following experiment.

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:11.020
We took a story by J.D. Salinger,

00:11:11.044 --> 00:11:15.379
in which a husband lost track
of his wife in the middle of a party,

00:11:15.403 --> 00:11:19.090
and he's calling his best friend, asking,
"Did you see my wife?"

00:11:19.836 --> 00:11:21.043
For half of the subjects,

00:11:21.067 --> 00:11:25.208
we said that the wife was having
an affair with the best friend.

00:11:25.232 --> 00:11:26.383
For the other half,

00:11:26.407 --> 00:11:31.512
we said that the wife is loyal
and the husband is very jealous.

00:11:32.127 --> 00:11:34.815
This one sentence before the story started

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:37.140
was enough to make the brain responses

00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:40.208
of all the people that believed
the wife was having an affair

00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:42.669
be very similar in these high-order areas

00:11:42.693 --> 00:11:44.915
and different than the other group.

00:11:44.939 --> 00:11:48.612
And if one sentence is enough
to make your brain similar

00:11:48.636 --> 00:11:50.239
to people that think like you

00:11:50.263 --> 00:11:53.216
and very different than people
that think differently than you,

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.717
think how this effect is going
to be amplified in real life,

00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.633
when we are all listening
to the exact same news item

00:11:59.657 --> 00:12:03.405
after being exposed
day after day after day

00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:07.241
to different media channels,
like Fox News or The New York Times,

00:12:07.265 --> 00:12:10.378
that give us very different
perspectives on reality.

00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:12.909
So let me summarize.

00:12:13.529 --> 00:12:15.618
If everything worked as planned tonight,

00:12:15.642 --> 00:12:19.941
I used my ability to vocalize sound
to be coupled to your brains.

00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:21.468
And I used this coupling

00:12:21.492 --> 00:12:25.333
to transmit my brain patterns associated
with my memories and ideas

00:12:25.357 --> 00:12:26.673
into your brains.

00:12:27.201 --> 00:12:30.999
In this, I start to reveal
the hidden neural mechanism

00:12:31.023 --> 00:12:32.658
by which we communicate.

00:12:32.682 --> 00:12:35.649
And we know that in the future
it will enable us to improve

00:12:35.673 --> 00:12:37.663
and facilitate communication.

00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:39.805
But these studies also reveal

00:12:40.535 --> 00:12:43.821
that communication relies
on a common ground.

00:12:43.845 --> 00:12:46.307
And we have to be
really worried as a society

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:50.367
if we lose this common ground
and our ability to speak with people

00:12:50.391 --> 00:12:52.508
that are slightly different than us

00:12:52.532 --> 00:12:55.920
because we let a few very strong
media channels

00:12:55.944 --> 00:12:57.485
take control of the mic,

00:12:57.509 --> 00:13:01.284
and manipulate and control
the way we all think.

00:13:01.308 --> 00:13:04.209
And I'm not sure how to fix it
because I'm only a scientist.

00:13:04.233 --> 00:13:06.693
But maybe one way to do it

00:13:06.717 --> 00:13:09.364
is to go back to the more
natural way of communication,

00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:10.990
which is a dialogue,

00:13:11.014 --> 00:13:13.521
in which it's not only me
speaking to you now,

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:16.210
but a more natural way of talking,

00:13:16.234 --> 00:13:19.511
in which I am speaking and I am listening,

00:13:19.535 --> 00:13:24.255
and together we are trying to come
to a common ground and new ideas.

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:25.437
Because after all,

00:13:25.461 --> 00:13:29.125
the people we are coupled to
define who we are.

00:13:29.149 --> 00:13:31.538
And our desire to be coupled
to another brain

00:13:31.562 --> 00:13:36.079
is something very basic
that starts at a very early age.

00:13:36.103 --> 00:13:40.290
So let me finish with an example
from my own private life

00:13:41.044 --> 00:13:45.355
that I think is a good example
of how coupling to other people

00:13:45.379 --> 00:13:47.653
is really going to define who we are.

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:51.368
This my son Jonathan at a very early age.

00:13:51.392 --> 00:13:55.542
See how he developed
a vocal game together with my wife,

00:13:55.566 --> 00:14:00.797
only from the desire and pure joy
of being coupled to another human being.

00:14:01.556 --> 00:14:06.473
(Both vocalizing)

00:14:14.915 --> 00:14:17.243
(Laughter)

00:14:17.267 --> 00:14:21.064
Now, think how the ability of my son

00:14:21.088 --> 00:14:23.850
to be coupled to us
and other people in his life

00:14:23.874 --> 00:14:26.732
is going to shape the man
he is going to become.

00:14:26.756 --> 00:14:29.171
And think how you change on a daily basis

00:14:29.195 --> 00:14:33.518
from the interaction and coupling
to other people in your life.

00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:36.665
So keep being coupled to other people.

00:14:37.157 --> 00:14:38.706
Keep spreading your ideas,

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.974
because the sum of all of us
together, coupled,

00:14:41.998 --> 00:14:43.592
is greater than our parts.

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:44.782
Thank you.

00:14:44.806 --> 00:14:50.468
(Applause)
