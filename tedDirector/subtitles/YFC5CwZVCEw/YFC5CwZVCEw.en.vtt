00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:18.402
When I was a child growing up in Maine,

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:20.426
one of my favorite things to do

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.474
was to look for sand dollars
on the seashores of Maine,

00:00:23.498 --> 00:00:26.204
because my parents told me
it would bring me luck.

00:00:26.228 --> 00:00:28.906
But you know, these shells,
they're hard to find.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.426
They're covered in sand,
they're difficult to see.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.433
However, over time,
I got used to looking for them.

00:00:35.457 --> 00:00:37.060
I started seeing shapes

00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:39.806
and patterns that helped me
to collect them.

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:44.416
This grew into a passion
for finding things,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.480
a love for the past and archaeology.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:50.114
And eventually, when I started
studying Egyptology,

00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:54.527
I realized that seeing
with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough.

00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:57.400
Because all of the sudden, in Egypt,

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:01.019
my beach had grown
from a tiny beach in Maine

00:01:01.043 --> 00:01:03.130
to one eight hundred miles long,

00:01:03.154 --> 00:01:04.304
next to the Nile.

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.459
And my sand dollars had grown
to the size of cities.

00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:12.633
This is really what brought me
to using satellite imagery.

00:01:12.657 --> 00:01:16.687
For trying to map the past,
I knew that I had to see differently.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.498
So I want to show you an example
of how we see differently

00:01:20.522 --> 00:01:21.766
using the infrared.

00:01:22.163 --> 00:01:25.116
This is a site located
in the eastern Egyptian delta

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.337
called Mendes.

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:29.337
And the site visibly appears brown,

00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:31.567
but when we use the infrared

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:34.241
and we process it, all of the sudden,

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:35.781
using false color,

00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:37.591
the site appears as bright pink.

00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:39.336
What you are seeing

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.661
are the actual chemical changes
to the landscape

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:46.177
caused by the building
materials and activities

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.566
of the ancient Egyptians.

00:01:48.645 --> 00:01:50.756
What I want to share with you today

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.581
is how we've used satellite data

00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:56.060
to find an ancient Egyptian city,

00:01:56.084 --> 00:01:57.702
called Itjtawy,

00:01:57.726 --> 00:01:59.457
missing for thousands of years.

00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:03.036
Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.583
for over four hundred years,

00:02:04.607 --> 00:02:06.925
at a period of time
called the Middle Kingdom,

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:08.543
about four thousand years ago.

00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:11.789
The site is located
in the Faiyum of Egypt,

00:02:11.813 --> 00:02:13.412
and the site is really important,

00:02:13.436 --> 00:02:16.434
because in the Middle Kingdom
there was this great renaissance

00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:19.329
for ancient Egyptian art,
architecture and religion.

00:02:20.044 --> 00:02:22.797
Egyptologists have always known
the site of Itjtawy

00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:27.251
was located somewhere near the pyramids
of the two kings who built it,

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:29.789
indicated within the red circles here,

00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:32.107
but somewhere within
this massive flood plain.

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:33.415
This area is huge --

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.033
it's four miles by three miles in size.

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.408
The Nile used to flow
right next to the city of Itjtawy,

00:02:39.432 --> 00:02:42.845
and as it shifted and changed
and moved over time to the east,

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.329
it covered over the city.

00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:48.567
So, how do you find a buried city

00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:49.995
in a vast landscape?

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:53.194
Finding it randomly
would be the equivalent

00:02:53.218 --> 00:02:54.916
of locating a needle in a haystack,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.790
blindfolded, wearing baseball mitts.

00:02:56.814 --> 00:02:58.042
(Laughter)

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:01.328
So what we did is
we used NASA topography data

00:03:01.352 --> 00:03:04.113
to map out the landscape,
very subtle changes.

00:03:04.478 --> 00:03:07.502
We started to be able to see
where the Nile used to flow.

00:03:08.193 --> 00:03:10.978
But you can see in more detail,
and even more interesting,

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:13.049
this very slight raised area

00:03:13.073 --> 00:03:14.510
seen within the circle up here

00:03:14.534 --> 00:03:17.953
which we thought could possibly be
the location of the city of Itjtawy.

00:03:18.493 --> 00:03:21.508
So we collaborated
with Egyptian scientists

00:03:21.532 --> 00:03:23.658
to do coring work, which you see here.

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:25.850
When I say coring, it's like ice coring,

00:03:25.874 --> 00:03:27.809
but instead of layers of climate change,

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.165
you're looking for layers
of human occupation.

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.926
And, five meters down,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.077
underneath a thick layer of mud,

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:37.529
we found a dense layer of pottery.

00:03:37.553 --> 00:03:40.427
What this shows is that
at this possible location of Itjtawy,

00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:41.688
five meters down,

00:03:41.712 --> 00:03:44.537
we have a layer of occupation
for several hundred years,

00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:45.958
dating to the Middle Kingdom,

00:03:45.982 --> 00:03:48.941
dating to the exact period of time
we think Itjtawy is.

00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:51.974
We also found work stone --

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:54.132
carnelian, quartz and agate

00:03:54.156 --> 00:03:56.593
that shows that there was
a jeweler's workshop here.

00:03:56.617 --> 00:03:58.102
These might not look like much,

00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:00.775
but when you think
about the most common stones

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.169
used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom,

00:04:04.193 --> 00:04:05.978
these are the stones that were used.

00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:08.186
So, we have a dense layer of occupation

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.211
dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:13.036
We also have evidence
of an elite jeweler's workshop,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.790
showing that whatever was there
was a very important city.

00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:18.734
No Itjtawy was here yet,

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.759
but we're going to be
returning to the site

00:04:20.783 --> 00:04:22.837
in the near future to map it out.

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.512
And even more importantly,

00:04:24.536 --> 00:04:29.059
we have funding to train young Egyptians
in the use of satellite technology

00:04:29.083 --> 00:04:32.019
so they can be the ones
making great discoveries as well.

00:04:32.784 --> 00:04:37.622
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote
from the Middle Kingdom --

00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:40.187
it was probably written
at the city of Itjtawy

00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:41.883
four thousand years ago.

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:45.154
"Sharing knowledge
is the greatest of all callings.

00:04:45.178 --> 00:04:46.941
There's nothing like it in the land."

00:04:46.965 --> 00:04:52.449
So as it turns out,
TED was not founded in 1984 AD.

00:04:52.473 --> 00:04:54.568
(Laughter)

00:04:55.369 --> 00:05:01.123
Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC

00:05:01.147 --> 00:05:04.401
at a not-lost-for-long city,
found from above.

00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:08.259
It certainly puts finding seashells
by the seashore in perspective.

00:05:08.283 --> 00:05:09.435
Thank you very much.

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.889
(Applause)

00:05:11.913 --> 00:05:13.070
Thank you.

00:05:13.094 --> 00:05:15.133
(Applause)
