John Hockenberry: It's great to be here with you, Tom.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
And I want to start with a question

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
that has just been consuming me

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
since I first became familiar with your work.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
of a natural force

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
in some sort of interplay with creative force.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Are they ever in equilibrium

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
in the way that you see your work?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Tom Shannon: Yeah, the subject matter that I'm looking for,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
it's usually to solve a question.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
I had the question popped into my head:

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.260
What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
if you could connect the two spheres?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And in proportion, what would the size of the sphere

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And so I went about and made that sculpture,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
turning it out of solid bronze.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
And I did one that was about 35 feet long.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
The sun end was about four inches in diameter,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and then it tapered over about 35 feet

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
to about a millimeter at the Earth end.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And so for me, it was really exciting

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
just to see what it looks like

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
if you could step outside and into a larger context,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
as though you were an astronaut,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and see these two things as an object,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
because they are so intimately bound,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and one is meaningless without the other.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
JH: Is there a relief

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
in playing with these forces?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
in playing with these forces.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
TS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects --

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
like that silver one there,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
that was the result

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
of hundreds of experiments with magnets,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
trying to find a way to make something float

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
with the least possible connection to the ground.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
So I got it down to just one tether

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
to be able to support that.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
JH: Now is this electromagnetic here, or are these static?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
TS: Those are permanent magnets, yeah.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
JH: Because if the power went out, there would just be a big noise.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
TS: Yeah.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
It's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
JH: I agree.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
TS: The magnetic works

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
are a combination of gravity and magnetism,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
that influence everything.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
The sun has a tremendous field

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
that extends way beyond the planets

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So there's this huge

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
invisible shape structures

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
that magnetism takes in the universe.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
But with the pendulum,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
it allows me to manifest

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
these invisible forces

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
that are holding the magnets up.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
My sculptures

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
are normally very simplified.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
I try to refine them down

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
to very simple forms.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
But the paintings become very complex,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
because I think the fields

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
that are supporting them,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
they're billowing, and they're interpenetrating,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and they're interference patterns.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
JH: And they're non-deterministic.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
I mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
even though the forces can be calculated.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
So the evolution of this --

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
I gather this isn't your first pendulum.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
TS: No. (JH: No.)

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
TS: The first one I did was in the late 70's,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and I just had a simple cone

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
with a spigot at the bottom of it.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
I threw it into an orbit,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and it only had one color,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and when it got to the center, the paint kept running out,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
so I had to run in there,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
didn't have any control over the spigot remotely.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
So that told me right away: I need a remote control device.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
But then I started dreaming of having six colors.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
I sort of think about it as the DNA --

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
these colors, the red, blue, yellow,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
the primary colors and white and black.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
And if you put them together in different combinations --

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
just like printing in a sense,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
like how a magazine color is printed --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and put them under certain forces,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
which is orbiting them

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
or passing them back and forth

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
or drawing with them,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
these amazing things started appearing.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
JH: It looks like we're loaded for bear here.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
TS: Yeah, well let's put a couple of canvases.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
I'll ask a couple of my sons

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
to set up the canvases here.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
I want to just say --

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
so this is Jack, Nick and Louie.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
JH: Thanks guys.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
TS: So here are the --

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
JH: All right, I'll get out of the way here.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
TS: I'm just going to throw this into an orbit

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
(Laughter)

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
JH: Whoa. That is ...

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
ooh, nice.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
TS: So something like this.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
I'm doing this as a demo,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and it's more playful,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
but inevitably,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
all of this can be used.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
I can redeem this painting,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
just continuing on,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
doing layers upon layers.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
And I keep it around for a couple of weeks,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and I'm contemplating it,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and I'll do another session with it

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and bring it up to another level,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
where all of this

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
becomes the background, the depth of it.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
JH: That's fantastic.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
are like radio-controlled airplane valves.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
TS: Yes, they're servos with cams

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
that pinch these rubber tubes.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And they can pinch them very tight and stop it,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
or you can have them wide open.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
And all of the colors

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
come out one central port

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
at the bottom.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
You can always be changing colors, put aluminum paint,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
or I could put anything into this.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
It could be tomato sauce,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
or anything could be dispensed --

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
sand, powders or anything like that.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
JH: So many forces there.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
You've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
you've got the fluid dynamics.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Each of these beautiful paintings,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
are they images in and of themselves,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
or are they records

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
of a physical event

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
called the pendulum approaching the canvas?

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
TS: Well, this painting here,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
I wanted to do something very simple,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
a simple, iconic image

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
of two ripples interfering.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
So the one on the right was done first,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
and then the one on the left

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
was done over it.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
And then I left gaps

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
so you could see the one that was done before.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
And then when I did the second one,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
it really disturbed the piece --

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
these big blue lines

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
crashing through the center of it --

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.260
There are lines in front of the one on the right,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
and there are lines behind the one on the left,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
and so it takes it into different planes.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
What it's also about,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
just the little events,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
the events of the interpenetration of --

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
JH: Two stars, or --

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
TS: Two things that happened --

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
there's an interference pattern, and then a third thing happens.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
There are shapes that come about

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
just by the marriage

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
of two events that are happening,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
and I'm very interested in that.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Like the occurrence of moire patterns.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Like this green one,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
this is a painting I did about 10 years ago,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
but it has some --

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
see, in the upper third --

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
there are these moires and interference patterns

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
that are radio kind of imagery.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And that's something that in painting

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
I've never seen done.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
I've never seen a representation

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
of a kind of radio interference patterns,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
which are so ubiquitous

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
and such an important part of our lives.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
JH: Is that a literal part of the image,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
or is my eye making that interference pattern --

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
is my eye completing that interference pattern?

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
TS: It is the paint actually,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
makes it real.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
It's really manifested there.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
If I throw a very concentric circle,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
or concentric ellipse,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
it just dutifully makes

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
these evenly spaced lines,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
which get closer and closer together,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
which describes how gravity works.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
There's something very appealing

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
about the exactitude of science

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
that I really enjoy.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
And I love the shapes that I see

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
in scientific observations

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
and apparatus,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
especially astronomical forms

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and the idea of the vastness of it,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
the scale,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
is very interesting to me.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
My focus in recent years

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
has kind of shifted more toward biology.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Some of these paintings, when you look at them very close,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
odd things appear

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
that really look like horses or birds

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
or crocodiles, elephants.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
There are lots of things that appear.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
When you look into it, it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And then there are all these forms

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
that we don't know what they are,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
but they're equally well-resolved

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
and complex.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
So I think, conceivably, those could be predictive.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
Because since it has the ability

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
to make forms

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
that look like forms that we're familiar with

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
in biology,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
And maybe it's the kind of forms

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
where there are probably lakes

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
with fish swimming under the surface.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
JH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Oh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
You know, it seems

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
at this stage in your life,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
you also very personally

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
are in this state of confrontation

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
with a sort of dissonant --

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
I suppose it's an electromagnetic force

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
that somehow governs your Parkinson's

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and this creative force

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
that is both the artist

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
who is in the here and now

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
and this sort of arc of your whole life.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
Is that relevant to your work?

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
TS: As it turns out,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
this device kind of comes in handy,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
because I don't have to have

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
the fine motor skills to do,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
that I can operate slides,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
which is more of a mental process.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
I'm looking at it and making decisions:

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
It needs more red, it needs more blue,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
it needs a different shape.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And so I make these creative decisions

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
and can execute them

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
in a much, much simpler way.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
I mean, I've got the symptoms.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
In my case,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
my left hand has a significant tremor

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
and my left leg also.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
I'm left-handed, and so I draw.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
All my creations

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
really start on small drawings,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
which I have thousands of,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
and it's my way of just thinking.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
I draw with a simple pencil,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and at first, the Parkinson's

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
was really upsetting,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
JH: So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
You think of yourself as the servant.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
It just has so much in it.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And I think nature

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
wants to express itself

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
in the sense that we are nature,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
humans are of the universe.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
The universe is in our mind,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
and our minds are in the universe.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
And we are expressions

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
of the universe, basically.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
As humans,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
ultimately being part of the universe,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
we're kind of the spokespeople

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
or the observer part

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
of the constituency

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
of the universe.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
And to interface with it,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
with a device that lets these forces

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
that are everywhere

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
act and show what they can do,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
giving them pigment and paint just like an artist,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
it's a good ally.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
It's a terrific studio assistant.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
JH: Well, I love the idea

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
that somewhere within this idea

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
of fine motion and control

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
with the traditional skills

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
that you have with your hand,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
some sort of more elemental force gets revealed,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
and that's the beauty here.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Tom, thank you so much. It's been really, really great.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
TS: Thank you, John.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
(Applause)
