00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Sometimes I go browsing

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
[through] a very old magazine.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I found this observation test

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
about the story of the ark.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And the artist that drew this observation test

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
did some errors, had some mistakes --

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
there are more or less 12 mistakes.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Some of them are very easy.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
There is a funnel, an aerial part,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
a lamp and clockwork key on the ark.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Some of them are about the animals, the number.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
But there is a much more fundamental mistake

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
in the overall story of the ark

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that's not reported here.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And this problem is: where are the plants?

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
So now we have God

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
that is going to submerge Earth permanently

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
or at least for a very long period,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and no one is taking care of plants.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
of every kind of animal,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
of every kind of creature that moves,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
but no mention about plants.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Why?

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
In another part of the same story,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
all the living creatures

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
are just the living creatures

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
that came out from the ark,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
so birds, livestock and wild animals.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Plants are not living creatures --

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
this is the point.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
That is a point that is not

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
coming out from the Bible,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
but it's something that

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
really accompanied humanity.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Let's have a look at this nice code

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
that is coming from a Renaissance book.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Here we have the description

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
of the order of nature.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
It's a nice description because it's starting from left --

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
you have the stones --

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
immediately after the stones, the plants

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
that are just able to live.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
We have the animals that are able to live and to sense,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and on the top of the pyramid,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
there is the man.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
This is not the common man.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
The "Homo studiosus" -- the studying man.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
This is quite comforting

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
for people like me -- I'm a professor --

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
this to be over there on the top of creation.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
But it's something completely wrong.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
You know very well about professors.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
But it's also wrong about plants,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
because plants are not just able to live;

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
they are able to sense.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
They are much more sophisticated

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
in sensing than animals.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Just to give you an example,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
every single root apex

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
is able to detect and to monitor

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
concurrently and continuously

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
at least 15 different chemical

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and physical parameters.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And they also are able to show and to exhibit

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
such a wonderful and complex behavior

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
that can be described just with the term of intelligence.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Well, but this is something --

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
this underestimation of plants is something

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
that is always with us.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Let's have a look at this short movie now.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
We have David Attenborough.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover;

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
he did some of the most beautiful movies

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
about plant behavior.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Now, when he speaks about plants,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
everything is correct.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
When he speaks about animals,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
[he] tends to remove the fact

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
that plants exist.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
The blue whale,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
the biggest creature that exists on the planet --

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
that is wrong, completely wrong.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
The blue whale, it's a dwarf

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
if compared with the real biggest creature

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
that exists on the planet --

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
that is, this wonderful,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.260
magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
(Applause)

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
And this is a living organism

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Now, the story

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
that plants are some low-level organisms

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
has been formalized

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
many times ago by Aristotle,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
that in "De Anima" --

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
that is a very influential book for the Western civilization --

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
wrote that the plants are on the edge

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
between living and not living.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
They have just a kind of very low-level soul.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
It's called the vegetative soul,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
because they lack movement,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and so they don't need to sense.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Let's see.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Okay, some of the movements of the plants are very well-known.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
This is a very fast movement.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
This is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
hunting snails --

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
sorry for the snail.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
This has been something that has been refused for centuries,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
despite the evidence.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
because it was against the order of nature.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
But plants are also able

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
to show a lot of movement.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Some of them are very well known, like the flowering.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
It's just a question to use some techniques

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
like the time lapse.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Some of them are much more sophisticated.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Look at this young bean

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
that is moving to catch the light every time.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And it's really so graceful;

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
it's like a dancing angel.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
They are also able to play --

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
they are really playing.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
These are young sunflowers,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and what they are doing

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
cannot be described

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
with any other terms than playing.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
They are training themselves,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
as many young animals do,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
to the adult life

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
where they will be called to track the sun

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
all the day.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
They are able to respond to gravity, of course,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
so the shoots are growing

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
against the vector of gravity

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and the roots toward the vector of gravity.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
But they are also able to sleep.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
This is one, Mimosa pudica.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
So during the night,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
they curl the leaves

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
and reduce the movement,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
and during the day, you have the opening of the leaves --

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
there is much more movement.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
This is interesting

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
because this sleeping machinery,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
it's perfectly conserved.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
It's the same in plants, in insects

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
and in animals.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And so if you need to study this sleeping problem,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
it's easy to study on plants, for example,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
than in animals

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and it's much more easy even ethically.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
It's a kind of vegetarian

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
experimentation.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Plants are even able to communicate --

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
they are extraordinary communicators.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
They communicate with other plants.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
They communicate

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
with plants of other species

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and they communicate with animals

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
by producing chemical volatiles,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
for example, during the pollination.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Now with the pollination, it's a very serious issue for plants,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
because they move the pollen from one flower to the other,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
yet they cannot move from one flower to the other.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
So they need a vector --

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and this vector,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
it's normally an animal.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Many insects

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
have been used by plants as vectors

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
for the transport of the pollination,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
but not just insects; even birds, reptiles,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and mammals like bats rats

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
are normally used for the transportation of the pollen.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
This is a serious business.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
We have the plants that are giving to the animals

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
a kind of sweet substance --

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
very energizing --

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
having in change this transportation of the pollen.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
But some plants are manipulating animals,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
like in the case of orchids

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
that promise sex and nectar

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and give in change nothing

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
for the transportation of the pollen.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Now, there is a big problem

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
behind all this behavior that we have seen.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
How is it possible to do this without a brain?

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
We need to wait until 1880,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
when this big man,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Charles Darwin,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
publishes a wonderful, astonishing book

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
that starts a revolution.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
The title is "The Power of Movement in Plants."

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
before Charles Darwin.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
In his book,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
assisted by his son, Francis --

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world, in Cambridge --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
they took into consideration every single movement

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
for 500 pages.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And in the last paragraph of the book,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
it's a kind of stylistic mark,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
because normally Charles Darwin stored,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
in the last paragraph of a book,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
the most important message.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
He wrote that,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
"It's hardly an exaggeration

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
to say that the tip of the radical

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
acts like the brain

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
of one of the lower animals."

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
This is not a metaphor.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.260
who was J.D. Hooker, or at that time, president of the Royal Society,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
so the maximum scientific authority in Britain

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
speaking about the brain in the plants.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Now, this is a root apex

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
growing against a slope.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
So you can recognize this kind of movement,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
the same movement that worms, snakes

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and every animal

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
that are moving on the ground without legs

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
is able to display.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
And it's not an easy movement

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
because, to have this kind of movement,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
you need to move different regions of the root

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
and to synchronize these different regions

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
without having a brain.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So we studied the root apex

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
and we found that there is a specific region

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
that is here, depicted in blue --

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
that is called the "transition zone."

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
And this region, it's a very small region --

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
it's less than one millimeter.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
And in this small region

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
you have the highest consumption

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
of oxygen in the plants

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
and more important,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
you have these kinds of signals here.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
The signals that you are seeing here are action potential,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
are the same signals

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
that the neurons of my brain, of our brain,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
use to exchange information.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Now we know that a root apex

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
has just a few hundred cells

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
that show this kind of feature,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
but we know how big

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
the root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
We have almost

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
14 million roots.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
We have 11 and a half million

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
root apex

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and a total length of 600 or more kilometers

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and a very high surface area.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
Now let's imagine

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
that each single root apex

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
is working in network with all the others.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Here were have on the left, the Internet

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
and on the right, the root apparatus.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
They work in the same way.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
They are a network

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
of small computing machines,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
working in networks.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
And why are they so similar?

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
Because they evolved

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
for the same reason:

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
to survive predation.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
They work in the same way.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
and the plants [continue] to work.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
You can remove 90 percent of the Internet

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
and it is [continuing] to work.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
So, a suggestion

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
for the people working with networks:

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
plants are able

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
to give you good suggestions

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
about how to evolve networks.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
And another possibility

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
is a technological possibility.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
Let's imagine

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
that we can build robots

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and robots that are inspired by plants.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Until now,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
the man was inspired

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
just by man or the animals

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
in producing a robot.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
We have the animaloid --

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
and the normal robots inspired by animals,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
insectoid, so on.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
We have the androids

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
that are inspired by man.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
But why have we not any plantoid?

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
Well, if you want to fly,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
it's good that you look at birds --

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
to be inspired by birds.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
But if you want to explore soils,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
or if you want to colonize

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
new territory,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
that are masters in doing this.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
We have another possibility

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
we are working [on] in our lab,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
[which] is to build hybrids.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
It's much more easy to build hybrids.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Hybrid means it's something

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
that's half living and half machine.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
It's much more easy to work with plants

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
than with animals.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
They have computing power,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
they have electrical signals.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
The connection with the machine is much more easy,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.260
much more even ethically possible.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
And these are three possibilities

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
that we are working on

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
to build hybrids,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
driven by algae

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
or by the leaves at the end,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
by the most, most powerful parts of the plants,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
by the roots.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
Well, thank you for your attention.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
And before I finish,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
in making this presentation.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
Thank you.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:43.260
(Applause)
