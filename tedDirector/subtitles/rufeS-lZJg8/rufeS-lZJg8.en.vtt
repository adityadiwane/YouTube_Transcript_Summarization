00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:15.833
Like most journalists, I'm an idealist.

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:20.158
I love unearthing good stories,
especially untold stories.

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:23.559
I just didn't think that in 2011,

00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:25.744
women would still be in that category.

00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:30.515
I'm the President of the Journalism
and Women Symposium -- JAWS.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.691
That's Sharky.

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:33.206
(Laughter)

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.034
I joined 10 years ago
because I wanted female role models,

00:00:36.058 --> 00:00:40.257
and I was frustrated by the lagging status
of women in our profession

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:42.926
and what that meant
for our image in the media.

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:46.189
We make up half
the population of the world,

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.800
but we're just 24 percent
of the news subjects

00:00:48.824 --> 00:00:50.324
quoted in news stories.

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:54.065
And we're just 20 percent
of the experts quoted in stories.

00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:56.533
And now, with today's technology,

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:59.739
it's possible to remove women
from the picture completely.

00:01:00.588 --> 00:01:04.460
This is a picture of President
Barack Obama and his advisors,

00:01:04.484 --> 00:01:06.572
tracking the killing of Osama bin Laden.

00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:08.730
You can see Hillary Clinton on the right.

00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:10.581
Let's see how the photo ran

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:13.453
in an Orthodox Jewish
newspaper based in Brooklyn.

00:01:14.327 --> 00:01:16.040
Hillary's completely gone.

00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:18.912
(Laughter)

00:01:18.936 --> 00:01:21.985
The paper apologized,
but said it never runs photos of women;

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.941
they might be sexually provocative.

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:26.075
(Laughter)

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:28.147
This is an extreme case, yes.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.338
But the fact is,

00:01:29.362 --> 00:01:33.481
women are only 19 percent
of the sources in stories on politics,

00:01:33.505 --> 00:01:36.517
and only 20 percent
in stories on the economy.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.091
The news continues to give us a picture

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:41.727
where men outnumber women

00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.465
in nearly all occupational
categories, except two:

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:46.977
students and homemakers.

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:48.258
(Laughter)

00:01:48.282 --> 00:01:51.311
So we all get a very
distorted picture of reality.

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:55.520
The problem is, of course,
there aren't enough women in newsrooms.

00:01:55.544 --> 00:01:59.449
They report at just 37 percent of stories
in print, TV and radio.

00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:03.086
Even in stories on gender-based violence,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.713
men get an overwhelming majority
of print space and airtime.

00:02:06.737 --> 00:02:07.888
Case in point:

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.903
This March, the New York Times
ran a story by James McKinley

00:02:11.927 --> 00:02:13.581
about a gang rape of a young girl,

00:02:13.605 --> 00:02:15.943
11 years old, in a small Texas town.

00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:19.570
McKinley writes that
the community is wondering,

00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:22.416
"How could their boys
have been drawn into this?"

00:02:23.136 --> 00:02:24.540
"Drawn into this" --

00:02:24.564 --> 00:02:27.644
like they were seduced
into committing an act of violence.

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:29.653
And the first person he quotes says,

00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:32.750
"These boys will have to live
with this the rest of their lives."

00:02:32.774 --> 00:02:35.016
(Groans, laughter)

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:38.620
You don't hear much
about the 11-year-old victim,

00:02:38.644 --> 00:02:42.061
except that she wore clothes
that were a little old for her

00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:43.497
and she wore makeup.

00:02:44.223 --> 00:02:46.918
The Times was deluged with criticism.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.949
Initially, it defended itself,

00:02:48.973 --> 00:02:50.694
and said, "These aren't our views.

00:02:50.718 --> 00:02:52.646
This is what we found in our reporting."

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.952
Now, here's a secret
you probably know already:

00:02:55.492 --> 00:02:57.090
Your stories are constructed.

00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:00.135
As reporters, we research, we interview.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.067
We try to give a good picture of reality.

00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:05.836
We also have our own unconscious biases.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.383
But The Times makes it sound like anyone
would have reported this story

00:03:09.407 --> 00:03:10.558
the same way.

00:03:11.175 --> 00:03:12.623
I disagree with that.

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:14.835
So three weeks later,

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.386
The Times revisits the story.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.159
This time, it adds another byline
to it with McKinley's:

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:21.659
Erica Goode.

00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:24.585
What emerges is a truly sad, horrific tale

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.568
of a young girl and her family
trapped in poverty.

00:03:27.592 --> 00:03:30.267
She was raped numerous times by many men.

00:03:30.703 --> 00:03:33.093
She had been a bright, easygoing girl.

00:03:33.117 --> 00:03:35.679
She was maturing quickly, physically,

00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:38.695
but her bed was still covered
with stuffed animals.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.282
It's a very different picture.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.327
Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode
is what made this story more complete.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.070
The Global Media Monitoring Project
has found that stories by female reporters

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:52.863
are more likely to challenge stereotypes
than those by male reporters.

00:03:52.887 --> 00:03:54.260
At KUNM here in Albuquerque,

00:03:54.284 --> 00:03:56.419
Elaine Baumgartel
did some graduate research

00:03:56.443 --> 00:03:58.712
on the coverage of violence against women.

00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:02.109
What she found was many of these
stories tend to blame victims

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:03.652
and devalue their lives.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.883
They tend to sensationalize,
and they lack context.

00:04:07.423 --> 00:04:08.638
So for her graduate work,

00:04:08.662 --> 00:04:11.559
she did a three-part series
on the murder of 11 women,

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:14.159
found buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa.

00:04:14.183 --> 00:04:17.547
She tried to challenge those patterns
and stereotypes in her work

00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:20.412
and she tried to show
the challenges that journalists face

00:04:20.436 --> 00:04:23.956
from external sources,
their own internal biases

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.279
and cultural norms.

00:04:25.652 --> 00:04:28.375
And she worked with an editor
at National Public Radio

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:30.932
to try to get a story aired nationally.

00:04:30.956 --> 00:04:34.901
She's not sure that would have happened
if the editor had not been a female.

00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:36.671
Stories in the news

00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:40.932
are more than twice as likely
to present women as victims than men,

00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:44.805
and women are more likely to be defined
by their body parts.

00:04:45.562 --> 00:04:47.750
Wired magazine, November 2010.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.550
Yes, the issue was about
breast-tissue engineering.

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:55.443
Now I know you're all distracted,
so I'll take that off.

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:56.468
(Laughter)

00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:57.646
Eyes up here.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.922
(Laughter)

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:02.097
So --

00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:06.299
(Applause)

00:05:06.323 --> 00:05:07.483
Here's the thing:

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:10.064
Wired almost never puts
women on its cover.

00:05:10.414 --> 00:05:12.391
Oh, there have been some gimmicky ones --

00:05:12.415 --> 00:05:14.017
Pam from "The Office,"

00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:15.950
manga girls,

00:05:15.974 --> 00:05:18.595
a voluptuous model
covered in synthetic diamonds.

00:05:19.863 --> 00:05:23.431
Texas State University professor
Cindy Royal wondered in her blog

00:05:23.455 --> 00:05:27.446
how are young women like her students
supposed to feel about their roles

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.938
in technology, reading Wired.

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:32.215
Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired,
defended his choice

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:34.628
and said there aren't enough women,
prominent women

00:05:34.652 --> 00:05:37.775
in technology to sell a cover,
to sell an issue.

00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:39.740
Part of that is true,

00:05:39.764 --> 00:05:42.312
there aren't as many
prominent women in technology.

00:05:42.336 --> 00:05:44.334
Here's my problem with that argument:

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.429
Media tells us every day what's important,

00:05:47.453 --> 00:05:49.956
by the stories they choose
and where they place them;

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.445
it's called agenda setting.

00:05:52.433 --> 00:05:55.168
How many people knew
the founders of Facebook and Google

00:05:55.192 --> 00:05:57.360
before their faces
were on a magazine cover?

00:05:57.384 --> 00:05:59.846
Putting them there
made them more recognizable.

00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:03.061
Now, Fast Company Magazine
embraces that idea.

00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:06.010
This is its cover from November 15, 2010.

00:06:06.371 --> 00:06:10.445
The issue is about the most prominent
and influential women in technology.

00:06:10.827 --> 00:06:13.366
Editor Robert Safian
told the Poynter Institute,

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.237
"Silicon Valley is very white
and very male.

00:06:16.261 --> 00:06:18.555
But that's not what Fast Company thinks

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:20.943
the business world
will look like in the future,

00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:24.643
so it tries to give a picture
of where the globalized world is moving."

00:06:25.354 --> 00:06:28.020
By the way, apparently,
Wired took all this to heart.

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:30.008
This was its issue in April.

00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:31.910
(Laughter)

00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:34.751
That's Limor Fried, the founder
of Adafruit Industries,

00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:36.449
in the Rosie the Riveter pose.

00:06:37.704 --> 00:06:41.174
It would help to have more women
in positions of leadership in media.

00:06:41.198 --> 00:06:42.435
A recent global survey

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:45.325
found that 73 percent
of the top media-management jobs

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:46.993
are still held by men.

00:06:47.335 --> 00:06:49.968
But this is also about something
far more complex:

00:06:49.992 --> 00:06:52.960
our own unconscious
biases and blind spots.

00:06:53.817 --> 00:06:55.441
Shankar Vedantam is the author

00:06:55.465 --> 00:06:58.513
of "The Hidden Brain: How Our Unconscious
Minds Elect Presidents,

00:06:58.537 --> 00:07:01.199
Control Markets, Wage Wars,
and Save Our Lives."

00:07:01.718 --> 00:07:04.845
He told the former ombudsman
at National Public Radio,

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:08.606
who was doing a report
on how women fare in NPR coverage,

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.720
unconscious bias flows
throughout most of our lives.

00:07:11.744 --> 00:07:14.712
It's really difficult
to disentangle those strands.

00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:16.920
But he did have one suggestion.

00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:20.092
He used to work for two editors

00:07:20.116 --> 00:07:23.487
who said every story had to have
at least one female source.

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:25.592
He balked at first,

00:07:25.616 --> 00:07:28.568
but said he eventually followed
the directive happily,

00:07:28.592 --> 00:07:30.033
because his stories got better

00:07:30.057 --> 00:07:31.533
and his job got easier.

00:07:32.014 --> 00:07:34.612
Now, I don't know if one
of the editors was a woman,

00:07:34.636 --> 00:07:37.013
but that can make the biggest difference.

00:07:37.037 --> 00:07:41.003
The Dallas Morning News
won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:43.630
for a series it did on women
around the world,

00:07:43.654 --> 00:07:45.361
but one of the reporters told me

00:07:45.385 --> 00:07:47.734
she's convinced
it never would have happened

00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:51.169
if they had not had
a female assistant foreign editor,

00:07:51.193 --> 00:07:53.677
and they would not have gotten
some of those stories

00:07:53.701 --> 00:07:56.192
without female reporters
and editors on the ground,

00:07:56.216 --> 00:07:59.118
particularly one
on female genital mutilation --

00:07:59.142 --> 00:08:01.807
men would just not be allowed
into those situations.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.454
This is an important point to consider,

00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:07.734
because much of our foreign policy
now revolves around countries

00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:10.179
where the treatment of women is an issue,

00:08:10.203 --> 00:08:11.568
such as Afghanistan.

00:08:13.578 --> 00:08:17.702
What we're told in terms of arguments
against leaving this country

00:08:17.726 --> 00:08:20.590
is that the fate of the women is primary.

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:25.415
Now, I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul
can find women to interview.

00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:29.607
Not so sure about rural,
traditional areas,

00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:32.310
where I'm guessing
women can't talk to strange men.

00:08:32.858 --> 00:08:36.443
It's important to keep talking about this,
in light of Lara Logan.

00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:39.033
She was the CBS News correspondent

00:08:39.057 --> 00:08:41.970
who was brutally sexually assaulted
in Egypt's Tahrir Square,

00:08:41.994 --> 00:08:43.760
right after this photo was taken.

00:08:44.133 --> 00:08:46.902
Almost immediately, pundits weighed in,

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:50.165
blaming her and saying things like,

00:08:50.189 --> 00:08:53.589
"You know, maybe women shouldn't
be sent to cover those stories."

00:08:53.613 --> 00:08:56.850
I never heard anyone say this
about Anderson Cooper and his crew,

00:08:56.874 --> 00:08:59.482
who were attacked covering the same story.

00:09:00.387 --> 00:09:02.438
One way to get more women into leadership

00:09:02.462 --> 00:09:04.239
is to have other women mentor them.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.233
One of my board members is an editor
at a major global media company,

00:09:08.257 --> 00:09:10.893
but she never thought
about this as a career path,

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:13.425
until she met female role models at JAWS.

00:09:14.425 --> 00:09:16.925
But this is not just a job
for super-journalists

00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:18.128
or my organization.

00:09:18.152 --> 00:09:20.782
You all have a stake
in a strong, vibrant media.

00:09:21.743 --> 00:09:23.076
Analyze your news.

00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:26.031
And speak up when there are gaps
missing in coverage,

00:09:26.055 --> 00:09:28.006
like people at The New York Times did.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.037
Suggest female sources
to reporters and editors.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.899
Remember -- a complete picture of reality
may depend upon it.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.195
And I'll leave you with a video clip

00:09:37.219 --> 00:09:40.749
that I first saw in [1987]
when I was a student in London.

00:09:41.137 --> 00:09:42.709
It's for The Guardian newspaper.

00:09:42.733 --> 00:09:46.082
It's actually long before I ever thought
about becoming a journalist,

00:09:46.106 --> 00:09:49.288
but I was very interested
in how we learn to perceive our world.

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:55.156
Narrator: An event seen from one
point of view gives one impression.

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:02.331
Seen from another point of view,

00:10:02.355 --> 00:10:04.720
it gives quite a different impression.

00:10:06.982 --> 00:10:09.360
But it's only when you get
the whole picture,

00:10:09.384 --> 00:10:12.050
you can fully understand what's going on.

00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:17.801
[The Guardian]

00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:19.747
Megan Kamerick: I think you'll all agree

00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:22.531
that we'd be better off
if we all had the whole picture.
