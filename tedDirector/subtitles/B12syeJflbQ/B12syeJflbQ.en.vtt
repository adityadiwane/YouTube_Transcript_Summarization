00:00:13.372 --> 00:00:19.521
Every day, I listen to harrowing stories
of people fleeing for their lives,

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:23.458
across dangerous borders
and unfriendly seas.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.604
But there's one story
that keeps me awake at night,

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.184
and it's about Doaa.

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:33.031
A Syrian refugee, 19 years old,

00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:38.891
she was living a grinding existence
in Egypt working day wages.

00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:44.302
Her dad was constantly thinking
of his thriving business back in Syria

00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:47.674
that had been blown to pieces by a bomb.

00:00:48.238 --> 00:00:54.294
And the war that drove them there
was still raging in its fourth year.

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.208
And the community
that once welcomed them there

00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:00.597
had become weary of them.

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:04.306
And one day, men on motorcycles
tried to kidnap her.

00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:09.833
Once an aspiring student
thinking only of her future,

00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:13.435
now she was scared all the time.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:16.278
But she was also full of hope,

00:01:16.302 --> 00:01:21.325
because she was in love
with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem.

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:26.359
Bassem was also struggling in Egypt,
and he said to Doaa,

00:01:26.383 --> 00:01:29.749
"Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety.

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:33.916
I will work, you can study --
the promise of a new life."

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.057
And he asked her father
for her hand in marriage.

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:44.240
But they knew to get to Europe
they had to risk their lives,

00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:46.764
traveling across the Mediterranean Sea,

00:01:46.788 --> 00:01:52.245
putting their hands in smugglers',
notorious for their cruelty.

00:01:53.173 --> 00:01:56.562
And Doaa was terrified of the water.

00:01:57.292 --> 00:02:00.342
She always had been.
She never learned to swim.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:06.975
It was August that year,
and already 2,000 people had died

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:08.953
trying to cross the Mediterranean,

00:02:08.977 --> 00:02:12.947
but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it
all the way to Northern Europe,

00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:15.240
and she thought, "Maybe we can, too."

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.001
So she asked her parents if they could go,

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:22.367
and after a painful discussion,
they consented,

00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:28.521
and Bassem paid his entire life savings --
2,500 dollars each --

00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:29.941
to the smugglers.

00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:34.036
It was a Saturday morning
when the call came,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.539
and they were taken by bus to a beach,
hundreds of people on the beach.

00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:42.921
They were taken then by small boats
onto an old fishing boat,

00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:45.503
500 of them crammed onto that boat,

00:02:45.527 --> 00:02:48.403
300 below, [200] above.

00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:54.004
There were Syrians, Palestinians,
Africans, Muslims and Christians,

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:59.356
100 children, including Sandra --
little Sandra, six years old --

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.196
and Masa, 18 months.

00:03:03.498 --> 00:03:07.396
There were families on that boat,
crammed together shoulder to shoulder,

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.952
feet to feet.

00:03:08.976 --> 00:03:12.784
Doaa was sitting with her legs
crammed up to her chest,

00:03:12.808 --> 00:03:15.323
Bassem holding her hand.

00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:19.093
Day two on the water,
they were sick with worry

00:03:19.117 --> 00:03:22.196
and sick to their stomachs
from the rough sea.

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.084
Day three, Doaa had a premonition.

00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:31.621
And she said to Bassem,
"I fear we're not going to make it.

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:33.684
I fear the boat is going to sink."

00:03:34.517 --> 00:03:37.666
And Bassem said to her,
"Please be patient.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.872
We will make it to Sweden,
we will get married

00:03:40.896 --> 00:03:42.450
and we will have a future."

00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.604
Day four, the passengers
were getting agitated.

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:50.764
They asked the captain,
"When will we get there?"

00:03:50.788 --> 00:03:54.176
He told them to shut up,
and he insulted them.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.482
He said, "In 16 hours we will reach
the shores of Italy."

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:01.680
They were weak and weary.

00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:05.975
Soon they saw a boat approach --
a smaller boat, 10 men on board,

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:09.414
who started shouting at them,
hurling insults,

00:04:09.438 --> 00:04:13.788
throwing sticks, asking them
to all disembark

00:04:13.812 --> 00:04:17.527
and get on this smaller,
more unseaworthy boat.

00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:21.069
The parents were terrified
for their children,

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:25.094
and they collectively
refused to disembark.

00:04:26.157 --> 00:04:29.273
So the boat sped away in anger,

00:04:29.297 --> 00:04:33.527
and a half an hour later, came back

00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:39.603
and started deliberately ramming a hole
in the side of Doaa's boat,

00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:42.240
just below where she
and Bassem were sitting.

00:04:43.764 --> 00:04:47.103
And she heard how they yelled,

00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:50.488
"Let the fish eat your flesh!"

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:57.437
And they started laughing
as the boat capsized and sank.

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:01.058
The 300 people below deck were doomed.

00:05:01.757 --> 00:05:06.346
Doaa was holding on to the side
of the boat as it sank,

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.188
and watched in horror as a small child
was cut to pieces by the propeller.

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:16.554
Bassem said to her, "Please let go,

00:05:16.578 --> 00:05:19.743
or you'll be swept in and the propeller
will kill you, too."

00:05:20.267 --> 00:05:22.315
And remember -- she can't swim.

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.187
But she let go and she started moving
her arms and her legs,

00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:28.647
thinking, "This is swimming."

00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:33.044
And miraculously,
Bassem found a life ring.

00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:35.854
It was one of those child's rings

00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:39.975
that they use to play
in swimming pools and on calm seas.

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.044
And Doaa climbed onto the ring,

00:05:42.068 --> 00:05:45.788
her arms and her legs
dangling by the side.

00:05:46.835 --> 00:05:48.776
Bassem was a good swimmer,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.594
so he held her hand and tread water.

00:05:54.064 --> 00:05:56.002
Around them there were corpses.

00:05:56.026 --> 00:05:58.494
Around 100 people survived initially,

00:05:58.518 --> 00:06:03.059
and they started coming together
in groups, praying for rescue.

00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:07.400
But when a day went by and no one came,

00:06:07.424 --> 00:06:09.249
some people gave up hope,

00:06:09.273 --> 00:06:11.447
and Doaa and Bassem watched

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:18.052
as men in the distance took their
life vests off and sank into the water.

00:06:19.052 --> 00:06:24.975
One man approached them
with a small baby perched on his shoulder,

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:26.649
nine months old -- Malek.

00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:31.752
He was holding onto a gas canister
to stay afloat, and he said to them,

00:06:31.776 --> 00:06:33.726
"I fear I am not going to survive.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.416
I'm too weak. I don't have
the courage anymore."

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:41.975
And he handed little Malek
over to Bassem and to Doaa,

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:44.711
and they perched her onto the life ring.

00:06:45.774 --> 00:06:51.188
So now they were three,
Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.

00:06:51.212 --> 00:06:54.341
And let me take a pause
in this story right here

00:06:54.365 --> 00:06:56.663
and ask the question:

00:06:56.687 --> 00:07:01.480
why do refugees like Doaa
take these kinds of risks?

00:07:03.061 --> 00:07:07.904
Millions of refugees are living
in exile, in limbo.

00:07:09.232 --> 00:07:13.532
They're living in countries [fleeing]
from a war that has been raging

00:07:13.556 --> 00:07:15.840
for four years.

00:07:17.634 --> 00:07:20.795
Even if they wanted to return, they can't.

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.581
Their homes, their businesses,

00:07:23.605 --> 00:07:27.127
their towns and their cities
have been completely destroyed.

00:07:27.151 --> 00:07:29.975
This is a UNESCO World Heritage City,

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:31.756
Homs, in Syria.

00:07:33.097 --> 00:07:37.662
So people continue to flee
into neighboring countries,

00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:41.285
and we build refugee camps
for them in the desert.

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:45.319
Hundreds of thousands of people
live in camps like these,

00:07:45.343 --> 00:07:50.316
and thousands and thousands more,
millions, live in towns and cities.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.558
And the communities,

00:07:51.582 --> 00:07:54.438
the neighboring countries
that once welcomed them

00:07:54.462 --> 00:07:56.224
with open arms and hearts

00:07:56.248 --> 00:07:57.866
are overwhelmed.

00:07:58.731 --> 00:08:03.183
There are simply not enough schools,
water systems, sanitation.

00:08:03.747 --> 00:08:08.370
Even rich European countries
could never handle such an influx

00:08:08.394 --> 00:08:11.637
without massive investment.

00:08:13.407 --> 00:08:18.433
The Syria war has driven almost
four million people over the borders,

00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:23.394
but over seven million people
are on the run inside the country.

00:08:23.418 --> 00:08:27.109
That means that over half
the Syrian population

00:08:27.133 --> 00:08:29.393
has been forced to flee.

00:08:29.766 --> 00:08:34.059
Back to those neighboring
countries hosting so many.

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:40.147
They feel that the richer world
has done too little to support them.

00:08:41.401 --> 00:08:45.798
And days have turned into months,
months into years.

00:08:46.483 --> 00:08:50.055
A refugee's stay is supposed
to be temporary.

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:53.400
Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water.

00:08:53.424 --> 00:08:57.773
It was their second day,
and Bassem was getting very weak.

00:08:58.764 --> 00:09:02.765
And now it was Doaa's turn
to say to Bassem,

00:09:02.789 --> 00:09:08.472
"My love, please hold on to hope,
to our future. We will make it."

00:09:09.376 --> 00:09:12.057
And he said to her,

00:09:12.081 --> 00:09:16.518
"I'm sorry, my love,
that I put you in this situation.

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:21.219
I have never loved anyone
as much as I love you."

00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:26.269
And he released himself into the water,

00:09:26.293 --> 00:09:32.549
and Doaa watched as the love of her life
drowned before her eyes.

00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:38.304
Later that day,

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:43.979
a mother came up to Doaa with her
small 18-month-old daughter, Masa.

00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:47.666
This was the little girl I showed you
in the picture earlier,

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.538
with the life vests.

00:09:49.562 --> 00:09:51.755
Her older sister Sandra had just drowned,

00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:55.898
and her mother knew she had to do
everything in her power

00:09:55.922 --> 00:09:57.414
to save her daughter.

00:09:57.993 --> 00:10:01.850
And she said to Doaa,
"Please take this child.

00:10:01.874 --> 00:10:05.902
Let her be part of you.
I will not survive."

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:10.467
And then she went away and drowned.

00:10:11.825 --> 00:10:16.059
So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee
who was terrified of the water,

00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:17.975
who couldn't swim,

00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:23.591
found herself in charge
of two little baby kids.

00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:27.296
And they were thirsty and they were hungry
and they were agitated,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.018
and she tried her best to amuse them,

00:10:30.042 --> 00:10:34.075
to sing to them, to say words
to them from the Quran.

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:39.668
Around them, the bodies were bloating
and turning black.

00:10:39.692 --> 00:10:41.438
The sun was blazing during the day.

00:10:41.462 --> 00:10:44.182
At night, there was a cold moon and fog.

00:10:44.206 --> 00:10:46.182
It was very frightening.

00:10:46.976 --> 00:10:51.715
On the fourth day in the water,
this is how Doaa probably looked

00:10:51.739 --> 00:10:53.860
on the ring with her two children.

00:10:53.884 --> 00:10:57.431
A woman came on the fourth day
and approached her

00:10:57.455 --> 00:11:00.566
and asked her to take another child --

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.605
a little boy, just four years old.

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:09.016
When Doaa took the little boy
and the mother drowned,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.000
she said to the sobbing child,

00:11:11.024 --> 00:11:14.460
"She just went away
to find you water and food."

00:11:16.388 --> 00:11:18.381
But his heart soon stopped,

00:11:18.405 --> 00:11:22.078
and Doaa had to release
the little boy into the water.

00:11:23.023 --> 00:11:25.048
Later that day,

00:11:25.072 --> 00:11:28.351
she looked up into the sky with hope,

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:32.390
because she saw two planes
crossing in the sky.

00:11:32.414 --> 00:11:36.913
And she waved her arms,
hoping they would see her,

00:11:36.937 --> 00:11:38.793
but the planes were soon gone.

00:11:39.317 --> 00:11:42.220
But that afternoon,
as the sun was going down,

00:11:42.244 --> 00:11:45.100
she saw a boat, a merchant vessel.

00:11:46.109 --> 00:11:50.126
And she said, "Please, God,
let them rescue me."

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.110
She waved her arms and she felt
like she shouted for about two hours.

00:11:54.134 --> 00:11:58.744
And it had become dark,
but finally the searchlights found her

00:11:58.768 --> 00:12:00.975
and they extended a rope,

00:12:00.999 --> 00:12:05.968
astonished to see a woman
clutching onto two babies.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.258
They pulled them onto the boat,
they got oxygen and blankets,

00:12:10.282 --> 00:12:13.289
and a Greek helicopter came
to pick them up

00:12:13.313 --> 00:12:15.425
and take them to the island of Crete.

00:12:16.353 --> 00:12:19.860
But Doaa looked down and asked,
"What of Malek?"

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.975
And they told her the little baby
did not survive --

00:12:23.999 --> 00:12:27.386
she drew her last breath
in the boat's clinic.

00:12:28.203 --> 00:12:33.975
But Doaa was sure that as they had
been pulled up onto the rescue boat,

00:12:33.999 --> 00:12:37.246
that little baby girl had been smiling.

00:12:39.278 --> 00:12:45.280
Only 11 people survived
that wreck, of the 500.

00:12:46.304 --> 00:12:50.975
There was never an international
investigation into what happened.

00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:55.094
There were some media reports
about mass murder at sea,

00:12:55.118 --> 00:12:56.443
a terrible tragedy,

00:12:56.467 --> 00:12:58.934
but that was only for one day.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.314
And then the news cycle moved on.

00:13:04.536 --> 00:13:09.078
Meanwhile, in a pediatric
hospital on Crete,

00:13:09.102 --> 00:13:12.474
little Masa was on the edge of death.

00:13:13.681 --> 00:13:17.391
She was really dehydrated.
Her kidneys were failing.

00:13:17.415 --> 00:13:19.439
Her glucose levels were dangerously low.

00:13:19.463 --> 00:13:23.029
The doctors did everything
in their medical power to save them,

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:26.713
and the Greek nurses never left her side,

00:13:26.737 --> 00:13:28.864
holding her, hugging her,
singing her words.

00:13:28.888 --> 00:13:34.457
My colleagues also visited
and said pretty words to her in Arabic.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:38.677
Amazingly, little Masa survived.

00:13:40.192 --> 00:13:46.128
And soon the Greek press started reporting
about the miracle baby,

00:13:46.152 --> 00:13:51.819
who had survived four days in the water
without food or anything to drink,

00:13:51.843 --> 00:13:56.577
and offers to adopt her came
from all over the country.

00:13:57.466 --> 00:14:00.856
And meanwhile, Doaa
was in another hospital on Crete,

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.492
thin, dehydrated.

00:14:03.571 --> 00:14:09.116
An Egyptian family took her into their
home as soon as she was released.

00:14:10.248 --> 00:14:14.995
And soon word went around
about Doaa's survival,

00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:18.197
and a phone number
was published on Facebook.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.865
Messages started coming in.

00:14:22.999 --> 00:14:27.787
"Doaa, do you know
what happened to my brother?

00:14:27.811 --> 00:14:34.352
My sister? My parents? My friends?
Do you know if they survived?"

00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:38.975
One of those messages said,

00:14:38.999 --> 00:14:43.447
"I believe you saved
my little niece, Masa."

00:14:44.249 --> 00:14:46.741
And it had this photo.

00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:50.003
This was from Masa's uncle,

00:14:50.027 --> 00:14:54.749
a Syrian refugee who had made it
to Sweden with his family

00:14:54.773 --> 00:14:56.980
and also Masa's older sister.

00:14:57.647 --> 00:15:03.331
Soon, we hope, Masa will be reunited
with him in Sweden,

00:15:03.355 --> 00:15:08.879
and until then, she's being cared for
in a beautiful orphanage in Athens.

00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:16.003
And Doaa? Well, word went around
about her survival, too.

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:20.712
And the media wrote
about this slight woman,

00:15:20.736 --> 00:15:24.648
and couldn't imagine how
she could survive all this time

00:15:24.672 --> 00:15:27.666
under such conditions in that sea,

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.721
and still save another life.

00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:37.846
The Academy of Athens, one of Greece's
most prestigious institutions,

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.226
gave her an award of bravery,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.241
and she deserves all that praise,

00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:46.686
and she deserves a second chance.

00:15:47.999 --> 00:15:51.439
But she wants to still go to Sweden.

00:15:51.463 --> 00:15:53.693
She wants to reunite
with her family there.

00:15:53.717 --> 00:15:57.828
She wants to bring her mother
and her father and her younger siblings

00:15:57.852 --> 00:16:00.170
away from Egypt there as well,

00:16:00.194 --> 00:16:03.375
and I believe she will succeed.

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:06.121
She wants to become a lawyer
or a politician

00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:11.039
or something that can help
fight injustice.

00:16:11.063 --> 00:16:14.127
She is an extraordinary survivor.

00:16:15.215 --> 00:16:17.779
But I have to ask:

00:16:17.803 --> 00:16:20.075
what if she didn't have to take that risk?

00:16:20.099 --> 00:16:22.575
Why did she have to go through all that?

00:16:23.226 --> 00:16:28.290
Why wasn't there a legal way
for her to study in Europe?

00:16:28.314 --> 00:16:32.610
Why couldn't Masa have taken
an airplane to Sweden?

00:16:32.634 --> 00:16:35.006
Why couldn't Bassem have found work?

00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:41.547
Why is there no massive resettlement
program for Syrian refugees,

00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:45.191
the victims of the worst war of our times?

00:16:45.778 --> 00:16:51.283
The world did this for the Vietnamese
in the 1970s. Why not now?

00:16:52.624 --> 00:16:57.241
Why is there so little investment
in the neighboring countries

00:16:57.265 --> 00:16:59.931
hosting so many refugees?

00:17:01.113 --> 00:17:03.975
And why, the root question,

00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:10.395
is so little being done to stop
the wars, the persecution

00:17:10.419 --> 00:17:14.975
and the poverty that is driving
so many people

00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:16.851
to the shores of Europe?

00:17:17.999 --> 00:17:20.608
Until these issues are resolved,

00:17:20.632 --> 00:17:23.967
people will continue to take to the seas

00:17:23.991 --> 00:17:27.420
and to seek safety and asylum.

00:17:28.103 --> 00:17:29.761
And what happens next?

00:17:30.253 --> 00:17:33.084
Well, that is largely Europe's choice.

00:17:33.108 --> 00:17:36.139
And I understand the public fears.

00:17:37.005 --> 00:17:42.932
People are worried about their security,
their economies, the changes of culture.

00:17:43.893 --> 00:17:48.034
But is that more important
than saving human lives?

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:51.638
Because there is something
fundamental here

00:17:51.662 --> 00:17:54.466
that I think overrides the rest,

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:58.052
and it is about our common humanity.

00:17:58.719 --> 00:18:03.188
No person fleeing war or persecution

00:18:03.212 --> 00:18:08.373
should have to die
crossing a sea to reach safety.

00:18:08.397 --> 00:18:14.729
(Applause)

00:18:14.753 --> 00:18:15.920
One thing is for sure,

00:18:15.944 --> 00:18:19.127
that no refugee would be
on those dangerous boats

00:18:19.151 --> 00:18:21.499
if they could thrive where they are.

00:18:21.523 --> 00:18:24.801
And no migrant would take
that dangerous journey

00:18:24.825 --> 00:18:28.711
if they had enough food
for themselves and their children.

00:18:28.735 --> 00:18:31.354
And no one would put their life savings

00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:34.171
in the hands of those notorious smugglers

00:18:34.195 --> 00:18:36.622
if there was a legal way to migrate.

00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:41.066
So on behalf of little Masa

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.359
and on behalf of Doaa

00:18:43.383 --> 00:18:45.107
and of Bassem

00:18:45.131 --> 00:18:50.268
and of those 500 people
who drowned with them,

00:18:50.292 --> 00:18:53.435
can we make sure that they
did not die in vain?

00:18:54.308 --> 00:18:57.975
Could we be inspired by what happened,

00:18:57.999 --> 00:19:03.950
and take a stand for a world
in which every life matters?

00:19:04.999 --> 00:19:06.310
Thank you.

00:19:06.334 --> 00:19:12.928
(Applause)
