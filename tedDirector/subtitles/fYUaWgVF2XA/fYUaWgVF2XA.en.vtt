00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:14.161
As humans, it's in our nature

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:17.455
to want to improve our health 
and minimize our suffering.

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:19.122
Whatever life throws at us,

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:21.587
whether it's cancer, diabetes, heart disease,

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:24.779
or even broken bones, we want to try and get better.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.262
Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab,

00:00:27.262 --> 00:00:30.002
and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.470
have used materials in really creative ways

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.214
in the body over time.

00:00:35.214 --> 00:00:38.860
Take, for example, this beautiful blue nacre shell.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.742
This was actually used by the Mayans

00:00:40.742 --> 00:00:44.281
as an artificial tooth replacement.

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:45.914
We're not quite sure why they did it.

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:48.490
It's hard. It's durable.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.608
But it also had other very nice properties.

00:00:52.608 --> 00:00:54.888
In fact, when they put it into the jawbone,

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.795
it could integrate into the jaw,

00:00:57.795 --> 00:00:59.893
and we know now with very sophisticated

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.566
imaging technologies

00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.915
that part of that integration comes from the fact

00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:05.602
that this material is designed

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:08.421
in a very specific way, has a beautiful chemistry,

00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.649
has a beautiful architecture.

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.401
And I think in many ways we can sort of think

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:15.408
of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.928
as the first real application

00:01:16.928 --> 00:01:19.223
of the bluetooth technology.

00:01:19.223 --> 00:01:20.685
(Laughter)

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:25.078
But if we move on and think throughout history

00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:28.062
how people have used different 
materials in the body,

00:01:28.062 --> 00:01:29.776
very often it's been physicians

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:31.168
that have been quite creative.

00:01:31.168 --> 00:01:33.136
They've taken things off the shelf.

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:35.021
One of my favorite examples

00:01:35.036 --> 00:01:38.278
is that of Sir Harold Ridley,

00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:40.416
who was a famous ophthalmologist,

00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:42.984
or at least became a famous ophthalmologist.

00:01:42.984 --> 00:01:44.911
And during World War II, what he would see

00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:47.763
would be pilots coming back from their missions,

00:01:47.763 --> 00:01:49.515
and he noticed that within their eyes

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:52.455
they had shards of small bits of material

00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:53.975
lodged within the eye,

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:55.674
but the very interesting thing about it

00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:57.967
was that material, actually, wasn't causing

00:01:57.967 --> 00:01:59.980
any inflammatory response.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.319
So he looked into this, and he figured out

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.923
that actually that material was little shards of plastic

00:02:04.923 --> 00:02:07.662
that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires.

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:10.063
And this led him to propose that material

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.825
as a new material for intraocular lenses.

00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:14.930
It's called PMMA, and it's now used

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.732
in millions of people every year

00:02:16.732 --> 00:02:19.501
and helps in preventing cataracts.

00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:21.810
And that example, I think, is a really nice one,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.245
because it helps remind us that in the early days,

00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:26.198
people often chose materials

00:02:26.198 --> 00:02:28.083
because they were bioinert.

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:31.595
Their very purpose was to 
perform a mechanical function.

00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:33.045
You'd put them in the body

00:02:33.045 --> 00:02:35.209
and you wouldn't get an adverse response.

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.877
And what I want to show you is that

00:02:36.877 --> 00:02:38.258
in regenerative medicine,

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.082
we've really shifted away from that idea

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:41.995
of taking a bioinert material.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.284
We're actually actively looking for materials

00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:47.252
that will be bioactive, that will interact with the body,

00:02:47.252 --> 00:02:49.579
and that furthermore we can put in the body,

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.028
they'll have their function,

00:02:51.028 --> 00:02:55.578
and then they'll dissolve away over time.

00:02:55.578 --> 00:02:57.511
If we look at this schematic,

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.112
this is showing you what we think of

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:01.249
as the typical tissue-engineering approach.

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:04.093
We have cells there, typically from the patient.

00:03:04.093 --> 00:03:05.975
We can put those onto a material,

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:08.683
and we can make that material 
very complex if we want to,

00:03:08.708 --> 00:03:10.878
and we can then grow that up in the lab

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:13.393
or we can put it straight back into the patient.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.844
And this is an approach that's 
used all over the world,

00:03:15.844 --> 00:03:19.367
including in our lab.

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:21.824
But one of the things that's really important

00:03:21.824 --> 00:03:23.702
when we're thinking about stem cells

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:26.281
is that obviously stem cells 
can be many different things,

00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:28.045
and they want to be many different things,

00:03:28.045 --> 00:03:29.921
and so we want to make sure that the environment

00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:32.271
we put them into has enough information

00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:34.267
so that they can become the right sort

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:36.953
of specialist tissue.

00:03:36.953 --> 00:03:40.016
And if we think about the different types of tissues

00:03:40.016 --> 00:03:42.035
that people are looking at regenerating

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:44.346
all over the world, in all the 
different labs in the world,

00:03:44.346 --> 00:03:47.282
there's pretty much every tissue you can think of.

00:03:47.282 --> 00:03:48.904
And actually, the structure of those tissues

00:03:48.904 --> 00:03:51.518
is quite different, and it's going to really depend

00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:53.936
on whether your patient has any underlying disease,

00:03:53.936 --> 00:03:56.986
other conditions, in terms of how

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:58.547
you're going to regenerate your tissue,

00:03:58.547 --> 00:04:00.532
and you're going to need to think about the materials

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.586
you're going to use really carefully,

00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:04.311
their biochemistry, their mechanics,

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:08.049
and many other properties as well.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.349
Our tissues all have very 
different abilities to regenerate,

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.091
and here we see poor Prometheus,

00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.184
who made a rather tricky career choice

00:04:16.184 --> 00:04:19.118
and was punished by the Greek gods.

00:04:19.118 --> 00:04:21.439
He was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:23.042
every day to eat his liver.

00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:25.309
But of course his liver would regenerate every day,

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:27.581
and so day after day he was punished

00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:33.378
for eternity by the gods.

00:04:33.378 --> 00:04:37.258
And liver will regenerate in this very nice way,

00:04:37.258 --> 00:04:39.034
but actually if we think of other tissues,

00:04:39.034 --> 00:04:40.803
like cartilage, for example,

00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:42.859
even the simplest nick and you're going to find it

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:45.302
really difficult to regenerate your cartilage.

00:04:45.302 --> 00:04:48.416
So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue.

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:51.216
Now, bone is somewhere in between,

00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:54.116
and this is one of the tissues 
that we work on a lot in our lab.

00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:56.100
And bone is actually quite good at repairing.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.113
It has to be. We've probably all had fractures

00:04:58.113 --> 00:04:59.925
at some point or other.

00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:02.082
And one of the ways that you can think

00:05:02.082 --> 00:05:03.771
about repairing your fracture

00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:06.598
is this procedure here, called 
an iliac crest harvest.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.264
And what the surgeon might do

00:05:08.264 --> 00:05:11.459
is take some bone from your iliac crest,

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:12.837
which is just here,

00:05:12.837 --> 00:05:15.361
and then transplant that 
somewhere else in the body.

00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:16.961
And it actually works really well,

00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:18.460
because it's your own bone,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.694
and it's well vascularized,

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:22.063
which means it's got a really good blood supply.

00:05:22.063 --> 00:05:24.846
But the problem is, there's
only so much you can take,

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:27.769
and also when you do that operation,

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:30.308
your patients might actually have significant pain

00:05:30.308 --> 00:05:33.549
in that defect site even two 
years after the operation.

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:35.435
So what we were thinking is,

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:38.584
there's a tremendous need 
for bone repair, of course,

00:05:38.584 --> 00:05:41.071
but this iliac crest-type approach

00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:43.503
really has a lot of limitations to it,

00:05:43.503 --> 00:05:45.737
and could we perhaps recreate

00:05:45.737 --> 00:05:47.906
the generation of bone within the body

00:05:47.906 --> 00:05:51.221
on demand and then be able to transplant it

00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:56.126
without these very, very painful aftereffects

00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:59.809
that you would have with the iliac crest harvest?

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:02.471
And so this is what we did, and the way we did it

00:06:02.471 --> 00:06:05.809
was by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:08.196
but actually thinking about it rather differently.

00:06:08.196 --> 00:06:10.115
And we simplified it a lot,

00:06:10.115 --> 00:06:12.166
so we got rid of a lot of these steps.

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:14.540
We got rid of the need to 
harvest cells from the patient,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.457
we got rid of the need to put 
in really fancy chemistries,

00:06:17.457 --> 00:06:19.149
and we got rid of the need

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.977
to culture these scaffolds in the lab.

00:06:21.977 --> 00:06:24.156
And what we really focused on

00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:27.905
was our material system and making it quite simple,

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:30.230
but because we used it in a really clever way,

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.877
we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone

00:06:32.877 --> 00:06:34.523
using this approach.

00:06:34.523 --> 00:06:36.276
So we were using the body

00:06:36.276 --> 00:06:38.396
as really the catalyst to help us

00:06:38.396 --> 00:06:40.939
to make lots of new bone.

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:42.522
And it's an approach that we call

00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:45.333
the in vivo bioreactor, and we were able to make

00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:47.819
enormous amounts of bone using this approach.

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:49.058
And I'll talk you through this.

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:51.538
So what we do is,

00:06:51.538 --> 00:06:53.881
in humans, we all have a layer of stem cells

00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:55.769
on the outside of our long bones.

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:57.472
That layer is called the periosteum.

00:06:57.472 --> 00:06:59.760
And that layer is actually normally

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.409
very, very tightly bound to the underlying bone,

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:03.841
and it's got stem cells in it.

00:07:03.841 --> 00:07:05.260
Those stem cells are really important

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.069
in the embryo when it develops,

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:09.311
and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture

00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:12.172
to help you with repairing the bone.

00:07:12.172 --> 00:07:14.265
So we take that periosteum layer

00:07:14.265 --> 00:07:17.255
and we developed a way to inject underneath it

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:20.071
a liquid that then, within 30 seconds,

00:07:20.071 --> 00:07:21.816
would turn into quite a rigid gel

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:25.069
and can actually lift the
periosteum away from the bone.

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:28.757
So it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity

00:07:28.757 --> 00:07:32.304
that is right next to both the bone

00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:36.005
but also this really rich layer of stem cells.

00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:37.617
And we go in through a pinhole incision

00:07:37.617 --> 00:07:40.570
so that no other cells from the body can get in,

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.362
and what happens is that that
artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity

00:07:45.362 --> 00:07:48.038
can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells,

00:07:48.038 --> 00:07:50.124
and they can form lots of new tissue,

00:07:50.124 --> 00:07:52.442
and then over time, you can harvest that tissue

00:07:52.442 --> 00:07:55.390
and use it elsewhere in the body.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.534
This is a histology slide

00:07:57.534 --> 00:07:59.704
of what we see when we do that,

00:07:59.704 --> 00:08:02.221
and essentially what we see

00:08:02.221 --> 00:08:03.855
is very large amounts of bone.

00:08:03.855 --> 00:08:06.335
So in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg,

00:08:06.335 --> 00:08:07.836
so the bone marrow,

00:08:07.836 --> 00:08:09.640
then you can see the original bone,

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.496
and you can see where that original bone finishes,

00:08:12.496 --> 00:08:15.007
and just to the left of that is the new bone

00:08:15.007 --> 00:08:17.044
that's grown within that bioreactor cavity,

00:08:17.044 --> 00:08:19.475
and you can actually make it even larger.

00:08:19.475 --> 00:08:22.102
And that demarcation that you can see

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:24.453
between the original bone and the new bone

00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:26.466
acts as a very slight point of weakness,

00:08:26.466 --> 00:08:28.600
so actually now the surgeon can come along,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.624
can harvest away that new bone,

00:08:30.624 --> 00:08:32.827
and the periosteum can grow back,

00:08:32.827 --> 00:08:34.696
so you're left with the leg

00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:36.246
in the same sort of state

00:08:36.246 --> 00:08:38.248
as if you hadn't operated on it in the first place.

00:08:38.248 --> 00:08:42.097
So it's very, very low in terms of after-pain

00:08:42.097 --> 00:08:45.952
compared to an iliac crest harvest.

00:08:45.952 --> 00:08:48.056
And you can grow different amounts of bone

00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:50.075
depending on how much gel you put in there,

00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:53.277
so it really is an on demand sort of procedure.

00:08:53.277 --> 00:08:55.479
Now, at the time that we did this,

00:08:55.479 --> 00:08:58.816
this received a lot of attention in the press,

00:08:58.816 --> 00:09:01.247
because it was a really nice way

00:09:01.247 --> 00:09:02.713
of generating new bone,

00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:04.708
and we got many, many contacts

00:09:04.708 --> 00:09:07.326
from different people that 
were interested in using this.

00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:09.115
And I'm just going to tell you,

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:12.068
sometimes those contacts are very strange,

00:09:12.068 --> 00:09:13.928
slightly unexpected,

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.990
and the very most interesting,

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.275
let me put it that way, contact that I had,

00:09:19.275 --> 00:09:22.486
was actually from a team of American footballers

00:09:22.486 --> 00:09:25.866
that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:30.147
made on their head.

00:09:30.156 --> 00:09:32.880
And so you do get these kinds of contacts,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.497
and of course, being British

00:09:35.497 --> 00:09:37.251
and also growing up in France,

00:09:37.251 --> 00:09:39.393
I tend to be very blunt,

00:09:39.393 --> 00:09:41.434
and so I had to explain to them very nicely

00:09:41.434 --> 00:09:42.909
that in their particular case,

00:09:42.909 --> 00:09:44.923
there probably wasn't that much in there

00:09:44.923 --> 00:09:47.911
to protect in the first place.

00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:49.481
(Laughter)

00:09:49.481 --> 00:09:50.734
(Applause)

00:09:50.734 --> 00:09:52.589
So this was our approach,

00:09:52.589 --> 00:09:54.233
and it was simple materials,

00:09:54.233 --> 00:09:56.220
but we thought about it carefully.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.840
And actually we know that those cells

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.978
in the body, in the embryo, as they develop

00:09:59.978 --> 00:10:03.207
can form a different kind of tissue, cartilage,

00:10:03.207 --> 00:10:05.762
and so we developed a gel that was slightly different

00:10:05.762 --> 00:10:08.181
in nature and slightly different chemistry,

00:10:08.181 --> 00:10:10.328
put it in there, and we were able to get

00:10:10.328 --> 00:10:12.506
100 percent cartilage instead.

00:10:12.506 --> 00:10:14.514
And this approach works really well, I think,

00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:16.996
for pre-planned procedures,

00:10:16.996 --> 00:10:19.868
but it's something you do have to pre-plan.

00:10:19.868 --> 00:10:22.136
So for other kinds of operations,

00:10:22.136 --> 00:10:23.833
there's definitely a need for other

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:26.336
scaffold-based approaches.

00:10:26.336 --> 00:10:28.705
And when you think about designing

00:10:28.705 --> 00:10:30.343
those other scaffolds, actually,

00:10:30.343 --> 00:10:32.314
you need a really multi-disciplinary team.

00:10:32.314 --> 00:10:34.379
And so our team has chemists,

00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:37.756
it has cell biologists, surgeons, physicists even,

00:10:37.756 --> 00:10:39.786
and those people all come together

00:10:39.786 --> 00:10:42.197
and we think really hard about 
designing the materials.

00:10:42.197 --> 00:10:45.163
But we want to make them have enough information

00:10:45.163 --> 00:10:47.317
that we can get the cells to do what we want,

00:10:47.317 --> 00:10:49.694
but not be so complex as to make it difficult

00:10:49.694 --> 00:10:51.437
to get to clinic.

00:10:51.437 --> 00:10:54.188
And so one of the things we think about a lot

00:10:54.188 --> 00:10:55.983
is really trying to understand

00:10:55.983 --> 00:10:58.360
the structure of the tissues in the body.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.020
And so if we think of bone,

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.644
obviously my own favorite tissue,

00:11:02.644 --> 00:11:04.201
we zoom in, we can see,

00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:06.083
even if you don't know anything 
about bone structure,

00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:08.628
it's beautifully organized, 
really beautifully organized.

00:11:08.628 --> 00:11:10.515
We've lots of blood vessels in there.

00:11:10.515 --> 00:11:12.854
And if we zoom in again, we see that the cells

00:11:12.854 --> 00:11:15.826
are actually surrounded by a 3D matrix

00:11:15.826 --> 00:11:17.997
of nano-scale fibers, and they give a lot

00:11:17.997 --> 00:11:20.179
of information to the cells.

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:21.793
And if we zoom in again,

00:11:21.793 --> 00:11:23.994
actually in the case of bone, the matrix

00:11:23.994 --> 00:11:26.145
around the cells is beautifully organized

00:11:26.145 --> 00:11:28.612
at the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material

00:11:28.612 --> 00:11:31.196
that's part organic, part inorganic.

00:11:31.196 --> 00:11:33.268
And that's led to a whole field, really,

00:11:33.268 --> 00:11:35.659
that has looked at developing materials

00:11:35.659 --> 00:11:38.407
that have this hybrid kind of structure.

00:11:38.407 --> 00:11:41.685
And so I'm showing here just two examples

00:11:41.685 --> 00:11:44.805
where we've made some materials
that have that sort of structure,

00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:46.243
and you can really tailor it.

00:11:46.243 --> 00:11:48.307
You can see here a very squishy one

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:52.406
and now a material that's also 
this hybrid sort of material

00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:54.353
but actually has remarkable toughness,

00:11:54.369 --> 00:11:55.829
and it's no longer brittle.

00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:58.285
And an inorganic material 
would normally be really brittle,

00:11:58.285 --> 00:11:59.725
and you wouldn't be able to have

00:11:59.725 --> 00:12:01.913
that sort of strength and toughness in it.

00:12:01.913 --> 00:12:04.402
One other thing I want to quickly mention is that

00:12:04.402 --> 00:12:07.117
many of the scaffolds we make 
are porous, and they have to be,

00:12:07.117 --> 00:12:09.220
because you want blood vessels to grow in there.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.097
But the pores are actually oftentimes

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:12.390
much bigger than the cells,

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.101
and so even though it's 3D,

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:17.456
the cell might see it more 
as a slightly curved surface,

00:12:17.456 --> 00:12:19.132
and that's a little bit unnatural.

00:12:19.132 --> 00:12:21.380
And so one of the things you can think about doing

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.528
is actually making scaffolds 
with slightly different dimensions

00:12:24.528 --> 00:12:27.321
that might be able to surround your cells in 3D

00:12:27.321 --> 00:12:29.890
and give them a little bit more information.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.457
And there's a lot of work going 
on in both of these areas.

00:12:33.471 --> 00:12:37.440
Now finally, I just want to talk a little bit about

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.148
applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease,

00:12:40.148 --> 00:12:43.411
because this is a really big clinical problem.

00:12:43.411 --> 00:12:46.996
And one of the things that we know is that,

00:12:46.996 --> 00:12:49.235
unfortunately, if you have a heart attack,

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:52.137
then that tissue can start to die,

00:12:52.137 --> 00:12:55.888
and your outcome may not be very good over time.

00:12:55.888 --> 00:12:57.598
And it would be really great, actually,

00:12:57.598 --> 00:12:59.517
if we could stop that dead tissue

00:12:59.517 --> 00:13:03.502
either from dying or help it to regenerate.

00:13:03.502 --> 00:13:06.750
And there's lots and lots of stem 
cell trials going on worldwide,

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.822
and they use many different types of cells,

00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:11.174
but one common theme that seems to be coming out

00:13:11.174 --> 00:13:14.173
is that actually, very often, those cells will die

00:13:14.173 --> 00:13:15.968
once you've implanted them.

00:13:15.968 --> 00:13:17.843
And you can either put them into the heart

00:13:17.843 --> 00:13:19.863
or into the blood system,

00:13:19.863 --> 00:13:22.225
but either way, we don't seem to be able

00:13:22.225 --> 00:13:24.092
to get quite the right number of cells

00:13:24.092 --> 00:13:26.334
getting to the location we want them to

00:13:26.334 --> 00:13:30.828
and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful

00:13:30.828 --> 00:13:33.568
cell regeneration that we would like to have

00:13:33.568 --> 00:13:36.985
to get good clinical outcomes.

00:13:36.985 --> 00:13:38.968
And so some of the things that we're thinking of,

00:13:38.968 --> 00:13:42.089
and many other people in the field are thinking of,

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:45.095
are actually developing materials for that.

00:13:45.095 --> 00:13:46.714
But there's a difference here.

00:13:46.714 --> 00:13:48.924
We still need chemistry, we still need mechanics,

00:13:48.924 --> 00:13:51.595
we still need really interesting topography,

00:13:51.595 --> 00:13:54.243
and we still need really interesting 
ways to surround the cells.

00:13:54.243 --> 00:13:56.754
But now, the cells also

00:13:56.754 --> 00:13:58.779
would probably quite like a material

00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:00.797
that's going to be able to be conductive,

00:14:00.797 --> 00:14:05.006
because the cells themselves will respond very well

00:14:05.006 --> 00:14:08.485
and will actually conduct signals 
between themselves.

00:14:08.485 --> 00:14:10.001
You can see them now

00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:12.476
beating synchronously on these materials,

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:15.255
and that's a very, very exciting development

00:14:15.255 --> 00:14:17.369
that's going on.

00:14:17.369 --> 00:14:22.193
So just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that

00:14:22.193 --> 00:14:24.549
being able to work in this sort of field,

00:14:24.549 --> 00:14:26.203
all of us that work in this field

00:14:26.203 --> 00:14:28.712
that's not only super-exciting science,

00:14:28.712 --> 00:14:30.758
but also has the potential

00:14:30.758 --> 00:14:32.726
to impact on patients,

00:14:32.726 --> 00:14:35.156
however big or small they are,

00:14:35.156 --> 00:14:36.709
is really a great privilege.

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.853
And so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well.

00:14:39.853 --> 00:14:41.170
Thank you.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:46.094
(Applause)
