00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I want to ask you all to consider for a second

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
the very simple fact

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
that, by far,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
most of what we know about the universe

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
comes to us from light.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and see stars with our bare eyes.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
We see light reflected off the Moon.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.260
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
at the celestial bodies,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
the known universe has come to us through light,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
across vast eras in cosmic history.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And with all of our modern telescopes,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
we've been able to collect

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
this stunning silent movie of the universe --

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
these series of snapshots

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
that go all the way back to the Big Bang.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
because the universe isn't silent.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
I'd like to convince you

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
that the universe has a soundtrack

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and that soundtrack is played on space itself,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
because space can wobble like a drum.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
It can ring out a kind of recording

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
throughout the universe

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Now we'd like to be able to add

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
to a kind of glorious visual composition

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
that we have of the universe --

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
a sonic composition.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And while we've never heard the sounds from space,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
we really should, in the next few years,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
So in this ambition

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
to capture songs from the universe,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
we turn our focus

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
to black holes and the promise they have,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
because black holes can bang on space-time

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
like mallets on a drum

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
and have a very characteristic song,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
for what that song will be like.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
We can't see them directly.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
They're not brought to us with light, at least not directly.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
We can see them indirectly,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
because black holes wreak havoc on their environment.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
They destroy stars around them.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
They churn up debris in their surroundings.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
But they won't come to us directly through light.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
We might one day see a shadow

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
a black hole can cast on a very bright background,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
but we haven't yet.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And yet black holes may be heard

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
even if they're not seen,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.260
and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Einstein realized that if space were empty,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
if the universe were empty,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
it would be like this picture,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
But if we were freely falling through the space,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
even without this helpful grid,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
we might be able to paint it ourselves,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
undeflected straight paths

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
through the universe.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Einstein also realized --

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
and this is the real meat of the matter --

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
that if you put energy or mass in the universe,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
it would curve space,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and a freely falling object

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
would pass by, let's say, the Sun

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and it would be deflected

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
along the natural curves in the space.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Now even light will be bent by those paths.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And you can be bent so much

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
that you're caught in orbit around the Sun,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
These are the natural curves in space.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
What Einstein did not realize

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
was that, if you took our Sun

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and you crushed it down to six kilometers --

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
so you took a million times the mass of the Earth

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
and you crushed it to six kilometers across,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
you would make a black hole,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
an object so dense

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
that if light veered too close, it would never escape --

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
a dark shadow against the universe.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
It wasn't Einstein who realized this,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
it was Karl Schwarzschild

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
who was a German Jew in World War I --

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
joined the German army already an accomplished scientist,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
working on the Russian front.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.260
calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and then, in between,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
calculating Einstein's equations --

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
as you do in the trenches.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And he was reading Einstein's recently published

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
general theory of relativity,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
and he was thrilled by this theory.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And he quickly surmised

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
an exact mathematical solution

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
that described something very extraordinary:

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
curves so strong

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
that space would rain down into them,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
space itself would curve like a waterfall

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
flowing down the throat of a hole.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And even light could not escape this current.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Light would be dragged down the hole

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
as everything else would be,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and all that would be left would be a shadow.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Now he wrote to Einstein,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and he said, "As you will see,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
the war has been kind to me enough.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Despite the heavy gunfire,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
I've been able to get away from it all

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and walk through the land of your ideas."

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
And he took Schwarzschild's idea

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
He did not believe they existed in nature.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
He thought nature would protect us from their formation.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
It was decades

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
before the term "black hole" was coined

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and people realized

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
that black holes are real astrophysical objects --

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
in fact they're the death state

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
of very massive stars

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
that collapse catastrophically

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
at the end of their lifetime.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
It's actually not massive enough.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
But if we did a little thought experiment --

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
as Einstein was very fond of doing --

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
we could imagine

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
maybe 30 kilometers

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
outside of the black-hole sun.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
And it would be self-illuminated,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light --

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
even 30 km

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
outside of this crushed black hole.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
This crushed black hole

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
before it destroyed the Earth.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
But basically that's what we're talking about.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
We're talking about an object that you could crush down

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
to half the square area of Manhattan.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
So we move this Earth very close --

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
30 kilometers outside --

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
There's a sort of myth

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
that black holes devour everything in the universe,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
but you actually have to get very close to fall in.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
we can always see the Earth.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
It cannot hide behind the black hole.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
The light from the Earth, some of it falls in,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
If this were Battlestar Galactica

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
and you're fighting the Cylons,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
don't hide behind the black hole.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
They can see you.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole --

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
it's not massive enough --

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.260
but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
this is what it would look like.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
We would see a shadow of that black hole

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
against the hundred billion stars

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
And if we were to fall towards this black hole,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
we would see all of that light lensed around it,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and we could even start to cross into that shadow

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
because we couldn't,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
anymore than light can escape.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
it's not dark on the inside,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.260
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
our clocks would seem to slow down

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
relative to galactic time,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
had been sped up and shot at us,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
It would be like a near-death experience

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
where you see the light at the end of the tunnel,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
but it's a total death experience.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
(Laughter)

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And there's no way of telling anybody

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
about the light at the end of the tunnel.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
but black holes can be heard,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
even if they're not seen.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.260
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation --

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Maybe they started as stars

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and collapsed to two black holes --

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
They can be spinning

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
hundreds of times a second.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
At the end of their lives,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
they're going around each other very near the speed of light.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
So they're crossing thousands of kilometers

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
in a fraction of a second,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and as they do so, they not only curve space,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
but they leave behind in their wake

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
a ringing of space,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
an actual wave on space-time.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
Space squeezes and stretches

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
as it emanates out from these black holes

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
banging on the universe.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And they travel out into the cosmos

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
at the speed of light.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
This computer simulation

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
This was one of the groups.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
again, with these helpfully painted curves.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint --

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
but if you can see the red waves emanating out,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
those are the gravitational waves.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
They're literally the sounds of space ringing,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
as they ring down and coalesce

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
to one spinning, quiet black hole

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
at the end of the day.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
If you were standing near enough,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
your ear would resonate

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
with the squeezing and stretching of space.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
You would literally hear the sound.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.260
Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
But I'd like to play for you

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
the sound that we predict.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
This is from my group --

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Imagine a lighter black hole

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
falling into a very heavy black hole.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
The sound you're hearing

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
is the light black hole banging on space

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
each time it gets close.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
But it comes in like a mallet,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
and it literally cracks space,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
wobbling it like a drum.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
And we can predict what the sound will be.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
We know that, as it falls in,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
it gets faster and it gets louder.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And eventually,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:24.260
(Thumping)

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
Then it's gone.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.260
This is another sound from my group.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
No, I'm not showing you any images,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
because black holes don't leave behind

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
helpful trails of ink,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and space is not painted,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
showing you the curves.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
and you heard this,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
you want to get moving.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
(Laughter)

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Want to get away from the sound.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Both black holes are moving.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
Both black holes are getting closer together.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And then they're going to merge.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:14.260
(Thumping)

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Now it's gone.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging --

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
that it chirps up at the end.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
Now that's our prediction

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
for what we'll see.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And surely, somewhere in the universe

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
two black holes have merged.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
And surely, the space around us

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
is ringing

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
at the speed of light to get to us.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth --

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
one called LIGO --

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
which will detect deviations

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
in the squeezing and stretching of space

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
over four kilometers.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
within the next few years -- to pick this up.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
There's also a mission proposed for space,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
which hopefully will launch in the next ten years,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
called LISA.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes --

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
black holes millions or billions of times

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
the mass of the Sun.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
They look like they're frozen in some embrace.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
And each one probably harbors

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
a super-massive black hole at its core.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
But they're not frozen;

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
they're actually merging.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
These two black holes are colliding,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
It's beyond our human perception

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
to pick up a song of that duration.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
But LISA could see the final stages

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
of two super-massive black holes

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
earlier in the universe's history,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
the last 15 minutes before they fall together.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
And it's not just black holes,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
but it's also any big disturbance in the universe --

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
When that expression was coined, it was derisive --

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
But now it actually might be more technically accurate

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
because it might bang.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
It might make a sound.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
It's everywhere, it's all around you,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
and the space is wobbling chaotically.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
Fourteen billion years pass

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
and this song is still ringing all around us.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
Galaxies form,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
and generations of stars form in those galaxies,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
and around one star,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
at least one star,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
is a habitable planet.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
And here we are frantically building these experiments,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
Imagine a billion years ago,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
two black holes collided.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
That song has been ringing through space

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
for all that time.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
We weren't even here.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
It gets closer and closer --

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
It's like hurry, build your instruments.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
whatever year it will be

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity --

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
we'll build them, we'll turn on the machines

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
and, bang, we'll catch it -- the first song from space.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
it would sound like this.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
(Static) It's a terrible sound.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
It's literally the definition of noise.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
But it's around us everywhere, presumably,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
if it hasn't been wiped out

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
by some other process in the universe.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
because it will be the quiet echo

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
of that moment of our creation,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
of our observable universe.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
So within the next few years,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
render the universe in audio.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
But if we detect those earliest moments,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
it'll bring us that much closer

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
to an understanding of the Big Bang,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
which brings us that much closer

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
If we run the movie of our universe backwards,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
we know that there was a Big Bang in our past,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.260
and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
Will it happen again?

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
to reignite wonder,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
we can ask questions, at least for this last minute,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
that honestly might evade us forever.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
But we have to ask:

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
Is it possible that our universe

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
is just a plume off of some greater history?

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:45.260
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse --

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.260
each branch with its own Big Bang in its past --

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
maybe some of them with black holes playing drums,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
maybe some without --

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without --

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
not in our past, not in our future,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
but somehow fundamentally connected to us?

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
in some other patch of that multiverse,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
are there creatures?

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
Here's my multiverse creatures.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
Are there other creatures in the multiverse,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
wondering about us

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
and wondering about their own origins?

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
And if they are,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
I can imagine them as we are,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
calculating, writing computer code,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
building instruments,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
trying to detect that faintest sound

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
of their origins

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
and wondering who else is out there.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
