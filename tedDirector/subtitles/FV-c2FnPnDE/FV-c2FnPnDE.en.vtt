00:00:12.581 --> 00:00:16.289
I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart,

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.354
and so just before I get going,

00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:21.925
I wanted to tell you as a South African

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:24.909
that one of the men who has inspired me most

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.975
passed away a few hours ago.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:30.665
Nelson Mandela has come to the end

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.345
of his long walk to freedom.

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:38.280
And so this talk is going to be for him.

00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:43.354
I grew up in wonder.

00:00:43.354 --> 00:00:47.469
I grew up amongst those animals.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.860
I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.758
at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve.

00:00:54.758 --> 00:00:57.530
It's a place where my family has been

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.725
in the safari business for four generations.

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:03.962
Now for as long as I can remember,

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:08.699
my job has been to take people out into nature,

00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:11.610
and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.430
to have the opportunity

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.311
to bring some of my experiences out in nature

00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:18.451
in to this gathering.

00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:20.330
Africa is a place

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.714
where people still sit under starlit skies

00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:27.124
and around campfires and tell stories,

00:01:27.124 --> 00:01:29.815
and so what I have to share with you today

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:34.234
is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories,

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:37.372
stories about heroes of heart.

00:01:37.372 --> 00:01:39.492
Now my stories are not the stories

00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:41.190
that you'll hear on the news,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.163
and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place,

00:01:44.163 --> 00:01:46.100
I also know it to be a place

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.366
where people, animals and ecosystems

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:54.753
teach us about a more interconnected world.

00:01:54.753 --> 00:01:56.731
When I was nine years old,

00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:59.965
President Mandela came to stay with my family.

00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:03.389
He had just been released from
his 27 years of incarceration,

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.016
and was in a period of readjustment

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:08.675
to his sudden global icon status.

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:11.175
Members of the African National Congress

00:02:11.175 --> 00:02:13.166
thought that in the bush

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.400
he would have time to rest and recuperate

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.161
away from the public eye,

00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:20.540
and it's true that lions tend to be

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.771
a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.

00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:26.900
(Laughter)

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.446
But it was a defining time for me as a young boy.

00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:31.507
I would take him breakfast in bed,

00:02:31.507 --> 00:02:33.875
and then, in an old track suit and slippers,

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:36.480
he would go for a walk around the garden.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.158
At night, I would sit with my family

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.659
around the snowy, bunny-eared TV,

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.077
and watch images of that same

00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:45.011
quiet man from the garden

00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:48.061
surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people

00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:51.320
as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.272
He was bringing peace

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:56.154
to a divided and violent South Africa,

00:02:56.154 --> 00:03:01.383
one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.

00:03:01.383 --> 00:03:04.147
Mandela said often that the gift of prison

00:03:04.147 --> 00:03:07.107
was the ability to go within and to think,

00:03:07.107 --> 00:03:08.836
to create in himself

00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:11.715
the things he most wanted for South Africa:

00:03:11.715 --> 00:03:15.060
peace, reconciliation, harmony.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.915
Through this act of immense open-heartedness,

00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:20.147
he was to become the embodiment

00:03:20.147 --> 00:03:23.686
of what in South Africa we call "ubuntu."

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:26.535
Ubuntu: I am because of you.

00:03:26.535 --> 00:03:29.198
Or, people are not people

00:03:29.198 --> 00:03:31.923
without other people.

00:03:31.923 --> 00:03:33.769
It's not a new idea or value

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.624
but it's one that I certainly think at these times

00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:37.373
is worth building on.

00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:40.537
In fact, it is said that in the
collective consciousness of Africa,

00:03:40.537 --> 00:03:42.576
we get to experience the deepest parts

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:43.881
of our own humanity

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:46.665
through our interactions with others.

00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:48.777
Ubuntu is at play right now.

00:03:48.777 --> 00:03:50.777
You are holding a space for me

00:03:50.777 --> 00:03:54.169
to express the deepest truth of who I am.

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.429
Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room,

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:59.507
and I spent a lot of time last week doing that,

00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:02.830
and it's not the same as this.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.256
(Laughter)

00:04:05.256 --> 00:04:08.704
If Mandela was the national
and international embodiment,

00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:10.298
then the man who taught me the most

00:04:10.298 --> 00:04:12.901
about this value personally was this man,

00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:14.259
Solly Mhlongo.

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.067
Solly was born under a tree

00:04:16.067 --> 00:04:18.853
60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.

00:04:18.853 --> 00:04:20.353
He would never have a lot of money,

00:04:20.353 --> 00:04:21.775
but he was to be

00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:24.404
one of the richest men I would ever meet.

00:04:24.404 --> 00:04:27.123
Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle.

00:04:27.123 --> 00:04:31.305
Now, I can tell you, I don't know what it is
about people who grow up looking after cattle,

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:34.327
but it makes for Ã¼ber-resourcefulness.

00:04:34.327 --> 00:04:36.801
The first job that he ever got in the safari business

00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:39.017
was fixing the safari trucks.

00:04:39.017 --> 00:04:41.671
Where he had learned to do that out in the bush

00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:43.800
I have no idea, but he could do it.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.727
He then moved across into what we called

00:04:45.727 --> 00:04:47.114
the habitat team.

00:04:47.114 --> 00:04:49.000
These were the people on the reserve

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.357
who were responsible for its well-being.

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.641
He fixed roads, he mended wetlands,

00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:55.459
he did some anti-poaching.

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:57.585
And then one day we were out together,

00:04:57.585 --> 00:05:01.116
and he came across the tracks of where
a female leopard had walked.

00:05:01.116 --> 00:05:02.890
And it was an old track,

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.331
but for fun he turned and he began to follow it,

00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:06.906
and I tell you, I could tell by the speed

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:08.603
at which he moved on those pad marks

00:05:08.603 --> 00:05:12.577
that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.

00:05:12.577 --> 00:05:14.351
If you drove past Solly

00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:16.029
somewhere out on the reserve,

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:17.678
you look up in your rearview mirror,

00:05:17.678 --> 00:05:19.523
you'd see he'd stopped the car

00:05:19.523 --> 00:05:21.569
20, 50 meters down the road

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.582
just in case you need help with something.

00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:27.335
The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him

00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:28.730
was when one of our clients said,

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.947
"Solly, you are pathologically helpful."

00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:34.394
(Laughter)

00:05:34.394 --> 00:05:37.285
When I started professionally guiding people

00:05:37.285 --> 00:05:38.942
out into this environment,

00:05:38.942 --> 00:05:40.502
Solly was my tracker.

00:05:40.502 --> 00:05:42.321
We worked together as a team.

00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:44.347
And the first guests we ever got

00:05:44.347 --> 00:05:47.194
were a philanthropy group from your East Coast,

00:05:47.194 --> 00:05:49.548
and they said to Solly, on the side, they said,

00:05:49.548 --> 00:05:52.189
"Before we even go out to see lions and leopards,

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:54.251
we want to see where you live."

00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:55.716
So we took them up to his house,

00:05:55.716 --> 00:05:58.588
and this visit of the philanthropist to his house

00:05:58.588 --> 00:06:01.269
coincided with a time when Solly's wife,

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:02.869
who was learning English,

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:05.053
was going through a phase
where she would open the door

00:06:05.053 --> 00:06:07.717
by saying, "Hello, I love you.

00:06:07.717 --> 00:06:09.932
Welcome, I love you." (Laughter)

00:06:09.932 --> 00:06:12.481
And there was something so beautifully African

00:06:12.481 --> 00:06:14.326
about it to me, this small house

00:06:14.326 --> 00:06:16.911
with a huge heart in it.

00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:23.486
Now on the day that Solly saved my life,

00:06:23.486 --> 00:06:25.497
he was already my hero.

00:06:25.497 --> 00:06:27.078
It was a hot day,

00:06:27.078 --> 00:06:29.052
and we found ourselves down by the river.

00:06:29.052 --> 00:06:31.888
Because of the heat, I took my shoes off,

00:06:31.888 --> 00:06:33.591
and I rolled up my pants,

00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:35.832
and I walked into the water.

00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:37.394
Solly remained on the bank.

00:06:37.394 --> 00:06:40.417
The water was clear running over sand,

00:06:40.417 --> 00:06:43.731
and we turned and we began
to make our way upstream.

00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:45.551
And a few meters ahead of us,

00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:48.536
there was a place where a tree
had fallen out of the bank,

00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:51.307
and its branches were touching the water,

00:06:51.307 --> 00:06:52.904
and it was shadowy.

00:06:52.904 --> 00:06:55.362
And if had been a horror movie,

00:06:55.362 --> 00:06:57.598
people in the audience would have started saying,

00:06:57.598 --> 00:07:01.051
"Don't go in there. Don't go in there." (Laughter)

00:07:01.051 --> 00:07:04.808
And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.

00:07:04.808 --> 00:07:06.923
Now the first thing that you notice
when a crocodile hits you

00:07:06.923 --> 00:07:08.523
is the ferocity of the bite.

00:07:08.523 --> 00:07:10.496
Wham! It hits me by my right leg.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:14.399
It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up.
I'm able to grab a branch.

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.137
It's shaking me violently.

00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:17.851
It's a very strange sensation

00:07:17.851 --> 00:07:19.797
having another creature try and eat you,

00:07:19.797 --> 00:07:23.248
and there are few things that
promote vegetarianism like that.

00:07:23.248 --> 00:07:24.843
(Laughter)

00:07:24.843 --> 00:07:27.128
Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.

00:07:27.128 --> 00:07:29.175
He turns. He begins to make his way to me.

00:07:29.175 --> 00:07:31.126
The croc again continues to shake me.

00:07:31.126 --> 00:07:33.043
It goes to bite me a second time.

00:07:33.043 --> 00:07:35.232
I notice a slick of blood in the water around me

00:07:35.232 --> 00:07:36.836
that gets washed downstream.

00:07:36.836 --> 00:07:39.009
As it bites the second time, I kick.

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:41.742
My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.

00:07:41.742 --> 00:07:43.873
I pull myself up into the branches,

00:07:43.873 --> 00:07:47.356
and as I come out of the water,
I look over my shoulder.

00:07:47.356 --> 00:07:49.276
My leg from the knee down

00:07:49.276 --> 00:07:51.204
is mangled beyond description.

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:52.599
The bone is cracked.

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:54.429
The meat is torn up.

00:07:54.429 --> 00:07:59.029
I make an instant decision that
I'll never look at that again.

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:01.413
As I come out of the water,

00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:04.030
Solly arrives at a deep section,

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.655
a channel between us.

00:08:05.655 --> 00:08:07.793
He knows, he sees the state of my leg,

00:08:07.793 --> 00:08:09.639
he knows that between him and I

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:10.851
there is a crocodile,

00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:13.343
and I can tell you this man doesn't
slow down for one second.

00:08:13.343 --> 00:08:15.149
He comes straight into the channel.

00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:17.084
He wades in to above his waist.

00:08:17.084 --> 00:08:18.547
He gets to me. He grabs me.

00:08:18.547 --> 00:08:20.219
I'm still in a vulnerable position.

00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:21.944
He picks me and puts me on his shoulder.

00:08:21.944 --> 00:08:24.363
This is the other thing about Solly,
he's freakishly strong.

00:08:24.363 --> 00:08:26.826
He turns. He walks me up the bank.

00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:28.880
He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.664
He wraps it around my leg,

00:08:30.664 --> 00:08:31.955
picks me up a second time,

00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:33.861
walks me to a vehicle,

00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:37.285
and he's able to get me to medical attention.

00:08:37.285 --> 00:08:40.508
And I survive.

00:08:40.508 --> 00:08:44.769
Now â (Applause)

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:47.479
Now I don't know how many people you know

00:08:47.479 --> 00:08:49.695
that go into a deep channel of water

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.955
that they know has a crocodile in it

00:08:51.955 --> 00:08:53.298
to come and help you,

00:08:53.298 --> 00:08:56.742
but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.

00:08:56.742 --> 00:08:59.198
And he is one amazing example

00:08:59.198 --> 00:09:02.643
of what I have experienced all over Africa.

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.774
In a more collective society,

00:09:04.774 --> 00:09:07.622
we realize from the inside

00:09:07.622 --> 00:09:10.755
that our own well-being is deeply tied

00:09:10.755 --> 00:09:13.993
to the well-being of others.

00:09:13.993 --> 00:09:17.262
Danger is shared. Pain is shared.

00:09:17.262 --> 00:09:20.187
Joy is shared. Achievement is shared.

00:09:20.187 --> 00:09:24.717
Houses are shared. Food is shared.

00:09:24.717 --> 00:09:27.913
Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts

00:09:27.913 --> 00:09:29.327
and to share,

00:09:29.327 --> 00:09:31.279
and what Solly taught me that day

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.282
is the essence of this value,

00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:36.040
his animated, empathetic action

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.085
in every moment.

00:09:38.085 --> 00:09:41.592
Now although the root word is about people,

00:09:41.592 --> 00:09:44.966
I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.

00:09:44.966 --> 00:09:48.240
And then I met this young lady.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.934
Her name was Elvis.

00:09:49.934 --> 00:09:51.705
In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis

00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:54.562
because he said she walked like she was doing

00:09:54.562 --> 00:09:57.227
the Elvis the pelvis dance.

00:09:57.227 --> 00:10:01.593
She was born with very badly
deformed back legs and pelvis.

00:10:01.593 --> 00:10:03.857
She arrived at our reserve from a reserve

00:10:03.857 --> 00:10:05.913
east of us on her migratory route.

00:10:05.913 --> 00:10:07.692
When I first saw her,

00:10:07.692 --> 00:10:10.160
I thought she would be dead in a matter of days.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.088
And yet, for the next five years

00:10:13.088 --> 00:10:15.618
she returned in the winter months.

00:10:15.618 --> 00:10:17.995
And we would be so excited to be out in the bush

00:10:17.995 --> 00:10:20.391
and to come across this unusual track.

00:10:20.391 --> 00:10:21.886
It looked like an inverted bracket,

00:10:21.886 --> 00:10:24.335
and we would drop whatever
we were doing and we would follow,

00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:26.006
and then we would come around the corner,

00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:28.092
and there she would be with her herd.

00:10:28.092 --> 00:10:30.987
And that outpouring of emotion

00:10:30.987 --> 00:10:32.701
from people on our safari trucks

00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:35.943
as they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.

00:10:35.943 --> 00:10:37.428
And it reminded me

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.359
that even people who grow up in cities

00:10:39.359 --> 00:10:42.944
feel a natural connection

00:10:42.944 --> 00:10:45.215
with the natural world and with animals.

00:10:45.215 --> 00:10:48.799
And yet still I remained amazed
that she was surviving.

00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:51.760
And then one day we came across
them at this small water hole.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.612
It was sort of a hollow in the ground.

00:10:53.612 --> 00:10:56.066
And I watched as the matriarch drank,

00:10:56.066 --> 00:10:59.340
and then she turned in that 
beautiful slow motion of elephants,

00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:01.110
looks like the arm in motion,

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.116
and she began to make her way up the steep bank.

00:11:04.116 --> 00:11:08.760
The rest of the herd turned and began to follow.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.544
And I watched young Elvis

00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:13.900
begin to psych herself up for the hill.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.255
She got visibly -- ears came forward,

00:11:17.255 --> 00:11:19.404
she had a full go of it and halfway up,

00:11:19.404 --> 00:11:21.681
her legs gave way, and she fell backwards.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.500
She attempted it a second time,

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.675
and again, halfway up, she fell backwards.

00:11:26.675 --> 00:11:28.532
And on the third attempt,

00:11:28.532 --> 00:11:30.989
an amazing thing happened.

00:11:30.989 --> 00:11:32.726
Halfway up the bank,

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:35.799
a young teenage elephant came in behind her,

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:38.002
and he propped his trunk underneath her,

00:11:38.002 --> 00:11:41.339
and he began to shovel her up the bank.

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:42.727
And it occurred to me

00:11:42.727 --> 00:11:44.283
that the rest of the herd

00:11:44.283 --> 00:11:46.958
was in fact looking after this young elephant.

00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.482
The next day I watched again

00:11:49.482 --> 00:11:51.652
as the matriarch broke a branch

00:11:51.652 --> 00:11:53.493
and she would put it in her mouth,

00:11:53.493 --> 00:11:55.450
and then she would break a second one

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.157
and drop it on the ground.

00:11:58.157 --> 00:12:00.529
And a consensus developed between all of us

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:02.378
who were guiding people in that area

00:12:02.378 --> 00:12:05.527
that that herd was in fact moving slower

00:12:05.527 --> 00:12:09.583
to accommodate that elephant.

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:11.674
What Elvis and the herd taught me

00:12:11.674 --> 00:12:14.998
caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu,

00:12:14.998 --> 00:12:17.614
and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild,

00:12:17.614 --> 00:12:19.825
we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves

00:12:19.825 --> 00:12:21.582
reflected back at us.

00:12:21.582 --> 00:12:25.222
And it is not only through other people

00:12:25.222 --> 00:12:28.142
that we get to experience our humanity

00:12:28.142 --> 00:12:32.068
but through all the creatures that live on this planet.

00:12:32.068 --> 00:12:34.882
If Africa has a gift to share,

00:12:34.882 --> 00:12:38.709
it's a gift of a more collective society.

00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:42.957
And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea,

00:12:42.957 --> 00:12:47.368
what I see is the essence of that value

00:12:47.368 --> 00:12:49.730
being invented here.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.845
Thank you.

00:12:51.845 --> 00:12:56.698
(Applause)

00:13:16.082 --> 00:13:17.879
Pat Mitchell: So Boyd,

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:22.920
we know that you knew President Mandela

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.897
from early childhood

00:13:24.897 --> 00:13:27.796
and that you heard the news as we all did today,

00:13:27.796 --> 00:13:30.236
and deeply distraught

00:13:30.236 --> 00:13:34.667
and know the tragic loss that it is to the world.

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:36.749
But I just wondered if you wanted

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:38.640
to share any additional thoughts,

00:13:38.655 --> 00:13:40.729
because we know that you heard that news

00:13:40.729 --> 00:13:44.109
just before coming in to do this session.

00:13:44.109 --> 00:13:45.805
Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.

00:13:45.805 --> 00:13:48.988
I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on.

00:13:48.988 --> 00:13:50.759
He was suffering.

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:53.157
And so of course there's the mixed emotions.

00:13:53.157 --> 00:13:55.141
But I just think of so many occurrences

00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:57.548
like the time he went on the Oprah show

00:13:57.548 --> 00:14:00.404
and asked her what the show would be about.

00:14:00.404 --> 00:14:01.882
(Laughter)

00:14:01.882 --> 00:14:05.180
And she was like, "Well, it'll be about you."

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.928
I mean, that's just incredible humility.

00:14:07.928 --> 00:14:11.591
(Laughter)

00:14:11.591 --> 00:14:14.753
He was the father of our nation

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:21.201
and we've got a road to walk in South Africa.

00:14:21.201 --> 00:14:24.611
And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.

00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:27.394
You know, he used to go to
a rugby match and we would win.

00:14:27.394 --> 00:14:30.855
Anywhere he went, things went well.

00:14:30.855 --> 00:14:33.236
But I think that magic will be with us,

00:14:33.236 --> 00:14:36.797
and the important thing is that we carry

00:14:36.797 --> 00:14:38.322
what he stood for.

00:14:38.322 --> 00:14:41.809
And so that's what I'm going to try and do,

00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:44.701
and that's what people all over 
South Africa are trying to do.

00:14:44.701 --> 00:14:46.927
PM: And that's what you've done today.
BV: Oh, thank you.

00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:50.066
PM: Thank you.
BV: Thank you. Thanks very much.

00:14:50.066 --> 00:14:54.288
(Applause)
