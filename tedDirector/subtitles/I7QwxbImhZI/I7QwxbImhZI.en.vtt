00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
To understand the business of mythology

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
you have to hear a story

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
of Ganesha,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
the elephant-headed god

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
who is the scribe of storytellers,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and his brother,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
the athletic warlord of the gods,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Kartikeya.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
The two brothers one day decided to go on a race,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
three times around the world.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Kartikeya leapt on his peacock

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
and flew around the continents

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and the mountains and the oceans.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
He went around once,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
he went around twice,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
he went around thrice.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
But his brother, Ganesha,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
simply walked around his parents

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
once, twice, thrice,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and said, "I won."

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
"How come?" said Kartikeya.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And Ganesha said,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
"You went around 'the world.'

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I went around 'my world.'"

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
What matters more?

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,'

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.260
you understand the difference between logos and mythos.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
'The world' is objective,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
logical, universal, factual,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
scientific.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
'My world' is subjective.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
It's emotional. It's personal.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
It's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
It is the belief system that we carry.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
It's the myth that we live in.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
'The world' tells us how the world functions,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
how the sun rises,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
how we are born.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
'My world' tells us why the sun rises,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.260
why we were born.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Every culture is trying to understand itself:

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
"Why do we exist?"

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.260
its own customized version of mythology.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Culture is a reaction to nature,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and this understanding of our ancestors

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
is transmitted generation from generation

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
in the form of stories, symbols and rituals,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.260
which are always indifferent to rationality.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And so, when you study it, you realize

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
that different people of the world

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
have a different understanding of the world.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Different people see things differently --

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
different viewpoints.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
There is my world and there is your world,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and my world is always better than your world,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
because my world, you see, is rational

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
and yours is superstition.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Yours is faith.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Yours is illogical.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
This is the root of the clash of civilizations.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.260
It took place, once, in 326 B.C.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
on the banks of a river called the Indus,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
now in Pakistan.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
This river lends itself to India's name.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
India. Indus.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Alexander, a young Macedonian,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
met there what he called a "gymnosophist,"

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
which means "the naked, wise man."

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
We don't know who he was.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Perhaps he was a Jain monk,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
like Bahubali over here,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.260
the Gomateshwara Bahubali

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
whose image is not far from Mysore.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Or perhaps he was just a yogi

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and the sun and the moon.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Alexander asked, "What are you doing?"

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and the gymnosophist answered,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
"I'm experiencing nothingness."

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Then the gymnosophist asked,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
"What are you doing?"

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and Alexander said, "I am conquering the world."

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And they both laughed.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Each one thought that the other was a fool.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.260
The gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
It's pointless."

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And Alexander thought,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
What a waste of a life."

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.260
To understand this difference in viewpoints,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
we have to understand

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
the subjective truth of Alexander --

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.260
his myth, and the mythology that constructed it.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Alexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
told him the story of Homer's "Iliad."

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
They told him of a great hero called Achilles,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
but when he withdrew from the battle,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
defeat was inevitable.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
"Achilles was a man who could shape history,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
a man of destiny,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
and this is what you should be, Alexander."

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
That's what he heard.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
"What should you not be?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
You should not be Sisyphus,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
who rolls a rock up a mountain all day

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.260
only to find the boulder rolled down at night.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Don't live a life which is monotonous,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
mediocre, meaningless.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Be spectacular! --

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
like the Greek heroes,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
like Jason, who went across the sea

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.260
with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Be spectacular like Theseus,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:50.260
who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
When you play in a race, win! --

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
because when you win, the exhilaration of victory

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.260
is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods."

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Because, you see, the Greeks believed

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
you live only once,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And if you have lived an extraordinary life,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
you will be welcomed to Elysium,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.260
or what the French call "Champs-Élysées" --

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.260
(Laughter) --

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
the heaven of the heroes.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.260
But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
He heard a very different story.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
He heard of a man called Bharat,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
after whom India is called Bhārata.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Bharat also conquered the world.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And then he went to the top-most peak

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
of the greatest mountain of the center of the world

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.260
called Meru.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And he wanted to hoist his flag to say,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
"I was here first."

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
But when he reached the mountain peak,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.260
he found the peak covered with countless flags

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
of world-conquerors before him,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.260
each one claiming "'I was here first' ...

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.260
that's what I thought until I came here."

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
And suddenly, in this canvas of infinity,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Bharat felt insignificant.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.260
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.260
You see, he had heroes, like Ram -- Raghupati Ram

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and Krishna, Govinda Hari.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.260
But they were not two characters on two different adventures.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.260
They were two lifetimes of the same hero.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.260
When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
When Ram dies, Krishna is born.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
When Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
You see, the Indians also had a river

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
But you don't cross it once.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
You go to and fro endlessly.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
It was called the Vaitarani.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
You go again and again and again.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Because, you see,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
nothing lasts forever in India, not even death.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And so, you have these grand rituals

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
where great images of mother goddesses are built

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
and worshiped for 10 days ...

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
And what do you do at the end of 10 days?

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
You dunk it in the river.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Because it has to end.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
And next year, she will come back.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
What goes around always comes around,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
and this rule applies not just to man,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
but also the gods.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
You see, the gods

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
have to come back again and again and again

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
as Ram, as Krishna.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Not only do they live infinite lives,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
but the same life is lived infinite times

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.260
till you get to the point of it all.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
"Groundhog Day."

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
(Laughter)

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Two different mythologies.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
Which is right?

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
One linear, one cyclical.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
One believes this is the one and only life.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.260
The other believes this is one of many lives.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
So, the value of his life was the sum total

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
of his achievements.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.260
The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
So, no matter what he did,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
it was always zero.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
And I believe it is this mythological paradigm

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
that inspired Indian mathematicians

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
to discover the number zero.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
Who knows?

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
And that brings us to the mythology of business.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.260
if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:01.260
then it was bound to influence the business they were in.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
You see, what is business

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
but the result of how the market behaves

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
and how the organization behaves?

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
And if you look at cultures around the world,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
all you have to do is understand the mythology

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
and you will see how they behave and how they do business.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.260
Take a look.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
If you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
you will see an obsession with binary logic,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
absolute truth, standardization,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
absoluteness, linear patterns in design.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
But if you look at cultures which have cyclical

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:39.260
and based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
with opinion,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
with contextual thinking,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
with everything is relative, sort of --

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.260
(Laughter)

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
mostly.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.260
(Laughter)

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
You look at art. Look at the ballerina,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
how linear she is in her performance.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
And then look at the Indian classical dancer,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
the Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
curvaceous.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
(Laughter)

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And then look at business.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
Standard business model:

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.260
vision, mission, values, processes.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
Sounds very much like the journey through

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
the wilderness to the promised land,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
with the commandments held by the leader.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.260
And if you comply, you will go to heaven.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
But in India there is no "the" promised land.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
There are many promised lands,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
depending on your station in society,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
depending on your stage of life.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.260
You see, businesses are not run as institutions,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
by the idiosyncrasies of individuals.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
It's always about taste.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.260
It's always about my taste.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
You see, Indian music, for example,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
does not have the concept of harmony.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.260
There is no orchestra conductor.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
There is one performer standing there, and everybody follows.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And you can never replicate that performance twice.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
It is not about documentation and contract.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.260
It's about conversation and faith.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.260
It's not about compliance. It's about setting,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.260
getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules --

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
just look at your Indian people around here,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
you'll see them smile; they know what it is.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.260
(Laughter)

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And then look at people who have done business in India,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
you'll see the exasperation on their faces.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.260
(Laughter)

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.260
(Applause)

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
is based on a cyclical world view.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
So, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And people are okay with it.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
And then globalization is taking place.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.260
The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.260
Which is rooted in one-life culture.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
And a clash is going to take place,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
like on the banks of the Indus.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
It is bound to happen.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
I love mythology too much.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
So, I had to teach it to myself.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And mythology does not pay, well, until now.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.260
(Laughter)

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
So, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
And I worked in the healthcare industry.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
And I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
and a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
I even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
And I would see the exasperation

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
between my American and European colleagues,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
when they were dealing with India.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
Example: Please tell us the process

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
to invoice hospitals.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
(Laughter)

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
How do you parameterize "mostly"?

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.260
How do you put it in a nice little software? You can't.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
I would give my viewpoints to people.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
But nobody was interested in listening to it,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.260
you see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:11.260
You see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
And there are more than 200 formats,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
across 50 cities and towns of India.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
And he knew very intuitively,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
that best practices,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
developed in Japan and China and Europe and America

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
will not work in India.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.260
He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.260
He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
So, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
"All I want to do is align belief."

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Sounds so simple.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
But belief is not measurable.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
You can't measure it. You can't manage it.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
So, how do you construct belief?

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.260
How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.260
Even if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.260
So, I tried to work on the standard model of culture,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
which is, develop stories, symbols and rituals.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
And I will share one of the rituals with you.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
Hindus don't have the concept of commandments.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
So, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
So, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
You want to see God.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.260
And you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
large unblinking eyes,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
sometimes made of silver,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
so they look at you.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.260
is divine empathy.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad."

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.260
(Laughter)

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
"Why did I do the setting,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.260
why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please."

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
And based on this, we created a ritual for leaders.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.260
After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.260
we blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.260
the customer, his family, his team, his boss.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
You read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
and then you remove the blindfold.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
And invariably, you see a tear,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
because the penny has dropped.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.260
He realizes that to succeed,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
he does not have to be a "professional,"

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
he does not have to cut out his emotions,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
he has to include all these people

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.260
in his world to succeed, to make them happy,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
The customer is happy, because the customer is God.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
behavior will happen, business will happen.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
And it has.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
So, then we come back to Alexander

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
and to the gymnosophist.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.260
And everybody asks me, "Which is the better way, this way or that way?"

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
And it's a very dangerous question,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.260
because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
So, I will not answer the question.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
What I will give you is an Indian answer,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
the Indian head-shake.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
(Laughter)

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.260
(Applause)

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
Depending on the context,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
depending on the outcome,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
choose your paradigm.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
They are cultural creations,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
not natural phenomena.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
And so the next time you meet someone, a stranger,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
one request:

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
Understand that you live in the subjective truth,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
and so does he.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
Understand it.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.260
And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
You will discover that within infinite myths

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
lies the eternal truth.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
Who sees it all?

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
Varuna has but a thousand eyes.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
Indra, a hundred.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
You and I, only two.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.260
Thank you. Namaste.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:20.260
(Applause)
