00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.816
People returning to work
after a career break:

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.016
I call them relaunchers.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.896
These are people who have taken
career breaks for elder care,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.736
for childcare reasons,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.456
pursuing a personal interest

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.680
or a personal health issue.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.536
Closely related are
career transitioners of all kinds:

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.896
veterans, military spouses,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.336
retirees coming out of retirement

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.080
or repatriating expats.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.695
Returning to work
after a career break is hard

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.736
because of a disconnect
between the employers

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.656
and the relaunchers.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.656
Employers can view hiring people
with a gap on their resume

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.776
as a high-risk proposition,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.656
and individuals on career break
can have doubts about their abilities

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.256
to relaunch their careers,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.600
especially if they've been out
for a long time.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.080
This disconnect is a problem
that I'm trying to help solve.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.160
Now, successful relaunchers
are everywhere and in every field.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.416
This is Sami Kafala.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.176
He's a nuclear physicist in the UK

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.120
who took a five-year career break
to be home with his five children.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.096
The Singapore press recently wrote
about nurses returning to work

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.176
after long career breaks.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.216
And speaking of long career breaks,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.520
this is Mimi Kahn.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.296
She's a social worker
in Orange County, California,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.656
who returned to work
in a social services organization

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.456
after a 25-year career break.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.840
That's the longest career break
that I'm aware of.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.816
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.680
took a five-year career break
early in her career.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.920
And this is Tracy Shapiro,
who took a 13-year career break.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.336
Tracy answered a call for essays
by the Today Show

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.776
from people who were trying
to return to work

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.640
but having a difficult time of it.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.616
Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five
who loved her time at home,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.176
but she had gone through a divorce
and needed to return to work,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.136
plus she really wanted
to bring work back into her life

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.800
because she loved working.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.096
Tracy was doing what so many of us do

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.856
when we feel like we've put in
a good day in the job search.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.856
She was looking for a finance
or accounting role,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.576
and she had just spent
the last nine months

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.896
very diligently researching
companies online

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.680
and applying for jobs with no results.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.856
I met Tracy in June of 2011,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.416
when the Today Show asked me
if I could work with her

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.600
to see if I could help her
turn things around.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.616
The first thing I told Tracy
was she had to get out of the house.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.376
I told her she had to go public
with her job search

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.240
and tell everyone she knew
about her interest in returning to work.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.456
I also told her, "You are going
to have a lot of conversations

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.056
that don't go anywhere.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.336
Expect that, and don't
be discouraged by it.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.936
There will be a handful

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.800
that ultimately lead
to a job opportunity."

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.296
I'll tell you what happened
with Tracy in a little bit,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.749
but I want to share with you
a discovery that I made

00:03:17.773 --> 00:03:19.496
when I was returning to work

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.616
after my own career break of 11 years
out of the full-time workforce.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.880
And that is, that people's view of you
is frozen in time.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.976
What I mean by this is,
when you start to get in touch with people

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.736
and you get back in touch
with those people from the past,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.016
the people with whom you worked
or went to school,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.776
they are going to remember you as you were

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.616
before your career break.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.136
And that's even if your sense of self
has diminished over time,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.256
as happens with so many of us

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.176
the farther removed we are
from our professional identities.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.896
So for example,
you might think of yourself

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.400
as someone who looks like this.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.096
This is me, crazy after a day
of driving around in my minivan.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.320
Or here I am in the kitchen.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.296
But those people from the past,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.536
they don't know about any of this.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.096
They only remember you as you were,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.296
and it's a great confidence boost
to be back in touch with these people

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.960
and hear their enthusiasm
about your interest in returning to work.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.536
There's one more thing I remember vividly
from my own career break.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.935
And that was that I hardly kept up
with the business news.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:30.576
My background is in finance,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.016
and I hardly kept up with any news

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.976
when I was home caring
for my four young children.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.376
So I was afraid I'd go into an interview

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.760
and start talking about a company
that didn't exist anymore.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.736
So I had to resubscribe
to the Wall Street Journal

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.216
and read it for a good six months
cover to cover before I felt

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.160
like I had a handle on what was going on
in the business world again.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.536
I believe relaunchers
are a gem of the workforce,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.296
and here's why.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.136
Think about our life stage:

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.816
for those of us who took career breaks
for childcare reasons,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.816
we have fewer or no maternity leaves.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.336
We did that already.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.696
We have fewer spousal
or partner job relocations.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.176
We're in a more settled time of life.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.016
We have great work experience.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.056
We have a more mature perspective.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.656
We're not trying to find ourselves
at an employer's expense.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.896
Plus we have an energy,
an enthusiasm about returning to work

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.840
precisely because we've been
away from it for a while.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.216
On the flip side, I speak with employers,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.776
and here are two concerns
that employers have

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.696
about hiring relaunchers.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.776
The first one is, employers
are worried that relaunchers

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.840
are technologically obsolete.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.656
Now, I can tell you,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.256
having been technologically
obsolete myself at one point,

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.960
that it's a temporary condition.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.656
I had done my financial analysis
so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.616
I don't know if anyone
can even remember back that far,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.856
but I had to relearn it on Excel.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.960
It actually wasn't that hard.
A lot of the commands are the same.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.816
I found PowerPoint much more challenging,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.000
but now I use PowerPoint all the time.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.616
I tell relaunchers that employers
expect them to come to the table

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.136
with a working knowledge
of basic office management software.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.896
And if they're not up to speed,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.296
then it's their
responsibility to get there.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.520
And they do.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.576
The second area of concern
that employers have about relaunchers

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.800
is they're worried that relaunchers
don't know what they want to do.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.656
I tell relaunchers that they need
to do the hard work

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.176
to figure out whether their interests
and skills have changed

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.776
or have not changed

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.616
while they have been on career break.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.896
That's not the employer's job.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.496
It's the relauncher's responsibility
to demonstrate to the employer

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.440
where they can add the most value.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.840
Back in 2010 I started noticing something.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.536
I had been tracking
return to work programs since 2008,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.856
and in 2010, I started noticing

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.776
the use of a short-term
paid work opportunity,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.256
whether it was called
an internship or not,

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.616
but an internship-like experience,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.776
as a way for professionals
to return to work.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.576
I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.896
start corporate reentry
internship programs.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.360
I saw a returning engineer,
a nontraditional reentry candidate,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.936
apply for an entry-level
internship program in the military,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.320
and then get a permanent job afterward.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.576
I saw two universities
integrate internships

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.640
into mid-career executive
education programs.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.016
So I wrote a report
about what I was seeing,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.016
and it became this article
for Harvard Business Review

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.936
called "The 40-Year-Old Intern."

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.576
I have to thank the editors
there for that title,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.976
and also for this artwork

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.336
where you can see the 40-year-old intern
in the midst of all the college interns.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.536
And then, courtesy of Fox Business News,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.736
they called the concept
"The 50-Year-Old Intern."

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.576
(Laughter)

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.456
So five of the biggest
financial services companies

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.616
have reentry internship programs
for returning finance professionals.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.936
And at this point,
hundreds of people have participated.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.736
These internships are paid,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.496
and the people who move on
to permanent roles

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.200
are commanding competitive salaries.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.136
And now, seven of the biggest
engineering companies

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.456
are piloting reentry internship programs
for returning engineers

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.200
as part of an initiative
with the Society of Women Engineers.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.400
Now, why are companies embracing
the reentry internship?

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.416
Because the internship allows the employer

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.456
to base their hiring decision
on an actual work sample

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.535
instead of a series of interviews,

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:59.296
and the employer does not have to make
that permanent hiring decision

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.120
until the internship period is over.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.536
This testing out period
removes the perceived risk

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.136
that some managers attach
to hiring relaunchers,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.816
and they are attracting
excellent candidates

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.680
who are turning into great hires.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.200
Think about how far we have come.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.536
Before this, most employers
were not interested

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.896
in engaging with relaunchers at all.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.416
But now, not only
are programs being developed

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.976
specifically with relaunchers in mind,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.496
but you can't even apply
for these programs

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.200
unless you have a gap on your résumé.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.936
This is the mark of real change,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.216
of true institutional shift,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.776
because if we can solve
this problem for relaunchers,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.096
we can solve it for other
career transitioners too.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.056
In fact, an employer just told me

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.576
that their veterans return to work program

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.976
is based on their reentry
internship program.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.016
And there's no reason why there can't be
a retiree internship program.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.520
Different pool, same concept.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.856
So let me tell you
what happened with Tracy Shapiro.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.456
Remember that she had to tell
everyone she knew

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.480
about her interest in returning to work.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.976
Well, one critical conversation
with another parent in her community

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.096
led to a job offer for Tracy,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.896
and it was an accounting job
in a finance department.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.240
But it was a temp job.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.256
The company told her
there was a possibility

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.816
it could turn into something more,
but no guarantees.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.200
This was in the fall of 2011.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.736
Tracy loved this company,
and she loved the people

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.816
and the office was less
than 10 minutes from her house.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.056
So even though she had a second job offer

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.976
at another company
for a permanent full-time role,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.216
she decided to take her chances
with this internship

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.000
and hope for the best.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.376
Well, she ended up blowing away
all of their expectations,

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.896
and the company not only
made her a permanent offer

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.016
at the beginning of 2012,

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.656
but they made it even more
interesting and challenging,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.800
because they knew what Tracy could handle.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.856
Fast forward to 2015,

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.456
Tracy's been promoted.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.896
They've paid for her
to get her MBA at night.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.240
She's even hired another relauncher
to work for her.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.216
Tracy's temp job was a tryout,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.896
just like an internship,

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:22.160
and it ended up being a win
for both Tracy and her employer.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.976
Now, my goal is to bring
the reentry internship concept

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.736
to more and more employers.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.576
But in the meantime,

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.816
if you are returning to work
after a career break,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.856
don't hesitate to suggest an internship
or an internship-like arrangement

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.496
to an employer that does not have
a formal reentry internship program.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.816
Be their first success story,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.480
and you can be the example
for more relaunchers to come.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.136
Thank you.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.325
(Applause)
