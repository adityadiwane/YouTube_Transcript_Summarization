00:00:13.157 --> 00:00:16.508
In the past few months, I've been
traveling for weeks at a time

00:00:16.532 --> 00:00:18.563
with only one suitcase of clothes.

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:21.051
One day, I was invited
to an important event,

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:23.749
and I wanted to wear
something special and new for it.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.553
So I looked through my suitcase
and I couldn't find anything to wear.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.063
I was lucky to be at the technology
conference on that day,

00:00:31.087 --> 00:00:33.681
and I had access to 3D printers.

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:35.942
So I quickly designed
a skirt on my computer,

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.111
and I loaded the file on the printer.

00:00:38.135 --> 00:00:40.290
It just printed the pieces overnight.

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.759
The next morning,
I just took all the pieces,

00:00:42.783 --> 00:00:44.750
assembled them together in my hotel room,

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:47.730
and this is actually the skirt
that I'm wearing right now.

00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:51.654
(Applause)

00:00:51.678 --> 00:00:54.461
So it wasn't the first time
that I printed clothes.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.850
For my senior collection
at fashion design school,

00:00:56.874 --> 00:01:01.357
I decided to try and 3D print
an entire fashion collection from my home.

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:05.212
The problem was that I barely knew
anything about 3D printing,

00:01:05.236 --> 00:01:10.011
and I had only nine months to figure out
how to print five fashionable looks.

00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:13.932
I always felt most creative
when I worked from home.

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:16.344
I loved experimenting with new materials,

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.577
and I always tried
to develop new techniques

00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:22.104
to make the most unique textiles
for my fashion projects.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.105
I loved going to old factories
and weird stores

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:29.819
in search of leftovers
of strange powders and weird materials,

00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:32.189
and then bring them home to experiment on.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.073
As you can probably imagine,

00:01:34.097 --> 00:01:36.112
my roommates didn't like that at all.

00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:37.141
(Laughter)

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:41.278
So I decided to move on
to working with big machines,

00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:43.395
ones that didn't fit in my living room.

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:45.546
I love the exact
and the custom work I can do

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.716
with all kinds of fashion technologies,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.432
like knitting machines
and laser cutting and silk printing.

00:01:52.498 --> 00:01:55.673
One summer break, I came here
to New York for an internship

00:01:55.697 --> 00:01:58.047
at a fashion house in Chinatown.

00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:02.022
We worked on two incredible dresses
that were 3D printed.

00:02:02.598 --> 00:02:04.839
They were amazing --
like you can see here.

00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:07.424
But I had a few issues with them.

00:02:07.448 --> 00:02:11.116
They were made from hard plastics
and that's why they were very breakable.

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:13.434
The models couldn't sit in them,

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:16.846
and they even got scratched
from the plastics under their arms.

00:02:17.444 --> 00:02:20.455
With 3D printing, the designers
had so much freedom

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.761
to make the dresses look
exactly like they wanted,

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:29.378
but still, they were very dependent
on big and expensive industrial printers

00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:32.559
that were located in a lab
far from their studio.

00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.889
Later that year, a friend gave me
a 3D printed necklace,

00:02:36.913 --> 00:02:39.048
printed using a home printer.

00:02:39.072 --> 00:02:41.218
I knew that these printers
were much cheaper

00:02:41.242 --> 00:02:44.498
and much more accessible
than the ones we used at my internship.

00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:46.390
So I looked at the necklace,

00:02:46.414 --> 00:02:49.877
and then I thought, "If I can
print a necklace from home,

00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:52.056
why not print my clothes from home, too?"

00:02:53.108 --> 00:02:56.145
I really liked the idea that I wouldn't
have to go to the market

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.793
and pick fabrics that
someone else chose to sell --

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:02.903
I could just design them
and print them directly from home.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.051
I found a small makerspace,

00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:08.698
where I learned everything
I know about 3D printing.

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:11.631
Right away, they literally
gave me the key to the lab,

00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:14.673
so I could experiment
into the night, every night.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.158
The main challenge was to find the right
filament for printing clothes with.

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:20.338
So what is a filament?

00:03:20.362 --> 00:03:22.794
Filament is the material
you feed the printer with.

00:03:22.818 --> 00:03:25.720
And I spent a month or so
experimenting with PLA,

00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:28.905
which is a hard and scratchy,
breakable material.

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:32.315
The breakthrough came
when I was introduced to Filaflex,

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:33.881
which is a new kind of filament.

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:36.245
It's strong, yet very flexible.

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.103
And with it, I was able to print
the first garment,

00:03:40.127 --> 00:03:43.575
the red jacket that had
the word "LibertÃ©" --

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.794
"freedom" in French --

00:03:44.818 --> 00:03:46.331
embedded into it.

00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:49.148
I chose this word because I felt
so empowered and free

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:51.475
when I could just design
a garment from my home

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:53.608
and then print it by myself.

00:03:54.328 --> 00:03:57.742
And actually, you can easily
download this jacket,

00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:00.394
and easily change the word
to something else.

00:04:00.418 --> 00:04:03.066
For example, your name
or your sweetheart's name.

00:04:03.507 --> 00:04:04.657
(Laughter)

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.766
So the printer plates are small,

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.868
so I had to piece the garment
together, just like a puzzle.

00:04:12.238 --> 00:04:14.489
And I wanted to solve another challenge.

00:04:14.513 --> 00:04:16.058
I wanted to print textiles

00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:18.587
that I would use
just like regular fabrics.

00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:20.545
That's when I found an open-source file

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.158
from an architect who designed
a pattern that I love.

00:04:23.182 --> 00:04:25.901
And with it, I was able to print
a beautiful textile

00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:28.549
that I would use
just like a regular fabric.

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:31.898
And it actually even looks
a little bit like lace.

00:04:33.247 --> 00:04:36.637
So I took his file and I modified it,
and changed it, played with it --

00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:39.255
many kinds of versions out of it.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:43.838
And I needed to print
another 1,500 more hours

00:04:43.862 --> 00:04:46.789
to complete printing my collection.

00:04:46.813 --> 00:04:50.621
So I brought six printers to my home
and just printed 24-7.

00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:53.696
And this is actually
a really slow process,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.063
but let's remember the Internet
was significantly slower 20 years ago,

00:04:58.087 --> 00:05:00.412
so 3D printing will also accelerate

00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:03.419
and in no time you'll be able to print
a T-Shirt in your home

00:05:03.443 --> 00:05:06.408
in just a couple of hours,
or even minutes.

00:05:06.826 --> 00:05:09.146
So you guys, you want to see
what it looks like?

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.471
Audience: Yeah!

00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:12.346
(Applause)

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:17.809
Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing
one of my five outfits.

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:22.650
Almost everything here she's wearing,
I printed from my home.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.330
Even her shoes are printed.

00:05:25.354 --> 00:05:26.506
Audience: Wow!

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.695
Audience: Cool!

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:31.521
(Applause)

00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:33.088
Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca.

00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:35.826
(To audience) Thank you, guys.

00:05:36.848 --> 00:05:39.365
So I think in the future,
materials will evolve,

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.570
and they will look and feel
like fabrics we know today,

00:05:42.594 --> 00:05:44.530
like cotton or silk.

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.316
Imagine personalized clothes
that fit exactly to your measurements.

00:05:51.537 --> 00:05:53.514
Music was once a very physical thing.

00:05:53.538 --> 00:05:56.562
You would have to go
to the record shop and buy CDs,

00:05:56.586 --> 00:05:59.236
but now you can just download the music --

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.419
digital music --

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:01.776
directly to your phone.

00:06:02.505 --> 00:06:04.966
Fashion is also a very physical thing.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.182
And I wonder what our world will look like

00:06:08.206 --> 00:06:11.550
when our clothes will be digital,
just like this skirt is.

00:06:12.056 --> 00:06:13.429
Thank you so much.

00:06:13.453 --> 00:06:14.653
(Applause)

00:06:14.677 --> 00:06:15.827
[Thank You]

00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:18.650
(Applause)
