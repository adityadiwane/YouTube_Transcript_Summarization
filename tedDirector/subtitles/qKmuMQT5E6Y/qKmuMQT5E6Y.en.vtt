00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.916
There's a beautiful statement
on the screen that says,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.316
"Light creates ambiance,
light makes the feel of a space,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.396
and light is also
the expression of structure."

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.236
Well, that was not by me.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.596
That was, of course, by Le Corbusier,
the famous architect.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.236
And here you can see what he meant
in one of his beautiful buildings --

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.436
the chapel Notre Dame Du Haut
De Ronchamp --

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.996
where he creates this light that he could
only make because there's also dark.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.220
And I think that is the quintessence
of this 18-minute talk --

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.236
that there is no good lighting
that is healthy and for our well-being

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.420
without proper darkness.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.876
So this is how we normally
would light our offices.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.796
We have codes and standards that tell us
that the lights should be so much Lux

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.076
and of great uniformity.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.115
This is how we create uniform lighting
from one wall to the other

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:22.916
in a regular grid of lamps.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.196
And that is quite different
from what I just showed you

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.900
from Le Corbusier.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.996
If we would apply
these codes and standards

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.556
to the Pantheon in Rome,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.436
it would never have looked like this,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.156
because this beautiful light feature
that goes around there all by itself

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.076
can only appear because there is
also darkness in that same building.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.796
And the same is more or less
what Santiago Calatrava said

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.596
when he said, "Light: I make it
in my buildings for comfort."

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.796
And he didn't mean the comfort
of a five-course dinner

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.756
as opposed to a one-course meal,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.476
but he really meant the comfort

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.236
of the quality of the building
for the people.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.264
He meant that you can see the sky
and that you can experience the sun.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.236
And he created these gorgeous buildings
where you can see the sky,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.356
and where you can experience the sun,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.260
that give us a better life
in the built environment,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.316
just because of the relevance of light
in its brightness and also in its shadows.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.276
And what it all boils down to is,
of course, the sun.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.236
And this image of the Sun may suggest

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.436
that the Sun is something
evil and aggressive,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.636
but we should not forget

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.236
that all energy on this planet
actually comes from the Sun,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.060
and light is only
a manifestation of that energy.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.396
The sun is for dynamics,
for color changes.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.996
The sun is for beauty in our environment,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.236
like in this building --
the High Museum in Atlanta,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.196
which has been created
by Renzo Piano from Italy,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.796
together with Arup Lighting,
a brilliant team of lighting designers,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.276
who created a very subtle
modulation of light across the space,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.618
responding to what the sun does outside,

00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:13.636
just because of all these
beautiful openings in the roof.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.836
So in an indirect way,
you can see the sun.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.316
And what they did is they created
an integral building element

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.116
to improve the quality of the space
that surrounds the visitors of the museum.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.396
They created this shade
that you can see here,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.076
which actually covers the sun,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.615
but opens up to the good
light from the sky.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.076
And here you can see how they really
crafted a beautiful design process

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.316
with physical models,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.596
with quantitative
as well as qualitative methods,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.836
to come to a final solution
that is truly integrated

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.396
and completely holistic
with the architecture.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.916
They allowed themselves
a few mistakes along the way.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.796
As you can see here,
there's some direct light on the floor,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.436
but they could easily figure out
where that comes from.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.036
And they allow people in that building
to really enjoy the sun,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.156
the good part of the sun.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.596
And enjoying the sun
can be in many different ways, of course.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.436
It can be just like this,

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.880
or maybe like this,
which is rather peculiar,

00:04:17.904 --> 00:04:19.996
but this is in 1963 --

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.036
the viewing of a sun eclipse
in the United States.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.316
And it's just a bit bright up there,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.500
so these people have found
a very intriguing solution.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.356
This is, I think, a very illustrative
image of what I try to say --

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.276
that the beautiful dynamics of sun,
bringing these into the building,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.836
creates a quality of our built environment
that truly enhances our lives.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.156
And this is all about darkness

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.276
as much as it is
about lightness, of course,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.916
because otherwise
you don't see these dynamics.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.396
As opposed to the first office

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.476
that I showed you
in the beginning of the talk,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.556
this is a well-known office,
which is the Weidt Group.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.636
They are in green energy consulting,
or something like that.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.613
And they really practice what they preach

00:05:02.637 --> 00:05:05.556
because this office doesn't have
any electric lighting at all.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.836
It has only, on one side,
this big, big glass window

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.436
that helps to let the sunlight
enter deep into the space

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.876
and create a beautiful quality there
and a great dynamic range.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.516
So it can be very dim over there,
and you do your work,

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.316
and it can be very bright over there,
and you do your work.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.236
But actually, the human eye
turns out to be remarkably adaptable

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.156
to all these different light conditions
that together create an environment

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.596
that is never boring
and that is never dull,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.260
and therefore helps us
to enhance our lives.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.956
I really owe a short introduction
of this man to you.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.916
This is Richard Kelly
who was born 100 years ago,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.756
which is the reason I bring him up now,
because it's kind of an anniversary year.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.876
In the 1930s, Richard Kelly
was the first person to really describe

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.836
a methodology of modern lighting design.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.676
And he coined three terms,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.596
which are "focal glow,"
"ambient luminescence"

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.276
and "play of the brilliants" --

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.796
three very distinctly different
ideas about light in architecture

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.796
that all together
make up this beautiful experience.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.236
So to begin with, focal glow.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.836
He meant something like this --

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.236
where the light
gives direction to the space

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.236
and helps you to get around.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.476
Or something like this,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.116
which is the lighting design
he did for General Motors,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.356
for the car showroom.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.596
And you enter that space,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.916
and you feel like,
"Wow! This is so impressive,"

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.996
just because of this focal point,
this huge light source in the middle.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.735
To me, it is something from theater,

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.956
and I will get back to that
a little bit later.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.636
It's the spotlight on the artist
that helps you to focus.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.476
It could also be the sunlight
that breaks through the clouds

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.916
and lights up a patch of the land,

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.500
highlighting it
compared to the dim environment.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.156
Or it can be in today's retail,
in the shopping environment --

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.196
lighting the merchandise and creating
accents that help you to get around.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.236
Ambient luminescence
is something very different.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.356
Richard Kelly saw it
as something infinite,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.676
something without any focus,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.516
something where all details
actually dissolve in infinity.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.436
And I see it as a very comfortable kind
of light that really helps us to relax

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.876
and to contemplate.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.716
It could also be something like this:

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.836
the National Museum of Science in London,

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.956
where this blue is embracing
all the exhibitions and galleries

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.476
in one large gesture.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.716
And then finally,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.196
Kelly's play of brilliants added to that

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.556
really some play, I think,
of the skyline of Hong Kong,

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.916
or perhaps the chandelier
in the opera house,

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.556
or in the theater here,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.756
which is the decoration,
the icing on the cake, something playful,

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.316
something that is just an addition
to the architectural environment,

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.556
I would say.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.156
These three distinct elements, together,

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.340
make a lighting environment
that helps us to feel better.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.076
And we can only
create these out of darkness.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.676
And I will explain that further.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.876
And I guess that is something
that Richard Kelly, here on the left,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.236
was explaining
to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.996
And behind them,
you see that Seagram Building

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.460
that later turned into an icon
of modern lighting design.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.045
Those times, there were
some early attempts

00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:18.556
also for light therapy already.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.756
You can see here a photo

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.916
from the United States
Library of Medicine,

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.036
where people are put
in the sun to get better.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.251
It's a little bit of a different story,
this health aspect of light,

00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:29.835
than what I'm telling you today.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.996
In today's modern medicine,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:38.516
there is a real understanding of light
in an almost biochemical way.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.236
And there is the idea
that, when we look at things,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.436
it is the yellow light
that helps us the most,

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.436
that we are the most sensitive for.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.076
But our circadian rhythms,

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.556
which are the rhythms
that help us to wake and sleep

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.956
and be alert and relaxed
and so forth and so on,

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.716
they are much more triggered
by blue light.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.636
And by modulating the amount
of blue in our environment,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.036
we can help people
to relax, or to be alert,

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.356
to fall asleep, or to stay awake.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:13.396
And that is how, maybe in the near future,
light can help hospitals

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.836
to make people better sooner,
recover them quicker.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.236
Maybe in the airplane,
we can overcome jet lag like that.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.042
Perhaps in school,
we can help children to learn better

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.114
because they concentrate more
on their work.

00:09:28.138 --> 00:09:30.636
And you can imagine
a lot more applications.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.236
But I would like to talk further

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:38.036
about the combination
of light and darkness

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.980
as a quality in our life.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.156
So light is, of course,
for social interaction also --

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.836
to create relationships
with all the features around us.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.236
It is the place where we gather around

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.516
when we have to say something
to each other.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.716
And it is all about this planet.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.996
But when you look at this planet at night,

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.356
it looks like this.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.916
And I think this is the most shocking
image in my talk today.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.556
Because all this light here
goes up to the sky.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.476
It never reaches the ground
where it was meant for.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.636
It never is to the benefit of people.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.476
It only spoils the darkness.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.716
So at a global scale, it looks like this.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.476
And, I mean, that is quite amazing,
what you see here --

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.836
how much light goes up into the sky
and never reaches the ground.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.596
Because if we look at the Earth
the way it should be,

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.636
it would be something
like this very inspiring image

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.956
where darkness is for our imagination
and for contemplation

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.660
and to help us to relate to everything.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.956
The world is changing though,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.196
and urbanization
is a big driver of everything.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.638
I took this photo
two weeks ago in Guangzhou,

00:10:45.662 --> 00:10:47.317
and I realized that 10 years ago,

00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:51.101
there was nothing like this,
of these buildings.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.076
It was just a much smaller city,

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.556
and the pace of urbanization
is incredible and enormous.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.596
And we have to understand
these main questions:

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.236
How do people move
through these new urban spaces?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.836
How do they share their culture?

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.700
How do we tackle things like mobility?

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.156
And how can light help there?

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.636
Because the new technologies,

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.116
they seem to be
in a really interesting position

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.996
to contribute to the solutions
of urbanization

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.356
and to provide us
with better environments.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.756
It's not that long ago

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.516
that our lighting was just done
with these kinds of lamps.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.636
And of course,
we had the metal-halide lamps

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.756
and fluorescent lamps
and things like that.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.276
Now we have LED,

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.356
but here you see the latest one,
and you see how incredibly small it is.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.996
And this is exactly
what offers us a unique opportunity,

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.236
because this tiny, tiny size allows us

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.596
to put the light
wherever we really need it.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.516
And we can actually leave it out
where it's not needed at all

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.236
and where we can preserve darkness.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.756
So that is a really interesting
proposition, I think,

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.356
and a new way of lighting
the architectural environment

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.260
with our well-being in mind.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.636
The problem is, though, that I wanted
to explain to you how this really works --

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.076
but I can have four of these on my finger,

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.196
so you would not be able
to really see them.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.276
So I asked our laboratory
to do something about it,

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.316
and they said,
"Well, we can do something."

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.876
They created for me
the biggest LED in the world

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.916
especially for TEDx in Amsterdam.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.276
So here it is.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.716
It's the same thing
as you can see over there --

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.356
just 200 times bigger.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.716
And I will very quickly
show you how it works.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.596
So just to explain.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:33.820
Now, every LED that is made
these days gives blue light.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.036
Now, this is not very pleasant
and comfortable.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:44.956
And for that reason,
we cover the LED with a phosphor cap.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.676
And the phosphor is excited by the blue

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.796
and makes the light white
and warm and pleasant.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.156
And then when you add the lens to that,

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.876
you can bundle the light
and send it wherever you need it

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.236
without any need to spill any light
to the sky or anywhere else.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.556
So you can preserve the darkness
and make the light.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:08.676
I just wanted to show that to you
so you understand how this works.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.716
(Applause)

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.928
Thank you.

00:13:10.952 --> 00:13:12.016
(Applause)

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.236
We can go further.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.476
So we have to rethink
the way we light our cities.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.236
We have to think again
about light as a default solution.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.676
Why are all these motorways
permanently lit?

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.916
Is it really needed?

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.636
Can we maybe be much more selective

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.996
and create better environments
that also benefit from darkness?

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.236
Can we be much more gentle with light?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.076
Like here -- this is
a very low light level actually.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.716
Can we engage people more
in the lighting projects that we create,

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.316
so they really want
to connect with it, like here?

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.200
Or can we create simply sculptures

00:13:43.224 --> 00:13:45.836
that are very inspiring
to be in and to be around?

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.836
And can we preserve the darkness?

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.099
Because to find a place
like this today on Earth

00:13:50.123 --> 00:13:52.763
is really very, very challenging.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.996
And to find a starry sky like this
is even more difficult.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.996
Even in the oceans,
we are creating a lot of light

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.476
that we could actually ban

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.156
also for animal life
to have a much greater well-being.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.476
And it's known that migrating birds,
for example, get very disoriented

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.556
because of these offshore platforms.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.356
And we discovered that
when we make those lights green,

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.396
the birds, they actually go the right way.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.436
They are not disturbed anymore.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.278
And it turns out once again

00:14:19.302 --> 00:14:23.460
that spectral sensitivity
is very important here.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.636
In all of these examples, I think,

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.556
we should start making
the light out of darkness,

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.476
and use the darkness as a canvas --
like the visual artists do,

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.756
like Edward Hopper in this painting.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.476
I think that there is
a lot of suspense in this painting.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.716
I think, when I see it,
I start to think, who are those people?

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.996
Where have they come from?
Where are they going?

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.236
What just happened?

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.516
What will be happening
in the next five minutes?

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.396
And it only embodies
all these stories and all this suspense

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.276
because of the darkness and the light.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.076
Edward Hopper was a real master

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.716
in creating the narration
by working with light and dark.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.036
And we can learn from that

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.836
and create more interesting
and inspiring architectural environments.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.316
We can do that in commercial
spaces like this.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.196
And you can still also go outside

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:14.036
and enjoy the greatest show
in the universe,

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.500
which is, of course, the universe itself.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:23.676
So I give you this wonderful,
informative image of the sky,

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.356
ranging from the inner city,

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.076
where you may see one or two stars
and nothing else,

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.436
all the way to the rural environments,

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.716
where you can enjoy this great
and gorgeous and beautiful performance

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.116
of the constellations and the stars.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.220
In architecture, it works just the same.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.276
By appreciating the darkness
when you design the light,

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.876
you create much more
interesting environments

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.220
that truly enhance our lives.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.836
This is the most well-known example,
Tadao Ando's Church of the Light.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:59.476
But I also think
of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals,

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.316
where light and dark,
in very gentle combinations,

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.876
alter each other to define the space.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.196
Or Richard MacCormac's
Southwark tube station in London,

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.791
where you can really see the sky,
even though you are under the ground.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.116
And finally, I want to point out

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.636
that a lot of this inspiration
comes from theater.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.796
And I think it's fantastic
that we are today experiencing TEDx

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.316
in a theater for the first time

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.716
because I think we really owe
to the theater a big thanks.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.996
It wouldn't be
such an inspiring scenography

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.220
without this theater.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:38.036
And I think the theater is a place
where we truly enhance life with light.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.276
Thank you very much.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:45.260
(Applause)
