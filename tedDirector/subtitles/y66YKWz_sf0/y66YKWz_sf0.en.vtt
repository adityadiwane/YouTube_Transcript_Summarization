00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:19.043
Five years ago, I experienced a bit

00:00:19.043 --> 00:00:22.379
of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:25.042
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher,

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:28.382
to teach a communications class for engineering students.

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:30.988
And I was scared. (Laughter)

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:34.659
Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.366
and their big books and their big, unfamiliar words.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.571
But as these conversations unfolded,

00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:44.479
I experienced what Alice must have when she went down

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.656
that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.

00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:51.267
That's just how I felt as I had those conversations

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.016
with the students. I was amazed at the ideas

00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:58.982
that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well.

00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:01.613
And I believe the key to opening that door

00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:02.903
is great communication.

00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:05.787
We desperately need great communication from our

00:01:05.787 --> 00:01:08.846
scientists and engineers in order to change the world.

00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:11.736
Our scientists and engineers are the ones

00:01:11.736 --> 00:01:14.902
that are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy

00:01:14.902 --> 00:01:17.907
to environment to health care, among others,

00:01:17.907 --> 00:01:21.069
and if we don't know about it and understand it,

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.077
then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility

00:01:24.077 --> 00:01:27.028
as non-scientists to have these interactions.

00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:30.188
But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:33.422
and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.

00:01:33.422 --> 00:01:38.901
So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:41.388
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that

00:01:41.388 --> 00:01:45.463
to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy

00:01:45.463 --> 00:01:48.063
and that your engineering is engaging.

00:01:48.063 --> 00:01:51.796
First question to answer for us: so what?

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:55.751
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.

00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:58.381
Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae,

00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:02.278
but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones

00:02:02.278 --> 00:02:06.891
because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.

00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:11.397
And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:15.273
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.

00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:18.349
Sure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.775
"space and time," which is so much more accessible to us?

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:26.923
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.

00:02:26.923 --> 00:02:29.700
Instead, as Einstein said, make everything

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.134
as simple as possible, but no simpler.

00:02:33.134 --> 00:02:35.907
You can clearly communicate your science

00:02:35.907 --> 00:02:38.594
without compromising the ideas.

00:02:38.594 --> 00:02:42.539
A few things to consider are having examples, stories

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.244
and analogies. Those are ways to engage

00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:46.426
and excite us about your content.

00:02:46.426 --> 00:02:52.739
And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.592
Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points? (Laughter)

00:02:56.592 --> 00:02:58.960
What do bullets do? Bullets kill,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.272
and they will kill your presentation.

00:03:01.272 --> 00:03:05.451
A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:09.178
on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.

00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:13.082
Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is

00:03:13.082 --> 00:03:15.964
much more effective. It's showing that the special structure

00:03:15.964 --> 00:03:19.628
of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:22.483
the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.

00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:26.163
And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence

00:03:26.163 --> 00:03:29.215
that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost,

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:32.493
and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses

00:03:32.493 --> 00:03:34.907
and create a deeper sense of understanding

00:03:34.907 --> 00:03:36.546
of what's being described.

00:03:36.546 --> 00:03:39.396
So I think these are just a few keys that can help

00:03:39.396 --> 00:03:42.918
the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland

00:03:42.918 --> 00:03:45.134
that is science and engineering.

00:03:45.134 --> 00:03:47.583
And because the engineers that I've worked with have

00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:51.383
taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd,

00:03:51.383 --> 00:03:54.336
I want to summarize with an equation. (Laughter)

00:03:54.336 --> 00:03:58.581
Take your science, subtract your bullet points

00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:01.359
and your jargon, divide by relevance,

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.806
meaning share what's relevant to the audience,

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:06.597
and multiply it by the passion that you have for

00:04:06.597 --> 00:04:08.820
this incredible work that you're doing,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.598
and that is going to equal incredible interactions

00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:14.072
that are full of understanding.

00:04:14.072 --> 00:04:17.534
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved

00:04:17.534 --> 00:04:22.630
this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me. (Laughter)

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.703
Thank you. (Applause)
