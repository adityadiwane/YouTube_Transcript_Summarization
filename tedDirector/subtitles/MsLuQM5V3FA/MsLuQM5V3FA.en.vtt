00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
By birth and by choice,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and for the past 30 years,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I've worked at Ford Motor Company.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And for most of those years,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I worried about,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
how am I going to sell more cars and trucks?

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
But today I worry about,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
What happens

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
or even quadruples?

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
My life is guided by two great passions,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
and the first is automobiles.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
I thought it was so cool as a little boy

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and leave it in the driveway.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And I decided about that time, about age 10,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
that it would be really cool if I was a test driver.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
So my parents would go to dinner.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
They'd sit down; I'd sneak out of the house.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and it was a blast.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And that went on for about two years,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
until -- I think I was about 12 --

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
my dad brought home

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
a Lincoln Mark III.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And it was snowing that day.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
So he and mom went to dinner,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and I snuck out

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
or even some figure-eights in the snow.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
My dad finished dinner early that evening.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And he was walking to the front hall

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and out the front door

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
just about the same time I hit some ice

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and met him at the front door with the car --

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
and almost ended up in the front hall.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
But I really began to love cars then.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.260
And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And even though the color was pretty hideous,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
I did love the car,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and it really cemented my love affair with cars

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
that's continued on to this day.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
But cars are really more than a passion of mine;

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
they're quite literally in my blood.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
My great grandfather was Henry Ford,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and on my mother's side,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
So when I was born,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.260
I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
But my great grandfather, Henry Ford,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
was to make people's lives better

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Because he believed that with mobility

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
comes freedom and progress.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And that's a belief that I share.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
My other great passion is the environment.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michigan

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
and then later wrote about.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And it really struck me

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
as the years went by,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
in a very negative way,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
when I would go to some stream that I'd loved,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and was used to walking through this field

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
that was once filled with fireflies,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And so even at a young age,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
that really resonated with me,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and the whole notion of environmental preservation,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
at a very basic level, sunk in with me.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
As a high-schooler, I started to read

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and Edward Abbey,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
and I really began to develop

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
a deeper appreciation of the natural world.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
But it never really occurred to me

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that my love of cars and trucks

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
would ever be in conflict with nature.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And that was true

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
until I got to college.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And when I got to college, you can imagine my surprise

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
when I would go to class

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and a number of my professors would say

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
that Ford Motor Company and my family

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.260
was everything that was wrong with our country.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
They thought that we were more interested, as an industry,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
in profits, rather than progress,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and that we filled the skies with smog --

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and frankly, we were the enemy.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
I joined Ford after college,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
after some soul searching

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
whether or not this is really the right thing to do.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
But I decided that I wanted to go

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and see if I could affect change there.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And as I look back over 30 years ago,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
it was a little naive to think at that age

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
that I could. But I wanted to.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
And I really discovered

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
that my professors weren't completely wrong.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
In fact, when I got back to Detroit,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
by those in my own company,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and certainly by those in the industry.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
I had some very interesting conversations,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
as you can imagine.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
There were some within Ford

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
who believed that all this ecological nonsense

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
should just disappear

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and that I needed to stop hanging out

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
with "environmental wackos."

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
I was considered a radical.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and told to stop associating

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
with any known or suspected environmentalists.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
(Laughter)

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Of course, I had no intention of doing that,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
and I kept speaking out about the environment,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and it really was the topic

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that we now today call sustainability.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
And in time, my views went from controversial

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
to more or less consensus today.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
I mean, I think most people in the industry

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
understand that we've got to get on with it.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
of cars and the environment --

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
not only at Ford, but really as an industry.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
We're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
And with new technology,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
we're reducing -- and I believe, someday we'll eliminate --

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
CO2 emissions.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
We're starting to sell electric cars, which is great.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
We're developing alternative powertrains

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
that are going to make cars affordable

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
in every sense of the word --

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
economically, socially

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and environmentally.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And actually, although we've got a long way to go

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and a lot of work to do,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
I can see the day where my two great passions --

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
cars and the environment --

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
actually come into harmony.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
But unfortunately,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem --

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
and as I said, we're not there yet; we've got a lot of work to do,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
but I can see where we will --

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
but even as we're in the process of doing that,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
another huge problem is looming,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and people aren't noticing.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And that is the freedom of mobility

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
that my great grandfather brought to people

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
is now being threatened, just as the environment is.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
The problem, put in its simplest terms,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
is one of mathematics.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.260
Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
and within our lifetime, that number's going to grow

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
to about nine billion.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And at that population level,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And with that growth

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
comes some severe practical problems,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
one of which is our transportation system

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
simply won't be able to deal with it.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
When we look at the population growth in terms of cars,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
it becomes even clearer.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
But with more people

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
and greater prosperity around the world,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
that number's going to grow

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
to between two and four billion cars by mid century.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
that the world has never seen before.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Now think about the impact

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
that this is going to have on our daily lives.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Today the average American

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
spends about a week a year

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
stuck in traffic jams,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and that's a huge waste of time and resources.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
But that's nothing compared

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
to what's going on

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
in the nations that are growing the fastest.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
Today the average driver in Beijing

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
has a five-hour commute.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And last summer -- many of you probably saw this --

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
there was a hundred-mile traffic jam

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
that took 11 days to clear in China.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
In the decades to come,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
75 percent of the world's population

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
will live in cities,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
and 50 of those cities

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
will be of 10 million people or more.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
So you can see the size of the issue that we're facing.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
When you factor in population growth,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
it's clear that the mobility model that we have today

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
simply will not work tomorrow.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Frankly, four billion clean cars on the road

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
are still four billion cars,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and a traffic jam with no emissions

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
is still a traffic jam.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
So, if we make no changes today,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
what does tomorrow look like?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
Well I think you probably already have the picture.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and they're really very, very inconvenient,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
but that's all they are.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
But the bigger issue

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
is that global gridlock

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
is going to stifle economic growth

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
and our ability to deliver

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
food and health care,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
particularly to people that live in city centers.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
So what's going to solve this?

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
My great grandfather once said

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
before he invented the Model T,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
"If I had asked people then what they wanted,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
they would have answered,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
'We want faster horses.'"

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
So the answer to more cars

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
is simply not to have more roads.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
When America began moving west,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
we didn't add more wagon trains,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
we built railroads.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And to connect our country after World War II,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
we didn't build more two-lane highways,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
we built the interstate highway system.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
Today we need that same leap in thinking

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
for us to create a viable future.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
We are going to build smart cars,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
but we also need to build

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
smart roads, smart parking,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
smart public transportation systems and more.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
We don't want to waste our time

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
sitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
or looking for parking spots.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
We need an integrated system

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
that uses real time data

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
without hassle or compromises for travelers.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
And frankly, that's the kind of system

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.260
that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Now the good news is some of this work has already begun

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
in different parts of the world.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
uses driverless electric vehicles

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
that can communicate with one another,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
and they go underneath the city streets.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
And up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
On New York City's 34th Street,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
gridlock will soon be replaced

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
with a connected system

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
of vehicle-specific corridors.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
to get across town in New York

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
from about an hour today at rush hour

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
to about 20 minutes.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Now if you look at Hong Kong,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
they have a very interesting system called Octopus there.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
It's a system that really ties together

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
all the transportation assets

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
into a single payment system.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
So parking garages, buses, trains,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
they all operate within the same system.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Now shared car services

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
are also springing up around the world,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
and these efforts, I think, are great.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
They're relieving congestion,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and they're frankly starting to save some fuel.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
These are all really good ideas

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
that will move us forward.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
But what really inspires me

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
is what's going to be possible

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
when our cars can begin talking to each other.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
Very soon, the same systems that we use today

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
to bring music and entertainment

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
and GPS information into our vehicles

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
are going to be used to create

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
a smart vehicle network.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Every morning I drive about 30 miles

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And every night I go home,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
my commute is a total crapshoot.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
And I often have to leave the freeway

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and look for different ways

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
for me to try and make it home.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
But very soon we're going to see the days

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
when cars are essentially talking to each other.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
it will immediately alert my car

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and tell my car to reroute itself

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
to get me home in the best possible way.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
And these systems are being tested right now,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.260
and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
But the potential of a connected car network

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
is almost limitless.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
So just imagine:

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
one day very soon,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
and your car will be connected to a smart parking system.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
So you get in your car,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
and as you get in your car,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive --

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
no more driving around looking for one,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
in today's cars in urban areas --

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
is looking for parking spots.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Or think about being in New York City

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.260
so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
Or being at a future TED Conference

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
and having your car

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
talk to the calendars of everybody here

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
and telling you all the best route to take home

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and when you should leave

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
This is the kind of technology

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
that will merge millions of individual vehicles

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
into a single system.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
So I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
to this enormous problem.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
and also fossil fuels,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
there is no one silver bullet.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
The solution is not going to be

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
more cars, more roads or a new rail system;

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
it can only be found, I believe,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
in a global network

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
of interconnected solutions.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
Now I know we can develop the technology

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
that's going to make this work,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
but we've got to be willing to get out there

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
and seek out the solutions --

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
or some other way we haven't even thought of yet;

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
must support all the future options.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
We need our best and our brightest

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
to start entertaining this issue.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
Companies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
they all need to understand

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
this is a huge business opportunity,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
as well as an enormous social problem.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
And just as these groups

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
embrace the green energy challenge --

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
and it's really been amazing to me to watch

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
how much brain power, how much money

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
and how much serious thought

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
has, really over the last three years,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
just poured into the green energy field.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
We need that same kind of passion and energy

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
to attack global gridlock.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
But we need people like all of you in this room,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
leading thinkers.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
I mean, frankly, I need all of you

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
to think about how

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
you can help solve this huge issue.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
And we need people from all walks of life;

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
not just inventors, we need policymakers

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
and government officials

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
This isn't going to be solved

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
by any one person or one group.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
It's going to really require a national energy policy,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
frankly for each country,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
because the solutions in each country are going to be different

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
based upon income levels, traffic jams

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
and also how integrated

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
the systems already are.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
But we need to get going, and we need to get going today.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
And we must have an infrastructure

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
that's designed to support

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
this flexible future.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
You know, we've come a long way.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
Since the Model T,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
most people never traveled

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
And since then,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
the automobile has allowed us the freedom

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
to choose where we live, where we work,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
where we play

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
and frankly when we just go out and want to move around.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
We don't want to regress and lose that freedom.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
We're on our way to solving --

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
and as I said earlier, I know we've got a long way to go --

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
and that's the environmental issue,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
but I believe we all must turn

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.260
all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
to help now solve this notion of global gridlock.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Because in doing so,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
which is the freedom to move

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
and move very effortlessly around the world.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
And it frankly will enhance our quality of life

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
if we fix this.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
Because, if you can envision, as I do,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
a future of zero emissions

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
and freedom to move around the country and around the world

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
like we take for granted today,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
that's worth the hard work today

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
to preserve that for tomorrow.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
I believe we're at our best

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
when we're confronted with big issues.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
This is a big one, and it won't wait.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
So let's get started now.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
Thank you.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
(Applause)
