00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.727
The urban explosion

00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:19.952
of the last years of economic boom

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:23.463
also produced dramatic marginalization,

00:00:23.463 --> 00:00:25.737
resulting in the explosion of slums

00:00:25.737 --> 00:00:28.352
in many parts of the world.

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:31.599
This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.434
surrounded by sectors of poverty

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.816
and the socioeconomic inequalities
they have engendered

00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:41.378
is really at the center of today's urban crisis.

00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:43.736
But I want to begin tonight

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:46.174
by suggesting that this urban crisis

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:50.054
is not only economic or environmental.

00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:52.952
It's particularly a cultural crisis,

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.837
a crisis of the institutions

00:00:55.837 --> 00:00:59.573
unable to reimagine the stupid ways

00:00:59.573 --> 00:01:01.997
which we have been growing,

00:01:01.997 --> 00:01:05.310
unable to challenge the oil-hungry,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.067
selfish urbanization that have perpetuated

00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:11.529
cities based on consumption,

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:16.960
from southern California to New York to Dubai.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.958
So I just really want to share with you a reflection

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.282
that the future of cities today

00:01:23.298 --> 00:01:25.989
depends less on buildings

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:28.404
and, in fact, depends more

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:33.154
on the fundamental reorganization
of socioeconomic relations,

00:01:33.154 --> 00:01:35.158
that the best ideas in the shaping

00:01:35.158 --> 00:01:36.988
of the city in the future

00:01:36.988 --> 00:01:41.037
will not come from enclaves of economic power

00:01:41.037 --> 00:01:42.415
and abundance,

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:48.046
but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:50.886
from which an urgent imagination

00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:54.910
can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.490
And let me illustrate what I mean

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.395
by understanding or engaging sites of conflict

00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:06.476
as harboring creativity, as I briefly introduce you

00:02:06.476 --> 00:02:09.009
to the Tijuana-San Diego border region,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.214
which has been the laboratory to
rethink my practice as an architect.

00:02:13.214 --> 00:02:15.726
This is the wall, the border wall,

00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:18.237
that separates San Diego and Tijuana,

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:21.078
Latin America and the United States,

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:23.115
a physical emblem

00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:25.765
of exclusionary planning policies

00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:28.276
that have perpetuated the division

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:30.709
of communities, jurisdictions

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.844
and resources across the world.

00:02:33.844 --> 00:02:36.547
In this border region, we find

00:02:36.547 --> 00:02:38.964
some of the wealthiest real estate,

00:02:38.964 --> 00:02:41.431
as I once found in the edges of San Diego,

00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:43.655
barely 20 minutes away

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:47.781
from some of the poorest 
settlements in Latin America.

00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:51.144
And while these two cities have the same population,

00:02:51.144 --> 00:02:54.980
San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.742
in the last decades,

00:02:56.742 --> 00:03:00.132
immediately thrusting us to confront

00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:02.179
the tensions and conflicts

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.927
between sprawl and density,

00:03:03.927 --> 00:03:05.918
which are at the center of today's discussion

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:08.746
about environmental sustainability.

00:03:08.746 --> 00:03:11.478
So I've been arguing in the last years

00:03:11.478 --> 00:03:15.183
that, in fact, the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot

00:03:15.183 --> 00:03:16.844
to the sprawls of San Diego

00:03:16.844 --> 00:03:20.374
when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability,

00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:22.793
that we should pay attention and learn

00:03:22.793 --> 00:03:25.106
from the many migrant communities

00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:27.621
on both sides of this border wall

00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:30.958
so that we can translate their informal processes

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.017
of urbanization.

00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:36.139
What do I mean by the informal in this case?

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.967
I'm really just talking about

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.623
the compendium of social practices of adaptation

00:03:41.623 --> 00:03:44.462
that enable many of these migrant communities

00:03:44.462 --> 00:03:49.016
to transgress imposed political and economic recipes

00:03:49.016 --> 00:03:50.569
of urbanization.

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.819
I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.194
of the bottom-up,

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:59.391
whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana

00:03:59.391 --> 00:04:03.135
that build themselves, in fact,
with the waste of San Diego,

00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:05.893
or the many migrant neighborhoods
in Southern California

00:04:05.893 --> 00:04:08.969
that have begun to be retrofitted with difference

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.626
in the last decades.

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:12.834
So I've been interested as an artist

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:15.418
in the measuring, the observation,

00:04:15.418 --> 00:04:17.690
of many of the trans-border informal flows

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.380
across this border:

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.817
in one direction, from south to north,

00:04:21.817 --> 00:04:24.410
the flow of immigrants into the United States,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.419
and from north to south the flow of waste

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.450
from southern California into Tijuana.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.718
I'm referring to the recycling

00:04:32.718 --> 00:04:36.170
of these old post-war bungalows

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.629
that Mexican contractors bring to the border

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.474
as American developers are disposing of them

00:04:42.474 --> 00:04:45.042
in the process of building a more inflated version

00:04:45.042 --> 00:04:47.118
of suburbia in the last decades.

00:04:47.118 --> 00:04:50.033
So these are houses waiting to cross the border.

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:52.385
Not only people cross the border here,

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:55.652
but entire chunks of one city move to the next,

00:04:55.652 --> 00:04:59.546
and when these houses are placed
on top of these steel frames,

00:04:59.546 --> 00:05:02.123
they leave the first floor to become the second

00:05:02.123 --> 00:05:04.177
to be in-filled with more house,

00:05:04.177 --> 00:05:05.835
with a small business.

00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:08.712
This layering of spaces and economies

00:05:08.712 --> 00:05:10.994
is very interesting to notice.

00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:13.509
But not only houses, also small debris

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.856
from one city, from San Diego, to Tijuana.

00:05:15.856 --> 00:05:18.242
Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires

00:05:18.242 --> 00:05:20.871
that are used in the slums to build retaining walls.

00:05:20.871 --> 00:05:23.224
But look at what people have done here in conditions

00:05:23.224 --> 00:05:25.452
of socioeconomic emergency.

00:05:25.452 --> 00:05:28.613
They have figured out how to peel off the tire,

00:05:28.613 --> 00:05:30.978
how to thread it and interlock it

00:05:30.978 --> 00:05:35.106
to construct a more efficient retaining wall.

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:38.318
Or the garage doors that are brought

00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:40.826
from San Diego in trucks

00:05:40.826 --> 00:05:45.555
to become the new skin of emergency housing

00:05:45.555 --> 00:05:47.394
in many of these slums

00:05:47.394 --> 00:05:49.724
surrounding the edges of Tijuana.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.140
So while, as an architect,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.067
this is a very compelling thing to witness,

00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:54.761
this creative intelligence,

00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:56.774
I also want to keep myself in check.

00:05:56.774 --> 00:05:58.810
I don't want to romanticize poverty.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.801
I just want to suggest

00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:02.942
that this informal urbanization

00:06:02.942 --> 00:06:06.541
is not just the image of precariousness,

00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:09.623
that informality here, the informal,

00:06:09.623 --> 00:06:14.153
is really a set of socioeconomic
and political procedures

00:06:14.153 --> 00:06:16.862
that we could translate as artists,

00:06:16.862 --> 00:06:19.207
that this is about a bottom-up urbanization

00:06:19.207 --> 00:06:20.732
that performs.

00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:23.558
See here, buildings are not important

00:06:23.558 --> 00:06:25.521
just for their looks,

00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:28.962
but, in fact, they are important for what they can do.

00:06:28.962 --> 00:06:32.061
They truly perform as they transform through time

00:06:32.076 --> 00:06:34.224
and as communities negotiate

00:06:34.224 --> 00:06:37.733
the spaces and boundaries and resources.

00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:40.854
So while waste flows southbound,

00:06:40.854 --> 00:06:43.382
people go north in search of dollars,

00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:45.917
and most of my research has had to do

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:49.812
with the impact of immigration

00:06:49.812 --> 00:06:52.286
in the alteration of the homogeneity

00:06:52.286 --> 00:06:54.612
of many neighborhoods in the United States,

00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:56.576
particularly in San Diego.

00:06:56.576 --> 00:06:58.961
And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest

00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:01.614
that the future of Southern California

00:07:01.614 --> 00:07:04.137
depends on the retrofitting

00:07:04.137 --> 00:07:07.344
of the large urbanization -- I mean, on steroids --

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.832
with the small programs,

00:07:09.832 --> 00:07:11.608
social and economic.

00:07:11.608 --> 00:07:13.713
I'm referring to how immigrants,

00:07:13.713 --> 00:07:15.511
when they come to these neighborhoods,

00:07:15.511 --> 00:07:18.562
they begin to alter the one-dimensionality

00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:20.544
of parcels and properties

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:24.931
into more socially and
economically complex systems,

00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:28.668
as they begin to plug an
informal economy into a garage,

00:07:28.668 --> 00:07:30.982
or as they build an illegal granny flat

00:07:30.982 --> 00:07:33.484
to support an extended family.

00:07:33.484 --> 00:07:38.559
This socioeconomic entrepreneurship

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:41.662
on the ground within these neighborhoods

00:07:41.662 --> 00:07:45.208
really begins to suggest ways of translating that

00:07:45.208 --> 00:07:49.355
into new, inclusive and more equitable

00:07:49.355 --> 00:07:51.394
land use policies.

00:07:51.394 --> 00:07:54.125
So many stories emerge from these dynamics

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:56.986
of alteration of space,

00:07:56.986 --> 00:07:58.834
such as &amp;quot;the informal Buddha,&amp;quot;

00:07:58.834 --> 00:08:01.407
which tells the story of a small house

00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:04.408
that saved itself, it did not travel to Mexico,

00:08:04.408 --> 00:08:06.412
but it was retrofitted in the end

00:08:06.412 --> 00:08:08.662
into a Buddhist temple,

00:08:08.662 --> 00:08:09.891
and in so doing,

00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:13.147
this small house transforms or mutates

00:08:13.147 --> 00:08:14.845
from a singular dwelling

00:08:14.845 --> 00:08:17.667
into a small, or a micro, socioeconomic

00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:21.623
and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood.

00:08:21.623 --> 00:08:24.370
So these action neighborhoods, as I call them,

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.398
really become the inspiration

00:08:26.398 --> 00:08:29.794
to imagine other interpretations of citizenship

00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:31.974
that have less to do, in fact,

00:08:31.974 --> 00:08:33.956
with belonging to the nation-state,

00:08:33.956 --> 00:08:37.802
and more with upholding the notion of citizenship

00:08:37.802 --> 00:08:39.696
as a creative act

00:08:39.696 --> 00:08:42.547
that reorganizes institutional protocols

00:08:42.547 --> 00:08:44.877
in the spaces of the city.

00:08:44.877 --> 00:08:47.732
As an artist, I've been interested, in fact,

00:08:47.732 --> 00:08:50.461
in the visualization of citizenship,

00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:54.026
the gathering of many anecdotes, urban stories,

00:08:54.026 --> 00:08:57.094
in order to narrativize the relationship

00:08:57.094 --> 00:09:00.224
between social processes and spaces.

00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:03.343
This is a story of a group of teenagers

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:06.266
that one night, a few months ago,

00:09:06.266 --> 00:09:09.198
decided to invade this space under the freeway

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:12.412
to begin constructing their own skateboard park.

00:09:12.412 --> 00:09:15.553
With shovels in hand, they started to dig.

00:09:15.553 --> 00:09:18.410
Two weeks later, the police stopped them.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.111
They barricaded the place,

00:09:20.111 --> 00:09:22.063
and the teenagers were evicted,

00:09:22.063 --> 00:09:24.776
and the teenagers decided to fight back,

00:09:24.776 --> 00:09:27.243
not with bank cards or slogans

00:09:27.243 --> 00:09:29.996
but with constructing a critical process.

00:09:29.996 --> 00:09:32.711
The first thing they did was to recognize

00:09:32.711 --> 00:09:35.691
the specificity of political jurisdiction

00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:38.418
inscribed in that empty space.

00:09:38.418 --> 00:09:40.496
They found out that they had been lucky

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:42.310
because they had not begun to dig

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.693
under Caltrans territoy.

00:09:44.693 --> 00:09:47.925
Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway,

00:09:47.925 --> 00:09:50.490
so it would have been very
difficult to negotiate with them.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.370
They were lucky, they said, because they began

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.777
to dig under an arm of the freeway

00:09:54.777 --> 00:09:57.040
that belongs to the local municipality.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.939
They were also lucky, they said,

00:09:58.939 --> 00:10:00.677
because they began to dig in a sort of

00:10:00.677 --> 00:10:03.019
Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction,

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.496
between port authority, airport authority,

00:10:06.496 --> 00:10:09.309
two city districts, and a review board.

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:12.087
All these red lines are the invisible

00:10:12.087 --> 00:10:14.665
political institutions that were inscribed

00:10:14.665 --> 00:10:17.699
in that leftover empty space.

00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:20.654
With this knowledge, these teenagers

00:10:20.654 --> 00:10:23.337
as skaters confronted the city.

00:10:23.337 --> 00:10:25.491
They came to the city attorney's office.

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:27.440
The city attorney told them

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.336
that in order to continue the negotiation

00:10:29.336 --> 00:10:31.279
they had to become an NGO,

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:33.540
and of course they didn't know what an NGO was.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.479
They had to talk to their friends in Seattle

00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:38.390
who had gone through the same experience.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.574
And they began to realize the necessity

00:10:40.574 --> 00:10:42.913
to organize themselves even deeper

00:10:42.913 --> 00:10:47.047
and began to fundraise, to organize budgets,

00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:49.371
to really be aware of all the knowledge

00:10:49.371 --> 00:10:52.604
embedded in the urban code in San Diego

00:10:52.604 --> 00:10:54.822
so that they could begin to redefine

00:10:54.822 --> 00:10:58.642
the very meaning of public space in the city,

00:10:58.642 --> 00:11:01.134
expanding it to other categories.

00:11:01.134 --> 00:11:03.769
At the end, the teenagers won the case

00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:06.242
with that evidence, and they were able

00:11:06.242 --> 00:11:08.857
to construct their skateboard park

00:11:08.857 --> 00:11:10.467
under that freeway.

00:11:10.467 --> 00:11:12.912
Now for many of you, this story

00:11:12.912 --> 00:11:15.152
might seem trivial or naive.

00:11:15.152 --> 00:11:17.101
For me as an architect, it has become

00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:19.439
a fundamental narrative,

00:11:19.439 --> 00:11:21.292
because it begins to teach me

00:11:21.292 --> 00:11:23.247
that this micro-community

00:11:23.247 --> 00:11:26.739
not only designed another category of public space

00:11:26.739 --> 00:11:30.544
but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols

00:11:30.544 --> 00:11:33.641
that were necessary to be inscribed in that space

00:11:33.641 --> 00:11:36.602
for its long-term sustainability.

00:11:36.602 --> 00:11:38.087
They also taught me

00:11:38.087 --> 00:11:40.122
that similar to the migrant communities

00:11:40.122 --> 00:11:41.651
on both sides of the border,

00:11:41.651 --> 00:11:45.368
they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool,

00:11:45.368 --> 00:11:47.172
because they had to produce a process

00:11:47.172 --> 00:11:50.789
that enabled them to reorganize resources

00:11:50.789 --> 00:11:52.623
and the politics of the city.

00:11:52.623 --> 00:11:55.148
In that act, that informal,

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:57.403
bottom-up act of transgression,

00:11:57.403 --> 00:11:59.552
really began to trickle up

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.670
to transform top-down policy.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:07.173
Now this journey from the bottom-up

00:12:07.173 --> 00:12:09.353
to the transformation of the top-down

00:12:09.353 --> 00:12:11.871
is where I find hope today.

00:12:11.871 --> 00:12:16.120
And I'm thinking of how these modest alterations

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.063
with space and with policy

00:12:19.063 --> 00:12:21.088
in many cities in the world,

00:12:21.088 --> 00:12:23.802
in primarily the urgency

00:12:23.802 --> 00:12:26.076
of a collective imagination

00:12:26.076 --> 00:12:27.550
as these communities

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.957
reimagine their own forms of governance,

00:12:29.957 --> 00:12:32.648
social organization, and infrastructure,

00:12:32.648 --> 00:12:34.576
really is at the center

00:12:34.576 --> 00:12:36.664
of the new formation

00:12:36.664 --> 00:12:39.976
of democratic politics of the urban.

00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:43.253
It is, in fact, this that could become the framework

00:12:43.253 --> 00:12:46.274
for producing new social

00:12:46.274 --> 00:12:49.330
and economic justice in the city.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.948
I want to say this and emphasize it,

00:12:50.948 --> 00:12:54.597
because this is the only way I see

00:12:54.597 --> 00:12:56.810
that can enable us to move

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.035
from urbanizations of consumption

00:13:00.035 --> 00:13:03.393
to neighborhoods of production today.

00:13:03.393 --> 00:13:05.281
Thank you.

00:13:05.281 --> 00:13:09.281
(Applause)
