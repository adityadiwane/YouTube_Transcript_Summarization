00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:14.688
I am a writer.

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:18.448
Writing books is my profession
but it's more than that, of course.

00:00:18.472 --> 00:00:22.372
It is also my great lifelong
love and fascination.

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:25.287
And I don't expect
that that's ever going to change.

00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:30.322
But, that said, something
kind of peculiar has happened recently

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:32.571
in my life and in my career,

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:37.338
which has caused me to have to recalibrate
my whole relationship with this work.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:40.972
And the peculiar thing
is that I recently wrote this book,

00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:42.940
this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love"

00:00:42.964 --> 00:00:47.505
which, decidedly
unlike any of my previous books,

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:50.573
went out in the world
for some reason, and became this big,

00:00:50.597 --> 00:00:53.939
mega-sensation, international
bestseller thing.

00:00:53.963 --> 00:00:57.005
The result of which
is that everywhere I go now,

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:59.605
people treat me like I'm doomed.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.487
Seriously -- doomed, doomed!

00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:05.178
Like, they come up to me now,
all worried, and they say,

00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:09.376
"Aren't you afraid you're never
going to be able to top that?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.622
Aren't you afraid you're going
to keep writing for your whole life

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:14.789
and you're never again
going to create a book

00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:17.355
that anybody in the world
cares about at all,

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.855
ever again?"

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.204
So that's reassuring, you know.

00:01:22.228 --> 00:01:25.015
But it would be worse,
except for that I happen to remember

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.274
that over 20 years ago,
when I was a teenager,

00:01:28.298 --> 00:01:31.421
when I first started telling people
that I wanted to be a writer,

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:33.992
I was met with this same
sort of fear-based reaction.

00:01:34.016 --> 00:01:37.826
And people would say, "Aren't you afraid
you're never going to have any success?

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.773
Aren't you afraid the humiliation
of rejection will kill you?

00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:44.257
Aren't you afraid that you're going
to work your whole life at this craft

00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:46.137
and nothing's ever going to come of it

00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:48.796
and you're going to die
on a scrap heap of broken dreams

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.287
with your mouth filled
with bitter ash of failure?"

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.640
(Laughter)

00:01:52.664 --> 00:01:54.492
Like that, you know.

00:01:54.516 --> 00:01:59.653
The answer -- the short answer
to all those questions is, "Yes."

00:01:59.677 --> 00:02:01.953
Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.

00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:03.218
And I always have been.

00:02:03.242 --> 00:02:05.528
And I'm afraid of many,
many more things besides

00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:07.453
that people can't even guess at,

00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:11.434
like seaweed and other
things that are scary.

00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:13.685
But, when it comes to writing,

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.669
the thing that I've been sort of thinking
about lately, and wondering about lately,

00:02:17.693 --> 00:02:18.843
is why?

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:20.137
You know, is it rational?

00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:22.384
Is it logical that anybody
should be expected

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:27.036
to be afraid of the work that they feel
they were put on this Earth to do.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.436
And what is it specifically
about creative ventures

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.908
that seems to make us really nervous
about each other's mental health

00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:37.935
in a way that other careers
kind of don't do, you know?

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.958
Like my dad, for example,
was a chemical engineer

00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:45.335
and I don't recall once in his 40 years
of chemical engineering

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.017
anybody asking him if he was afraid
to be a chemical engineer, you know?

00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:54.828
"That chemical-engineering block,
John, how's it going?"

00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:56.992
It just didn't come up
like that, you know?

00:02:57.016 --> 00:03:00.826
But to be fair,
chemical engineers as a group

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.374
haven't really earned
a reputation over the centuries

00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:06.070
for being alcoholic manic-depressives.

00:03:06.094 --> 00:03:07.518
(Laughter)

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:10.352
We writers, we kind of do have
that reputation,

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:14.335
and not just writers,
but creative people across all genres,

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:19.036
it seems, have this reputation
for being enormously mentally unstable.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.852
And all you have to do is look
at the very grim death count

00:03:22.876 --> 00:03:26.435
in the 20th century alone,
of really magnificent creative minds

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.561
who died young and often
at their own hands, you know?

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:32.827
And even the ones
who didn't literally commit suicide

00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:36.203
seem to be really undone
by their gifts, you know.

00:03:36.227 --> 00:03:39.102
Norman Mailer, just before he died,
last interview, he said,

00:03:39.126 --> 00:03:43.203
"Every one of my books
has killed me a little more."

00:03:43.227 --> 00:03:46.802
An extraordinary statement
to make about your life's work.

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:49.762
But we don't even blink
when we hear somebody say this,

00:03:49.786 --> 00:03:52.368
because we've heard
that kind of stuff for so long

00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:56.369
and somehow we've completely
internalized and accepted collectively

00:03:56.393 --> 00:04:01.036
this notion that creativity and suffering
are somehow inherently linked

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.102
and that artistry, in the end,
will always ultimately lead to anguish.

00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:08.793
And the question that I want
to ask everybody here today

00:04:08.817 --> 00:04:11.310
is are you guys all cool with that idea?

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.517
Are you comfortable with that?

00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:16.541
Because you look at it
even from an inch away and, you know --

00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:19.668
I'm not at all comfortable
with that assumption.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.154
I think it's odious.

00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:23.107
And I also think it's dangerous,

00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:26.036
and I don't want to see it
perpetuated into the next century.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.910
I think it's better if we encourage
our great creative minds to live.

00:04:29.934 --> 00:04:35.685
And I definitely know that,
in my case -- in my situation --

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:40.848
it would be very dangerous for me to start
sort of leaking down that dark path

00:04:40.872 --> 00:04:42.069
of assumption,

00:04:42.093 --> 00:04:46.222
particularly given the circumstance
that I'm in right now in my career.

00:04:46.246 --> 00:04:48.761
Which is -- you know, like check it out,

00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:50.976
I'm pretty young,
I'm only about 40 years old.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.270
I still have maybe another four
decades of work left in me.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:58.787
And it's exceedingly likely that anything
I write from this point forward

00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:01.764
is going to be judged by the world
as the work that came after

00:05:01.788 --> 00:05:05.087
the freakish success
of my last book, right?

00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:09.049
I should just put it bluntly, because
we're all sort of friends here now --

00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:13.330
it's exceedingly likely
that my greatest success is behind me.

00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:15.530
So Jesus, what a thought!

00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:17.960
That's the kind of thought
that could lead a person

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.588
to start drinking gin
at nine o'clock in the morning,

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:23.525
and I don't want to go there.

00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:24.583
(Laughter)

00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:27.037
I would prefer to keep doing
this work that I love.

00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:30.375
And so, the question becomes, how?

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:33.259
And so, it seems to me,
upon a lot of reflection,

00:05:33.283 --> 00:05:36.624
that the way that I have to work now,
in order to continue writing,

00:05:36.648 --> 00:05:40.458
is that I have to create some sort of
protective psychological construct, right?

00:05:40.482 --> 00:05:43.958
I have to sort of find some way
to have a safe distance

00:05:43.982 --> 00:05:48.843
between me, as I am writing,
and my very natural anxiety

00:05:48.867 --> 00:05:52.708
about what the reaction to that writing
is going to be, from now on.

00:05:52.732 --> 00:05:55.119
And, as I've been looking,
over the last year,

00:05:55.143 --> 00:05:56.976
for models for how to do that,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.124
I've been sort of looking across time,

00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:01.226
and I've been trying
to find other societies

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.976
to see if they might have had
better and saner ideas than we have

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.203
about how to help creative people

00:06:07.227 --> 00:06:11.009
sort of manage the inherent
emotional risks of creativity.

00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:16.024
And that search has led me
to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

00:06:16.048 --> 00:06:18.715
So stay with me, because
it does circle around and back.

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:20.871
But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome --

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:23.437
people did not happen
to believe that creativity

00:06:23.461 --> 00:06:25.855
came from human beings back then, OK?

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:30.314
People believed that creativity
was this divine attendant spirit

00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:34.315
that came to human beings
from some distant and unknowable source,

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.764
for distant and unknowable reasons.

00:06:36.788 --> 00:06:42.015
The Greeks famously called these divine
attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.115
Socrates, famously, believed
that he had a daemon

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.572
who spoke wisdom to him from afar.

00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:49.189
The Romans had the same idea,

00:06:49.213 --> 00:06:53.799
but they called that sort of disembodied
creative spirit a genius.

00:06:53.823 --> 00:06:56.538
Which is great, because the Romans
did not actually think

00:06:56.562 --> 00:06:59.332
that a genius was a particularly
clever individual.

00:06:59.356 --> 00:07:03.015
They believed that a genius was this,
sort of magical divine entity,

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:08.337
who was believed to literally
live in the walls of an artist's studio,

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:10.881
kind of like Dobby the house elf,

00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:12.419
and who would come out

00:07:12.443 --> 00:07:15.045
and sort of invisibly assist
the artist with their work

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:17.514
and would shape the outcome of that work.

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:21.396
So brilliant -- there it is, right there,
that distance that I'm talking about --

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.598
that psychological construct to protect
you from the results of your work.

00:07:25.622 --> 00:07:29.206
And everyone knew that this
is how it functioned, right?

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.897
So the ancient artist was protected
from certain things,

00:07:31.921 --> 00:07:34.298
like, for example,
too much narcissism, right?

00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:37.513
If your work was brilliant,
you couldn't take all the credit for it,

00:07:37.537 --> 00:07:41.232
everybody knew that you had this
disembodied genius who had helped you.

00:07:41.256 --> 00:07:44.601
If your work bombed,
not entirely your fault, you know?

00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:47.119
Everyone knew your genius
was kind of lame.

00:07:47.143 --> 00:07:48.177
(Laughter)

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:51.699
And this is how people
thought about creativity in the West

00:07:51.723 --> 00:07:53.031
for a really long time.

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:55.631
And then the Renaissance came
and everything changed,

00:07:55.655 --> 00:07:57.946
and we had this big idea,
and the big idea was,

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.165
let's put the individual human being
at the center of the universe

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.730
above all gods and mysteries,

00:08:02.754 --> 00:08:05.039
and there's no more room
for mystical creatures

00:08:05.063 --> 00:08:06.831
who take dictation from the divine.

00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:08.966
And it's the beginning
of rational humanism,

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.133
and people started
to believe that creativity

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:13.497
came completely from the self
of the individual.

00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:15.347
And for the first time in history,

00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:20.458
you start to hear people referring
to this or that artist as being a genius,

00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.299
rather than having a genius.

00:08:22.323 --> 00:08:25.623
And I got to tell you,
I think that was a huge error.

00:08:25.647 --> 00:08:29.869
You know, I think that allowing
somebody, one mere person

00:08:29.893 --> 00:08:32.632
to believe that he or she is like,
the vessel,

00:08:32.656 --> 00:08:35.228
you know, like the font
and the essence and the source

00:08:35.252 --> 00:08:38.581
of all divine, creative,
unknowable, eternal mystery

00:08:38.605 --> 00:08:44.666
is just a smidge too much responsibility
to put on one fragile, human psyche.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.181
It's like asking somebody
to swallow the sun.

00:08:48.205 --> 00:08:50.832
It just completely warps
and distorts egos,

00:08:50.856 --> 00:08:54.382
and it creates all these unmanageable
expectations about performance.

00:08:54.406 --> 00:08:56.381
And I think the pressure of that

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:59.598
has been killing off our artists
for the last 500 years.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.263
And, if this is true,

00:09:02.287 --> 00:09:03.849
and I think it is true,

00:09:03.873 --> 00:09:06.714
the question becomes, what now?

00:09:06.738 --> 00:09:08.583
Can we do this differently?

00:09:08.607 --> 00:09:11.979
Maybe go back to some more
ancient understanding

00:09:12.003 --> 00:09:16.480
about the relationship between humans
and the creative mystery.

00:09:16.504 --> 00:09:17.833
Maybe not.

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:21.715
Maybe we can't just erase 500 years
of rational humanistic thought

00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:23.873
in one 18 minute speech.

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.582
And there's probably
people in this audience

00:09:26.606 --> 00:09:30.697
who would raise really
legitimate scientific suspicions

00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:33.076
about the notion of, basically, fairies

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.064
who follow people around rubbing fairy
juice on their projects and stuff.

00:09:38.088 --> 00:09:42.381
I'm not, probably, going to bring
you all along with me on this.

00:09:42.405 --> 00:09:45.166
But the question
that I kind of want to pose is --

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.363
you know, why not?

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:49.285
Why not think about it this way?

00:09:49.309 --> 00:09:53.397
Because it makes as much sense
as anything else I have ever heard

00:09:53.421 --> 00:09:57.353
in terms of explaining
the utter maddening capriciousness

00:09:57.377 --> 00:09:58.898
of the creative process.

00:09:58.922 --> 00:10:02.113
A process which, as anybody
who has ever tried to make something --

00:10:02.137 --> 00:10:04.203
which is to say basically
everyone here ---

00:10:04.227 --> 00:10:07.314
knows does not always behave rationally.

00:10:07.338 --> 00:10:11.897
And, in fact, can sometimes
feel downright paranormal.

00:10:11.921 --> 00:10:13.673
I had this encounter recently

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:17.382
where I met the extraordinary
American poet Ruth Stone,

00:10:17.406 --> 00:10:20.217
who's now in her 90s,
but she's been a poet her entire life

00:10:20.241 --> 00:10:23.447
and she told me that when
she was growing up in rural Virginia,

00:10:23.471 --> 00:10:25.329
she would be out working in the fields,

00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:28.205
and she said she would feel
and hear a poem

00:10:28.229 --> 00:10:30.212
coming at her from over the landscape.

00:10:30.236 --> 00:10:33.369
And she said it was like
a thunderous train of air.

00:10:33.393 --> 00:10:36.197
And it would come barreling down
at her over the landscape.

00:10:36.221 --> 00:10:39.699
And she felt it coming, because it
would shake the earth under her feet.

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:42.498
She knew that she had
only one thing to do at that point,

00:10:42.522 --> 00:10:44.749
and that was to,
in her words, "run like hell."

00:10:44.773 --> 00:10:46.781
And she would run like hell to the house

00:10:46.805 --> 00:10:48.967
and she would be getting
chased by this poem,

00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:52.597
and the whole deal was that she had
to get to a piece of paper and a pencil

00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:56.002
fast enough so that when it thundered
through her, she could collect it

00:10:56.026 --> 00:10:57.208
and grab it on the page.

00:10:57.232 --> 00:10:59.321
And other times
she wouldn't be fast enough,

00:10:59.345 --> 00:11:02.548
so she'd be running and running,
and she wouldn't get to the house

00:11:02.572 --> 00:11:05.386
and the poem would barrel
through her and she would miss it

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.030
and she said it would continue
on across the landscape,

00:11:08.054 --> 00:11:10.138
looking, as she put it "for another poet."

00:11:10.162 --> 00:11:11.808
And then there were these times --

00:11:11.832 --> 00:11:13.687
this is the piece I never forgot --

00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:17.169
she said that there were moments
where she would almost miss it, right?

00:11:17.193 --> 00:11:20.220
So, she's running to the house
and she's looking for the paper

00:11:20.244 --> 00:11:21.837
and the poem passes through her,

00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:24.471
and she grabs a pencil just
as it's going through her,

00:11:24.495 --> 00:11:27.839
and then she said, it was like
she would reach out with her other hand

00:11:27.863 --> 00:11:29.146
and she would catch it.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.127
She would catch the poem by its tail,

00:11:31.151 --> 00:11:33.705
and she would pull it
backwards into her body

00:11:33.729 --> 00:11:35.565
as she was transcribing on the page.

00:11:35.589 --> 00:11:40.420
And in these instances, the poem would
come up on the page perfect and intact

00:11:40.444 --> 00:11:43.825
but backwards, from the last
word to the first.

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:45.537
(Laughter)

00:11:45.561 --> 00:11:50.254
So when I heard that I was like --
that's uncanny,

00:11:50.278 --> 00:11:52.755
that's exactly what my creative
process is like.

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:56.368
(Laughter)

00:11:56.392 --> 00:11:59.734
That's not at all what my creative
process is -- I'm not the pipeline!

00:11:59.758 --> 00:12:01.788
I'm a mule, and the way
that I have to work

00:12:01.812 --> 00:12:04.055
is I have to get up
at the same time every day,

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:06.889
and sweat and labor and barrel
through it really awkwardly.

00:12:06.913 --> 00:12:08.752
But even I, in my mulishness,

00:12:08.776 --> 00:12:12.620
even I have brushed
up against that thing, at times.

00:12:12.644 --> 00:12:14.883
And I would imagine
that a lot of you have too.

00:12:14.907 --> 00:12:18.188
You know, even I have had work
or ideas come through me from a source

00:12:18.212 --> 00:12:20.699
that I honestly cannot identify.

00:12:20.723 --> 00:12:22.295
And what is that thing?

00:12:22.319 --> 00:12:26.333
And how are we to relate to it in a way
that will not make us lose our minds,

00:12:26.357 --> 00:12:29.219
but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?

00:12:29.243 --> 00:12:32.998
And for me, the best contemporary
example that I have of how to do that

00:12:33.022 --> 00:12:35.330
is the musician Tom Waits,

00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:39.871
who I got to interview several years ago
on a magazine assignment.

00:12:39.895 --> 00:12:41.372
And we were talking about this,

00:12:41.396 --> 00:12:44.933
and you know, Tom, for most of his life,
he was pretty much the embodiment

00:12:44.957 --> 00:12:47.053
of the tormented
contemporary modern artist,

00:12:47.077 --> 00:12:49.380
trying to control and manage and dominate

00:12:49.404 --> 00:12:51.854
these sort of uncontrollable
creative impulses

00:12:51.878 --> 00:12:53.741
that were totally internalized.

00:12:53.765 --> 00:12:55.746
But then he got older, he got calmer,

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.669
and one day he was driving down
the freeway in Los Angeles,

00:12:58.693 --> 00:13:00.605
and this is when it all changed for him.

00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:02.695
And he's speeding along,
and all of a sudden

00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:06.241
he hears this little fragment of melody,

00:13:06.265 --> 00:13:10.270
that comes into his head as inspiration
often comes, elusive and tantalizing,

00:13:10.294 --> 00:13:12.398
and he wants it, it's gorgeous,

00:13:12.422 --> 00:13:14.723
and he longs for it,
but he has no way to get it.

00:13:14.747 --> 00:13:17.898
He doesn't have a piece of paper,
or a pencil, or a tape recorder.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.982
So he starts to feel all of that old
anxiety start to rise in him

00:13:21.006 --> 00:13:22.747
like, "I'm going to lose this thing,

00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:24.867
and I'll be be haunted
by this song forever.

00:13:24.891 --> 00:13:26.796
I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.830
And instead of panicking, he just stopped.

00:13:28.854 --> 00:13:32.972
He just stopped that whole mental process
and he did something completely novel.

00:13:32.996 --> 00:13:35.455
He just looked up at the sky, and he said,

00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:38.469
"Excuse me, can you not
see that I'm driving?"

00:13:38.493 --> 00:13:42.170
(Laughter)

00:13:42.194 --> 00:13:44.904
"Do I look like I can write
down a song right now?

00:13:44.928 --> 00:13:48.749
If you really want to exist,
come back at a more opportune moment

00:13:48.773 --> 00:13:50.411
when I can take care of you.

00:13:50.435 --> 00:13:53.488
Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.

00:13:53.512 --> 00:13:56.784
Go bother Leonard Cohen."

00:13:56.808 --> 00:13:59.916
And his whole work process
changed after that.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.524
Not the work, the work was still
oftentimes as dark as ever.

00:14:03.548 --> 00:14:06.583
But the process, and the heavy
anxiety around it

00:14:06.607 --> 00:14:09.530
was released when he took
the genie, the genius out of him

00:14:09.554 --> 00:14:13.441
where it was causing nothing but trouble,
and released it back where it came from,

00:14:13.465 --> 00:14:17.102
and realized that this didn't have to be
this internalized, tormented thing.

00:14:17.126 --> 00:14:20.240
It could be this peculiar,
wondrous, bizarre collaboration,

00:14:20.264 --> 00:14:24.372
kind of conversation between
Tom and the strange, external thing

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:25.875
that was not quite Tom.

00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:29.312
When I heard that story,
it started to shift a little bit

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:32.341
the way that I worked too,
and this idea already saved me once.

00:14:32.365 --> 00:14:35.469
It saved me when I was in the middle
of writing "Eat, Pray, Love,"

00:14:35.493 --> 00:14:38.002
and I fell into one of those
sort of pits of despair

00:14:38.026 --> 00:14:41.482
that we all fall into when we're working
on something and it's not coming

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:45.666
and you start to think this is going to be
a disaster, the worst book ever written.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.040
Not just bad, but the worst
book ever written.

00:14:48.064 --> 00:14:51.455
And I started to think I should
just dump this project.

00:14:51.479 --> 00:14:54.530
But then I remembered Tom
talking to the open air

00:14:54.554 --> 00:14:56.578
and I tried it.

00:14:56.602 --> 00:14:59.070
So I just lifted my face
up from the manuscript

00:14:59.094 --> 00:15:02.000
and I directed my comments
to an empty corner of the room.

00:15:02.024 --> 00:15:05.578
And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing,

00:15:05.602 --> 00:15:08.776
you and I both know
that if this book isn't brilliant

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.577
that is not entirely my fault, right?

00:15:10.601 --> 00:15:13.833
Because you can see that I am putting
everything I have into this,

00:15:13.857 --> 00:15:15.472
I don't have any more than this.

00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:19.281
If you want it to be better, you've got
to show up and do your part of the deal.

00:15:19.305 --> 00:15:22.122
But if you don't do that,
you know what, the hell with it.

00:15:22.146 --> 00:15:24.828
I'm going to keep writing anyway
because that's my job.

00:15:24.852 --> 00:15:27.288
And I would please
like the record to reflect today

00:15:27.312 --> 00:15:29.310
that I showed up for my part of the job."

00:15:29.334 --> 00:15:32.325
(Laughter)

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:34.412
Because --

00:15:34.436 --> 00:15:36.486
(Applause)

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.658
Because in the end it's like this, OK --

00:15:38.682 --> 00:15:41.059
centuries ago in the deserts
of North Africa,

00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:45.726
people used to gather for these moonlight
dances of sacred dance and music

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.430
that would go on for hours
and hours, until dawn.

00:15:48.454 --> 00:15:51.674
They were always magnificent,
because the dancers were professionals

00:15:51.698 --> 00:15:53.128
and they were terrific, right?

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:56.449
But every once in a while, very rarely,
something would happen,

00:15:56.473 --> 00:15:59.961
and one of these performers
would actually become transcendent.

00:15:59.985 --> 00:16:02.245
And I know you know
what I'm talking about,

00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:05.065
because I know you've all seen,
at some point in your life,

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:06.365
a performance like this.

00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:08.294
It was like time would stop,

00:16:08.318 --> 00:16:11.223
and the dancer would sort of step
through some kind of portal

00:16:11.247 --> 00:16:13.127
and he wasn't doing anything different

00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:15.160
than he had ever done,
1,000 nights before,

00:16:15.184 --> 00:16:16.911
but everything would align.

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:20.078
And all of a sudden, he would
no longer appear to be merely human.

00:16:20.102 --> 00:16:22.477
He would be lit from within,
and lit from below

00:16:22.501 --> 00:16:26.267
and all lit up on fire with divinity.

00:16:26.291 --> 00:16:28.412
And when this happened, back then,

00:16:28.436 --> 00:16:32.628
people knew it for what it was,
you know, they called it by its name.

00:16:32.652 --> 00:16:35.795
They would put their hands together
and they would start to chant,

00:16:35.819 --> 00:16:39.360
"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."

00:16:39.384 --> 00:16:42.462
That's God, you know.

00:16:42.486 --> 00:16:45.142
Curious historical footnote:

00:16:45.166 --> 00:16:49.983
when the Moors invaded southern Spain,
they took this custom with them

00:16:50.007 --> 00:16:52.293
and the pronunciation
changed over the centuries

00:16:52.317 --> 00:16:55.093
from "Allah, Allah, Allah,"
to "Olé, olé, olé,"

00:16:55.117 --> 00:16:58.267
which you still hear in bullfights
and in flamenco dances.

00:16:58.291 --> 00:17:01.920
In Spain, when a performer has done
something impossible and magic,

00:17:01.944 --> 00:17:05.069
"Allah, olé, olé, Allah,
magnificent, bravo,"

00:17:05.093 --> 00:17:07.460
incomprehensible, there it is
-- a glimpse of God.

00:17:08.547 --> 00:17:10.645
Which is great, because we need that.

00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:14.496
But, the tricky bit
comes the next morning,

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.923
for the dancer himself,
when he wakes up and discovers

00:17:17.947 --> 00:17:21.370
that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m.,
and he's no longer a glimpse of God.

00:17:21.394 --> 00:17:24.862
He's just an aging mortal
with really bad knees,

00:17:24.886 --> 00:17:29.102
and maybe he's never going
to ascend to that height again.

00:17:29.126 --> 00:17:32.829
And maybe nobody will ever chant
God's name again as he spins,

00:17:32.853 --> 00:17:35.687
and what is he then to do
with the rest of his life?

00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:37.069
This is hard.

00:17:37.093 --> 00:17:39.911
This is one of the most painful
reconciliations to make

00:17:39.935 --> 00:17:42.002
in a creative life.

00:17:42.026 --> 00:17:45.185
But maybe it doesn't have to be
quite so full of anguish

00:17:45.209 --> 00:17:48.452
if you never happened
to believe, in the first place,

00:17:48.476 --> 00:17:52.557
that the most extraordinary aspects
of your being came from you.

00:17:52.581 --> 00:17:55.418
But maybe if you just believed
that they were on loan to you

00:17:55.442 --> 00:17:59.026
from some unimaginable source
for some exquisite portion of your life

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.066
to be passed along when you're finished,

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.916
with somebody else.

00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:07.722
And, you know, if we think about it
this way, it starts to change everything.

00:18:07.746 --> 00:18:09.586
This is how I've started to think,

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.935
and this is certainly how I've been
thinking in the last few months

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:15.864
as I've been working on the book
that will soon be published,

00:18:15.888 --> 00:18:19.419
as the dangerously, frighteningly
over-anticipated follow up

00:18:19.443 --> 00:18:22.079
to my freakish success.

00:18:22.103 --> 00:18:25.002
And what I have to
sort of keep telling myself

00:18:25.026 --> 00:18:29.202
when I get really psyched out
about that is don't be afraid.

00:18:29.226 --> 00:18:32.551
Don't be daunted. Just do your job.

00:18:32.575 --> 00:18:35.671
Continue to show up for your piece of it,
whatever that might be.

00:18:35.695 --> 00:18:38.436
If your job is to dance, do your dance.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.401
If the divine, cockeyed genius
assigned to your case

00:18:42.425 --> 00:18:47.485
decides to let some sort of wonderment
be glimpsed, for just one moment

00:18:47.509 --> 00:18:50.189
through your efforts, then "Olé!"

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:53.124
And if not, do your dance anyhow.

00:18:53.148 --> 00:18:54.805
And "Olé!" to you, nonetheless.

00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:57.115
I believe this and I feel
that we must teach it.

00:18:57.139 --> 00:18:58.593
"Olé!" to you, nonetheless,

00:18:58.617 --> 00:19:01.906
just for having the sheer
human love and stubbornness

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.751
to keep showing up.

00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:05.426
Thank you.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.501
(Applause)

00:19:07.525 --> 00:19:08.992
Thank you.

00:19:09.016 --> 00:19:12.106
(Applause)

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.939
June Cohen: Olé!

00:19:13.963 --> 00:19:17.663
(Applause)
