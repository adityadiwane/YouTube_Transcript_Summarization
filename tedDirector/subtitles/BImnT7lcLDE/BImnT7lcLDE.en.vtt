00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:16.115
So I grew up in East Los Angeles,

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.286
not even realizing I was poor.

00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:22.403
My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.

00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:23.702
Everyone knew who I was,

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:27.152
so I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected,

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:29.721
and even though my dad spent most of my life

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.070
in and out of jail,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.571
I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.

00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:37.080
She worked at the local high school

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.635
as a secretary in the dean's office,

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:42.325
so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class,

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:45.163
for whatever reason, who were waiting to be disciplined.

00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:48.954
Man, her office was packed.

00:00:48.954 --> 00:00:52.751
So, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.309
outside of school,

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.226
and sometimes we're just not ready to focus.

00:00:57.226 --> 00:00:59.556
But that doesn't mean that we can't.

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:01.743
It just takes a little bit more.

00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:04.848
Like, I remember one day I found my dad

00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:07.192
convulsing, foaming at the mouth,

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.406
OD-ing on the bathroom floor.

00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:11.879
Really, do you think that doing my homework that night

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:14.391
was at the top of my priority list?

00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:15.858
Not so much.

00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:18.991
But I really needed a support network,

00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:21.316
a group of people who were going to help me

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:23.536
make sure that I wasn't going to be

00:01:23.536 --> 00:01:26.191
a victim of my own circumstance,

00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:27.805
that they were going to push me

00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:30.370
beyond what I even thought I could do.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.839
I needed teachers, in the classroom, every day,

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:37.584
who were going to say, "You can move beyond that."

00:01:37.584 --> 00:01:40.862
And unfortunately, the local junior high

00:01:40.862 --> 00:01:42.971
was not going to offer that.

00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:46.805
It was gang-infested, huge teacher turnover rate.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:49.978
So my mom said, "You're going on a bus

00:01:49.978 --> 00:01:55.191
an hour and a half away from where we live every day."

00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:57.553
So for the next two years, that's what I did.

00:01:57.553 --> 00:02:02.040
I took a school bus to the fancy side of town.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.965
And eventually, I ended up at a school

00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:06.529
where there was a mixture.

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:09.207
There were some people who were really gang-affiliated,

00:02:09.207 --> 00:02:10.672
and then there were those of us

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.666
really trying to make it to high school.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:16.169
Well, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:17.883
You had to survive.

00:02:17.883 --> 00:02:20.536
You just had to do things sometimes.

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:22.889
So there were a lot of teachers who were like,

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.315
"She's never going to make it.

00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:25.906
She has an issue with authority.

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:27.549
She's not going to go anywhere."

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.642
Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause.

00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:34.809
But then, they were very surprised

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:38.000
when I graduated from high school.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.862
I was accepted to Pepperdine University,

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:43.985
and I came back to the same school that I attended

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:45.896
to be a special ed assistant.

00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:50.449
And then I told them, "I want to be a teacher."

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.673
And boy, they were like, "What? Why?

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.193
Why would you want to do that?"

00:02:55.193 --> 00:02:57.479
So I began my teaching career

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:01.007
at the exact same middle school that I attended,

00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:04.438
and I really wanted to try to save more kids

00:03:04.438 --> 00:03:06.515
who were just like me.

00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:09.715
And so every year, I share my background with my kids,

00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:12.772
because they need to know that everyone has a story,

00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:15.139
everyone has a struggle,

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.893
and everyone needs help along the way.

00:03:18.893 --> 00:03:23.021
And I am going to be their help along the way.

00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:29.089
So as a rookie teacher, I created opportunity.

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:31.735
I had a kid one day come into my class

00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:34.943
having been stabbed the night before.

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:37.439
I was like, "You need to go to a hospital,

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.714
the school nurse, something."

00:03:40.714 --> 00:03:42.875
He's like, "No, Miss, I'm not going.

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:45.643
I need to be in class because I need to graduate."

00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:49.035
So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim

00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:50.812
of his circumstance,

00:03:50.812 --> 00:03:54.850
but we were going to push forward and keep moving on.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.740
And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.856
and getting to know exactly what they're going through,

00:04:02.856 --> 00:04:06.112
getting to know their families -- I wanted that,

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:11.592
but I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids,

00:04:11.592 --> 00:04:15.066
and teachers turning over year after year after year.

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:19.118
How do you get to build those relationships?

00:04:19.118 --> 00:04:22.705
So we created a new school.

00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:24.184
And we created

00:04:24.184 --> 00:04:27.722
the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media.

00:04:27.722 --> 00:04:31.194
And we made sure that we were still attached

00:04:31.194 --> 00:04:35.232
to our school district for funding, for support.

00:04:35.232 --> 00:04:38.349
But with that, we were going to gain freedom:

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.602
freedom to hire the teachers

00:04:40.602 --> 00:04:43.924
that we knew were going to be effective;

00:04:43.924 --> 00:04:46.664
freedom to control the curriculum

00:04:46.664 --> 00:04:52.302
so that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no;

00:04:52.302 --> 00:04:55.022
and freedom to control a budget,

00:04:55.022 --> 00:04:57.606
to spend money where it matters,

00:04:57.606 --> 00:05:01.847
not how a district or a state says you have to do it.

00:05:01.847 --> 00:05:04.150
We wanted those freedoms.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.726
But now, shifting an entire paradigm,

00:05:06.726 --> 00:05:10.871
it hasn't been an easy journey, nor is it even complete.

00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:13.221
But we had to do it.

00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:17.342
Our community deserved a new way of doing things.

00:05:17.342 --> 00:05:20.868
And as the very first pilot middle school

00:05:20.868 --> 00:05:24.093
in all of Los Angeles Unified School District,

00:05:24.093 --> 00:05:27.069
you better believe there was some opposition.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.192
And it was out of fear --

00:05:29.192 --> 00:05:32.415
fear of, well, what if they get it wrong?

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.600
Yeah, what if we get it wrong?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.854
But what if we get it right?

00:05:36.854 --> 00:05:38.929
And we did.

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:41.540
So even though teachers were against it

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.121
because we employ one-year contracts --

00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:48.190
you can't teach, or you don't want to teach,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.250
you don't get to be at my school with my kids.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:58.014
(Applause)

00:05:58.014 --> 00:06:01.686
So in our third year, how did we do it?

00:06:01.686 --> 00:06:05.117
Well, we're making school worth coming to every day.

00:06:05.117 --> 00:06:07.878
We make our kids feel like they matter to us.

00:06:07.878 --> 00:06:11.766
We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them,

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:14.351
and they use all the technology that they're used to.

00:06:14.351 --> 00:06:17.278
Laptops, computers, tablets -- you name it, they have it.

00:06:17.278 --> 00:06:21.196
Animation, software, moviemaking software, they have it all.

00:06:21.196 --> 00:06:25.009
And because we connect it to what they're doing â€”

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.211
For example, they made public service announcements

00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:29.837
for the Cancer Society.

00:06:29.837 --> 00:06:32.661
These were played in the local trolley system.

00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:34.668
Teaching elements of persuasion,

00:06:34.668 --> 00:06:37.588
it doesn't get any more real than that.

00:06:37.588 --> 00:06:39.749
Our state test scores have gone up

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:42.738
more than 80 points since we've become our own school.

00:06:42.738 --> 00:06:45.833
But it's taken all stakeholders, working together --

00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:49.016
teachers and principals on one-year contracts,

00:06:49.017 --> 00:06:52.841
working over and above and beyond their contract hours

00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:55.877
without compensation.

00:06:55.877 --> 00:06:58.096
And it takes a school board member

00:06:58.096 --> 00:07:00.048
who is going to lobby for you and say,

00:07:00.048 --> 00:07:02.476
"Know, the district is trying to impose this,

00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:05.509
but you have the freedom to do otherwise."

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.073
And it takes an active parent center

00:07:08.073 --> 00:07:12.153
who is not only there, showing a presence every day,

00:07:12.153 --> 00:07:15.020
but who is part of our governance,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.024
making decisions for their kids, our kids.

00:07:20.024 --> 00:07:22.629
Because why should our students have to go

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.608
so far away from where they live?

00:07:25.608 --> 00:07:29.332
They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood,

00:07:29.332 --> 00:07:32.505
a school that they can be proud to say they attend,

00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:36.173
and a school that the community can be proud of as well,

00:07:36.173 --> 00:07:40.371
and they need teachers to fight for them every day

00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:45.704
and empower them to move beyond their circumstances.

00:07:45.704 --> 00:07:48.420
Because it's time that kids like me

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.142
stop being the exception, and we become the norm.

00:07:53.142 --> 00:07:54.451
Thank you.

00:07:54.451 --> 00:07:58.790
(Applause)
