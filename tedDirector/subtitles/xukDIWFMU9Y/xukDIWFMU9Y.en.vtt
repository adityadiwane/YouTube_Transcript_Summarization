00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:18.414
Now, I don't usually like cartoons,

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:20.924
I don't think many of them are funny,

00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:26.147
I find them weird. But I love this cartoon from the New Yorker.

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:28.759
(Text: Never, ever think outside the box.) (Laughter)

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.228
So, the guy is telling the cat,

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:36.599
don't you dare think outside the box.

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:39.906
Well, I'm afraid I used to be the cat.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:42.964
I always wanted to be outside the box.

00:00:42.964 --> 00:00:46.446
And it's partly because I came to this field

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:51.659
from a different background, chemist and a bacterial geneticist.

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.261
So, what people were saying to me

00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:57.452
about the cause of cancer, sources of cancer,

00:00:57.452 --> 00:01:00.533
or, for that matter, why you are who you are,

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.407
didn't make sense.

00:01:02.407 --> 00:01:05.454
So, let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that

00:01:05.454 --> 00:01:08.055
and how I went about it.

00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:10.487
So, to begin with, however,

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:14.913
I have to give you a very, very quick lesson

00:01:14.913 --> 00:01:16.680
in developmental biology,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.742
with apologies to those of you who know some biology.

00:01:20.742 --> 00:01:23.756
So, when your mom and dad met,

00:01:23.756 --> 00:01:26.430
there is a fertilized egg,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.551
that round thing with that little blip.

00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:31.606
It grows and then it grows,

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:35.759
and then it makes this handsome man.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.174
(Applause)

00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:42.832
So, this guy, with all the cells in his body,

00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:47.044
all have the same genetic information.

00:01:47.044 --> 00:01:51.419
So how did his nose become his nose, his elbow his elbow,

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:53.595
and why doesn't he get up one morning

00:01:53.595 --> 00:01:56.155
and have his nose turn into his foot?

00:01:56.155 --> 00:01:59.395
It could. It has the genetic information.

00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:00.603
You all remember, dolly,

00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:03.284
it came from a single mammary cell.

00:02:03.284 --> 00:02:05.218
So, why doesn't it do it?

00:02:05.218 --> 00:02:10.721
So, have a guess of how many cells he has in his body.

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:18.123
Somewhere between 10 trillion to 70 trillion cells in his body.

00:02:18.123 --> 00:02:19.763
Trillion!

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:24.401
Now, how did these cells, all with the same genetic material,

00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:26.609
make all those tissues?

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.753
And so, the question I raised before

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:33.367
becomes even more interesting if you thought about

00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:37.953
the enormity of this in every one of your bodies.

00:02:37.953 --> 00:02:40.953
Now, the dominant cancer theory would say

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:43.265
that there is a single oncogene

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:46.969
in a single cancer cell, and it would make you

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.618
a cancer victim.

00:02:49.618 --> 00:02:53.284
Well, this did not make sense to me.

00:02:53.284 --> 00:02:56.466
Do you even know how a trillion looks?

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:58.185
Now, let's look at it.

00:02:58.185 --> 00:03:03.226
There it comes, these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes.

00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:10.044
Now, if .0001 of these cells got mutated,

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:15.301
and .00001 got cancer, you will be a lump of cancer.

00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:17.597
You will have cancer all over you. And you're not.

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:19.906
Why not?

00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:23.628
So, I decided over the years,

00:03:23.628 --> 00:03:25.556
because of a series of experiments

00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:30.436
that this is because of context and architecture.

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:32.613
And let me quickly tell you

00:03:32.613 --> 00:03:36.540
some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.451
To begin with, I came to work with this virus

00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:43.844
that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken.

00:03:43.844 --> 00:03:47.204
Rous discovered this in 1911.

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:50.769
It was the first cancer virus discovered,

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.660
and when I call it "oncogene," meaning "cancer gene."

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.572
So, he made a filtrate, he took this filter

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:02.828
which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter,

00:04:02.828 --> 00:04:06.829
and he injected it to another chicken, and he got another tumor.

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.540
So, scientists were very excited,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.708
and they said, a single oncogene can do it.

00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:14.004
All you need is a single oncogene.

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:16.899
So, they put the cells in cultures, chicken cells,

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.934
dumped the virus on it,

00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:20.383
and it would pile up,

00:04:20.383 --> 00:04:23.404
and they would say, this is malignant and this is normal.

00:04:23.404 --> 00:04:25.422
And again this didn't make sense to me.

00:04:25.422 --> 00:04:28.708
So for various reasons, we took this oncogene,

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:31.020
attached it to a blue marker,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.028
and we injected it into the embryos.

00:04:34.028 --> 00:04:38.221
Now look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo.

00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:42.500
Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.916
inside a cancer cell, and they're part of the feather.

00:04:46.916 --> 00:04:51.516
So, when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish,

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:54.228
we got a mass of blue cells.

00:04:54.228 --> 00:04:55.694
So, in the chicken you get a tumor,

00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:57.398
in the embryo you don't,

00:04:57.398 --> 00:05:01.390
you dissociate, you put it in a dish, you get another tumor.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.613
What does that mean?

00:05:02.613 --> 00:05:05.597
That means that microenvironment

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:09.606
and the context which surrounds those cells

00:05:09.606 --> 00:05:16.533
actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do.

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:19.845
Now, let's take a normal example.

00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:23.030
The normal example, let's take the human mammary gland.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.510
I work on breast cancer.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.517
So, here is a lovely human breast.

00:05:27.517 --> 00:05:29.465
And many of you know how it looks,

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:32.318
except that inside that breast, there are all these

00:05:32.318 --> 00:05:35.695
pretty, developing, tree-like structures.

00:05:35.695 --> 00:05:38.593
So, we decided that what we like to do

00:05:38.593 --> 00:05:41.553
is take just a bit of that mammary gland,

00:05:41.553 --> 00:05:43.585
which is called an "acinus,"

00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:47.226
where there are all these little things inside the breast

00:05:47.226 --> 00:05:50.769
where the milk goes, and the end of the nipple

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:54.313
comes through that little tube when the baby sucks.

00:05:54.313 --> 00:05:57.720
And we said, wonderful! Look at this pretty structure.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.489
We want to make this a structure, and ask the question,

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:03.193
how do the cells do that?

00:06:03.193 --> 00:06:04.985
So, we took the red cells --

00:06:04.985 --> 00:06:08.233
you see the red cells are surrounded by blue,

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:11.562
other cells that squeeze them, and behind it

00:06:11.562 --> 00:06:15.280
is material that people thought was mainly inert,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.877
and it was just having a structure to keep the shape,

00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:21.805
and so we first photographed it

00:06:21.805 --> 00:06:24.573
with the electron microscope years and years ago,

00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:27.629
and you see this cell is actually quite pretty.

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:30.092
It has a bottom, it has a top,

00:06:30.092 --> 00:06:32.773
it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk,

00:06:32.773 --> 00:06:35.965
because it just came from an early pregnant mouse.

00:06:35.965 --> 00:06:38.292
You take these cells, you put them in a dish,

00:06:38.292 --> 00:06:41.637
and within three days, they look like that.

00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:44.797
They completely forget.

00:06:44.797 --> 00:06:47.597
So you take them out, you put them in a dish,

00:06:47.597 --> 00:06:50.260
they don't make milk. They completely forget.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.159
For example, here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:57.414
on the left, there is nothing on the right.

00:06:57.414 --> 00:07:01.143
Look at the nuclei. The nuclei in the cell on the left

00:07:01.143 --> 00:07:04.639
is in the animal, the one on the right is in a dish.

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.375
They are completely different from each other.

00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:09.400
So, what does this tell you?

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.367
This tells you that here also, context overrides.

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:17.752
In different contexts, cells do different things.

00:07:17.752 --> 00:07:20.497
But how does context signal?

00:07:20.497 --> 00:07:23.039
So, Einstein said that

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:29.692
"For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope."

00:07:29.692 --> 00:07:35.652
So, you can imagine the amount of skepticism

00:07:35.652 --> 00:07:38.053
I received -- couldn't get money,

00:07:38.053 --> 00:07:39.996
couldn't do a whole lot of other things,

00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:41.725
but I'm so glad it all worked out.

00:07:41.725 --> 00:07:45.540
So, we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.723
and all those lovely acini are there,

00:07:48.723 --> 00:07:52.934
every one of those with the red around them are an acinus,

00:07:52.934 --> 00:07:56.628
and we said okay, we are going to try and make this,

00:07:56.628 --> 00:07:59.860
and I said, maybe that red stuff

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.985
around the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold,

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:06.925
maybe it has information,

00:08:06.925 --> 00:08:11.491
maybe it tells the cells what to do, maybe it tells the nucleus what to do.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:15.774
So I said, extracellular matrix, which is this stuff

00:08:15.774 --> 00:08:20.165
called ECM, signals and actually tells the cells what to do.

00:08:20.165 --> 00:08:23.932
So, we decided to make things that would look like that.

00:08:23.932 --> 00:08:26.812
We found some gooey material

00:08:26.812 --> 00:08:29.687
that had the right extracellular matrix in it,

00:08:29.687 --> 00:08:32.226
we put the cells in it, and lo and behold,

00:08:32.226 --> 00:08:35.047
in about four days, they got reorganized

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:38.455
and on the right, is what we can make in culture.

00:08:38.455 --> 00:08:42.951
On the left is what's inside the animal, we call it in vivo,

00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:45.535
and the one in culture was full of milk,

00:08:45.535 --> 00:08:48.335
the lovely red there is full of milk.

00:08:48.335 --> 00:08:51.751
So, we Got Milk, for the American audience.

00:08:51.751 --> 00:08:57.095
All right. And here is this beautiful human cell,

00:08:57.095 --> 00:09:02.041
and you can imagine that here also, context goes.

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.757
So, what do we do now?

00:09:04.757 --> 00:09:06.981
I made a radical hypothesis.

00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:13.644
I said, if it's true that architecture is dominant,

00:09:13.644 --> 00:09:18.130
architecture restored to a cancer cell

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.119
should make the cancer cell think it's normal.

00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:22.603
Could this be done?

00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:25.131
So, we tried it.

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.169
In order to do that, however,

00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:32.054
we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant,

00:09:32.054 --> 00:09:36.051
and on the left is the single normal cell,

00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:40.014
human breast, put in three-dimensional gooey gel

00:09:40.014 --> 00:09:43.878
that has extracellular matrix, it makes all these beautiful structures.

00:09:43.878 --> 00:09:46.766
On the right, you see it looks very ugly,

00:09:46.766 --> 00:09:48.414
the cells continue to grow,

00:09:48.414 --> 00:09:49.990
the normal ones stop.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.822
And you see here in higher magnification

00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:57.174
the normal acinus and the ugly tumor.

00:09:57.174 --> 00:10:01.398
So we said, what is on the surface of these ugly tumors?

00:10:01.398 --> 00:10:03.566
Could we calm them down --

00:10:03.566 --> 00:10:08.486
they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up --

00:10:08.486 --> 00:10:11.550
and make them to the level of the normal?

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.270
Well, it was wonderful. Boggles my mind.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.431
This is what we got.

00:10:18.431 --> 00:10:22.110
We can revert the malignant phenotype.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.678
(Applause)

00:10:24.678 --> 00:10:27.790
And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.508
I didn't just choose one,

00:10:29.508 --> 00:10:32.278
here are little movies, sort of fuzzy,

00:10:32.278 --> 00:10:35.934
but you see that on the left are the malignant cells,

00:10:35.934 --> 00:10:37.278
all of them are malignant,

00:10:37.278 --> 00:10:42.078
we add one single inhibitor in the beginning,

00:10:42.078 --> 00:10:45.535
and look what happens, they all look like that.

00:10:45.535 --> 00:10:48.982
We inject them into the mouse, the ones on the right,

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:51.222
and none of them would make tumors.

00:10:51.222 --> 00:10:54.758
We inject the other ones in the mouse, 100 percent tumors.

00:10:54.758 --> 00:10:57.430
So, it's a new way of thinking about cancer,

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.830
it's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.806
We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level,

00:11:03.806 --> 00:11:09.718
and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior

00:11:09.718 --> 00:11:13.590
is regulated at the level of tissue organization

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.582
and that the tissue organization is dependent

00:11:17.582 --> 00:11:21.278
on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment.

00:11:21.278 --> 00:11:28.909
All right, thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally.

00:11:28.909 --> 00:11:33.029
And here is another five seconds of repose,

00:11:33.029 --> 00:11:37.451
is my mantra. Form and function.

00:11:37.451 --> 00:11:41.097
And of course, we now ask, where do we go now?

00:11:41.097 --> 00:11:44.092
We'd like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic.

00:11:44.092 --> 00:11:48.016
But before we do that, I'd like you to think

00:11:48.016 --> 00:11:51.604
that at any given time when you're sitting there,

00:11:51.604 --> 00:11:54.617
in your 70 trillion cells,

00:11:54.617 --> 00:11:58.090
the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus,

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.168
the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix

00:12:01.168 --> 00:12:07.162
and this is how your balance is kept and restored.

00:12:07.162 --> 00:12:09.377
We have made a lot of discoveries,

00:12:09.377 --> 00:12:12.465
we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin.

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:15.912
We have shown that there's little pieces of DNA

00:12:15.912 --> 00:12:19.735
on the specific genes of the mammary gland

00:12:19.735 --> 00:12:22.599
that actually respond to extracellular matrix.

00:12:22.599 --> 00:12:26.296
It has taken many years, but it has been very rewarding.

00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:30.687
And before I get to the next slide, I have to tell you

00:12:30.687 --> 00:12:35.799
that there are so many additional discoveries to be made.

00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:38.327
There is so much mystery we don't know.

00:12:38.327 --> 00:12:42.688
And I always say to the students and post-docs I lecture to,

00:12:42.688 --> 00:12:48.351
don't be arrogant, because arrogance kills curiosity.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.543
Curiosity and passion.

00:12:50.543 --> 00:12:54.440
You need to always think, what else needs to be discovered?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.415
And maybe my discovery needs to be added to

00:12:57.415 --> 00:12:59.207
or maybe it needs to be changed.

00:12:59.207 --> 00:13:02.711
So, we have now made an amazing discovery,

00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:05.815
a post-doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me,

00:13:05.815 --> 00:13:07.992
what do the cells do when you put them in?

00:13:07.992 --> 00:13:11.286
What do they do in the beginning when they do?

00:13:11.286 --> 00:13:12.767
I said, I don't know, we couldn't look at them.

00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:15.360
We didn't have high images in the old days.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.055
So she, being an imager and a physicist,

00:13:18.055 --> 00:13:19.799
did this incredible thing.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:24.175
This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions.

00:13:24.175 --> 00:13:26.703
Look at it. It's constantly doing this.

00:13:26.703 --> 00:13:28.799
Has a coherent movement.

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:33.133
You put the cancer cells there, and they do go all over,

00:13:33.133 --> 00:13:35.037
they do this. They don't do this.

00:13:35.037 --> 00:13:39.045
And when we revert the cancer cell, it again does this.

00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:41.229
Absolutely boggles my mind.

00:13:41.229 --> 00:13:46.573
So the cell acts like an embryo. What an exciting thing.

00:13:46.573 --> 00:13:49.429
So I'd like to finish with a poem.

00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:52.493
Well I used to love English literature,

00:13:52.493 --> 00:13:55.100
and I debated in college, which one should I do?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.712
And unfortunately or fortunately, chemistry won.

00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:05.436
But here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines.

00:14:05.436 --> 00:14:08.095
It's called "Among the School Children."

00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:12.616
"O body swayed to music / O brightening glance /

00:14:12.616 --> 00:14:15.766
How [can we know] the dancer from the dance?"

00:14:15.766 --> 00:14:17.677
And here is Merce Cunningham,

00:14:17.677 --> 00:14:20.661
I was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger,

00:14:20.661 --> 00:14:22.854
and here he is a dancer,

00:14:22.854 --> 00:14:26.158
and while he is dancing, he is both the dancer and the dance.

00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:29.859
The minute he stops, we have neither.

00:14:29.859 --> 00:14:33.333
So it's like form and function.

00:14:33.333 --> 00:14:39.112
Now, I'd like to show you a current picture of my group.

00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:42.640
I have been fortunate to have had these magnificant

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.864
students and post-docs who have taught me so much,

00:14:45.864 --> 00:14:49.127
and I have had many of these groups come and go.

00:14:49.127 --> 00:14:53.704
They are the future and I try to make them not be afraid

00:14:53.704 --> 00:14:57.407
of being the cat and being told,

00:14:57.407 --> 00:14:59.000
don't think outside the box.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.495
And I'd like to leave you with this thought.

00:15:01.495 --> 00:15:06.240
On the left is water coming through the shore,

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.135
taken from a NASA satellite.

00:15:08.135 --> 00:15:11.184
On the right, there is a coral.

00:15:11.184 --> 00:15:15.186
Now if you take the mammary gland and spread it

00:15:15.186 --> 00:15:18.631
and take the fat away, on a dish it looks like that.

00:15:18.631 --> 00:15:21.983
Do they look the same? Do they have the same patterns?

00:15:21.983 --> 00:15:25.935
Why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again?

00:15:25.935 --> 00:15:28.295
And I'd like to submit to you

00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:30.472
that we have sequenced the human genome,

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:33.352
we know everything about the sequence of the gene,

00:15:33.352 --> 00:15:35.783
the language of the gene, the alphabet of the gene,

00:15:35.783 --> 00:15:39.022
But we know nothing, but nothing,

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:43.685
about the language and alphabet of form.

00:15:43.685 --> 00:15:46.729
So, it's a wonderful new horizon,

00:15:46.729 --> 00:15:50.479
it's a wonderful thing to discover for the young

00:15:50.479 --> 00:15:52.959
and the passionate old, and that's me.

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:55.007
So go to it!

00:15:55.007 --> 00:16:06.507
(Applause)
