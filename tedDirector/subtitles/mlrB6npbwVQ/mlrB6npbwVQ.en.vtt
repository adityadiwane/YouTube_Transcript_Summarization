00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm going to have a pretty simple idea

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and that is all of us are makers.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I really believe that.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
All of us are makers.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
We're born makers.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
We have this ability

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
to make things,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
to grasp things with our hands.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
We use words like "grasp" metaphorically

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
to also think about understanding things.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
We don't just live, but we make.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
We create things.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Well I'm going to show you a group of makers

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
from Maker Faire and various places.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
It doesn't come out particularly well,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
but that's a particularly tall bicycle.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
It's a scraper bike; it's called --

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
from Oakland.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And this is a particularly small scooter

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
for a gentleman of this size.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
But he's trying to power it, or motorize it,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
with a drill.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
(Laughter)

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And the question he had is,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
"Can I do it? Can it be done?"

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Apparently it can.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
So makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs;

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
they're people who love

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
doing what they do.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
They don't always even know why they're doing it.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
We have begun organizing makers

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
at our Maker Faire.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
There was one held in Detroit here last summer,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
But we hold them in San Francisco --

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
(Applause)

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
-- and in New York.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
And it's a fabulous event

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
to just meet and talk to these people who make things

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and are there to just show them to you and talk about them

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
and have a great conversation.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
(Video) Guy: I might get one of those.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Dale Dougherty: These are electric muffins.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Guy: Where did you guys get those?

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Muffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.)

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
DD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
We got there first.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Lady: Will you glide with us?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
DD: This is something I call "swinging in the rain."

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And you can barely see it,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
but it's -- a controller at top cycles the water to fall

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
So imagine a kid: "Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
No, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?"

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
That's the experience of a clever ride.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And of course, we have fashion.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
People are remaking things into fashion.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
I don't know if this is called a basket-bra,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
but it ought to be something like that.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
We have art students getting together,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
taking old radiator parts

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
They did that in the summer, and it was very warm.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Now this one takes a little bit of explaining.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
You know what those are, right?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Billy-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Now the background is -- the guy who did this is a physicist.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
(Video) Richard Carter: I'm Richard Carter,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Choir: ♫ When you hold me in your arms ♫

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
DD: This is all computer-controlled

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
in an old Volvo.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Choir: ♫ I'm hooked on a feelin' ♫

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.260
♫ I'm high on believin' ♫

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
♫ That you're in love with me ♫

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
DD: So Richard came up from Houston last year

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
to visit us in Detroit here

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
So, are you a maker?

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
How many people here would say you're a maker, if you raise your hand?

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
That's a pretty good --

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And again, think about it.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
You're makers of food; you're makers of shelter;

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
you're makers of lots of different things,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and partly what interests me today

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
is you're makers of your own world,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
and particularly the role that technology has

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
in your life.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
You're really a driver or a passenger --

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
to use a Volkswagen phrase.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Makers are in control.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
They want to figure out how things work;

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
they want to get access to it;

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and they want to control it.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
They want to use it to their own purpose.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Makers today, to some degree, are out on the edge.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
They're not mainstream.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
They're a little bit radical.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
They're a bit subversive in what they do.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
But at one time,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
It was not something you'd even remark upon.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And I found this old video.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
And I'll tell you more about it, but just ...

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.260
(Music)

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
(Video) Narrator: Of all things Americans are,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
we are makers.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.260
With our strengths and our minds and spirit,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
we gather, we form, and we fashion.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Makers and shapers

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and put-it-togetherers.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
DD: So it goes on to show you

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
people making things out of wood,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
a grandfather making a ship in a bottle,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
a woman making a pie --

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
somewhat standard fare of the day.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
But it was a sense of pride

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
that we made things,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
that the world around us was made by us.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
It didn't just exist.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
We made it, and we were connected to it that way.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
And I think that's tremendously important.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
This particular reel --

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
it's an industrial video --

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
but it was shown in drive-in theaters

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
in 1961 --

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
in the Detroit area, in fact --

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho."

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
(Laughter)

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
So I like to think there was something going on there

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
of the new generation of makers

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
coming out of this, plus "Psycho."

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
This is Andrew Archer.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
I met Andrew at one of our community meetings

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
putting together Maker Faire.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Andrew had moved to Detroit

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
from Duluth, Minnesota.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
And I talked to his mom,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and I ended up doing a story on him

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
for a magazine called Kidrobot.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
He's just a kid that grew up

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
playing with tools instead of toys.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
He liked to take things apart.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
His mother gave him a part of the garage,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
and he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And then he didn't particularly like school that much,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
but he got involved in robotics competitions,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and he realized he had a talent,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
and, more importantly, he had a real passion for it.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And he began building robots.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And when I sat down next to him,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
he was telling me about a company he formed,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
and he was building some robots for automobile factories

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
to move things around on the factory floor.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And that's why he moved to Michigan.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
But he also moved here

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
to meet other people doing what he's doing.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
And this kind of gets to this important idea today.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
in a hackerspace.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
But these are like clubs --

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
they're sharing tools, sharing space,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
sharing expertise in what to make.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
And so it's a very interesting phenomenon

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
that's going across the world.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
But essentially these are people that are playing with technology.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
Let me say that again: playing.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
They're playing

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
to discover what the technology can do,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and probably to discover what they can do themselves,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
what their own capabilities are.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Now the other thing that I think is taking off,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
another reason making is taking off today,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
is there's some great new tools out there.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
And you can't see this very well on the screen,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
but Arduino -- Arduino is an open-source hardware platform.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
It's a micro-controller.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
If you don't know what those are, they're just the "brains."

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
So they're the brains of maker projects,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
and here's an example of one.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
And I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox --

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
So you figure out how to program this,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
and you put this in your mailbox.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And when someone opens your mailbox,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
you get a notification,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
an alert message goes to your iPhone.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
Now that could be a dog door,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.260
it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
like a little brother into a little sister's room.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
There's all kinds of different things

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
that you can imagine for that.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
Now here's something -- a 3D printer.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
That's another tool that's really taken off -- really, really interesting.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
This is Makerbot.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
And there are industrial versions of this --

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
about 20,000 dollars.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
These guys came up with a kit version

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
for 750 dollars,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Now they don't know what they want to do with it,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
but they're going to figure it out.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
One of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
some new brackets for the box.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Well you printed out the brackets

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Isn't that cool?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
So makers harvest technology

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
from all the places around us.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
This is a radar speed detector

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
And they do interesting things.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
They're really creating new areas and exploring areas

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
that you might only think --

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
the military is doing drones --

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
well, there is a whole community of people

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
building autonomous airplanes, or vehicles --

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
something that you could program to fly on its own,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
without a stick or anything, to figure out what path it's going.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
Fascinating work they're doing.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
We just had an issue on space exploration,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
DIY space exploration.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
This is probably the best time in the history of mankind

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
to love space.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
You could build your own satellite and get it into space

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
for like 8,000 dollars.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
Think how much money and how many years it took NASA

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
to get satellites into space.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
In fact, these guys actually work for NASA,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
and they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
cheap things that aren't specialized

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
that they can combine

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
and send up into space.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
Makers are a source of innovation,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
and I think it relates back to something

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
like the birth of the personal computer industry.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers?

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
It's the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
And he says, "I could go there all day long

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and talk to people

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and share ideas for free."

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
Well he did a little bit better than free.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
But it's important to understand

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
that a lot of the origins of our industries --

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
even like Henry Ford --

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
come from this idea of playing

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
and figuring things out in groups.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Well, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
I hope I could convince you

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
that our next generation should be makers,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
that kids are particularly interested in this,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
in this ability to control the physical world

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and be able to use things like micro-controllers

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and build robots.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
And we've got to get this into schools,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
or into communities in many, many ways --

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
the ability to tinker,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
to shape and reshape the world around us.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
There's a great opportunity today --

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
and that's what I really care about the most.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
An the answer to the question: what will America make?

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
It's more makers.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Thank you very much.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
(Applause)
