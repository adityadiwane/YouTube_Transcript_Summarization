00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I want to talk to you today about prosperity,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
about our hopes

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
for a shared and lasting prosperity.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And not just us,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
but the two billion people worldwide

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
who are still chronically undernourished.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And hope actually is at the heart of this.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
In fact, the Latin word for hope

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
is at the heart of the word prosperity.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
"Pro-speras," "speras," hope --

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
in accordance with our hopes and expectations.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
The irony is, though,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
that we have cashed-out prosperity

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
almost literally in terms of money and economic growth.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And we've grown our economies so much

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
that we now stand

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
in a real danger

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
of undermining hope --

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
running down resources, cutting down rainforests,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
changing the climate --

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
and the only thing that has actually

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
remotely slowed down the relentless rise

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
is recession.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And recession, of course,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
isn't exactly a recipe for hope either,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
as we're busy finding out.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
So we're caught in a kind of trap.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
It's a dilemma, a dilemma of growth.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
We can't live with it; we can't live without it.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Trash the system or crash the planet --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
it's a tough choice; it isn't much of a choice.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And our best avenue of escape from this actually

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
is a kind of blind faith

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and doing things more efficiently.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Now I haven't got anything against efficiency.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And I think we are a clever species sometimes.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
But I think we should also just check the numbers,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
take a reality check here.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
So I want you to imagine a world,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
in 2050, of around nine billion people,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
all aspiring to Western incomes,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Western lifestyles.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And I want to ask the question --

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
because we believe in growth.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
And I want to ask the question:

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
how far and how fast would be have to move?

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
How clever would we have to be?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
How much technology would we need in this world

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
to deliver our carbon targets?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
And here in my chart --

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
on the left-hand side is where we are now.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
in the economy at the moment.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
It's around about 770 grams of carbon.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
In the world I describe to you,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
we have to be right over here at the right-hand side

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
at six grams of carbon.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
It's a 130-fold improvement,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and that is 10 times further and faster

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Maybe we can do it, maybe it's possible -- who knows?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Maybe we can even go further

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
which is what we're going to need to be doing

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
by the end of the century.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
But shouldn't we just check first

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
that the economic system that we have

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
is remotely capable of delivering

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
this kind of improvement?

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
It's a bit complex, and I apologize for that.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
What I'll try and do, is I'll try and paraphrase it

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
is sort of human terms.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So it looks a little bit like this.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Firms produce goods for households -- that's us --

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and provide us with incomes,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and that's even better, because we can spend those incomes

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
on more goods and services.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
That's called the circular flow of the economy.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
It looks harmless enough.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
I just want to highlight one key feature of this system,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
which is the role of investment.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Now investment constitutes

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
only about a fifth of the national income

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
in most modern economies,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
but it plays an absolutely vital role.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And what it does essentially

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
is to stimulate further consumption growth.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
It does this in a couple of ways --

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
chasing productivity,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
But I want to concentrate

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
on the role of investment

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
in seeking out novelty,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
the production and consumption of novelty.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Joseph Schumpeter called this

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
"the process of creative destruction."

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
continually chasing expanding consumer markets,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
consumer goods, new consumer goods.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And this, this is where it gets interesting,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
because it turns out that human beings

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
have something of an appetite for novelty.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
We love new stuff --

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
new material stuff for sure --

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
but also new ideas, new adventures,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
new experiences.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
But the materiality matters too,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
because in every society

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
that anthropologists have looked at,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
material stuff

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
operates as a kind of language --

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
a language of goods,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
a symbolic language

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
that we use to tell each other stories --

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
stories, for example,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
about how important we are.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Status-driven, conspicuous consumption

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
thrives from the language

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
of novelty.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And here, all of a sudden,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
we have a system

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
that is locking economic structure with social logic --

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
the economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
to drive an engine of growth.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And this engine is not just economic value;

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
it is pulling material resources

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
relentlessly through the system,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
driven by our own insatiable appetites,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
driven in fact by a sense of anxiety.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Adam Smith, 200 years ago,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
spoke about our desire

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
for a life without shame.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
A life without shame:

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
in his day, what that meant was a linen shirt,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and today, well, you still need the shirt,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
but you need the hybrid car,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
the HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
the netbook and iPad, the list goes on --

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
an almost inexhaustible supply of goods,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
driven by this anxiety.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
And even if we don't want them,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
we need to buy them,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
because, if we don't buy them, the system crashes.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
And to stop it crashing

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
over the last two to three decades,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
we've expanded the money supply,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
expanded credit and debt,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
so that people can keep buying stuff.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And of course, that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
But this -- I just want to show you some data here.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
This is what it looks like, essentially,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
this credit and debt system, just for the U.K.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
This was the last 15 years before the crash,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and you can see there, consumer debt rose dramatically.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
It was above the GDP for three years in a row

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
just before the crisis.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And in the mean time, personal savings absolutely plummeted.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
The savings ratio, net savings,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
were below zero in the middle of 2008,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
just before the crash.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
This is people expanding debt, drawing down their savings,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
just to stay in the game.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
This is a strange, rather perverse, story,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
just to put it in very simple terms.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
It's a story about us, people,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
being persuaded

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
to spend money we don't have

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
on things we don't need

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
to create impressions that won't last

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
on people we don't care about.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
(Laughter)

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.260
(Applause)

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
But before we consign ourselves to despair,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
maybe we should just go back and say, "Did we get this right?

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Is this really how people are?

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
Is this really how economies behave?"

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And almost straightaway

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
we actually run up against a couple of anomalies.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
The first one is in the crisis itself.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
In the crisis, in the recession, what do people want to do?

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
They want to hunker down, they want to look to the future.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
They want to spend less and save more.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
from the system point of view.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Keynes called this the "paradox of thrift" --

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
saving slows down recovery.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And politicians call on us continually

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
to draw down more debt,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
to draw down our own savings even further,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
just so that we can get the show back on the road,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
so we can keep this growth-based economy going.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
It's an anomaly,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
it's a place where the system actually is at odds

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
with who we are as people.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Here's another one -- completely different one:

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
Why is it

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
to combat climate change,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
very, very simple things

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
like buying energy-efficient appliances,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
putting in efficient lights, turning the lights off occasionally,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
insulating our homes?

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
These things save carbon, they save energy,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
they save us money.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
So is it that, though they make perfect economic sense,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
we don't do them?

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
Well, I had my own personal insight into this

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
a few years ago.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
It was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and it was just after --

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
actually, to be honest, too long after --

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
we had moved into a new house.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
installing insulation around the windows and doors

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
to keep out the drafts.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
And my, then, five year-old daughter

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
was helping me in the way that five year-olds do.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And we'd been doing this for a while,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
when she turned to me very solemnly and said,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
"Will this really keep out the giraffes?"

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
(Laughter)

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
"Here they are, the giraffes."

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
You can hear the five-year-old mind working.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
These ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
But actually that childish misrepresentation

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
stuck with me,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
because it suddenly became clear to me

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
why we don't do the blindingly obvious things.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
We're too busy keeping out the giraffes --

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
putting the kids on the bus in the morning,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
getting ourselves to work on time,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
surviving email overload

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and shop floor politics,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
foraging for groceries, throwing together meals,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
into prime-time TV

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
or TED online,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
getting from one end of the day to the other,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
keeping out the giraffes.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
(Laughter)

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
What is the objective?

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
"What is the objective of the consumer?"

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
written 35 years ago.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
"It is," she said,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
"to help create the social world

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
and find a credible place in it."

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
That is a deeply humanizing

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
vision of our lives,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and it's a completely different vision

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
than the one that lies at the heart

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
of this economic model.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
So who are we?

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
Who are these people?

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
Are we these novelty-seeking, hedonistic,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
selfish individuals?

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Or might we actually occasionally be

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
something like the selfless altruist

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
depicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here?

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
Well psychology actually says

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
there is a tension --

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
a tension between self-regarding behaviors

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and other regarding behaviors.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
so selfish behavior

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
is adaptive in certain circumstances --

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
fight or flight.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
But other regarding behaviors

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
are essential to our evolution

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
as social beings.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
and tradition or conservation.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
Novelty is adaptive when things are changing

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
and you need to adapt yourself.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
Tradition is essential to lay down the stability

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
to raise families and form cohesive social groups.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
So here, all of a sudden,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
we're looking at a map of the human heart.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
And it reveals to us, suddenly,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
the crux of the matter.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
What we've done is we've created economies.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
We've created systems,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
which systematically privilege, encourage,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
one narrow quadrant

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
of the human soul

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and left the others unregarded.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And in the same token, the solution becomes clear,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
because this isn't, therefore,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
about changing human nature.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
It isn't, in fact, about curtailing possibilities.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
It is about opening up.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
It is about allowing ourselves the freedom

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
to become fully human,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
recognizing the depth and the breadth

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
of the human psyche

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
and building institutions

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.260
to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
What does all this mean for economics?

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
What would economies look like

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
if we took that vision of human nature

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
at their heart

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
and stretched them

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
along these orthogonal dimensions

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
of the human psyche?

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
Well, it might look a little bit

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
like the 4,000 community-interest companies

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
enterprises

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
that have ecological and social goals

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
written into their constitution

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
at their heart --

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
companies, in fact, like this one, Ecosia.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
And I just want to, very quickly, show you this.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
Ecosia is an Internet search engine.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Internet search engines work

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
by drawing revenues from sponsored links

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
that appear when you do a search.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
So we can do that here --

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
we can just put in a little search term.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
There you go, Oxford, that's where we are. See what comes up.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
The difference with Ecosia though

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
is that, in Ecosia's case,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
it draws the revenues in the same way,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
but it allocates

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
80 percent of those revenues

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
And we're going to do it.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
that's the page to go to.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
And what happened then was

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
and Ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
to a rainforest protection project.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
It's taking profits from one place

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
and allocating them

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
into the protection of ecological resources.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
It's a different kind of enterprise

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
for a new economy.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
It's a form, if you like,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
of ecological altruism --

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Whatever it is,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
whatever this new economy is,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
what we need the economy to do, in fact,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
is to put investment

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
back into the heart of the model,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
to re-conceive investment.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
Only now, investment

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
isn't going to be

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
about the relentless and mindless

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
pursuit of consumption growth.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Investment has to be a different beast.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
Investment has to be,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
in the new economy,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
protecting and nurturing

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
the ecological assets on which our future depends.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
It has to be about transition.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
and infrastructures.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
We have to invest, in fact,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
in the idea of a meaningful prosperity,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
providing capabilities

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
for people to flourish.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
And of course, this task has material dimensions.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
if they didn't have food, clothing and shelter.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
It has social and psychological aims --

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
family, friendship,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
commitments, society,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
participating in the life of that society.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
And this too

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
requires investment,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
investment -- for example, in places --

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
places where we can connect,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
places where we can participate,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
shared spaces,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
concert halls, gardens,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
public parks,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
libraries, museums, quiet centers,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
places of joy and celebration,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
places of tranquility and contemplation,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
sites for the "cultivation

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
of a common citizenship,"

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.260
An investment -- investment, after all, is just such a basic economic concept --

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
is nothing more nor less

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
than a relationship

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
between the present and the future,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
a shared present and a common future.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
And we need that relationship to reflect,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
to reclaim hope.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
So let me come back, with this sense of hope,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
to the two billion people

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
still trying to live each day

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
on less than the price of a skinny latte

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
from the cafe next door.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
What can we offer those people?

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
It's clear that we have a responsibility

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
to help lift them out of poverty.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
It's clear that we have a responsibility

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
to make room for growth

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
where growth really matters in those poorest nations.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
And it's also clear that we will never achieve that

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
unless we're capable of redefining

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
a prosperity that is more meaningful

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
and less materialistic

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
than the growth-based model.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
So this is not just

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
a Western post-materialist fantasy.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
In fact, an African philosopher wrote to me,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
when "Prosperity Without Growth" was published,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
pointing out the similarities

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
between this view of prosperity

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
and the traditional African concept of ubuntu.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
Ubuntu says, "I am

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
because we are."

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
Prosperity is a shared endeavor.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
Its roots are long and deep --

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
its foundations, I've tried to show,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
exist already, inside each of us.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
So this is not about

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
standing in the way of development.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
It's not about

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
overthrowing capitalism.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
It's not about

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
trying to change human nature.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
What we're doing here

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
is we're taking a few simple steps

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
towards an economics fit for purpose.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
And at the heart of that economics,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
we're placing a more credible,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
more robust,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.260
and more realistic vision

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.260
of what it means to be human.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:10.260
(Applause)

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.260
Chris Anderson: While they're taking the podium away, just a quick question.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
First of all, economists aren't supposed to be inspiring,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
so you may need to work on the tone a little.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
(Laughter)

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this?

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
I mean, can you picture

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.260
a politician standing up in Britain and saying,

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.260
"GDP fell two percent this year. Good news!

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.260
We're actually all happier, and a country's more beautiful,

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
and our lives are better."

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
Tim Jackson: Well that's clearly not what you're doing.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
You're not making news out of things falling down.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.260
You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
Can I picture politicians doing it?

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
Actually, I already am seeing a little bit of it.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.260
When we first started this kind of work,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
politicians would stand up, treasury spokesmen would stand up,

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.260
and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
And actually in the period

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.260
through which we've been working over the last 18 years --

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
partly because of the financial crisis

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.260
and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics --

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
actually people are engaging in this issue

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.260
in all sorts of countries around the world.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.260
CA: But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together,

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.260
or is it going to be more just civil society and companies?

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.260
TJ: It has to be companies. It has to be civil society.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.260
But it has to have political leadership.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.260
This is a kind of agenda,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.260
which actually politicians themselves

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.260
are kind of caught in that dilemma,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.260
because they're hooked on the growth model themselves.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
But actually opening up the space

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
to think about different ways of governing,

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.260
different kinds of politics,

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.260
and creating the space

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.260
for civil society and businesses to operate differently --

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.260
absolutely vital.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.260
CA: And if someone could convince you

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260
that we actually can make the -- what was it? --

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
the 130-fold improvement in efficiency,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.260
of reduction of carbon footprint,

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.260
would you then actually like that picture of economic growth

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.260
into more knowledge-based goods?

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260
TJ: I would still want to know that you could do that

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.260
and get below zero by the end of the century,

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.260
in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere,

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.260
and solve the problem of biodiversity

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.260
and reduce the impact on land use

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.260
and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.260
If you can convince me we can do all that,

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.260
then, yes, I would take the two percent.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.260
CA: Tim, thank you for a very important talk. Thank you.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.260
(Applause)
