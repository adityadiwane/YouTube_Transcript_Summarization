00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.776
Pat Mitchell: So I was thinking
about female friendship a lot,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.056
and by the way, these two women,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.456
I'm very honored to say,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.416
have been my friends
for a very long time, too.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.656
Jane Fonda: Yes we have.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.176
PM: And one of the things
that I read about female friendship

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.816
is something that Cervantes said.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.216
He said, "You can tell
a lot about someone,"

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.456
in this case a woman,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.896
"by the company that she keeps."

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.136
So let's start with --

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.360
(Laughter)

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.936
JF: We're in big trouble.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.936
Lily Tomlin: Hand me one of those waters,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.176
I'm extremely dry.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.040
(Laughter)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.720
JF: You're taking up our time.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.936
We have a very limited --

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.296
LT: Just being with her
sucks the life out of me.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.096
(Laughter)

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.856
JF: You ain't seen nothing yet.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.096
Anyway -- sorry.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.496
PM: So tell me, what do you
look for in a friend?

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.096
LT: I look for someone
who has a sense of fun,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.096
who's audacious,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.576
who's forthcoming, who has politics,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.456
who has even a small scrap
of passion for the planet,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.096
someone who's decent,
has a sense of justice

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.216
and who thinks I'm worthwhile.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.216
(Laughter)

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.000
(Applause)

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.776
JF: You know, I was thinking this morning,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.616
I don't even know what I would do
without my women friends.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.656
I mean it's, "I have my friends,
therefore I am."

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.896
LT: (Laughter)

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.136
JF: No, it's true.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.399
I exist because I have
my women friends. They --

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.536
You're one of them.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.322
I don't know about you. But anyway --

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:52.496
(Laughter)

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.096
You know, they make me stronger,
they make me smarter,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.696
they make me braver.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.496
They tap me on the shoulder when I might
be in need of course-correcting.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.216
And most of them are
a good deal younger than me, too.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.896
You know? I mean, it's nice --
LT: Thank you.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.376
(Laughter)

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.456
JF: No, I do, I include you in that,
because listen, you know --

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.656
it's nice to have somebody still around
to play with and learn from

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.576
when you're getting toward the end.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.896
I'm approaching --
I'll be there sooner than you.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.616
LT: No, I'm glad to have you
parallel aging alongside me.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.696
(Laughter)

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.216
JF: I'm showing you the way.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.456
(Laughter)

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.376
LT: Well, you are and you have.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.736
PM: Well, as we grow older,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.616
and as we go through
different kinds of life's journeys,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.160
what do you do to keep
your friendships vital and alive?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.856
LT: Well you have to use a lot of --

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.536
JF: She doesn't invite me over much,
I'll tell you that.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.576
LT: I have to use a lot of social media --

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.096
You be quiet now. And so --

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.416
(Laughter)

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.456
LT: And I look through my emails,
I look through my texts

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.696
to find my friends,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.816
so I can answer them
as quickly as possible,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.256
because I know they need my counsel.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.056
(Laughter)

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.336
They need my support,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.456
because most of my friends
are writers, or activists, or actors,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.776
and you're all three ...

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.416
and a long string
of other descriptive phrases,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.736
and I want to get to you
as soon as possible,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.816
I want you to know that I'm there for you.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.136
JF: Do you do emojis?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.056
LT: Oh ...
JF: No?

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.536
LT: That's embarrassing.
JF: I'm really into emojis.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.976
LT: No, I spell out my --

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.776
I spell out my words of happiness
and congratulations,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.456
and sadness.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.896
JF: You spell it right out --

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.301
LT: I spell it, every letter.

00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:33.896
(Laughter)

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.096
JF: Such a purist.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.056
You know, as I've gotten older,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.296
I've understood more
the importance of friendships,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.176
and so, I really make an effort

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.816
to reach out and make play dates --
not let too much time go by.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.056
I read a lot

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.016
so, as Lily knows all too well,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.096
my books that I like,
I send to my friends.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.056
LT: When we knew we would be here today

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.896
you sent me a lot of books
about women, female friendships,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.456
and I was so surprised
to see how many books,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.816
how much research
has been done recently --

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.336
JF: And were you grateful?
LT: I was grateful.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.640
(Laughter)

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.616
PM: And --

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.816
LT: Wait, no, it's really important
because this is another example

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.216
of how women are overlooked,
put aside, marginalized.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.016
There's been very little
research done on us,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.016
even though we volunteered lots of times.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.296
JF: That's for sure.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.936
(Laughter)

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.176
LT: This is really exciting,
and you all will be interested in this.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.896
The Harvard Medical School study has shown

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.136
that women who have
close female friendships

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.776
are less likely to develop impairments --

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.936
physical impairments as they age,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.456
and they are likely to be seen
to be living much more vital, exciting --

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.696
JF: And longer --

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.936
LT: Joyful lives.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.856
JF: We live five years longer than men.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.936
LT: I think I'd trade the years for joy.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.640
(Laughter)

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.976
LT: But the most important
part is they found --

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.856
the results were so exciting
and so conclusive --

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.776
the researchers found

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.536
that not having close female friends
is detrimental to your health,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.536
as much as smoking or being overweight.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.416
JF: And there's something else, too --

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.856
LT: I've said my part, so ...

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.896
(Laughter)

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.576
JF: OK, well, listen to my part,
because there's an additional thing.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.776
Because they only --
for years, decades --

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.056
they only researched men when they
were trying to understand stress,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.576
only very recently have they researched
what happens to women when we're stressed,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.936
and it turns out
that when we're stressed -- women,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.176
our bodies get flooded by oxytocin.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.696
Which is a feel-good, calming,
stress-reducing hormone.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.776
Which is also increased
when we're with our women friends.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.176
And I do think that's one reason
why we live longer.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.816
And I feel so bad for men
because they don't have that.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.056
Testosterone in men
diminishes the effects of oxytocin.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.296
LT: Well, when you and I
and Dolly made "9 to 5" ...

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.536
JF: Oh --

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.616
LT: We laughed, we did,
we laughed so much,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.336
we found we had so much in common
and we're so different.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.075
Here she is, like Hollywood royalty,

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.176
I'm like a tough kid from Detroit,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.896
[Dolly's] a Southern kid
from a poor town in Tennessee,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.336
and we found we were so in sync as women,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.576
and we must have --

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.736
we laughed -- we must have added
at least a decade onto our lifespans.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.536
JF: I think -- we sure
crossed our legs a lot.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.536
(Laughter)

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.176
If you know what I mean.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.376
LT: I think we all know what you mean.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.416
(Laughter)

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.136
PM: You're adding decades
to our lives right now.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.096
So among the books that Jane
sent us both to read on female friendship

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.976
was one by a woman we admire greatly,
Sister Joan Chittister,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.096
who said about female friendship

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.376
that women friends
are not just a social act,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.296
they're a spiritual act.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.536
Do you think of your friends as spiritual?

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.976
Do they add something
spiritual to your lives?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.016
LT: Spiritual -- I absolutely think that.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.096
Because -- especially people
you've known a long time,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.696
people you've spent time with --

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.776
I can see the spiritual
essence inside them,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.720
the tenderness, the vulnerability.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.616
There's actually kind of a love,
an element of love in the relationship.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.296
I just see deeply into your soul.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.776
PM: Do you think that, Jane --

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.360
LT: But I have special powers.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.016
JF: Well, there's all kinds of friends.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.576
There's business friends,
and party friends,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.016
I've got a lot of those.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.016
(Laughter)

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.920
But the oxytocin-producing
friendships have ...

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.816
They feel spiritual
because it's a heart opening, right?

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.560
You know, we go deep. And --

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.840
I find that I shed tears a lot
with my intimate friends.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.336
Not because I'm sad but because
I'm so touched and inspired by them.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.640
LT: And you know one of you
is going to go soon.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.280
(Laughter)

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.976
PM: Well, two of us are sitting here,
Lily, which one are you talking about?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.376
(Laughter)

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.216
And I always think, when women
talk about their friendships,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.496
that men always look a little mystified.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.056
What are the differences, in your opinion,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.056
between men friendships
and women friendships?

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.056
JF: There's a lot of difference,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.016
and I think we have to have
a lot of empathy for men --

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.736
(Laughter)

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.480
that they don't have what we have.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.576
Which I think may be why they die sooner.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.135
(Laughter)

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:49.856
I have a lot of compassion for men,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.496
because women, no kidding, we --

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.136
women's relationships, our friendships
are full disclosure, we go deep.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.600
They're revelatory.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.096
We risk vulnerability --
this is something men don't do.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.656
I mean how many times
have I asked you, "Am I doing OK?"

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.936
"Did I really screw up there?"

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.336
PM: You're doing great.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.456
(Laughter)

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.616
JF: But I mean, we ask questions like that

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.856
of our women friends,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.896
and men don't.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.816
You know, people describe women's
relationships as face-to-face,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.856
whereas men's friendships
are more side-by-side.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.616
LT: I mean most of the time
men don't want to reveal their emotions,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.336
they want to bury deeper feelings.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.376
I mean, that's the general,
conventional thought.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.936
They would rather go off in their man cave
and watch a game or hit golf balls,

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.576
or talk about sports,
or hunting, or cars or have sex.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.856
I mean, it's just the kind of --
it's a more manly behavior.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.176
JF: You meant --
LT: They talk about sex.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.896
I meant they might have sex

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.296
if they could get somebody
in their man cave to --

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.080
(Laughter)

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.576
JF: You know something, though,
that I find very interesting --

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.176
and again, psychologists didn't know this
until relatively recently --

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.936
is that men are born every bit
as relational as women are.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.576
If you look at films
of newborn baby boys and girls,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.696
you'll see the baby boys
just like the girls,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.056
gazing into their mother's eyes,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.256
you know, needing that relational
exchange of energy.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:27.576
When the mother looks away,
they could see the dismay on the child,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.856
even the boy would cry.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.736
They need relationship.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.736
So the question is why,
as they grow older, does that change?

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.096
And the answer is patriarchal culture,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.096
which says to boys and young men

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:45.376
that to be needing of relationship,
to be emotional with someone is girly.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:51.056
That a real man doesn't ask
directions or express a need,

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.376
they don't go to doctors if they feel bad.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.976
They don't ask for help.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.696
There's a quote that I really like,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.456
"Men fear that becoming 'we'
will erase his 'I'."

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.176
You know, his sense of self.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.696
Whereas women's sense of self
has always been kind of porous.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.536
But our "we" is our saving grace,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.016
it's what makes us strong.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.776
It's not that we're better than men,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.848
we just don't have
our masculinity to prove.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.656
LT: And, well --

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.336
JF: That's a Gloria Steinem quote.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.736
So we can express our humanity --
LT: I know who Gloria Steinem is.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.237
JF: I know you know who she is,
but I think it's a --

00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:29.296
(Laughter)

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.176
No, but it's a great quote, I think.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.456
We're not better than men, we just
don't have our masculinity to prove.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.856
And that's really important.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.456
LT: But men are
so inculcated in the culture

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.616
to be comfortable in the patriarchy.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.576
And we've got to make
something different happen.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.776
JF: Women's friendships
are like a renewable source of power.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.256
LT: Well, that's what's exciting
about this subject.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.816
It's because our friendships --

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.456
female friendships
are just a hop to our sisterhood,

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.896
and sisterhood can be
a very powerful force,

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.336
to give the world --

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.176
to make it what it should be --

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.120
the things that humans desperately need.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.656
PM: It is why we're talking about it,

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.376
because women's friendships are,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.616
as you said, Jane,

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.976
a renewable source of power.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.480
So how do we use that power?

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.136
JF: Well, women are the fastest growing
demographic in the world,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.376
especially older women.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.456
And if we harness our power,
we can change the world.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.016
And guess what? We need to.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.176
(Applause)

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.496
And we need to do it soon.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.016
And one of the things
that we need to do --

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.576
and we can do it as women --

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.696
for one thing, we kind of set
the consumer standards.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.136
We need to consume less.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.136
We in the Western world
need to consume less

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.376
and when we buy things, we need to
buy things that are made locally,

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.496
when we buy food, we need to buy food
that's grown locally.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.736
We are the ones
that need to get off the grid.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:59.496
We need to make ourselves
independent from fossil fuels.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.496
And the fossil fuel companies --

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.656
the Exxons and the Shell Oils
and those bad guys --

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.896
cause they are --

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.776
are going to tell us that we can't do it
without going back to the Stone Age.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.656
You know, that the alternatives
just aren't quite there yet,

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.016
and that's not true.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.096
There are countries in the world right now

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.456
that are living mostly on renewable
energy and doing just fine.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.616
And they tell us that if we do
wean ourselves from fossil fuel

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.776
that we're going to be
back in the Stone Age,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.976
and in fact, if we begin
to use renewable energy,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.166
and not drill in the Arctic,
and not drill --

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.356
LT: Oh, boy.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.496
JF: And not drill
in the Alberta tar sands --

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.736
Right.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.000
That we will be --

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.416
there will be more democracy
and more jobs and more well-being,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.656
and it's women that are
going to lead the way.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.056
LT: Maybe we have the momentum
to start a third-wave feminist movement

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.656
with our sisterhood around the world,

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.856
with women we don't see,
women we may never meet,

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.376
but we join together that way,

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.616
because --

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.840
Aristotle said --

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.136
most people --

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.056
people would die without male friendships.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.336
And the operative word here was "male."

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.296
Because they thought that friendships
should be between equals

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.536
and women were not considered equal --

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.016
JF: They didn't think
we had souls even, the Greeks.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.896
LT: No, exactly. That shows you
just how limited Aristotle was.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.600
(Laughter)

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.416
And wait, no, here's the best part.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.056
It's like, you know,
men do need women now.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.216
The planet needs women.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.696
The US Constitution needs women.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.496
We are not even in the Constitution.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.976
JF: You're talking about
the Equal Rights Amendment.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.158
LT: Right.

00:14:38.182 --> 00:14:42.080
Justice Ginsberg said something like --

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.496
every constitution that's been written
since the end of World War II

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.496
included a provision that made women
citizens of equal stature,

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.216
but ours does not.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.136
So that would be a good place to start.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.216
Very, very mild --

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.456
JF: Right.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.680
(Applause)

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.856
And gender equality, it's like a tide,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.816
it would lift all boats, not just women.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.376
PM: Needing new role models
on how to do that.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.816
How to be friends,

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.736
how to think about our power
in different ways,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.976
as consumers,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.656
as citizens of the world,

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.096
and this is what makes Jane and Lily

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.856
a role model of how
women can be friends --

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.496
for a very long time,

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.936
and even if they occasionally disagree.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.160
Thank you.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.576
Thank you both.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.816
(Applause)

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.040
JF: Thanks.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.776
LT: Thank you.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.000
JF: Thank you.

00:15:38.053 --> 00:15:43.120
(Applause)
