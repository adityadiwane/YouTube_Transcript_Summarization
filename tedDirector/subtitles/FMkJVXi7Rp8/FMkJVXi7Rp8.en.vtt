You know, when Chris first approached me
to speak at TED, I said no,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.143
because I felt
like I wasn't going to be able

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:36.406
to make that personal connection,
you know, that I wanted to.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.976
It's such a large conference.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.499
But he explained to me
that he was in a bind,

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:43.976
and that he was having trouble
finding the kind of sex appeal

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.976
and star power that
the conference was known for.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.835
So I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.976
I'll come on two conditions.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.842
One: I want to speak as early
in the morning as possible.

00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:01.616
And two: I want to pick
the theme for TED 2006.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.749
And luckily he agreed.

00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:08.455
And the theme, in two years,
is going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies."

I know this letter
will come to you surprisingly,

but let it not be a surprise to you,

00:02:21.368 --> 00:02:24.304
for nature has a way
of arriving unannounced,

but their echoes sound ouder.

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:30.976
So I decided to contact you myself,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.048
for you to assure me
of safety and honesty,

00:02:33.072 --> 00:02:37.436

under your custody.

I am Mr Micheal Bangura,
the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.167
who was the Minister of Finance

Knowing your country to be
economical conducive for investment,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.564
and your people as transparent
and trustworthy to engage in business,

00:02:56.588 --> 00:02:58.231
on which premise I write you.

Before my father death,

00:03:01.877 --> 00:03:05.558
he had the sum of 23 million
United States dollars,

00:03:05.582 --> 00:03:08.980
which he kept away from the rebel
leaders during the course of the war.

00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:11.396
(Laughter)

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.062
This fund was supposed to be used

00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:16.510
for the rehabilitation of water reserves
all over the country,

00:03:16.534 --> 00:03:18.482
before the outbreak of war.

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:20.531
When the war broke out,

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:23.001
the rebel leader demanded
the fund be given to him,

00:03:23.025 --> 00:03:26.328
my father insisted it
was not in his possession,

00:03:26.352 --> 00:03:29.267
and he was killed because of his refusal
to release the fund.

00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:30.898
Meanwhile, my mother and I

00:03:30.922 --> 00:03:34.744

because my father always confide in me.

00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:38.520

with a Red Cross relief worker,

00:03:38.544 --> 00:03:42.117
who used his official van to transport
the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown,

00:03:42.141 --> 00:03:44.666
although he did not know
the real contents of the box.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.303
(Laughter)

00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:49.276
The fund was deposited
as a family reasure,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.976
in a safe, reliable security company
in Dakar, Senegal,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.976
where I was only given temporary asylum.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.976
I do not wish to invest
the money in Senegal

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.743
due to unfavorable economic climate,
and so close to my country.

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:06.787
The only assistance I need from you,
which I know you would do for me,

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:09.752
are the following:
one, be a silent partner

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:11.976
and receive the funds
in your account in trust;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.377
two, provide a bank account
under your control

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:17.344
to which the funds will be remitted;

00:04:17.368 --> 00:04:20.976
three, receive the funds
into your account in trust;

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.465
take out your commission;
and leave the rest of the money

00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:26.976
until I arrive,
after the transfer is complete.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.535

with Google over your lifetime,

"What was I going to say next?"

00:06:42.154 --> 00:06:43.852
and my name, and it would tell me.

00:06:43.876 --> 00:06:47.090

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.976
(Laughter)

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.915
And I know what you're saying,

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.170
"Holy crap!

00:10:07.194 --> 00:10:08.976
How is his presentation so smooth?"

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.348
(Laughter)

00:10:12.372 --> 00:10:15.195
And I have to say
that it's not all me this year.

00:10:15.219 --> 00:10:19.976
I guess Chris has to take some credit
here, because in years past,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.710
I guess there's been
some sort of subpar speakers at TED.

00:10:22.734 --> 00:10:23.976
I don't know.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.976
And so, this year, Chris sent us
a TED conference simulator.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.407
(Laughter)

00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:34.976
Which really allowed us as speakers
to get there, in the trenches,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.976
and practice at home so that we would be
ready for this experience.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.976
And I've got to say that, you know,
it's really, really great to be here.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.845
(Pre-recorded applause)

00:10:45.869 --> 00:10:47.965
I'd like to tell all of you a little joke.

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:50.454
(Pre-recorded applause and cheering)

00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:52.611
Not just the good stuff, though.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.627
You can do heckler mode.

00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:58.375
Voice: Hey, moron, get off the stage!

00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.976
ZF: You get off the stage.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.976
(Laughter)

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.195
Voice: We want Malcolm Gladwell.

00:11:04.219 --> 00:11:07.970
(Laughter)

00:11:07.994 --> 00:11:10.389
(Baby cooing)

00:11:10.413 --> 00:11:15.886
(Huge crowd applauding)

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.484
In case you run over time.

00:11:17.508 --> 00:11:18.658
(Heroic music)

00:11:18.682 --> 00:11:21.076
Just one last thing
I'd like to say, I'd, really --

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.976
(Laughter)

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.343
I'd like to thank all of you
for being here.

00:11:25.367 --> 00:11:26.530
(Loud music)

00:11:26.554 --> 00:11:28.690
(Laughter)

00:11:28.714 --> 00:11:30.118
And frog mode.

00:11:30.142 --> 00:11:32.959
(Singing)

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.371
(Sings) "Ah, the first time that I made
love to a rock shrimp --"

00:11:45.395 --> 00:11:48.842
(Laughter)

00:11:48.866 --> 00:11:51.466
[Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes]

00:11:52.104 --> 00:11:53.176
(Sighs)

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.472
It's true.

00:11:54.496 --> 00:11:57.168
Some people say to me,

00:11:57.192 --> 00:11:59.731
"Ze, you're doing all this stuff,
this Internet stuff,

00:11:59.755 --> 00:12:01.386
and you're not making any money."

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.976
(Laughter)

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.328
"Why?" And I say, "Mom, Dad --

00:12:06.352 --> 00:12:09.976
(Laughter)

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.194
I'm trying."

00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:13.976
I don't know if you're all aware of this,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.976
but the video game market,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.844
kids are playing these video games,

00:12:18.868 --> 00:12:20.920
but, supposedly, there's tons of money.

00:12:20.944 --> 00:12:24.167
I mean, like, I think,
100,000 dollars or so a year

00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:25.786
is being spent on these things.

00:12:26.239 --> 00:12:29.797
So I decided to try my hand.

00:12:30.177 --> 00:12:31.604
I came up with a few games.

00:12:31.628 --> 00:12:33.722
(Laughter)

00:12:33.746 --> 00:12:34.976
This is called "Atheist."

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.643
I figured it would be popular
with the young kids.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.364
OK.

00:12:39.388 --> 00:12:42.000
Look, I'll move around
and say some things.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.560
(Sighs)

00:12:45.218 --> 00:12:47.526
[Game over. There is no replay.]

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.328
(Laughter)

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:50.976
So that didn't go over so well.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.333
(Laughter)

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:56.627
I don't really understand
why you're laughing.

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:57.976
(Laughter)

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.479
Should have done this
before I tried to pitch it.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.976
"Buddhist," of course, looks
very, very similar to "Atheist."

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.085
(Laughter)

00:13:07.109 --> 00:13:08.976
But you come back as a duck.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.976
(Laughter)

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.429
And this is great because,
you know, for a quarter,

00:13:17.453 --> 00:13:19.429
you can play this for a long time.

00:13:19.453 --> 00:13:20.977
(Laughter)

00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:22.778
And Chris had said in an email

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.149
that we should really bring
something new to TED,

00:13:25.173 --> 00:13:27.625
something that we haven't shown anyone.

00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:30.976
So, I made this for TED. It's "Christian."

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.454
It's the third in the series.

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.610
I'm hoping it's going
to do well this year.

00:13:35.191 --> 00:13:36.341
(Sighs)

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.976
(Laughter)

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.254
Do you have a preference?

00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:43.407
(Laughter)

00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:44.581
Good choice.

00:13:44.605 --> 00:13:47.647
(Laughter)

00:13:47.671 --> 00:13:50.381
So you can wait for the Second Coming,

00:13:50.405 --> 00:13:54.976
which is a random number
between one and 500 million.

00:13:55.744 --> 00:13:58.926
(Laughter)

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.717
So really, what are we talking about here?

00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:02.976
Oh, tech joy.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.393
(Laughter)

00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:09.119
Tech joy, to me, means something,
because I get a lot of joy out of tech.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.976
And in fact, making things
using technology --

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.428
and I'm being serious here,

00:14:15.452 --> 00:14:18.597
even though I'm using
my sarcastic voice -- I won't -- hold on.

00:14:19.657 --> 00:14:22.712
Making things, you know --

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:25.042
making things actually
does give me a lot of joy.

00:14:25.066 --> 00:14:27.381
It's the process of creation that keeps me

00:14:27.405 --> 00:14:30.976
sort of a bubble and a half
above perpetual anxiety in my life,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.429
and it's that feeling of being
about 80 percent complete on a project --

00:14:34.453 --> 00:14:36.644
where you know you still have
something to do,

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:39.976
but it's not finished,
and you're not starting something --

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.690
that really fills my entire life.

00:14:42.714 --> 00:14:44.548
And so, what I've done is,

00:14:44.572 --> 00:14:48.178
I started getting interested
in creating online social spaces

00:14:48.202 --> 00:14:49.672
to share that feeling

00:14:49.696 --> 00:14:52.100
with people who don't consider
themselves artists.

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:54.598
We're in a culture of guru-ship.

00:14:54.622 --> 00:14:58.454
It's so hard to use some software
because, you know, it's unapproachable,

00:14:58.478 --> 00:15:01.054
people feel like they have
to read the manual.

00:15:01.078 --> 00:15:06.670
So I try to create
these very minimal activities

00:15:06.694 --> 00:15:10.124
that allow people to express
themselves, and, hopefully --

00:15:10.148 --> 00:15:13.976
("The End" by The Doors)

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.976
Whoa! I'm like -- on the page,
but it doesn't exist.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.362
(Laughter)

00:15:21.386 --> 00:15:24.374
It's, like -- seriously, though --

00:15:24.398 --> 00:15:26.976
(Laughter)

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.976
I try to create meaningful environments
for people to express themselves.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.063
(Laughter)

00:15:32.087 --> 00:15:35.976
Here I created a contest called,
"When Office Supplies Attack,"

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.976
which, I think, really resonated
with the working population.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.158
(Laughter)

00:15:42.182 --> 00:15:45.643
Over 500 entries in three weeks.

00:15:46.554 --> 00:15:47.976
Toilet paper fashion.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.843
(Laughter)

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.154
Again, people from all over the country.

00:15:53.178 --> 00:15:55.286
The watch is particularly incredible.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.976
(Laughter)

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.784
Online drawing tools --
you've probably seen a lot of them.

00:16:00.808 --> 00:16:02.055
I think they're wonderful.

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:04.551
It's a chance for people
to get to play with crayons

00:16:04.575 --> 00:16:05.861
and all that kind of stuff.

00:16:05.885 --> 00:16:08.238
But I'm interested
in the process of creating,

00:16:08.262 --> 00:16:11.440
as the real event that I'm interested in.

00:16:11.464 --> 00:16:15.598
And the problem is that
a lot of people suck at drawing,

00:16:15.622 --> 00:16:19.588
and they get bummed out at this,
sort of, you know, stick figure,

00:16:19.612 --> 00:16:21.815
awful little thing that they created.

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:24.976
And eventually, it just makes them
stop playing with it,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.521
or they draw penises and things like that.

00:16:27.545 --> 00:16:28.976
(Laughter)

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.405
So, the Scribbler is an attempt
to create a generative tool.

00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:34.976
In other words, it's a helping tool.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.810
You can draw your simple stick figure,

00:16:36.834 --> 00:16:40.976
and it collaborates with you to create
sort of a post-war German etching.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.206
(Laughter)

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:50.055
In fact, it's tuned to be better
at drawing things that look worse.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.944
So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling.

00:16:54.888 --> 00:16:58.976
So the idea is that you can really,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.976
you know, partake in this process,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.976
but watch something
really crappy look beautiful.

00:17:05.853 --> 00:17:07.563
And here are some of my favorites.

00:17:07.587 --> 00:17:11.445
This is the little trap marionette
that was submitted to me.

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.548
Very cool.

00:17:15.572 --> 00:17:16.693
(Laughter)

00:17:18.257 --> 00:17:19.486
Darling.

00:17:20.201 --> 00:17:21.490
Beautiful stuff.

00:17:22.713 --> 00:17:24.391
I mean this is incredible.

00:17:24.415 --> 00:17:27.116
An 11-year-old girl drew this
and submitted it.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.847
It's just gorgeous.

00:17:28.871 --> 00:17:30.395
(Laughter)

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:32.187
I'm dead serious here.

00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:33.658
This is not a joke.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.976
(Laughter)

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.295
But, I think it's a really fun
and wonderful thing.

00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:42.481
So this is called the "Fiction Project."

00:17:42.505 --> 00:17:44.478
This is an online space,

00:17:44.502 --> 00:17:47.976
which is basically
a refurbished message board

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.730
that encourages collaborative
fiction writing.

00:17:50.754 --> 00:17:51.976
These are haikus.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.381
None of the haikus were written
by the same person.

00:17:54.405 --> 00:17:58.361
In fact, each line is contributed
by a different person

00:17:58.385 --> 00:17:59.976
at a different time.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.842
I think that the "now tied up, tied down,

00:18:03.866 --> 00:18:06.646
mistress cruel approaches me,
now tied down, it's up."

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.976
It's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.428
if you come home, and your spouse,
or whoever it is,

00:18:16.452 --> 00:18:18.198
says, "Let's talk" --

00:18:20.063 --> 00:18:23.545
That, like, chills you to the very core.

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:24.624
(Laughter)

00:18:24.648 --> 00:18:26.823
But it's peripheral activities like these

00:18:26.847 --> 00:18:29.976
that allow people to get together,
doing fun things.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.762
They actually get to know each other,

00:18:31.786 --> 00:18:35.356
and it's sort of like low-threshold
peripheral activities

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.346
that I think are the key to bringing up

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:39.894
some of our bonding social capital
that we're lacking.

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:42.282
And very, very quickly --
I love puppets.

00:18:42.306 --> 00:18:44.291
Here's a puppet.

00:18:44.315 --> 00:18:45.499
It dances to music.

00:18:45.523 --> 00:18:49.976
Lotte Reiniger, an amazing
shadow puppeteer in the 20s,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.969
that started doing more elaborate things.

00:18:51.993 --> 00:18:53.470
I became interested in puppets,

00:18:53.494 --> 00:18:55.683
and I just want to show
one last thing to you.

00:18:55.707 --> 00:18:57.279
Oh, this is how you make puppets.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:58.889
(Applause)

00:18:58.913 --> 00:19:01.429
Chris Anderson: Ladies
and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.

00:19:01.453 --> 00:19:04.453
(Applause)
