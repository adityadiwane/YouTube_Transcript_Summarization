00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:15.768
At Free America, we've done
a listening and learning tour.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.834
We visited not only with prosecutors

00:00:19.858 --> 00:00:21.604
but with legislators,

00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:26.489
with inmates in our state
and local prisons.

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:29.932
We've gone to immigration
detention centers.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.675
We've met a lot of people.

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:39.398
And we've seen that redemption
and transformation can happen

00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:44.109
in our prisons, our jails
and our immigration detention centers,

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.150
giving hope to those
who want to create a better life

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:48.842
after serving their time.

00:00:50.028 --> 00:00:53.596
Imagine if we also considered
the front end of this prison pipeline.

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:55.905
What would it look like
if we intervened,

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.882
with rehabilitation as a core value --

00:00:58.906 --> 00:01:01.940
with love and compassion as core values?

00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:04.822
We would have a society that is safer,

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:05.997
healthier

00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:07.870
and worthy of raising our children in.

00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:11.536
I want to introduce you to James Cavitt.

00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:16.539
James served 12 years
in the San Quentin State Prison

00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:19.213
and is being released in 18 months.

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:21.774
Now James, like you and me,

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:24.714
is more than the worst thing he's done.

00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:28.608
He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet.

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:30.882
He committed a crime;

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:32.523
he's paying his debt,

00:01:32.547 --> 00:01:35.011
and working hard to build the skills

00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:38.122
to make the transition back
to a productive life

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:41.783
when he enters the civilian
population again.

00:01:41.807 --> 00:01:44.461
Now James, like millions
of people behind bars,

00:01:44.485 --> 00:01:46.520
is an example of what happens

00:01:46.544 --> 00:01:50.995
if we believe that our failings
don't define who we are,

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:53.321
that we are all worthy of redemption

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:57.582
and if we support those impacted
by mass incarceration,

00:01:57.606 --> 00:01:59.233
we can all heal together.

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:02.320
I'd like to introduce you
to James right now,

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:04.828
and he's going to share
his journey of redemption

00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:06.002
through spoken word.

00:02:08.432 --> 00:02:09.782
James Cavitt: Thanks, John.

00:02:09.806 --> 00:02:11.721
TED, welcome to San Quentin.

00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:15.195
The talent is abundant
behind prison walls.

00:02:15.608 --> 00:02:17.640
Future software engineers,

00:02:17.664 --> 00:02:18.943
entrepreneurs,

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:20.118
craftsmen,

00:02:20.142 --> 00:02:21.293
musicians

00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:22.600
and artists.

00:02:22.624 --> 00:02:25.721
This piece is inspired
by all of the hard work

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.973
that men and women are doing on the inside

00:02:28.997 --> 00:02:32.322
to create better lives
and futures for themselves

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:34.179
after they serve their time.

00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:38.518
This piece is entitled, "Where I Live."

00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:43.852
I live in a world where most people
are too afraid to go.

00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:46.777
Surrounded by tall, concrete walls,

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:47.952
steel bars,

00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:49.270
where razor wire have a way

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:52.380
of cutting away at the hopes
for a brighter tomorrow.

00:02:53.697 --> 00:02:54.848
I live in a world

00:02:54.872 --> 00:02:56.405
that kill people who kill people

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:57.580
in order to teach people

00:02:57.604 --> 00:02:59.000
that killing people is wrong.

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:01.577
Imagine that.

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.262
Better yet,

00:03:03.286 --> 00:03:06.356
imagine a world where healed people
helped hurt people heal

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.633
and become strong.

00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:11.618
Maybe then we would all
be singin' "Redemption Song."

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.989
I live in a world that
has been called "hell on Earth"

00:03:16.013 --> 00:03:17.723
by those trapped inside.

00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:20.969
But I've come to the stark realization

00:03:20.993 --> 00:03:22.197
that prison --

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.316
it really is what you make it.

00:03:25.192 --> 00:03:27.907
You see, in spite
of the harshness of my reality,

00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:29.391
there is a silver lining.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.288
I knew that my freedom was gonna come,

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:33.701
it was just a matter of time.

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:37.117
And so I treated my first steps
as if they were my last mile,

00:03:37.141 --> 00:03:40.098
and I realized that you
don't have to be free

00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:41.791
in order to experience freedom.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.649
And just because you're free,

00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:46.470
doesn't mean that you have freedom.

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:50.242
Many of us, for years,
have been battling our inner demons.

00:03:50.266 --> 00:03:53.607
We walk around smiling
when inside we're really screamin':

00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:54.781
freedom!

00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.321
Don't you get it?

00:03:58.018 --> 00:03:59.503
We're all serving time;

00:03:59.527 --> 00:04:01.099
we're just in different places.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.931
As for me,

00:04:02.955 --> 00:04:05.535
I choose to be free
from the prisons I've created.

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:06.710
The key:

00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:07.885
forgiveness.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.060
Action's my witness.

00:04:09.084 --> 00:04:10.234
If we want freedom,

00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:12.669
then we gotta think different.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.840
Because freedom ...

00:04:17.227 --> 00:04:18.377
it isn't a place.

00:04:19.783 --> 00:04:20.933
It's a mind setting.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:24.147
Thank you.

00:04:24.171 --> 00:04:27.512
(Applause)

00:04:27.536 --> 00:04:34.536
(Piano)

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.710
John Legend: Old pirates, yes, they rob I.

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:52.987
Sold I to the merchant ships.

00:04:55.414 --> 00:04:59.598
Minutes after they took I

00:04:59.622 --> 00:05:01.589
from the bottomless pit.

00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:06.977
My hands were made strong

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.207
by the hand of the almighty.

00:05:12.213 --> 00:05:15.371
We forward in this generation

00:05:17.798 --> 00:05:19.844
triumphantly.

00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:24.851
Won't you help to sing

00:05:26.686 --> 00:05:29.401
these songs of freedom?

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:32.754
'Cause all I ever had --

00:05:35.238 --> 00:05:37.603
redemption songs.

00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:42.153
Redemption songs.

00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:48.253
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.

00:05:48.277 --> 00:05:51.848
None but ourselves can free our minds.

00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:56.447
Have no fear for atomic energy

00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:00.566
'cause none of them can stop the time.

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.609
How long shall they kill our prophets

00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:08.395
while we stand aside and look?

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:13.677
Some say it's just a part of it,

00:06:14.447 --> 00:06:16.971
we've got to fulfill the book.

00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:22.226
Won't you help to sing

00:06:24.048 --> 00:06:26.468
these songs of freedom?

00:06:27.263 --> 00:06:30.183
'Cause all I ever had --

00:06:32.322 --> 00:06:34.671
redemption songs.

00:06:36.387 --> 00:06:38.752
Redemption songs.

00:06:38.776 --> 00:06:45.776
(Piano)

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.735
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.

00:07:00.423 --> 00:07:04.113
None but ourselves can free our minds.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.404
Have no fear for atomic energy

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:12.281
'cause none of them can stop the time.

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:16.440
How long shall they kill our prophets

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:20.154
while we stand aside and look?

00:07:20.178 --> 00:07:24.746
Some say it's just a part of it,

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:28.317
we've got to fulfill the book.

00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:33.397
Won't you help to sing

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:37.634
these songs of freedom?

00:07:38.418 --> 00:07:41.354
'Cause all I ever had --

00:07:43.508 --> 00:07:46.167
redemption songs.

00:07:47.828 --> 00:07:50.238
Redemption songs.

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:54.412
These songs of freedom.

00:07:55.428 --> 00:07:59.666
'Cause all I ever had --

00:08:00.883 --> 00:08:03.215
redemption songs.

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:07.663
Redemption songs.

00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:16.695
Redemption songs.

00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:19.451
(Piano)

00:08:19.475 --> 00:08:26.057
(Applause)

00:08:26.081 --> 00:08:27.231
Thank you.

00:08:27.584 --> 00:08:28.736
Thank you.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:35.667
(Applause)
