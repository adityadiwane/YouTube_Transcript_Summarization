00:00:12.598 --> 00:00:15.211
It was the middle of summer
and well past closing time

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:17.898
in the downtown Berkeley bar
where my friend Polly and I

00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:20.239
worked together as bartenders.

00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:24.485
Usually at the end of our shift
we had a drink -- but not that night.

00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:26.737
"I'm pregnant.

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:30.266
Not sure what I'm going
to do yet," I told Polly.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.912
Without hesitation, she replied,
"I've had an abortion."

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:39.624
Before Polly, no one had ever told me
that she'd had an abortion.

00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:43.336
I'd graduated from college
just a few months earlier

00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:46.961
and I was in a new relationship
when I found out that I was pregnant.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:52.484
When I thought about my choices,
I honestly did not know how to decide,

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:54.809
what criteria I should use.

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:57.758
How would I know what
the right decision was?

00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:01.682
I worried that I would regret 
an abortion later.

00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:05.726
Coming of age on the beaches
of Southern California,

00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:08.787
I grew up in the middle of 
our nation's abortion wars.

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:14.290
I was born in a trailer on the third
anniversary of Roe vs. Wade.

00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:18.265
Our community was surfing Christians.

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:21.650
We cared about God, the less fortunate,
and the ocean.

00:01:22.022 --> 00:01:23.740
Everyone was pro-life.

00:01:24.413 --> 00:01:30.125
As a kid, the idea of abortion made me so
sad that I knew if I ever got pregnant

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:31.522
I could never have one.

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:34.560
And then I did.

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.809
It was a step towards the unknown.

00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:42.305
But Polly had given me
a very special gift:

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:44.687
the knowledge that I wasn't alone

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:48.747
and the realization that abortion
was something that we can talk about.

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:50.883
Abortion is common.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.678
According to the Guttmacher Institute,
one in three women in America

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.152
will have an abortion in their lifetime.

00:02:00.147 --> 00:02:04.050
But for the last few decades, the dialogue
around abortion in the United States

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.461
has left little room for anything beyond 
pro-life and pro-choice.

00:02:07.944 --> 00:02:10.278
It's political and polarizing.

00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:14.962
But as much as abortion is hotly debated,
it's still rare for us,

00:02:14.982 --> 00:02:18.898
whether as fellow women
or even just as fellow people,

00:02:18.898 --> 00:02:22.994
to talk with one another
about the abortions that we have.

00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:25.176
There is a gap.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.215
Between what happens in politics
and what happens in real life,

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.469
and in that gap, a battlefield mentality.

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:34.696
An "are you with us 
or against us?" stance takes root.

00:02:36.058 --> 00:02:38.550
This isn't just about abortion.

00:02:38.655 --> 00:02:43.032
There are so many important issues 
that we can't talk about.

00:02:44.278 --> 00:02:49.524
And so finding ways to shift the conflict
to a place of conversation

00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:51.576
is the work of my life.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.127
There are two main ways to get started.

00:02:56.332 --> 00:02:58.472
One way is to listen closely.

00:02:58.634 --> 00:03:01.328
And the other way is to share stories.

00:03:03.073 --> 00:03:06.645
So, 15 years ago, I cofounded
an organization called Exhale

00:03:06.664 --> 00:03:09.315
to start listening to people 
who have had abortions.

00:03:10.593 --> 00:03:13.963
The first thing we did was create 
a talk-line, where women and men

00:03:13.963 --> 00:03:16.003
could call to get emotional support.

00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:21.041
Free of judgment and politics,
believe it or not, nothing like our sevice

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:22.457
had ever existed.

00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:28.467
We needed a new framework that could 
hold all the experiences that we were

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:30.375
hearing on our talk-line.

00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:33.115
The feminist who regrets her abortion.

00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:36.017
The Catholic who is grateful for hers.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:40.800
The personal experiences that weren't 
fitting neatly into one box or the other.

00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:44.957
We didn't think it was right 
to ask women to pick a side.

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:50.320
We wanted to show them that
the whole world was on their side,

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:54.825
as they were going through this deeply
personal experience.

00:03:54.964 --> 00:03:56.775
So we invented "pro-voice."

00:03:58.191 --> 00:04:02.719
Beyond abortion, pro-voice works on hard
issues that we've struggled with globally

00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:03.973
for years,

00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:09.315
issues like immigration, religious
tolerance, violence against women.

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:13.307
It also works on deeply personal topics 
that might only matter to you

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:15.305
and your immediate family and friends.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.796
They have a terminal illness, 
their mother just died,

00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:23.523
they have a child with special needs
and they can't talk about it.

00:04:25.636 --> 00:04:30.048
Listening and storytelling are
the hallmarks of pro-voice practice.

00:04:31.302 --> 00:04:32.927
Listening and storytelling.

00:04:33.484 --> 00:04:35.156
That sounds pretty nice.

00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:38.848
Sounds maybe, easy?
We could all do that.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.161
It's not easy.
It's very hard.

00:04:42.354 --> 00:04:48.182
Pro-voice is hard because we are talking
about things everyone's fighting about

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:50.620
or the things that no one 
wants to talk about.

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:58.327
I wish I could tell you that when you 
decide to be pro-voice, that you'll find

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:02.042
beautiful moments of breakthrough 
and gardens full of flowers,

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:06.245
where listening and storytelling
creates wonderful "a-ha" moments.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.279
I wish I could tell you that there would
be a feminist welcoming party for you,

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:14.641
or that there's a long-lost sisterhood
of people who are just ready

00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:17.001
to have your back when you get slammed.

00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:22.546
But it can be vulnerable and exhausting 
to tell our own stories

00:05:22.546 --> 00:05:24.875
when it feels like nobody cares.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.755
And if we truly listen to one another,

00:05:30.755 --> 00:05:36.713
we will hear things that demand
that we shift our own perceptions.

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:40.827
There is no perfect time
and there is no perfect place

00:05:40.827 --> 00:05:43.470
to start a difficult conversation.

00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:49.297
There's never a time when everyone will be
on the same page, share the same lens,

00:05:49.414 --> 00:05:51.620
or know the same history.

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:58.470
So, let's talk about listening
and how to be a good listener.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.608
There's lots of ways to be a good listener
and I'm going to give you just a couple.

00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:05.528
One is to ask open-ended questions.

00:06:05.807 --> 00:06:08.519
You can ask yourself or someone 
that you know,

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:11.519
"How are you feeling?"

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:13.005
"What was that like?"

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:16.255
"What do you hope for, now?"

00:06:18.368 --> 00:06:22.339
Another way to be a good listener 
is to use reflective language.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.661
If someone is talking about
their own personal experience,

00:06:25.661 --> 00:06:28.074
use the words that they use.

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.487
If someone is talking about an abortion
and they say the word "baby,"

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:33.043
you can say "baby."

00:06:33.483 --> 00:06:35.550
If they say "fetus,"
you can say "fetus."

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.219
If someone describes themselves
as gender queer to you,

00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:40.914
you can say "gender queer."

00:06:41.782 --> 00:06:45.372
If someone kind of looks like a he,
but they say they're a she -- it's cool.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.787
Call that person a she.

00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:51.618
When we reflect the language of the person
who is sharing their own story,

00:06:51.647 --> 00:06:56.998
we are conveying that we are interested
in understanding who they are

00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:58.896
and what they're going through.

00:06:59.745 --> 00:07:03.843
The same way that we hope people are 
interested in knowing us.

00:07:05.062 --> 00:07:08.473
So, I'll never forget being in one 
of the Exhale counselor meetings,

00:07:08.473 --> 00:07:12.374
listening to a volunteer talk about how
she was getting a lot of calls

00:07:12.374 --> 00:07:15.069
from Christian women who 
were talking about God.

00:07:16.114 --> 00:07:20.038
Now, some of our volunteers are religious,
but this particular one was not.

00:07:20.247 --> 00:07:24.138
At first, it felt a little weird for her 
to talk to callers about God.

00:07:24.852 --> 00:07:27.282
So, she decided to get comfortable.

00:07:27.282 --> 00:07:31.137
And she stood in front of her mirror 
at home, and she said the word "God."

00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:32.375
"God."

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:33.505
"God."

00:07:33.505 --> 00:07:34.225
"God."

00:07:34.225 --> 00:07:34.945
"God."

00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:36.027
"God."

00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:36.982
"God."

00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:41.081
Over and over and over again
until the word no longer felt strange

00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:43.211
coming out her mouth.

00:07:43.455 --> 00:07:47.325
Saying the word God did not turn this 
volunteer into a Christian,

00:07:47.395 --> 00:07:52.186
but it did make her a much 
better listener of Christian women.

00:07:54.693 --> 00:07:58.576
So, another way to be pro-voice
is to share stories,

00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:02.796
and one risk that you take on, when you
share your story with someone else,

00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:05.983
is that given the same
set of circumstances as you

00:08:05.983 --> 00:08:08.578
they might actually
make a different decision.

00:08:09.227 --> 00:08:13.423
For example, if you're telling a story 
about your abortion,

00:08:13.423 --> 00:08:16.403
realize that she might have had the baby.

00:08:18.284 --> 00:08:20.257
She might have placed for adoption.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.598
She might have told her parents 
and her partner -- or not.

00:08:26.503 --> 00:08:32.215
She might have felt relief and confidence,
even though you felt sad and lost.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.237
This is okay.

00:08:35.723 --> 00:08:41.063
Empathy gets created the moment we
imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes.

00:08:41.606 --> 00:08:45.405
It doesn't mean we all have 
to end up in the same place.

00:08:46.729 --> 00:08:52.023
It's not agreement, it's not sameness
that pro-voice is after.

00:08:53.207 --> 00:08:58.965
It creates a culture and a society that 
values what make us special and unique.

00:08:59.569 --> 00:09:04.630
It values what makes us human,
our flaws and our imperfections.

00:09:04.932 --> 00:09:09.517
And this way of thinking allows us to see
our differences with respect,

00:09:09.551 --> 00:09:11.225
instead of fear.

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:14.600
And it generates the empathy that we need

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.026
to overcome all the ways
that we try to hurt one another.

00:09:18.026 --> 00:09:23.577
Stigma, shame, prejudice, 
discrimination, oppression.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.570
Pro-voice is contagious,
and the more it's practiced

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:31.193
the more it spreads.

00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:37.903
So, last year I was pregnant again.

00:09:38.253 --> 00:09:41.549
This time I was looking forward 
to the birth of my son.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:48.886
And while pregnant, I had never been asked
how I was feeling so much in all my life.

00:09:48.927 --> 00:09:50.062
(Laughter)

00:09:50.346 --> 00:09:54.366
And however I replied, whether I was
feeling wonderful and excited

00:09:54.408 --> 00:09:57.152
or scared and totally freaked out,

00:09:57.217 --> 00:10:01.578
there was always someone there
giving me a "been there" response.

00:10:01.578 --> 00:10:03.165
It was awesome.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.520
It was a welcome, yet dramatic
departure from what I experience

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.128
when I talk about
my mixed feelings of my abortion.

00:10:13.087 --> 00:10:16.864
Pro-voice is about the real stories
of real people

00:10:16.864 --> 00:10:19.444
making an impact on the way abortion

00:10:19.444 --> 00:10:23.542
and so many other politicized
and stigmatized issues

00:10:23.542 --> 00:10:25.642
are understood and discussed.

00:10:25.857 --> 00:10:30.309
From sexuality and mental health
to poverty and incarceration.

00:10:31.562 --> 00:10:35.050
Far beyond definition
as single right or wrong decisions,

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.435
our experiences can exist on a spectrum.

00:10:40.478 --> 00:10:44.800
Pro-voice focuses that conversation
on human experience

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.696
and it makes support and respect
possible for all.

00:10:50.755 --> 00:10:52.181
Thank you.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.199
(Applause)
