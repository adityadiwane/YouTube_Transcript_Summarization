00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
(Applause)

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that's going to tell you a little bit

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
about how we open user-generated content up for business.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, here's the first story.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
1906. This man, John Philip Sousa, traveled to this place,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the United States Capitol, to talk about this technology,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
what he called the, quote, "talking machines."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is what he had to say.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
"These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of music in this country.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
When I was a boy, in front of every house in the summer evenings,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
you would find young people together

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
singing the songs of the day, or the old songs.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Today, you hear these infernal machines going night and day.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We will not have a vocal chord left," Sousa said.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
"The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
as was the tail of man when he came from the ape."

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now, this is the picture I want you to focus on.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is a picture of culture.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We could describe it using modern computer terminology

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
as a kind of read-write culture.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's a culture where people participate in the creation

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
because of these, quote, "infernal machines." They would take it away.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And in its place, we'd have the opposite of read-write culture,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
what we could call read-only culture.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Culture where creativity was consumed

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
but the consumer is not a creator.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
A culture which is top-down, owned,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Now, as you look back at the twentieth century,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
at least in what we think of as the, quote, "developed world" --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
hard not to conclude that Sousa was right.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Never before in the history of human culture

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
had it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Never before has creativity of the millions

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
been as effectively displaced,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and displaced because of these, quote, "infernal machines."

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The twentieth century was that century

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
where, at least for those places we know the best,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So, second. Land is a kind of property --

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
it is property. It's protected by law.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
As Lord Blackstone described it, land is protected by trespass law,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
for most of the history of trespass law,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
by presuming it protects the land all the way down below

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and to an indefinite extent upward.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Now, that was a pretty good system

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
for most of the history of the regulation of land,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
until this technology came along, and people began to wonder,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
were these instruments trespassers

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
as they flew over land without clearing the rights

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
of the farms below as they traveled across the country?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Two farmers, Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby, who raised chickens,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
had a significant complaint because of these technologies.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
The complaint was that their

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and flew themselves into the walls of the barn

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
when the airplanes flew over the land.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
to say these airplanes were trespassing.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Since time immemorial, the law had said,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
so this flight must stop.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Well, the Supreme Court considered this 100-years tradition

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that the Causbys must lose.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
all the way to the sky has no place in the modern world,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
otherwise every transcontinental flight would

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
subject the operator to countless trespass suits.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Common sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was. Common sense --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter) --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Revolts at the idea. Common sense.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Finally. Before the Internet, the last great terror

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
to rain down on the content industry

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
was a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting:

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
a new way to spread content,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and therefore a new battle over the control

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
of the businesses that would spread content.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Now, at that time, the entity,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
the legal cartel, that controlled the performance rights

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
for most of the music that would be broadcast

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
using these technologies was ASCAP.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
They had an exclusive license on the most popular content,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to the broadcasters who really was in charge.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
until the broadcasters finally got together

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and said, okay, enough of this.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started something

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
called Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And BMI was much more democratic in the art

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that it would include within its repertoire,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
including African American music for the first time in the repertoire.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But most important was that BMI took public domain works

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and made arrangements of them, which they gave away for free

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
to their subscribers. So that in 1940,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
when ASCAP threatened to double their rates,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Now, ASCAP said they didn't care.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best music

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
was no longer available, because they had shifted

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
to the second best public domain provided by BMI.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Well, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And the important point to recognize

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
is that even though these broadcasters

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
were broadcasting something you would call second best,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
that competition was enough to break, at that time,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
this legal cartel over access to music.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Okay. Three stories. Here's the argument.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
In my view, the most significant thing to recognize

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
about what this Internet is doing

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
that Sousa romanticized.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Digital technology is the opportunity

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
for the revival of these vocal chords

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
that he spoke so passionately to Congress about.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
User-generated content, spreading in businesses

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
in extraordinarily valuable ways like these,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
celebrating amateur culture.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
By which I don't mean amateurish culture,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I mean culture where people produce

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
for the love of what they're doing and not for the money.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
For when you think of what Sousa romanticized

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
in the young people together, singing the songs of the day,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
of the old songs, you should recognize

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
what your kids are doing right now.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Taking the songs of the day and the old songs

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and remixing them to make them something different.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It's how they understand access to this culture.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So, let's have some very few examples

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
to get a sense of what I'm talking about here.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Here's something called Anime Music Video, first example,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
taking anime captured from television

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
re-edited to music tracks.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:31.000
(Music)

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
This one you should be -- confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:10:21.000
(Music)

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.000
(Laughter)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And this is the best.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
(Music)

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
My love ...

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
There's only you in my life ...

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
The only thing that's bright ...

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
My first love ...

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
You're every breath that I take ...

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
You're every step I make ...

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And I ....

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I want to share all my love with you ...

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
No one else will do ...

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And your eyes ...

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
They tell me how much you care ...

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
(Music)

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So, this is remix, right?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
(Applause)

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And it's important to emphasize that what this is not

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
is not what we call, quote, "piracy."

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I'm not talking about nor justifying

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
people taking other people's content in wholesale

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I'm talking about people taking and recreating

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
using other people's content, using digital technologies

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
to say things differently.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Now, the importance of this

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
is not the technique that you've seen here.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Because, of course, every technique that you've seen here

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
is something that television and film producers

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
have been able to do for the last 50 years.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
The importance is that that technique has been democratized.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It is now anybody with access to a $1,500 computer

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
who can take sounds and images from the culture around us

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and use it to say things differently.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
These tools of creativity have become tools of speech.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It is how our kids think. It is what your kids are

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
as they increasingly understand digital technologies

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and their relationship to themselves.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Now, in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
the law has not greeted this Sousa revival

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
with very much common sense.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Instead, the architecture of copyright law

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and the architecture of digital technologies,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
as they interact, have produced the presumption

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that these activities are illegal.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
is that every single use of culture produces a copy.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Every single use therefore requires permission;

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
without permission, you are a trespasser.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
You're a trespasser with about as much sense

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
as these people were trespassers.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Common sense here, though, has not yet revolted

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
in response to this response that the law has offered

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
to these forms of creativity.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Instead, what we've seen

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
is something much worse than a revolt.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
There's a growing extremism that comes from both sides

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
in this debate, in response to this conflict

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
between the law and the use of these technologies.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
One side builds new technologies, such as one recently announced

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
that will enable them

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
to automatically take down from sites like YouTube

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
any content that has any copyrighted content in it,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
whether or not there's a judgment of fair use

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
that might be applied to the use of that content.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And on the other side, among our kids,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
there's a growing copyright abolitionism,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
a generation that rejects the very notion

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
of what copyright is supposed to do, rejects copyright

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000
to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
a fact we should have learned many, many times over,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and both extremes in this debate are just wrong.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Now, the balance that I try to fight for,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
I, as any good liberal, try to fight for first

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
by looking to the government. Total mistake, right?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
(Laughter)

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
to do something to make the system make more sense.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It failed partly because the courts are too passive,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
partly because the legislatures are corrupted,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
by which I don't mean that there's bribery

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
operating to stop real change,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
means that policymakers here will not understand this

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
until it's too late to fix it.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
So, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And the solution here, in my view, is a private solution,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and to realize the economic potential of that,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Because, as BMI demonstrated, competition here

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
can achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
We don't have a public domain to draw upon now,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
so instead what we need is two types of changes.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
First, that artists and creators embrace the idea,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
choose that their work be made available more freely.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So, for example, they can say their work is available freely

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
for non-commercial, this amateur-type of use,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
but not freely for any commercial use.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And second, we need the businesses

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
that are building out this read-write culture

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
to embrace this opportunity expressly, to enable it,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
so that this ecology of free content, or freer content,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
can grow on a neutral platform

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
where they both exist simultaneously,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
so that more-free can compete with less-free,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
can teach one the lessons of the other.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Now, I would talk about one particular such plan

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
that I know something about,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
but I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
so I'm not going to talk about this at all.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
That artist choice is the key for new technology

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
having an opportunity to be open for business,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
and we need to build artist choice here

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
if these new technologies are to have that opportunity.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
But let me end with something I think much more important --

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
much more important than business.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
It's the point about how this connects to our kids.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
We have to recognize they're different from us. This is us, right?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
(Laughter)

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
We made mixed tapes; they remix music.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
We watched TV; they make TV.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
It is technology that has made them different,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
and as we see what this technology can do,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
we need to recognize you can't kill

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
the instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
We can't stop our kids from using it.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
We can only drive it underground.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
We can't make our kids passive again.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
We can only make them, quote, "pirates." And is that good?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
We live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
where in many areas of our life,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
we live life constantly against the law.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Ordinary people live life against the law,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
and that's what I -- we are doing to our kids.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
They live life knowing they live it against the law.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
That realization is extraordinarily corrosive,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
extraordinarily corrupting.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And in a democracy, we ought to be able to do better.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Do better, at least for them, if not for opening for business.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
(Applause)
