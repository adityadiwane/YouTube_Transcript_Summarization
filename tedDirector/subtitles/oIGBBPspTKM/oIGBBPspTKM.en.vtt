00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.151
About 10 years ago, I went through
a little bit of a hard time.

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:18.449
So I decided to go see a therapist.

00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:22.195
I had been seeing her for a few months,
when she looked at me one day and said,

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:25.063
"Who actually raised you
until you were three?"

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:29.146
Seemed like a weird question.
I said, "My parents."

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.148
And she said, "I don't think
that's actually the case;

00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:34.329
because if it were,

00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:38.175
we'd be dealing with things that are
far more complicated than just this."

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:42.487
It sounded like the setup to a joke,
but I knew she was serious.

00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:45.200
Because when I first started seeing her,

00:00:45.224 --> 00:00:47.830
I was trying to be
the funniest person in the room.

00:00:47.854 --> 00:00:52.012
And I would try and crack these jokes,
but she caught on to me really quickly,

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:55.813
and whenever I tried to make a joke,
she would look at me and say,

00:00:55.837 --> 00:00:58.967
"That is actually really sad."

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.888
(Laughter)

00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:02.088
It's terrible.

00:01:02.557 --> 00:01:06.044
So I knew I had to be serious,
and I asked my parents

00:01:06.068 --> 00:01:08.642
who had actually raised me
until I was three?

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.040
And to my surprise, they said

00:01:11.064 --> 00:01:14.814
my primary caregiver had been
a distant relative of the family.

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.291
I had called her my auntie.

00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:20.587
I remember my auntie so clearly,

00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:23.834
it felt like she had been part of my life
when I was much older.

00:01:24.312 --> 00:01:26.639
I remember the thick, straight hair,

00:01:26.663 --> 00:01:28.925
and how it would come around
me like a curtain

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:30.290
when she bent to pick me up;

00:01:30.314 --> 00:01:32.852
her soft, southern Thai accent;

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:34.706
the way I would cling to her,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.849
even if she just wanted to go
to the bathroom

00:01:36.873 --> 00:01:38.111
or get something to eat.

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:42.528
I loved her, but [with] the ferocity
that a child has sometimes

00:01:42.552 --> 00:01:47.470
before she understands that love
also requires letting go.

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:52.243
But my clearest and sharpest
memory of my auntie,

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:55.230
is also one of my first
memories of life at all.

00:01:56.345 --> 00:02:01.099
I remember her being beaten and slapped
by another member of my family.

00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:04.583
I remember screaming hysterically
and wanting it to stop,

00:02:04.607 --> 00:02:07.381
as I did every single time it happened,

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:10.142
for things as minor as wanting
to go out with her friends,

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:11.610
or being a little late.

00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:15.268
I became so hysterical over her treatment,

00:02:15.292 --> 00:02:19.502
that eventually, she was just
beaten behind closed doors.

00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:24.698
Things got so bad for her
that eventually she ran away.

00:02:25.424 --> 00:02:26.996
As an adult, I learned later

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.247
that she had been just 19
when she was brought over from Thailand

00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:34.249
to the States to care for me,
on a tourist visa.

00:02:35.674 --> 00:02:37.731
She wound up working
in Illinois for a time,

00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:40.185
before eventually returning to Thailand,

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.129
which is where I ran into her again,
at a political rally in Bangkok.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.592
I clung to her again, as I had
when I was a child,

00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:52.187
and I let go, and then
I promised that I would call.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.571
I never did, though.

00:02:55.536 --> 00:03:00.303
Because I was afraid if I said
everything that she meant to me --

00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:05.077
that I owed perhaps the best parts
of who I became to her care,

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:08.189
and that the words "I'm sorry"
were like a thimble

00:03:08.213 --> 00:03:12.638
to bail out all the guilt
and shame and rage I felt

00:03:12.662 --> 00:03:17.133
over everything she had endured
to care for me for as long as she had --

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.949
I thought if I said those words to her,
I would never stop crying again.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:26.304
Because she had saved me.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.481
And I had not saved her.

00:03:32.877 --> 00:03:36.321
I'm a journalist, and I've been writing
and researching human trafficking

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:38.446
for the past eight years or so,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.421
and even so, I never put together
this personal story

00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:45.491
with my professional life
until pretty recently.

00:03:46.234 --> 00:03:49.553
I think this profound disconnect
actually symbolizes

00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:52.284
most of our understanding
about human trafficking.

00:03:52.977 --> 00:03:58.604
Because human trafficking is far more
prevalent, complex and close to home

00:03:58.628 --> 00:04:00.240
than most of us realize.

00:04:01.377 --> 00:04:03.369
I spent time in jails and brothels,

00:04:03.393 --> 00:04:06.951
interviewed hundreds of survivors
and law enforcement, NGO workers.

00:04:07.578 --> 00:04:10.555
And when I think about what we've done
about human trafficking,

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.483
I am hugely disappointed.

00:04:13.284 --> 00:04:16.641
Partly because we don't even talk
about the problem right at all.

00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:19.987
When I say "human trafficking,"

00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:23.251
most of you probably don't think
about someone like my auntie.

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:26.551
You probably think
about a young girl or woman,

00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:30.007
who's been brutally forced
into prostitution by a violent pimp.

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.625
That is real suffering,
and that is a real story.

00:04:35.578 --> 00:04:36.861
That story makes me angry

00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:40.326
for far more than just the reality
of that situation, though.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.372
As a journalist, I really care about how
we relate to each other through language,

00:04:46.396 --> 00:04:50.087
and the way we tell that story,
with all the gory, violent detail,

00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:55.149
the salacious aspects -- I call that
"look at her scars" journalism.

00:04:55.782 --> 00:04:58.040
We use that story to convince ourselves

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:02.678
that human trafficking is a bad man
doing a bad thing to an innocent girl.

00:05:03.328 --> 00:05:05.224
That story lets us off the hook.

00:05:05.248 --> 00:05:08.986
It takes away all the societal context
that we might be indicted for,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.169
for the structural inequality,
or the poverty,

00:05:11.193 --> 00:05:12.946
or the barriers to migration.

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:14.840
We let ourselves think

00:05:14.864 --> 00:05:18.440
that human trafficking is only
about forced prostitution,

00:05:18.464 --> 00:05:19.979
when in reality,

00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:23.486
human trafficking is embedded
in our everyday lives.

00:05:24.771 --> 00:05:26.144
Let me show you what I mean.

00:05:26.996 --> 00:05:31.245
Forced prostitution accounts for
22 percent of human trafficking.

00:05:31.828 --> 00:05:35.799
Ten percent is in state-
imposed forced labor.

00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:39.986
but a whopping 68 percent
is for the purpose of creating the goods

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.640
and delivering the services
that most of us rely on every day,

00:05:44.664 --> 00:05:48.840
in sectors like agricultural work,
domestic work and construction.

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:52.381
That is food and care and shelter.

00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:55.429
And somehow, these most essential workers

00:05:55.453 --> 00:05:59.596
are also among the world's most underpaid
and exploited today.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.893
Human trafficking is the use
of force, fraud or coercion

00:06:05.917 --> 00:06:07.917
to compel another person's labor.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.244
And it's found in cotton fields,
and coltan mines,

00:06:11.268 --> 00:06:13.806
and even car washes in Norway and England.

00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:17.815
It's found in U.S. military
bases in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.313
It's found in Thailand's fishing industry.

00:06:20.726 --> 00:06:24.634
That country has become the largest
exporter of shrimp in the world.

00:06:25.248 --> 00:06:27.574
But what are the circumstances

00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:30.608
behind all that cheap
and plentiful shrimp?

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:35.965
Thai military were caught selling
Burmese and Cambodian migrants

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:37.349
onto fishing boats.

00:06:37.944 --> 00:06:41.041
Those fishing boats were taken out,
the men put to work,

00:06:41.065 --> 00:06:44.717
and they were thrown overboard
if they made the mistake of falling sick,

00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:46.725
or trying to resist their treatment.

00:06:47.368 --> 00:06:49.863
Those fish were then used to feed shrimp,

00:06:49.887 --> 00:06:54.321
The shrimp were then sold
to four major global retailers:

00:06:54.345 --> 00:06:58.532
Costco, Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour.

00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:04.450
Human trafficking is found
on a smaller scale than just that,

00:07:04.474 --> 00:07:06.672
and in places you would
never even imagine.

00:07:07.016 --> 00:07:10.001
Traffickers have forced young people
to drive ice cream trucks,

00:07:10.025 --> 00:07:12.170
or to sing in touring boys' choirs.

00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:16.366
Trafficking has even been found
in a hair braiding salon in New Jersey.

00:07:16.942 --> 00:07:19.029
The scheme in that case was incredible.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:25.623
The traffickers found young families
who were from Ghana and Togo,

00:07:25.647 --> 00:07:28.989
and they told these families that
"your daughters are going to get

00:07:29.013 --> 00:07:31.120
a fine education in the United States."

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:34.376
They then located winners
of the green card lottery,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.261
and they told them, "We'll help you out.

00:07:37.285 --> 00:07:40.264
We'll get you a plane ticket.
We'll pay your fees.

00:07:40.288 --> 00:07:43.260
All you have to do is take
this young girl with you,

00:07:43.284 --> 00:07:45.802
say that she's your sister or your spouse.

00:07:46.998 --> 00:07:50.261
Once everyone arrived in New Jersey,
the young girls were taken away,

00:07:50.285 --> 00:07:52.844
and put to work for 14-hour days,

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:55.758
seven days a week, for five years.

00:07:56.154 --> 00:07:59.984
They made their traffickers
nearly four million dollars.

00:08:02.345 --> 00:08:04.043
This is a huge problem.

00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:06.157
So what have we done about it?

00:08:07.049 --> 00:08:09.482
We've mostly turned
to the criminal justice system.

00:08:10.386 --> 00:08:14.394
But keep in mind, most victims of human
trafficking are poor and marginalized.

00:08:14.418 --> 00:08:16.424
They're migrants, people of color.

00:08:16.448 --> 00:08:18.130
Sometimes they're in the sex trade.

00:08:18.634 --> 00:08:20.800
And for populations like these,

00:08:20.824 --> 00:08:23.862
the criminal justice system is
too often part of the problem,

00:08:23.886 --> 00:08:25.338
rather than the solution.

00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:31.089
In study after study, in countries ranging
from Bangladesh to the United States,

00:08:31.113 --> 00:08:35.850
between 20 and 60 percent of the people
in the sex trade who were surveyed

00:08:35.874 --> 00:08:40.542
said that they had been raped or assaulted
by the police in the past year alone.

00:08:42.302 --> 00:08:45.969
People in prostitution, including people
who have been trafficked into it,

00:08:45.993 --> 00:08:49.314
regularly receive multiple
convictions for prostitution.

00:08:49.809 --> 00:08:52.873
Having that criminal record makes it
so much more difficult

00:08:52.897 --> 00:08:56.794
to leave poverty, leave abuse,
or leave prostitution,

00:08:56.818 --> 00:08:58.670
if that person so desires.

00:09:00.296 --> 00:09:02.232
Workers outside of the sex sector --

00:09:02.256 --> 00:09:06.284
if they try and resist their treatment,
they risk deportation.

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:10.328
In case after case I've studied,
employers have no problem

00:09:10.352 --> 00:09:13.795
calling on law enforcement
to try and threaten or deport

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:15.849
their striking trafficked workers.

00:09:16.718 --> 00:09:18.472
If those workers run away,

00:09:18.496 --> 00:09:23.208
they risk becoming part of the great mass
of undocumented workers

00:09:23.232 --> 00:09:26.684
who are also subject to the whims
of law enforcement if they're caught.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.860
Law enforcement is supposed to identify
victims and prosecute traffickers.

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:40.719
But out of an estimated 21 million victims
of human trafficking in the world,

00:09:40.743 --> 00:09:45.159
they have helped and identified
fewer than 50,000 people.

00:09:45.742 --> 00:09:47.361
That's like comparing

00:09:47.385 --> 00:09:51.256
the population of the world
to the population of Los Angeles,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.581
proportionally speaking.

00:09:53.997 --> 00:10:00.419
As for convictions, out of an estimated
5,700 convictions in 2013,

00:10:00.443 --> 00:10:03.278
fewer than 500 were for labor trafficking.

00:10:03.976 --> 00:10:05.668
Keep in mind that labor trafficking

00:10:05.692 --> 00:10:08.858
accounts for 68 percent
of all trafficking,

00:10:08.882 --> 00:10:11.945
but fewer than 10 percent
of the convictions.

00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:18.651
I've heard one expert say that trafficking
happens where need meets greed.

00:10:19.523 --> 00:10:21.793
I'd like to add one more element to that.

00:10:22.772 --> 00:10:26.927
Trafficking happens in sectors where
workers are excluded from protections,

00:10:26.951 --> 00:10:29.239
and denied the right to organize.

00:10:29.874 --> 00:10:32.035
Trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum.

00:10:32.538 --> 00:10:36.045
It happens in systematically
degraded work environments.

00:10:37.249 --> 00:10:38.400
You might be thinking,

00:10:38.424 --> 00:10:41.525
oh, she's talking about failed states,
or war-torn states, or --

00:10:41.549 --> 00:10:43.652
I'm actually talking
about the United States.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.270
Let me tell you what that looks like.

00:10:47.342 --> 00:10:50.835
I spent many months researching
a trafficking case called Global Horizons,

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.185
involving hundreds of Thai farm workers.

00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:56.801
They were sent all over the States,
to work in Hawaii pineapple plantations,

00:10:56.825 --> 00:10:59.926
and Washington apple orchards,
and anywhere the work was needed.

00:11:00.555 --> 00:11:04.879
They were promised three years
of solid agricultural work.

00:11:04.903 --> 00:11:06.823
So they made a calculated risk.

00:11:06.847 --> 00:11:09.929
They sold their land, they sold
their wives' jewelry,

00:11:09.953 --> 00:11:14.099
to make thousands in recruitment fees
for this company, Global Horizons.

00:11:14.776 --> 00:11:16.604
But once they were brought over,

00:11:16.628 --> 00:11:18.653
their passports were confiscated.

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.298
Some of the men were beaten
and held at gunpoint.

00:11:21.791 --> 00:11:24.413
They worked so hard
they fainted in the fields.

00:11:26.138 --> 00:11:28.362
This case hit me so hard.

00:11:29.572 --> 00:11:31.653
After I came back home,

00:11:31.677 --> 00:11:35.702
I was wandering through the grocery store,
and I froze in the produce department.

00:11:36.688 --> 00:11:40.084
I was remembering the over-the-top meals
the Global Horizons survivors

00:11:40.108 --> 00:11:42.935
would make for me every time
I showed up to interview them.

00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:49.423
They finished one meal with this plate
of perfect, long-stemmed strawberries,

00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:51.960
and as they handed them to me, they said,

00:11:51.984 --> 00:11:55.216
"Aren't these the kind of strawberries
you eat with somebody special

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.397
in the States?

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.901
And don't they taste so much better

00:11:58.925 --> 00:12:02.513
when you know the people
whose hands picked them for you?"

00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:10.247
As I stood in that grocery store weeks
later, I realized I had no idea

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.447
of who to thank for this plenty,

00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:14.471
and no idea of how
they were being treated.

00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:20.058
So, like the journalist I am, I started
digging into the agricultural sector.

00:12:20.423 --> 00:12:24.738
And I found there are too many fields,
and too few labor inspectors.

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:27.969
I found multiple layers
of plausible deniability

00:12:27.993 --> 00:12:32.053
between grower and distributor
and processor, and God knows who else.

00:12:32.988 --> 00:12:35.854
The Global Horizons survivors had been
brought to the States

00:12:35.878 --> 00:12:38.117
on a temporary guest worker program.

00:12:38.979 --> 00:12:42.612
That guest worker program
ties a person's legal status

00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:44.278
to his or her employer,

00:12:44.302 --> 00:12:47.961
and denies that worker
the right to organize.

00:12:48.717 --> 00:12:52.969
Mind you, none of what I am describing
about this agricultural sector

00:12:52.993 --> 00:12:56.515
or the guest worker program
is actually human trafficking.

00:12:57.234 --> 00:13:01.138
It is merely what we find
legally tolerable.

00:13:02.305 --> 00:13:05.631
And I would argue this is
fertile ground for exploitation.

00:13:06.187 --> 00:13:10.198
And all of this had been hidden to me,
before I had tried to understand it.

00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:14.449
I wasn't the only person
grappling with these issues.

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:17.209
Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay,

00:13:17.233 --> 00:13:21.073
is one of the biggest anti-trafficking
philanthropists in the world.

00:13:21.544 --> 00:13:26.685
And even he wound up accidentally
investing nearly 10 million dollars

00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:30.369
in the pineapple plantation cited
as having the worst working conditions

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.997
in that Global Horizons case.

00:13:34.464 --> 00:13:38.434
When he found out, he and his wife
were shocked and horrified,

00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:41.051
and they wound up writing
an op-ed for a newspaper,

00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:44.974
saying that it was up to all of us
to learn everything we can

00:13:44.998 --> 00:13:48.808
about the labor and supply chains
of the products that we support.

00:13:49.909 --> 00:13:51.601
I totally agree.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.773
What would happen
if each one of us decided

00:13:55.797 --> 00:13:58.354
that we are no longer going
to support companies

00:13:58.378 --> 00:14:01.944
if they don't eliminate exploitation
from their labor and supply chains?

00:14:02.326 --> 00:14:05.027
If we demanded laws calling for the same?

00:14:05.729 --> 00:14:08.627
If all the CEOs out there decided

00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:12.153
that they were going to go through
their businesses and say, "no more"?

00:14:13.046 --> 00:14:15.839
If we ended recruitment fees
for migrant workers?

00:14:16.574 --> 00:14:19.685
If we decided that guest workers
should have the right to organize

00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:21.225
without fear of retaliation?

00:14:21.968 --> 00:14:25.610
These would be decisions heard
around the world.

00:14:26.729 --> 00:14:28.973
This isn't a matter of buying
a fair-trade peach

00:14:29.007 --> 00:14:33.164
and calling it a day, buying
a guilt-free zone with your money.

00:14:33.188 --> 00:14:34.766
That's not how it works.

00:14:35.402 --> 00:14:39.428
This is the decision to change
a system that is broken,

00:14:39.452 --> 00:14:42.963
and that we have unwittingly but willingly

00:14:42.987 --> 00:14:47.111
allowed ourselves to profit from
and benefit from for too long.

00:14:49.435 --> 00:14:53.355
We often dwell on human trafficking
survivors' victimization.

00:14:54.303 --> 00:14:56.666
But that is not my experience of them.

00:14:57.725 --> 00:15:00.082
Over all the years that I've
been talking to them,

00:15:00.106 --> 00:15:03.426
they have taught me that we are
more than our worst days.

00:15:03.941 --> 00:15:07.211
Each one of us is more
than what we have lived through.

00:15:08.183 --> 00:15:10.261
Especially trafficking survivors.

00:15:10.746 --> 00:15:14.369
These people were the most resourceful
and resilient and responsible

00:15:14.393 --> 00:15:15.552
in their communities.

00:15:16.022 --> 00:15:18.676
They were the people that you
would take a gamble on.

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:22.266
You'd say, I'm gong to sell my rings,
because I have the chance

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.491
to send you off to a better future.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.516
They were the emissaries of hope.

00:15:29.371 --> 00:15:32.349
These survivors don't need saving.

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:35.775
They need solidarity,
because they're behind

00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:39.546
some of the most exciting
social justice movements out there today.

00:15:40.766 --> 00:15:43.703
The nannies and housekeepers
who marched with their families

00:15:43.727 --> 00:15:45.627
and their employers' families --

00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:48.569
their activism got us
an international treaty

00:15:48.593 --> 00:15:50.479
on domestic workers' rights.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:55.279
The Nepali women who were trafficked
into the sex trade --

00:15:55.303 --> 00:15:57.050
they came together, and they decided

00:15:57.074 --> 00:16:00.671
that they were going to make the world's
first anti-trafficking organization

00:16:00.695 --> 00:16:04.271
actually headed and run
by trafficking survivors themselves.

00:16:05.681 --> 00:16:08.459
These Indian shipyard workers
were trafficked

00:16:08.483 --> 00:16:11.174
to do post-Hurricane Katrina
reconstruction.

00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:15.315
They were threatened with deportation,
but they broke out of their work compound

00:16:15.339 --> 00:16:18.718
and they marched from New Orleans
to Washington, D.C.,

00:16:18.742 --> 00:16:20.981
to protest labor exploitation.

00:16:21.778 --> 00:16:25.293
They cofounded an organization called
the National Guest Worker Alliance,

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:30.001
and through this organization,
they have wound up helping other workers

00:16:30.025 --> 00:16:34.423
bring to light exploitation
and abuses in supply chains

00:16:34.447 --> 00:16:36.115
in Walmart and Hershey's factories.

00:16:36.139 --> 00:16:40.320
And although the Department
of Justice declined to take their case,

00:16:40.344 --> 00:16:44.586
a team of civil rights lawyers won
the first of a dozen civil suits

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.516
this February, and got
their clients 14 million dollars.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.517
These survivors are fighting
for people they don't even know yet,

00:16:54.541 --> 00:16:58.892
other workers, and for the possibility
of a just world for all of us.

00:16:59.626 --> 00:17:01.626
This is our chance to do the same.

00:17:02.716 --> 00:17:04.899
This is our chance to make the decision

00:17:04.923 --> 00:17:08.756
that tells us who we are,
as a people and as a society;

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:11.625
that our prosperity is no
longer prosperity,

00:17:11.649 --> 00:17:15.522
as long as it is pinned
to other people's pain;

00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:19.165
that our lives are
inextricably woven together;

00:17:19.193 --> 00:17:23.081
and that we have the power
to make a different choice.

00:17:26.217 --> 00:17:31.020
I was so reluctant to share
my story of my auntie with you.

00:17:31.976 --> 00:17:34.953
Before I started this TED process
and climbed up on this stage,

00:17:34.977 --> 00:17:37.953
I had told literally a handful
of people about it,

00:17:37.977 --> 00:17:39.929
because, like many a journalist,

00:17:39.953 --> 00:17:42.843
I am far more interested in learning
about your stories

00:17:42.867 --> 00:17:46.085
than sharing much,
if anything, about my own.

00:17:47.273 --> 00:17:50.218
I also haven't done my journalistic
due diligence on this.

00:17:50.242 --> 00:17:52.646
I haven't issued my mountains
of document requests,

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.907
and interviewed everyone and their mother,

00:17:54.931 --> 00:17:56.931
and I haven't found my auntie yet.

00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:02.069
I don't know her story
of what happened, and of her life now.

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:06.161
The story as I've told it to you
is messy and unfinished.

00:18:06.914 --> 00:18:11.766
But I think it mirrors the messy
and unfinished situation we're all in,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.790
when it comes to human trafficking.

00:18:14.523 --> 00:18:17.237
We are all implicated in this problem.

00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:22.778
But that means we are all
also part of its solution.

00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:28.355
Figuring out how to build a more
just world is our work to do,

00:18:28.379 --> 00:18:30.280
and our story to tell.

00:18:31.289 --> 00:18:33.677
So let us tell it the way
we should have done,

00:18:33.701 --> 00:18:35.264
from the very beginning.

00:18:35.801 --> 00:18:38.557
Let us tell this story together.

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:40.827
Thank you so much.

00:18:40.851 --> 00:18:47.700
(Applause)
