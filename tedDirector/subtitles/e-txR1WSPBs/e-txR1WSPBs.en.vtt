00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.700
I have all my life wondered what "mind-boggling" meant.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:40.700
After two days here, I declare myself boggled, and enormously impressed,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.700
and feel that you are one of the great hopes --

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.700
not just for American achievement in science and technology,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.700
but for the whole world.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.700
I've come, however, on a special mission on behalf of my constituency,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:12.700
which are the 10-to-the-18th-power -- that's a million trillion --

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:26.700
insects and other small creatures, and to make a plea for them.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.700
If we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet --

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.700
which we are trying hard to do --

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:45.700
the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.700
And within a few months.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.700
Now, how did I come to this particular position of advocacy?

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.700
As a little boy, and through my teenage years,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700
I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:14.700
I had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.700
and finally and definitively, an ant period.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.700
By my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.700
a specialist on the biology of ants,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.700
but my attention and research continued to make journeys

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.700
across the great variety of life on Earth in general --

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.700
including all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.700
and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.700
Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.700
crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.700
My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.700
that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, on the Florida peninsula.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.700
As far back as I can remember, I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.700
and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.700
One day when I was only seven years old and fishing,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.700
I pulled a "pinfish," they're called, with sharp dorsal spines, up too hard and fast,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.700
and I blinded myself in one eye.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.700
I later discovered I was also hard of hearing,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.700
possibly congenitally, in the upper registers.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.700
So in planning to be a professional naturalist --

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.700
I never considered anything else in my entire life --

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.700
I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.700
So I turned to the teeming small creatures

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.700
that can be held between the thumb and forefinger:

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.700
the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.700
the little things, as I like to say, who run the world.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:31.700
In so doing, I reached a frontier of biology so strange, so rich,

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.700
that it seemed as though it exists on another planet.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.700
In fact, we live on a mostly unexplored planet.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.700
The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.700
In the last 30 years, thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.700
and advances in technology,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:04.700
biologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species,

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.700
to bring the current total to 5,400,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.700
and more continue to pour in.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.700
Two new kinds of whales have been discovered, along with two new antelopes,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.700
dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant --

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.700
and even a distinct kind of gorilla.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:33.700
At the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacteria,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.700
the Prochlorococci -- that will be on the final exam --

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:48.700
although discovered only in 1988, are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth,

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:55.700
and moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.700
These bacteria were not uncovered sooner

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.700
because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms --

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.700
so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.700
Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.700
These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:26.700
Consider the fungi -- including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.700
60,000 species are known to science,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.700
but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.700
Consider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:48.700
Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms --

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.700
if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.700
you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.700
About 16,000 species of nematode worms

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.700
have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists;

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.700
there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.700
This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:23.700
by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria,

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:29.700
which within just the last several years

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:36.700
still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:42.700
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:51.700
just a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.700
It's been estimated that a single ton of soil -- fertile soil --

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:04.700
contains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:12.700
So the question is: what are they all doing?

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.700
The fact is, we don't know.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:24.700
We are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.700
done by faith and guess alone.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.700
Our lives depend upon these creatures.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:40.700
To take an example close to home: there are over 500 species of bacteria now known --

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.700
friendly bacteria -- living symbiotically in your mouth and throat

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:52.700
probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.700
At this point I think we have a little impressionistic film

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.700
that was made especially for this occasion.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.700
And I'd like to show it.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.700
Assisted in this by Billie Holiday.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:11:06.700
(Video)

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.700
And that may be just the beginning!

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:15.700
The viruses, those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:22.700
the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria,

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:31.700
are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology, a world unto themselves.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.700
What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved,

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.700
although they're obviously of enormous importance to us.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:45.700
But this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:52.700
exceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.700
Nowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:03.700
scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.700
But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:15.700
Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:21.700
Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs --

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:27.700
to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.700
in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:39.700
What will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously?

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.700
As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:50.700
to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.700
to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.700
enveloped and living within humanity?

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:05.700
Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:11.700
have been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms:

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.700
true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea,

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:22.700
which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.700
Some serious biologists, and I count myself among them,

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:36.700
have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:41.700
one might -- just might -- find aliens among them.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.700
True aliens, stocks that arrived from outer space.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.700
They've had billions of years to do it,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:55.700
but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.700
We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:07.700
are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.700
and other harsh changes in environment,

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:18.700
including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.700
around the growing population of bacteria.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:27.700
There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:33.700
and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.700
hardly worth distinguishing one from the other.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.700
But each of these species, even the tiniest Prochlorococci,

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.700
are masterpieces of evolution.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:50.700
Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.700
Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives,

00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:01.700
interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.700
in ways we have not begun even to imagine.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.700
We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.700
at the peril of our own existence --

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:21.700
and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:31.700
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.700
searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba,

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.700
ants that shine in the sunlight --

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:45.700
metallic green or metallic blue, according to species, and one species, I discovered, metallic gold.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:50.700
I found my magical ants, but only after a tough climb into the mountains

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.700
where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on,

00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:00.700
and were then -- and still are -- being cut back.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.700
I realized then that these species

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:09.700
and a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island --

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:14.700
and this is true of practically every part of the world --

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.700
which took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:24.700
And so it is everywhere one looks.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:32.700
The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.700
that can be summarized by the acronym "HIPPO," the animal hippo.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:44.700
H is for habitat destruction, including climate change forced by greenhouse gases.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:52.700
I is for the invasive species like the fire ants, the zebra mussels, broom grasses

00:16:52.700 --> 00:17:03.700
and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country, and at an exponential rate -- that's the I.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.700
The P, the first one in "HIPPO," is for pollution.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:13.700
The second is for continued population, human population expansion.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.700
And the final letter is O, for over-harvesting --

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.700
driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:26.700
The HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined --

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.700
according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research --

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.700
to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.700
to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.700
Human-forced climate change alone -- again, if unabated --

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:51.700
could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.700
What will we and all future generations lose

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.700
if much of the living environment is thus degraded?

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.700
Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered,

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.700
much of our environmental stability

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:16.700
and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value --

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.700
all thrown away.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.700
The loss will inflict a heavy price

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:29.700
in wealth, security and yes, spirituality for all time to come,

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.700
because previous cataclysms of this kind --

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.700
the last one, that ended the age of dinosaurs --

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:40.700
took, normally, five to 10 million years to repair.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.700
Sadly, our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.700
that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:58.700
For example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:05.700
actually has been found to be only partial in coverage;

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.700
it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:17.700
Only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:23.700
Of the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as "in peril,"

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.700
that is, in danger of extinction.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.700
That's in the United States.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:34.700
We are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.700
We urgently need to change this.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.700
We need to have the biosphere properly explored

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.700
so that we can understand and competently manage it.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.700
We need to settle down before we wreck the planet.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.700
And we need that knowledge.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.700
This should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.700
It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.700
So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters,

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.700
and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:12.700
I wish we will work together to help create the key tools

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.700
that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.700
And let us call it the "Encyclopedia of Life."

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.700
What is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.700
and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously?

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.700
It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.700
and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.700
Amateurs can do it also.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:44.700
It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:50.700
It makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.700
on demand, anywhere in the world.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.700
I've written about this idea before,

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:03.700
and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:11.700
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form,

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.700
science has advanced.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.700
Technology has moved forward.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.700
Today, the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia,

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:26.700
regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it, are within reach.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.700
Indeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.700
have begun mobilizing to realize this dream.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.700
I wish you would help them.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.700
Working together, we can make this real.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.700
The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:52.700
It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:58.700
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.700
And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.700
to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago:

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.700
to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.700
That is my wish. Thank you.
