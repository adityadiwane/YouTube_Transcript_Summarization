00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
If nothing else, at least I've discovered

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
what it is we put our speakers through:

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
sweaty palms, sleepless nights,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
a wholly unnatural fear of clocks.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I mean, it's quite brutal.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
And I'm also a little nervous about this.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
There are nine billion humans coming our way.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Now, the most optimistic dreams

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
can get dented by the prospect

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
of people plundering the planet.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
But recently, I've become intrigued

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
by a different way of thinking of large human crowds,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
because there are circumstances

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
where they can do something really cool.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
It's a phenomenon that I think

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
any organization or individual can tap into.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and perhaps the world's future overall.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
So, let's explore.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
The story starts with just a single person,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
a child, behaving a little strangely.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
This kid is known online as Lil Demon.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
He's doing tricks here, dance tricks,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
How did he learn them?

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
this must have taken?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Here's a clue.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
(Video) Lil Demon: ♫ Step your game up. Oh. Oh. ♫

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
♫ Step your game up. Oh. Oh. ♫

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Chris Anderson: So, that was sent to me by this man,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
a filmmaker, Jonathan Chu,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
who told me that was the moment he realized

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
the Internet was causing dance to evolve.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
This is what he said at TED in February.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
In essence,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
dancers were challenging each other online to get better;

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
incredible new dance skills were being invented;

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
even the six-year-olds were joining in.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
It felt like a revolution.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
And so Jon had a brilliant idea:

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
He went out to recruit the best of the best dancers

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
off of YouTube

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
to create this dance troupe --

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
The League of Extraordinary Dancers, the LXD.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I mean, these kids were web-taught,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And at TED here in February,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
their passion and brilliance just took our breath away.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
So, this story

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
of the evolution of dance

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
seems strangely familiar.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
You know, a while after TEDTalks started taking off,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
we noticed that speakers

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
... Months of preparation

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
crammed into 18 minutes,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
with the effects that we've seen this week.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
It's not as if J.J. and Jill

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
actually ended their talks saying, "Step your game up,"

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
but they might as well have.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
So, in both of these cases,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
you've got these cycles of improvement,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
apparently driven

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
by people watching web video.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
What is going on here?

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
Well, I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
"crowd-accelerated innovation."

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
You can think of them

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
as three dials on a giant wheel.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And the first thing you need is ... a crowd,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
a group of people who share a common interest.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
The bigger the crowd,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
the more potential innovators there are.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
That's important, but actually most people in the crowd

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
occupy these other roles.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
They're creating the ecosystem

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
from which innovation emerges.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
The second thing you need is light.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
You need clear, open visibility

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
of what the best people in that crowd are capable of,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
because that is how you will learn

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
how you will be empowered to participate.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And third, you need desire.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
You know, innovation's hard work.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
It's based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Absent desire, not going to happen.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Now, here's an example -- pre-Internet --

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
of this machine in action.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Dancers at a street corner --

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
it's a crowd, a small one,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
but they can all obviously see what each other can do.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And the desire part comes, I guess,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
from social status, right?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Best dancer walks tall, gets the best date.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
There's probably going to be some innovation happening here.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
But on the web,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
all three dials are ratcheted right up.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
The dance community is now global.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
There's millions connected.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
And amazingly,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
you can still see what the best can do,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
because the crowd itself shines a light on them,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
either directly, through comments, ratings,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
email, Facebook, Twitter,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
or indirectly,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
through numbers of views,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
through links that point Google there.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
So, it's easy to find the good stuff,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and when you've found it, you can watch it in close-up repeatedly

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
and read what hundreds of people have written about it.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
That's a lot of light.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
But the desire element

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
is really dialed way up.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
I mean, you might just be a kid with a webcam,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
but if you can do something that goes viral,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
you get to be seen by the equivalent

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
of sports stadiums crammed with people.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not --

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
it can still really make your day.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
So, this possibility

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
of a new type of global recognition,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
I think, is driving huge amounts of effort.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting:

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
because you can see the best, everyone can learn.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Also, the system is self-fueling.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
but the light and desire are a lethal one-two combination

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
that attract new people to the crowd.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
So, this is a model

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
that pretty much any organization could use

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
to try and nurture its own cycle

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
of crowd-accelerated innovation.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Invite the crowd, let in the light,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
dial up the desire.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
And the hardest part about that is probably the light,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
because it means you have to open up,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
you have to show your stuff to the world.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
that maybe millions of people

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
are empowered to help improve it.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
And, very happily, there's one class of people

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
who really can't make use of this tool.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
The dark side of the web

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
is allergic to the light.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
I don't think we're going to see terrorists, for example,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
publishing their plans online and saying to the world,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
"Please, could you help us to actually

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
make them work this time?"

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
But you can publish your stuff online.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And if you can get that wheel to turn,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
look out.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
So, at TED,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
In fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it "radical openness,"

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
because it works for us each time.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
We opened up our talks to the world,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and suddenly there are millions of people out there

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
helping spread our speakers' ideas,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and thereby making it easier for us

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
By opening up our translation program,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
thousands of heroic volunteers --

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
some of them watching online right now, and thank you! --

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
have translated our talks

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
into more than 70 languages,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
thereby tripling our viewership in non-English-speaking countries.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
By giving away our TEDx brand,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
we suddenly have a thousand-plus

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
live experiments in the art of spreading ideas.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
And these organizers,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
they're seeing each other, they're learning from each other.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
We are learning from them.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
We're getting great talks back from them.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
The wheel is turning.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Okay, step back a minute.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
I mean, it's really not news for me to tell you

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
that innovation emerges out of groups.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
You know, we've heard that this week --

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
this romantic notion of the lone genius

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
with the "eureka!" moment that changes the world

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
is misleading.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Even he said that, and he would know.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
We're a social species.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
We spark off each other.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
It's also not news

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
For the past 15 years,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
powerful communities have been connecting online,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
sparking off each other.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
If you take programmers,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
you know, the whole open-source movement

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
is a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
But what's key here is,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
the reason these groups have been able to connect

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
is because their work output is of the type

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
that can be easily shared digitally --

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
a picture, a music file,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
software.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
And that's why what I'm excited about,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
and what I think is under-reported,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
is the significance of the rise

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
of online video.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
This is the technology

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
thereby launching a whole new cycle

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
of crowd-accelerated innovation.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
The first few years of the web

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
were pretty much video-free,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
for this reason: video files are huge; the web couldn't handle them.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
But in the last 10 years,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Suddenly, here we are.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Cisco actually estimates that, within four years,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
more than 90 percent of the web's data will be video.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
If it's all puppies, porn and piracy,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
we're doomed.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
I don't think it will be.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
Video is high-bandwidth for a reason.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
It packs a huge amount of data,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Here, let me introduce you to Sam Haber.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
He's a unicyclist.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Before YouTube,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
there was no way for him to discover

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
his sport's true potential,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
because you can't communicate this stuff in words, right?

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
But looking at video clips posted by strangers,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
a world of possibility opens up for him.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
Suddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
inspire each other to greatness.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
And there are thousands of other examples of this happening --

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
of video-driven evolution of skills,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
ranging from the physical to the artful.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
And I have to tell you,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
I find this strangely beautiful.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
I mean, there's a lot of passion right here on this screen.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
But if Rube Goldberg machines

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
how about this.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
Jove is a website

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
that was founded to encourage scientists

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
to publish their peer-reviewed research

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
on video.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
It can take months for a scientist in another lab

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
to figure out how to replicate the experiments

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
that are described in print.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
Here's one such frustrated scientist,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
Moshe Pritsker, the founder of Jove.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
He told me that the world is wasting

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
billions of dollars on this.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
But look at this video.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
I mean, look: if you can show

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
instead of just describing,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
that problem goes away.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
So it's not far-fetched to say

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
that, at some point,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Here's another example

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
that's close to our hearts at TED,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
where video is sometimes more powerful than print --

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
the sharing of an idea.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
Why do people like watching TEDTalks?

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
All those ideas are already out there in print.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
It's actually faster to read than to view.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Why would someone bother?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
Well, so, there's some showing as well as telling.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
But even leaving the screen out of it,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
there's still a lot more being transferred than just words.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
And in that non-verbal portion, there's some serious magic.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
the vocal cadence, the facial expressions,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
the eye contact,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
the passion,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
the kind of awkward, British body language,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
the sense of how the audience are reacting,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
there are hundreds of subconscious clues

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
that go to how well you will understand,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
and whether you're inspired --

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
light, if you like,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
and desire.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
Incredibly, all of this can be communicated

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
on just a few square inches of a screen.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Reading and writing are actually

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
relatively recent inventions.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
Face-to-face communication has been fine-tuned

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
by millions of years of evolution.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
That's what's made it into this mysterious, powerful thing it is.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
Someone speaks,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
there's resonance in all these receiving brains,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
the whole group acts together.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
I mean, this is the connective tissue

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
of the human superorganism in action.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
It's probably driven our culture for millennia.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
500 years ago, it ran into

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
a competitor with a lethal advantage.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
It's right here.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
Print scaled.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
The world's ambitious innovators and influencers

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
now could get their ideas to spread far and wide,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
and so the art of the spoken word

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
pretty much withered on the vine.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
But now, in the blink of an eye,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
the game has changed again.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
It's not too much to say

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
that what Gutenberg did for writing,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
online video can now do for face-to-face communication.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
So, that primal medium,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
that just went global.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
Now, this is big.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
We may have to reinvent an ancient art form.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
I mean, today, one person speaking

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
can be seen by millions,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
shedding bright light on potent ideas,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
creating intense desire

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
for learning and to respond --

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
and in his case, intense desire to laugh.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
For the first time in human history,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
talented students

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
don't have to have their potential and their dreams

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
written out of history by lousy teachers.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Now, TED is just a small part of this.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
I mean, the world's universities are opening up their curricula.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
Thousands of individuals and organizations

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
are sharing their knowledge and data online.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
Thousands of people are figuring out new ways

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
to learn and, crucially,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
to respond, completing the cycle.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
And so, as we've thought about this,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
you know, it's become clear to us

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
TEDTalks can't be a one-way process, one-to-many.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Our future is many-to-many.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
So, we're dreaming of ways

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
to make it easier for you, the global TED community,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
to respond to speakers,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
to contribute your own ideas,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
maybe even your own TEDTalks,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
Because, if we can bubble up the very best

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
from a vastly larger pool,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
this wheel turns.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
Now, is it possible to imagine

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
a similar process to this,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
happening to global education overall?

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
I mean, does it have to be this painful,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
top-down process?

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
Why not a self-fueling cycle

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
in which we all can participate?

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
It's the participation age, right?

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
Schools can't be silos.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
We can't stop learning at age 21.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
What if, in the coming crowd of nine billion ...

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
what if that crowd could learn enough

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
to be net contributors,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
instead of net plunderers?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
That changes everything, right?

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
I mean, that would take more teachers than we've ever had.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
But the good news is they are out there.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
They're in the crowd,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
and the crowd is switching on lights,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
and we can see them for the first time,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
but as individuals we can learn from.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
Who's the teacher?

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
You're the teacher.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
You're part of the crowd

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
that may be about to launch

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
the biggest learning cycle in human history,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
a cycle capable of carrying all of us

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
to a smarter, wiser, more beautiful place.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
Here's a group of kids in a village in Pakistan

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
near where I grew up.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
Within five years, each of these kids is going to have access

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
to a cellphone capable of full-on web video

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
and capable of uploading video to the web.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
I mean, is it crazy to think that this girl,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
in the back, at the right, in 15 years,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
for your grandchildren?

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
It's not crazy; it's actually happening right now.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
(Video) Christopher Makau: Hi. My name is Christopher Makau.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
There's a self-help group.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
They turned a trash place into a garden.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
The same spot, it was a crime spot

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
where people were being robbed.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
They used the same trash

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
to form green manure.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
The same trash site

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
is feeding more than 30 families.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
We have our own film school.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
They are using Flip cameras

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
to record, edit,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
and reporting to their own channel,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
Kibera TV.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
Because of a scarcity of land,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
we are using the sacks to grow vegetables,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
and also [we're] able to save on the cost of living.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
Change happens when we see things in a different way.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.260
Today, I see Kibera in a different way.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
My message to TEDGlobal

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
and the entire world is:

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
Kibera is a hotbed

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
of innovation and ideas.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:18:00.260
(Applause)

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
CA: You know what?

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.260
What's new -- and it's huge --

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.260
is that, for the first time, we get to see him,

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
and he can see us.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
Right now, Chris and Kevin

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
and Dennis and Dickson and their friends

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.260
are watching us, in Nairobi, right now.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
Guys,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
we've learned from you today.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
Thank you.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
And thank you.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:46.260
(Applause)
