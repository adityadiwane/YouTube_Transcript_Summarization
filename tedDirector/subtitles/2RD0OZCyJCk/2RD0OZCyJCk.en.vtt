00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
in the very fabric of the modern economy.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
And to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
because in the beginning were commodities.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
Commodities are things that you grow in the ground, raise on the ground or pull out of the ground:

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
basically, animal, mineral, vegetable.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
And then you extract them out of the ground,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
and sell them on the open marketplace.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
that lasted for millennia.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
But then along came the industrial revolution,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
and then goods became the predominant economic offering,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
where we used commodities as a raw material

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
to be able to make or manufacture goods.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
So, we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
Well, what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
is that goods have become commoditized.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
Commoditized: where they're treated like a commodity,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
where people don't care who makes them.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
They just care about three things and three things only:

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
price, price and price.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
Now, there's an antidote to commoditization,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
and that is customization.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
My first book was called "Mass Customization" --

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
it came up a couple of times yesterday --

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
and how I discovered this progression of economic value

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
was realizing that customizing a good

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
automatically turned it into a service,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
because it was done just for a particular person,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
because it wasn't inventoried,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
it was delivered on demand to that individual person.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
So, we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
But over the past 10 or 20 years, what's happened is that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
services are being commoditized as well.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
Long-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price;

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing;

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.160
but services as well.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
What that means is that it's time

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
to move to a new level of economic value.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
Time to go beyond the goods and the services,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
and use, in that same heuristic, what happens when you customize a service?

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
What happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person --

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
that's exactly what they need at this moment in time?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
Then you can't help but make them go "wow";

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
you can't help but turn it into a memorable event --

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
you can't help but turn it into an experience.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
So we're shifting to an experience economy,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.160
where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
Now most places that I talk to,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
when I talk about experience, I talk about Disney --

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
the world's premier experience-stager.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
I talk about theme restaurants, and experiential retail,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
and boutique hotels, and Las Vegas --

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
the experience capital of the world.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
But here, when you think about experiences,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
think about Thomas Dolby and his group, playing music.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
Think about meaningful places.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
Think about drinking wine,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.160
Those are all experiences. Think about TED itself.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
The experience capital in the world of conferences.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
All of these are experiences.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
Now, over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
and particularly in the Netherlands,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
and whenever I talk about the experience economy there,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
almost invariably.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
And the question isn't really so much a question

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
as an accusation.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
And the Dutch, when they usually put it,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
it always starts with the same two words.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
You know the words I mean?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160
You Americans.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
They say, you Americans.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
You like your fantasy environments,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
your fake, your Disneyland experiences.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
They say, we Dutch, we like real,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.160
natural, authentic experiences.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.160
So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
which is: I point out that first of all,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
you have to understand that there is no such thing

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
as an inauthentic experience.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
Why? Because the experience happens inside of us.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
So, as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
then every experience we have is authentic.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
Now, there may be more or less natural or artificial

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
stimuli for the experience,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.160
but even that is a matter of degree, not kind.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
And there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
there is a company that manufactured the car

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
that delivered you to the edge of the woods;

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
to protect yourself from the ground of the woods.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
There's a company that provides a cell phone service you have

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
in case you get lost in the woods.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
Right? All of those are man-made,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
artificiality brought into the woods by you,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
and by the very nature of being there.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
And then I always finish off

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
particularly coming from the Dutch,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
is that the Netherlands

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
(Laughter)

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
And the Dutch, they always go ...

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
and they realize, I'm right!

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
There isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
that hasn't been reclaimed from the sea,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
or otherwise moved, modified and manicured

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
to look as if it had always been there.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.160
(Laughter)

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160
But nonetheless, not just the Dutch,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
but everyone has this desire for the authentic.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
And authenticity is therefore

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
becoming the new consumer sensibility --

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
the buying criteria by which consumers

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
are choosing who are they going to buy from,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
and what they're going to buy.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
Becoming the basis of the economy.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
In fact, you can look at how each of these economies developed,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.160
that each one has their own business imperative,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
matched with a consumer sensibility.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
We're the agrarian economy, and we're supplying commodities.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
It's about supply and availability.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
Getting the commodities to market.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
With the industrial economy, it is about controlling costs --

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
getting the costs down as low as possible

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
so we can offer them to the masses.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
With the service economy, it is about

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
improving quality.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
That has -- the whole quality movement has risen

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
And now, with the experience economy,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
it's about rendering authenticity.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
Rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is "rendering."

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
Right? Rendering, because you have to get your consumers --

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
as business people --

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
to percieve your offerings as authentic.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
Because there is a basic paradox:

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
no one can have an inauthentic experience,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160
but no business can supply one.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Because all businesses are man-made objects; all business is involved with money;

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
all business is a matter of using machinery,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.160
and all those things make something inauthentic.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
So, how do you render authenticity,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
is the question.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
Are you rendering authenticity?

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
When you think about that, let me go back to

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
what Lionel Trilling, in his seminal book on authenticity,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
"Sincerity and Authenticity" -- came out in 1960 --

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160
points to as the seminal point

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
at which authenticity entered the lexicon,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
if you will.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
And that is, to no surprise, in Shakespeare,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
and in his play, Hamlet.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
And there is one part in this play, Hamlet,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160
where the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet, Polonius,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
says something profoundly real.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
At the end of a laundry list of advice

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
he's giving to his son, Laertes,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
he says this:

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.160
And this above all: to thine own self be true.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
And it doth follow, as night the day,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
that thou canst not then be false to any man.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.160
And those three verses are the core of authenticity.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
There are two dimensions to authenticity:

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
one, being true to yourself, which is very self-directed.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
Two, is other-directed:

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.160
being what you say you are to others.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
And I don't know about you, but whenever I encounter two dimensions,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
I immediately go, ahh, two-by-two!

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
All right? Anybody else like that, no?

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
Well, if you think about that, you do, in fact, get

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
a two-by-two.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.160
Where, on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
As businesses, are the economic offerings you are providing --

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
are they true to themselves?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
And the other dimension is:

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
are they what they say they are to others?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
If not, you have,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.160
"is not true to itself," and "is not what it says it is,"

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
yielding a two-by-two matrix.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
And of course, if you are both true to yourself,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
and are what you say you are, then you're real real!

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
(Laughter)

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
The opposite, of course, is -- fake fake.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
All right, now, there is value for fake.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
There will always be companies around to supply the fake,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
because there will always be desire for the fake.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
Fact is, there's a general rule: if you don't like it, it's fake;

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
if you do like it, it's faux.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
(Laughter)

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
Now, the other two sides of the coin are:

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
being a real fake --

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.160
is what it says it is,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
but is not true to itself,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
or being a fake real:

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
is true to itself, but not what it says it is.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
You can think about those two -- you know, both of these

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
better than being fake fake -- not quite as good as being real real.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
You can contrast them by thinking about

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
Universal City Walk versus

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
Disney World, or Disneyland.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
Universal City Walk is a real fake --

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160
in fact, we got this very term

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
from Ada Louise Huxtable's book, "The Unreal America."

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
A wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as --

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160
you know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
right, because you can see behind the facade, right?

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
It is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio;

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
it's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
Right? You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
well, here's a place where you are going to walk a lot,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
outside in this city.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
But is it really true to itself?

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
Right? Is it really in the city?

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
Is it --

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.160
you can see behind all of it,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
and see what is going on in the facades of it.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
So she calls it a real fake.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
Disney World, on the other hand, is a fake real,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.160
or a fake reality.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.160
Right? It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.160
(Laughter)

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
But it is -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.160
(Laughter)

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
-- sorry.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
We won't talk about Santa Claus then.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.160
(Laughter)

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160
But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
Right? Just wonderfully true to itself.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
When you are there you are just immersed

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.160
in this wonderful environment.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
So, it's a fake real.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
Now the easiest way

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
to fall down in this,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
and not be real real,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
right, the easiest way not to be true to yourself

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
is not to understand your heritage,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
and thereby repudiate that heritage.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.160
Right, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
Knowing where your heritage is: what you have done in the past.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
And what you have done in the past limits what you can do,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
what you can get away with, essentially, in the future.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
So, you have to understand that past.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
Think about Disney again.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160
Disney,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
10 or 15 years ago, right,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
the Disney -- the company that is probably

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
best-known for family values out there,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
Disney bought the ABC network.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
The ABC network, affectionately known in the trade

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
as the T&amp;A network, right --

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
that's not too much jargon, is it?

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
Right, the T&amp;A network. Then it bought Miramax,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
known for its NC-17 fare,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160
and all of a sudden, families everywhere

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160
couldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160
It was no longer true to its heritage;

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
no longer true to Walt Disney.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
That's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
Because it is no longer true to itself.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.160
So, understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
When it comes to being what you say you are, the easiest mistake that companies make

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
is that they advertise

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
things that they are not.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
That's when you're perceived as fake, as a phony company --

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
advertizing things that you're not.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
Think about any hotel, any airline,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
any hospital.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
Right, if you could check into the ads, you'd have a great experience.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
(Laughter)

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
But unfortunately, you have to experience the actual hotel,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
airline and hospital, and then you have that disconnect.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
Then you have that perception that you are phony.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
So, the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
is to provide places for people to experience

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
who you are.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
For people to experience who you are.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
Right, it's not advertising does it.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
That's why you have companies like Starbucks,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.160
right, that doesn't advertise at all.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
They said, you want to know who we are, you have to come experience us.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
And think about the economic value they have provided

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
by that experience.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160
Right? Coffee, at its core, is what?

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.160
Right? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
You know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean?

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
Two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.160
But grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
and now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
when you treat it as a good.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160
Take that same good,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160
and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
in a corner diner, in a bodega, a kiosk somewhere,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
you get 50 cents, maybe a buck

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.160
per cup of coffee.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
But surround the brewing of that coffee

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160
with the ambiance of a Starbucks,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
and now, because of that authentic experience,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
you can charge two, three, four, five dollars

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
for a cup of coffee.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160
So, authenticity is becoming

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.160
the new consumer sensibility.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
Let me summarize it, for the business people in the audience,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160
with three rules, three basic rules.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
One, don't say you're authentic

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
unless you really are authentic.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160
Two, it's easier to be authentic

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
if you don't say you're authentic.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
And three, if you say you're authentic,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
you better be authentic.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.160
And then for the consumers, for everyone else in the audience,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
let me simply summarize it by saying, increasingly,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.160
what we -- what will make us happy,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
is spending our time and our money

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.160
satisfying the desire for authenticity.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
Thank you.
