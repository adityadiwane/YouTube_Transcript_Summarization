00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:16.135
What's the fastest growing threat
to Americans' health?

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:18.973
Cancer? Heart attacks? Diabetes?

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:21.449
The answer is actually none of these;

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.250
it's Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.276
Every 67 seconds,

00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:28.221
someone in the United States
is diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:32.149
As the number of Alzheimer's patients
triples by the year 2050,

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.446
caring for them, as well as
the rest of the aging population,

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:38.005
will become an overwhelming
societal challenge.

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:40.465
My family has experienced firsthand

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:42.967
the struggles of caring
for an Alzheimer's patient.

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:45.107
Growing up in a family
with three generations,

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:47.262
I've always been very close
to my grandfather.

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:48.689
When I was four years old,

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:51.192
my grandfather and I 
were walking in a park in Japan

00:00:51.192 --> 00:00:52.497
when he suddenly got lost.

00:00:52.497 --> 00:00:55.710
It was one of the scariest moments
I've ever experienced in my life,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.117
and it was also the first
instance that informed us

00:00:58.117 --> 00:01:00.412
that my grandfather
had Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:04.025
Over the past 12 years,
his condition got worse and worse,

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:07.823
and his wandering in particular
caused my family a lot of stress.

00:01:07.823 --> 00:01:09.302
My aunt, his primary caregiver,

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:12.349
really struggled to stay awake at night
to keep an eye on him,

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:15.047
and even then often failed
to catch him leaving the bed.

00:01:15.047 --> 00:01:17.858
I became really concerned
about my aunt's well-being

00:01:17.858 --> 00:01:19.599
as well as my grandfather's safety.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:23.130
I searched extensively for a solution
that could help my family's problems,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.490
but couldn't find one.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.693
Then, one night about two years ago,

00:01:27.693 --> 00:01:31.158
I was looking after my grandfather
and I saw him stepping out of the bed.

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:33.150
The moment his foot landed on the floor,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.412
I thought, why don't I put
a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot?

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:38.809
Once he stepped onto the floor
and out of the bed,

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:42.516
the pressure sensor would detect an
increase in pressure caused by body weight

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:45.971
and then wirelessly send an audible alert
to the caregiver's smartphone.

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.312
That way, my aunt could sleep
much better at night

00:01:48.312 --> 00:01:51.002
without having to worry
about my grandfather's wandering.

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:54.934
So now I'd like to perform
a demonstration of this sock.

00:01:57.134 --> 00:01:59.802
Could I please have
my sock model on the stage?

00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:02.560
Great.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.950
So once the patient
steps onto the floor --

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.510
(Ringing) --

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.182
an alert is sent
to the caregiver's smartphone.

00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:18.057
Thank you. (Applause)

00:02:18.057 --> 00:02:21.225
Thank you, sock model.

00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:26.649
So this is a drawing
of my preliminary design.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.441
My desire to create
a sensor-based technology

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.969
perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love
for sensors and technology.

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.465
When I was six years old,

00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:37.795
an elderly family friend
fell down in the bathroom

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:39.505
and suffered severe injuries.

00:02:39.505 --> 00:02:41.606
I became concerned
about my own grandparents

00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:43.958
and decided to invent
a smart bathroom system.

00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.566
Motion sensors would be installed
inside the tiles of bathroom floors

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:51.404
to detect the falls of elderly patients
whenever they fell down in the bathroom.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:53.416
Since I was only six years old at the time

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:55.739
and I hadn't graduated
from kindergarten yet,

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.073
I didn't have the necessary resources and 
tools to translate my idea into reality,

00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:02.706
but nonetheless, my research experience

00:03:02.706 --> 00:03:06.957
really implanted in me a firm desire
to use sensors to help the elderly people.

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:11.573
I really believe that sensors can improve
the quality of life of the elderly.

00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:16.425
When I laid out my plan, I realized
that I faced three main challenges:

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:18.194
first, creating a sensor;

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:19.773
second, designing a circuit;

00:03:19.773 --> 00:03:21.519
and third, coding a smartphone app.

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.927
This made me realize that my project
was actually much harder to realize

00:03:24.927 --> 00:03:26.982
than I initially had thought it to be.

00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:30.476
First, I had to create a wearable sensor
that was thin and flexible enough

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:33.237
to be worn comfortably
on the bottom of the patient's foot.

00:03:33.237 --> 00:03:36.656
After extensive research and testing
of different materials like rubber,

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:40.191
which I realized was too thick to be worn
snugly on the bottom of the foot,

00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:41.758
I decided to print a film sensor

00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:44.660
with electrically conductive
pressure-sensitive ink particles.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.236
Once pressure is applied, the connectivity
between the particles increases.

00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:51.200
Therefore, I could design a circuit
that would measure pressure

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.967
by measuring electrical resistance.

00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:56.026
Next, I had to design
a wearable wireless circuit,

00:03:56.026 --> 00:03:59.338
but wireless signal transmission
consumes lots of power

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:01.101
and requires heavy, bulky batteries.

00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:04.728
Thankfully, I was able to find out
about the Bluetooth low energy technology,

00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:08.251
which consumes very little power
and can be driven by a coin-sized battery.

00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:11.880
This prevented the system
from dying in the middle of the night.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.343
Lastly, I had to code a smartphone app
that would essentially transform

00:04:15.343 --> 00:04:17.821
the care-giver's smartphone
into a remote monitor.

00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:21.497
For this, I had to expand upon
my knowledge of coding with Java and XCode

00:04:21.497 --> 00:04:24.984
and I also had to learn about how to code
for Bluetooth low energy devices

00:04:24.984 --> 00:04:27.860
by watching YouTube tutorials
and reading various textbooks.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.019
Integrating these components, I was able
to successfully create two prototypes,

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:35.347
one in which the sensor
is embedded inside a sock,

00:04:35.347 --> 00:04:37.743
and another that's
a re-attachable sensor assembly

00:04:37.743 --> 00:04:39.949
that can be adhered anywhere
that makes contact

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.782
with the bottom of the patient's foot.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:44.682
I've tested the device on my grandfather
for about a year now,

00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.593
and it's had a 100 percent success rate

00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:50.089
in detecting the over 900 
known cases of his wandering.

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.052
Last summer, I was able
to beta test my device

00:04:53.052 --> 00:04:55.598
at several residential
care facilities in California,

00:04:55.598 --> 00:04:57.770
and I'm currently incorporating
the feedback

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.733
to further improve the device 
into a marketable product.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.841
Testing the device on a number of patients

00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:05.350
made me realize that I needed
to invent solutions

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.235
for people who didn't want
to wear socks to sleep at night.

00:05:08.805 --> 00:05:11.630
So sensor data, collected
on a vast number of patients,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.959
can be useful for improving patient care

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:16.777
and also leading to a cure
for the disease, possibly.

00:05:16.777 --> 00:05:18.620
For example, I'm currently examining 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.848
correlations between the frequency
of a patient's nightly wandering

00:05:21.848 --> 00:05:24.714
and his or her daily activities and diet.

00:05:25.854 --> 00:05:28.615
One thing I'll never forget
is when my device first caught

00:05:28.615 --> 00:05:30.833
my grandfather's wandering
out of bed at night.

00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:33.784
At that moment, I was really struck
by the power of technology

00:05:33.784 --> 00:05:35.761
to change lives for the better.

00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:38.131
People living happily and healthfully --

00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:40.156
that's the world that I imagine.

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:42.216
Thank you very much.

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:45.526
(Applause)
