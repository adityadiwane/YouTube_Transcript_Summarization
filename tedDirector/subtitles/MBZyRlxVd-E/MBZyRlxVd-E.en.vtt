00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
also agrees with us, and also calls us to this action.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
He said, "A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, the 'universe,' --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a part limited in time and space.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
as something separated from the rest,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This delusion is a kind of prison for us,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
wherein compassion -- "karuna," it is called --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
is defined as, "the sensitivity to another's suffering

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering."

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and wishes to share it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and selfishness to compassion, the concern for others,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
suffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and, implicitly, more happy.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
as the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In fact, suffering is so huge and enormous,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
his own becomes less and less monumental.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And this immediately cheers him up,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Thus, he uses his own suffering

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
He is a very good colleague of Einstein's, we must say.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now, I want to tell a story,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
of the great Saint Asanga

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha's time.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And he was discontented with the state of people's practice

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
of the Buddhist religion in India at that time.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And so he said, "I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
but they are acting selfish and pathetic.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but exists currently in a certain heaven" -- that's Maitreya --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
"so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and gives me a teaching or something

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to revive the practice of compassion in the world today."

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And he left in disgust.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And as he was leaving, he saw a man --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And he had a lump of iron.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And he was rubbing it with a cloth.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And he became interested in that.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
He said, "Well what are you doing?"

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And the man said, "I'm making a needle."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And he said, "That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth."

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And the man said, "Really?" And he showed him a dish full of needles.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So he said, "Okay, I get the point."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
He went back to his cave. He meditated again.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Another three years, no vision. He leaves again.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
This time, he comes down.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So he said, "All right. I get the point." He went back.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Another three years.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And he again leaves, and this time: water dripping,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to see any encouraging vision.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And he comes to the town. He's a broken person.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
even in America, I think, in some areas --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and he's looking just terrible.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Some of it is like gangrenous,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
He thinks, "What can I do to fix up this dog?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Well, at least I can clean this wound and wash it."

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So, he takes it to some water. He's about to clean,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
but then his awareness focuses on the maggots.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And he sees the maggots, and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
"Well, if I clean the dog, I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha, no Maitreya,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and everything is all hopeless.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And now I'm going to kill the maggots?"

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So, he had a brilliant idea.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and he placed it on ground.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
He was just immediately caught with the situation.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So he thought, "I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
then clean the dog's wounds, and then

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I'll figure out what to do with the maggots."

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab, these maggots.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So he says, "Well, I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue" --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
the dog is kind of used up --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
"and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing."

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So he goes down, and he's sticking his tongue out like this.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And then, suddenly, there's a pfft, a noise like that.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
He jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And he says, "Oh." He bows.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So as he comes up from his first bow he says,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
"My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
What is this?"

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And Maitreya says, "I was with you. Who do you think was making needles

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?"

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
(Laughter)

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
"Looking for the Buddha in person," he said.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And he said, "You didn't have, until this moment, real compassion.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love."

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
"Maitreya" means love, "the loving one," in Sanskrit.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And so he looked very dubious, Asanga did.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And he said, "If you don't believe me, just take me with you."

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe, a ball --

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
took him on his shoulder.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, "Rejoice! Rejoice!

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is."

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him --

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
it wasn't Chautauqua, it was some other town --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
because they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
like some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
shouting that the future Buddha had come.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So, naturally, they chased him out of town.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
dictating to him five complicated tomes

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
A famous one, it's called the "Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion."

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one --

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
even animals too, but everyone is in human form.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And then you try to say, "Well, the loved ones I love.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
But, you know, after all, they're nice to me.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So, in a way, I like them so much because they're nice to me.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
But they are nice to somebody. I could be them."

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And then the Buddhists, of course, think that, because we've all had infinite previous lives,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
we've all been each other's relatives, actually.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Therefore all of you, in the Buddhist view,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
in some previous life, although you don't remember it and neither do I,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
have been my mother -- for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And also, actually, I've been your mother.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
the way the Buddhists reflect.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
are part of the eternal mother.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
You gave me that expression; "the eternal mama," you said. That's wonderful.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So, that's the way the Buddhists do it.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
A theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So, in that sense, we're related.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So, they first create this foundation of equality.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
So, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love --

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don't know.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And we definitely reduce the hostility and the "I don't want to be compassionate to them"

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
to the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And then the next thing we do is what is called "mother recognition."

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And we see the mother in every being.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
We see that look that the mother has on her face,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
looking at this child that is a miracle

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that she has produced from her own body, being a mammal,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
where she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
in spiritual traditions.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
People laugh at me because, you know, I used to say that

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
when, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And you think of him as nursing you.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
but you think of him as a mom.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and you see how they could be familiar to you.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And you do that for a while, until you really feel that.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
You can feel the familiarity of all beings.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Nobody seems alien. They're not "other."

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
if you can remember the kindness of your own mother,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
if you can remember the kindness of your spouse,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
or, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
You will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Every being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And then, third, you step from there to what is called "a feeling of gratitude."

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love."

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
In each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
depending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
when they are satisfied.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
but when they're happy they look beautiful.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And so you see beings in their potential happiness.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
We think Jesus is being unrealistic

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
when he says, "Love thine enemy."

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
He does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and sort of spiritual and highfalutin. "Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that."

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
But, actually, that's practical.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
If your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
How boring to run around chasing you.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
But anyway, that's the "lovely love. "

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And then finally, the fifth step is compassion, "universal compassion."

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And you look at them, and you see how they are.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You see that furrowed brow in people.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
They're driven by this duty and this obligation.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
"I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something."

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And they're rushing around all stressed out.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
But actually they are cruel to themselves.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And they, then, never get any positive feedback.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And the more they succeed and the more power they have,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
the more unhappy they are.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And this is where you feel real compassion for them.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And you then feel you must act.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And the choice of the action, of course,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
hopefully will be more practical

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
than poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
because he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
he wanted to help.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
But, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And so the next step -- the sixth step beyond "universal compassion" --

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
and you have compassion for yourself also,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
being more and more mean to other people

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and getting punished in the future for it in various ways.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
by dying, but they don't.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And so they get reborn as whatever, you know.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Never mind. I won't get into that.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
But the next step is called "universal responsibility."

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And that is very important -- the Charter of Compassion

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
must lead us to develop through true compassion,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
what is called "universal responsibility."

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
that he always teaches everywhere, he says

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
that that is the common religion of humanity: kindness.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
But "kindness" means "universal responsibility."

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us:

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
we are responsible for that, and we should take it

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
and do whatever we can at whatever little level

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and small level that we can do it.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And then, finally, that leads to a new orientation in life

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
where we live equally for ourselves and for others

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and we are

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
joyful and happy.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Compassion makes you happy.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Although, the change in your mind already does something for other beings:

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
they can sense this new quality in yourself,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and it helps them already, and gives them an example.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
So, practice compassion, read the charter, disseminate it

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
and develop it within yourself.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Don't just think, "Well, I'm compassionate," or "I'm not compassionate,"

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
and sort of think you're stuck there.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
You can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
the cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and take universal responsibility for them.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And then, not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
but Karen Armstrong will smile.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Thank you very much. (Applause)
