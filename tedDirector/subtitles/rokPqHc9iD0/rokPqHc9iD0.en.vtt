00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.870
We can cut violent deaths
around the world

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.960
by 50 percent in the next three decades.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.191
All we have to do
is drop killing by 2.3 percent a year,

00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:29.644
and we'll hit that target.

00:00:29.644 --> 00:00:31.339
You don't believe me?

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.613
Well, the leading epidemiologists
and criminologists around the world

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:37.004
seem to think we can, and so do I,

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:42.139
but only if we focus on our cities,
especially the most fragile ones.

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:46.408
You see, I've been thinking
about this a lot.

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:48.320
For the last 20 years, I've been working

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.888
in countries and cities
ripped apart by conflict,

00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:55.905
violence, terrorism, or some
insidious combination of all.

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:59.411
I've tracked gun smugglers
from Russia to Somalia,

00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:02.583
I've worked with warlords
in Afghanistan and the Congo,

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:07.705
I've counted cadavers in Colombia, in 
Haiti, in Sri Lanka, in Papua New Guinea.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:10.535
You don't need to be
on the front line, though,

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:13.847
to get a sense that our planet
is spinning out of control, right?

00:01:13.847 --> 00:01:18.396
There's this feeling that international
instability is the new normal.

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:20.527
But I want you to take a closer look,

00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:23.739
and I think you'll see that
the geography of violence is changing,

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:27.547
because it's not so much our nation states
that are gripped by conflict and crime

00:01:27.547 --> 00:01:35.071
as our cities: Aleppo, Bamako, Caracas, 
Erbil, Mosul, Tripoli, Salvador.

00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:38.196
Violence is migrating to the metropole.

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:40.921
And maybe this is to be expected, right?

00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:44.868
After all, most people today,
they live in cities, not the countryside.

00:01:44.868 --> 00:01:50.704
Just 600 cities, including 30 megacities,
account for two thirds of global GDP.

00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:52.463
But when it comes to cities,

00:01:52.463 --> 00:01:55.122
the conversation is
dominated by the North,

00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:58.521
that is, North America, Western Europe,
Australia and Japan,

00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:01.668
where violence is 
actually at historic lows.

00:02:01.668 --> 00:02:06.369
As a result, city enthusiasts, they talk
about the triumph of the city,

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.515
of the creative classes, and the mayors
that will rule the world.

00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:13.801
Now, I hope that mayors
do one day rule the world,

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:15.838
but, you know, the fact is,

00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:20.207
we don't hear any conversation, really,
about what is happening in the South.

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:24.584
And by South, I mean
Latin America, Africa, Asia,

00:02:24.584 --> 00:02:27.312
where violence in some
cases is accelerating,

00:02:27.312 --> 00:02:29.913
where infrastructure is overstretched,

00:02:29.913 --> 00:02:34.268
and where governance is sometimes
an aspiration and not a reality.

00:02:34.268 --> 00:02:38.591
Now, some diplomats
and development experts and specialists,

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:41.256
they talk about 40 to 50 fragile states

00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:44.878
that will shape security
in the 21st century.

00:02:44.878 --> 00:02:50.063
I think it's fragile cities which will
define the future of order and disorder.

00:02:50.063 --> 00:02:53.414
That's because warfare
and humanitarian action

00:02:53.414 --> 00:02:55.628
are going to be
concentrated in our cities,

00:02:55.628 --> 00:02:57.201
and the fight for development,

00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:59.892
whether you define that
as eradicating poverty,

00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:02.325
universal healthcare,
beating back climate change,

00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:07.996
will be won or lost in the shantytowns,
slums and favelas of our cities.

00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:10.552
I want to talk to you about four megarisks

00:03:10.552 --> 00:03:13.801
that I think will define
fragility in our time,

00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:16.030
and if we can get to grips with these,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.975
I think we can do something
with that lethal violence problem.

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:21.347
So let me start with some good news.

00:03:21.347 --> 00:03:26.778
Fact is, we're living in the most
peaceful moment in human history.

00:03:26.778 --> 00:03:30.959
Steven Pinker and others have shown how
the intensity and frequency of conflict

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.699
is actually at an all-time low.

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.345
Now, Gaza, Syria, Sudan, Ukraine,

00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:41.176
as ghastly as these conflicts are,
and they are horrific,

00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:43.916
they represent a relatively
small blip upwards

00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:46.911
in a 50-year-long secular decline.

00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:51.218
What's more, we're seeing
a dramatic reduction in homicide.

00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:53.435
Manuel Eisner and others have shown

00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:57.145
that for centuries, we've seen
this incredible drop in murder,

00:03:57.145 --> 00:03:59.090
especially in the West.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.526
Most Northern cities today are 100 times
safer than they were just 100 years ago.

00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:08.271
These two facts -- the decline in armed 
conflict and the decline in murder --

00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:09.950
are amongst the most extraordinary,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.527
if unheralded, accomplishments
of human history,

00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:15.827
and we should be really excited, right?

00:04:15.827 --> 00:04:17.655
Well, yeah, we should.

00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:22.044
There's just one problem:
These two scourges are still with us.

00:04:22.044 --> 00:04:28.137
You see, 525,000 people --
men, women, boys and girls --

00:04:28.148 --> 00:04:31.329
die violently every single year.

00:04:31.329 --> 00:04:33.929
Research I've been doing
with Keith Krause and others

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:39.386
has shown that between 50,000 and 60,000
people are dying in war zones violently.

00:04:39.386 --> 00:04:44.400
The rest, almost 500,000 people,
are dying outside of conflict zones.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.393
In other words, 10 times more people
are dying outside of war than inside war.

00:04:50.393 --> 00:04:53.488
What's more, violence is moving south,

00:04:53.488 --> 00:04:56.196
to Latin America and the Caribbean,

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:58.477
to parts of Central and Southern Africa,

00:04:58.477 --> 00:05:01.351
and to bits of the Middle East
and Central Asia.

00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:04.120
Forty of the 50 most dangerous 
cities in the world

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.658
are right here in Latin America,

00:05:05.658 --> 00:05:07.528
13 in Brazil,

00:05:07.528 --> 00:05:12.765
and the most dangerous of all, it's 
San Pedro Sula, Honduras' second city,

00:05:12.765 --> 00:05:17.581
with a staggering homicide rate
of 187 murders per 100,000 people.

00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:20.720
That's 23 times the global average.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.447
Now, if violence is
re-concentrating geographically,

00:05:23.447 --> 00:05:26.260
it's also being reconfigured
to the world's new topography,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.799
because when it comes to cities,
the world ain't flat,

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:31.077
like Thomas Friedman likes to say.

00:05:31.077 --> 00:05:32.413
It's spiky.

00:05:32.413 --> 00:05:36.327
The dominance of the city
as the primary mode of urban living

00:05:36.327 --> 00:05:40.614
is one of the most extraordinary
demographic reversals in history,

00:05:40.614 --> 00:05:43.702
and it all happened so fast.

00:05:43.702 --> 00:05:45.227
You all know the figures, right?

00:05:45.227 --> 00:05:47.469
There's 7.3 billion people
in the world today;

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.858
there will be 9.6 billion by 2050.

00:05:49.858 --> 00:05:51.922
But consider this one fact:

00:05:51.922 --> 00:05:55.114
In the 1800s, one in 30
people lived in cities,

00:05:55.114 --> 00:05:57.634
today it's one in two,

00:05:57.634 --> 00:06:00.792
and tomorrow virtually everyone
is going to be there.

00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:04.878
And this expansion in urbanization
is going to be neither even nor equitable.

00:06:04.878 --> 00:06:06.521
The vast majority, 90 percent,

00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:10.733
will be happening in the South,
in cities of the South.

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:13.864
So urban geographers and demographers,

00:06:13.864 --> 00:06:18.159
they tell us that it's not necessarily
the size or even the density of cities

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.249
that predicts violence, no.

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:22.501
Tokyo, with 35 million people,

00:06:22.501 --> 00:06:27.229
is one of the largest, and some might say
safest, urban metropolises in the world.

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.976
No, it's the speed of
urbanization that matters.

00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:36.823
I call this turbo-urbanization, and it's 
one of the key drivers of fragility.

00:06:36.823 --> 00:06:41.611
When you think about the incredible
expansion of these cities,

00:06:41.611 --> 00:06:45.218
and you think about turbo-urbanization,
think about Karachi.

00:06:45.218 --> 00:06:51.127
Karachi was about 500,000 people in 1947,
a hustling, bustling city.

00:06:51.127 --> 00:06:54.824
Today, it's 21 million people,

00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:58.769
and apart from accounting
for three quarters of Pakistan's GDP,

00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:01.863
it's also one of the most violent
cities in South Asia.

00:07:01.863 --> 00:07:04.667
Dhaka, Lagos, Kinshasa,

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:08.712
these cities are now 40 times larger
than they were in the 1950s.

00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:11.440
Now take a look at New York.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.636
The Big Apple, it took 150 years
to get to eight million people.

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:21.077
São Paulo, Mexico City, took 15
to reach that same interval.

00:07:21.947 --> 00:07:25.840
Now, what do these medium,
large, mega-, and hypercities look like?

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.379
What is their profile?

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.214
Well, for one thing, they're young.

00:07:29.214 --> 00:07:32.836
What we're seeing in many of them
is the rise of the youth bulge.

00:07:32.836 --> 00:07:34.748
Now, this is actually a good news story.

00:07:34.748 --> 00:07:37.338
It's a function of reductions
in child mortality rates.

00:07:37.338 --> 00:07:39.795
But the youth bulge is something
we've got to watch.

00:07:39.795 --> 00:07:41.226
What it basically means

00:07:41.226 --> 00:07:44.125
is the proportion of young people
living in our fragile cities

00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:47.627
is much larger than those living 
in our healthier and wealthier ones.

00:07:47.627 --> 00:07:49.146
In some fragile cities,

00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:52.727
75 percent of the population
is under the age of 30.

00:07:52.727 --> 00:07:57.479
Think about that:
Three in four people are under 30.

00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:00.324
It's like Palo Alto on steroids.

00:08:00.324 --> 00:08:03.064
Now, if you look at Mogadishu for example,

00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:07.174
in Mogadishu the mean age is 16 years old.

00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:10.076
Ditto for Dhaka, Dili and Kabul.

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:12.828
And Tokyo? It's 46.

00:08:12.828 --> 00:08:16.229
Same for most Western European cities.

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:19.409
Now, it's not just youth
that necessarily predicts violence.

00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:21.453
That's one factor among many,

00:08:21.453 --> 00:08:24.429
but youthfulness combined
with unemployment, lack of education,

00:08:24.429 --> 00:08:28.535
and -- this is the kicker -- 
being male, is a deadly proposition.

00:08:28.535 --> 00:08:32.036
They're statistically correlated,
all those risk factors, with youth,

00:08:32.036 --> 00:08:35.163
and they tend to relate
to increases in violence.

00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:39.358
Now, for those of you who are
parents of teenage sons,

00:08:39.358 --> 00:08:41.304
you know what I'm talking about, right?

00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:44.214
Just imagine your boy
without any structure

00:08:44.214 --> 00:08:47.915
with those unruly friends of his,
out there cavorting about.

00:08:47.915 --> 00:08:50.106
Now, take away the parents,

00:08:50.106 --> 00:08:54.476
take away the education,
limit the education possibilities,

00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:57.721
sprinkle in a little bit of drugs,
alcohol and guns,

00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:00.924
and sit back and watch the fireworks.

00:09:00.924 --> 00:09:03.021
The implications are disconcerting.

00:09:03.021 --> 00:09:06.536
Right here in Brazil,
the life expectancy is 73.6 years.

00:09:06.536 --> 00:09:10.211
If you live in Rio, I'm sorry,
shave off two right there.

00:09:10.211 --> 00:09:12.498
But if you're young, you're uneducated,

00:09:12.498 --> 00:09:15.012
you lack employment,
you're black, and you're male,

00:09:15.012 --> 00:09:18.224
your life expectancy drops
to less than 60 years old.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:23.081
There's a reason why youthfulness
and violence are the number one killers

00:09:23.081 --> 00:09:25.422
in this country.

00:09:25.422 --> 00:09:28.696
Okay, so it's not all doom
and gloom in our cities.

00:09:28.696 --> 00:09:31.064
After all, cities are hubs of innovation,

00:09:31.064 --> 00:09:34.653
dynamism, prosperity, 
excitement, connectivity.

00:09:34.653 --> 00:09:36.905
They're where the smart people gather.

00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:38.846
And those young people I just mentioned,

00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:42.490
they're more digitally savvy
and tech-aware than ever before.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.064
And this explosion, the Internet,
and mobile technology,

00:09:46.064 --> 00:09:49.779
means that the digital divide
separating the North and the South

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:53.023
between countries
and within them, is shrinking.

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:54.644
But as we've heard so many times,

00:09:54.644 --> 00:09:57.376
these new technologies
are dual-edged, right?

00:09:57.376 --> 00:09:59.519
Take the case of law enforcement.

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:03.106
Police around the world are starting
to use remote sensing and big data

00:10:03.106 --> 00:10:04.701
to anticipate crime.

00:10:04.701 --> 00:10:09.121
Some cops are able to predict
criminal violence before it even happens.

00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:12.526
The future crime scenario,
it's here today,

00:10:12.526 --> 00:10:14.026
and we've got to be careful.

00:10:14.026 --> 00:10:16.321
We have to manage the issues
of the public safety

00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:18.987
against rights to individual privacy.

00:10:18.987 --> 00:10:21.138
But it's not just the cops
who are innovating.

00:10:21.138 --> 00:10:23.982
We've heard extraordinary activities
of civil society groups

00:10:23.982 --> 00:10:27.117
who are engaging in local 
and global collective action,

00:10:27.117 --> 00:10:30.950
and this is leading to digital protest
and real revolution.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.136
But most worrying
of all are criminal gangs

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:38.045
who are going online
and starting to colonize cyberspace.

00:10:38.045 --> 00:10:41.177
In Ciudad Juárez in Mexico,
where I've been working,

00:10:41.177 --> 00:10:43.531
groups like the Zetas
and the Sinaloa cartel

00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:45.152
are hijacking social media.

00:10:45.152 --> 00:10:47.736
They're using it to recruit,
to sell their products,

00:10:47.736 --> 00:10:49.966
to coerce, to intimidate and to kill.

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:53.149
Violence is going virtual.

00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:55.282
So this is just a partial sketch

00:10:55.282 --> 00:10:57.958
of a fast-moving and dynamic
and complex situation.

00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.807
I mean, there are many other megarisks

00:10:59.807 --> 00:11:02.242
that are going to define
fragility in our time,

00:11:02.242 --> 00:11:04.141
not least income inequality,

00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:07.879
poverty, climate change, impunity.

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:10.224
But we're facing a stark dilemma

00:11:10.224 --> 00:11:14.283
where some cities are going to thrive
and drive global growth

00:11:14.283 --> 00:11:17.219
and others are going to stumble
and pull it backwards.

00:11:17.219 --> 00:11:20.445
If we're going to change course,
we need to start a conversation.

00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:23.436
We can't only focus
on those cities that work,

00:11:23.436 --> 00:11:25.944
the Singapores, the Kuala Lumpurs,

00:11:25.944 --> 00:11:27.824
the Dubais, the Shanghais.

00:11:27.824 --> 00:11:32.028
We've got to bring those fragile cities
into the conversation.

00:11:32.028 --> 00:11:34.558
One way to do this might be
to start twinning

00:11:34.558 --> 00:11:37.298
our fragile cities with our healthier
and wealthier ones,

00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:39.811
kickstarting a process of learning
and collaboration

00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:44.050
and sharing of practices,
of what works and what doesn't.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.642
A wonderful example of this is coming
from El Salvador and Los Angeles,

00:11:47.642 --> 00:11:51.802
where the mayors in San Salvador
and Los Angeles are collaborating

00:11:51.802 --> 00:11:55.755
on getting ex-gang members
to work with current gang members,

00:11:55.755 --> 00:11:58.543
offering tutoring, education,

00:11:58.543 --> 00:12:01.863
and in the process are helping
incubate cease-fires and truces,

00:12:01.863 --> 00:12:04.410
and we've seen homicide rates
go down in San Salvador,

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.233
once the world's most violent city,

00:12:06.233 --> 00:12:07.877
by 50 percent.

00:12:07.877 --> 00:12:10.426
We can also focus 
on hot cities, but also hot spots.

00:12:10.426 --> 00:12:14.728
Place and location matter fundamentally
in shaping violence in our cities.

00:12:14.728 --> 00:12:17.283
Did you know that between
one and two percent

00:12:17.283 --> 00:12:19.348
of street addresses in any fragile city

00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:23.050
can predict up to 99 percent
of violent crime?

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.614
Take the case of São Paulo,
where I've been working.

00:12:25.614 --> 00:12:29.367
It's gone from being Brazil's most
dangerous city to one of its safest,

00:12:29.367 --> 00:12:31.326
and it did this by doubling down

00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:34.557
on information collection,
hot spot mapping, and police reform,

00:12:34.557 --> 00:12:39.595
and in the process, it dropped homicide
by 70 percent in just over 10 years.

00:12:39.595 --> 00:12:42.050
We also got to focus on those hot people.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:46.139
It's tragic, but being young,
unemployed, uneducated, male,

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:50.136
increases the risks
of being killed and killing.

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.821
We have to break this cycle of violence

00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:56.155
and get in there early with our children,
our youngest children,

00:12:56.155 --> 00:12:58.764
and valorize them, not stigmatize them.

00:12:59.214 --> 00:13:02.584
There's wonderful work that's happening
that I've been involved with

00:13:02.584 --> 00:13:04.875
in Kingston, Jamaica
and right here in Rio,

00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:08.173
which is putting education,
employment, recreation

00:13:08.173 --> 00:13:10.329
up front for these high-risk groups,

00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:13.684
and as a result, we're seeing violence
going down in their communities.

00:13:13.684 --> 00:13:17.362
We've also got to make our cities safer,
more inclusive, and livable for all.

00:13:17.362 --> 00:13:21.129
The fact is, social cohesion matters.

00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:23.609
Mobility matters in our cities.

00:13:23.609 --> 00:13:26.679
We've got to get away from this model
of segregation, exclusion,

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:28.095
and cities with walls.

00:13:28.095 --> 00:13:30.905
My favorite example of how to do this
comes from Medellín.

00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:32.910
When I lived in Colombia
in the late 1990s,

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.541
Medellín was the murder capital 
of the world, but it changed course,

00:13:36.541 --> 00:13:40.800
and it did this by deliberately investing
in its low-income and most violent areas

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.208
and integrating them
with the middle-class ones

00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:44.880
through a network of cable cars,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.527
of public transport,
and first-class infrastructure,

00:13:47.527 --> 00:13:52.349
and in the process, it dropped homicide
by 79 percent in just under two decades.

00:13:52.349 --> 00:13:54.389
And finally, there's technology.

00:13:55.119 --> 00:13:57.901
Technology has enormous
promise but also peril.

00:13:57.901 --> 00:14:00.449
We've seen examples here
of extraordinary innovation,

00:14:00.449 --> 00:14:02.242
and much of it coming from this room,

00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:04.610
The police are engaging 
in predictive analytics.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.200
Citizens are engaging
in new crowdsourcing solutions.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.847
Even my own group is involved
in developing applications

00:14:09.847 --> 00:14:14.199
to provide more accountability over police
and increase safety among citizens.

00:14:14.199 --> 00:14:16.607
But we need to be careful.

00:14:17.687 --> 00:14:21.076
If I have one single
message for you, it's this:

00:14:21.076 --> 00:14:24.561
There is nothing inevitable
about lethal violence,

00:14:24.561 --> 00:14:29.312
and we can make our cities safer.

00:14:29.312 --> 00:14:35.358
Folks, we have the opportunity
of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence

00:14:35.358 --> 00:14:38.005
in half within our lifetime.

00:14:38.005 --> 00:14:39.738
So I have just one question:

00:14:39.738 --> 00:14:41.283
What are we waiting for?

00:14:41.283 --> 00:14:43.067
Thank you.

00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:47.320
(Applause)
