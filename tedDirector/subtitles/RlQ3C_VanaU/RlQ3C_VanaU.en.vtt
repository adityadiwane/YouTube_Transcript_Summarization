00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:13.970
Hi everyone.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.260
So, I'm going to take us back to 2007.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.996
I'd just spent about six months
working on album

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.076
that I'd poured my heart and my soul into,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.316
and it was getting about three plays
per day on Myspace at the time,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.356
and I was getting more and more depressed
when I started noticing these other people

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.076
who were playing guitar and singing

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.516
and putting videos
on this new site called YouTube,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.276
and they were getting 300,000 views.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.396
So I decided I'm going to start
making some Youtube videos.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.636
And one day they featured
a video of my band on the homepage,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.915
which was amazing --
we got a bunch of new fans.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:45.356
We also got a bunch of people

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.356
who, I guess, just didn't really like
the music or something --

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.396
(Laughter)

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.836
It's OK because people
started coming to our shows,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.116
and we started touring,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.596
and we came out with a record.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.676
And when I checked
our bank account balance

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.556
after our first monthly iTunes payout,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.076
we had 22,000 bucks in it,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.356
which was amazing because at the time
I was living at my dad's house,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.836
trying to make a living as a musician
by uploading videos to the internet

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.676
which literally zero people
respected in 2009 --

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.436
even the people who were
uploading videos to the internet.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.156
And so for the next four years,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.996
I uploaded more and more
videos to the Internet,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.556
and they got better and better,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.756
and we made enough money
through brand deals

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.316
and commercials and iTunes sales

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.156
to buy a house.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.476
And we built a recording studio.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.156
But there was one big problem:

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.276
making money as a creative person
in 2013 was super weird.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.196
First of all, the business models
were changing all the time.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.996
So our 58,000 dollars
of annual iTunes download income

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.676
was about to be replaced by about
6,000 dollars of streaming income.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.596
Steams paid less than downloads.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.676
And then as more and more creators
started popping up online,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.796
there was just more competition
for these five-figure brand deals

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.956
that had kept the band afloat for years.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.196
And to top it all off,
our videos themselves --

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.036
the creative stuff that we made
that our fans loved and appreciated --

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.516
that were actually
contributing value to the world,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.676
those videos were generating
almost zero dollars of income for us.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.076
This is an actual snapshot
of my YouTube dashboard

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.356
from a 28-day period

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.076
that shows one million views

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.660
and 166 dollars of ad earnings
for those views.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.995
The whole machine in 2013

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.516
that took art online and outputted money

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.836
was totally nonfunctional.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.396
It doesn't matter if you're a newspaper,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.036
or an institution,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.396
or an independent creator.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.716
A monthly web comic
with 20,000 monthly readers --

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.036
20,000 monthly readers --

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.396
gets paid a couple hundred
bucks in ad revenue.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.460
This is 20,000 people.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.116
Like, in what world is this not enough?

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.076
I don't understand.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.716
What systems have we built
where this is insufficient

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.220
for a person to make a living?

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.716
So, I actually have a theory about this.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.476
I think it's been a weird 100 years.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.716
(Laughter)

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.796
(Applause)

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.716
About 100 years ago,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.316
humans figured out how to record
sound onto a wax cylinder.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.316
That was the beginning of the phonograph.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.676
Right around the same time,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.996
we figured out how to record
light onto a piece of photographic paper,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.396
celluloid -- the beginning
of film and television.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.116
For the first time,
you could store art on a thing,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.396
which was amazing.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.156
Art used to be completely ephemeral,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.636
so if you missed the symphony,
you just didn't get to hear the orchestra.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.076
But now, for the first time,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.676
you could store the orchestra's
performance on a physical object,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.196
and like, listen to it later,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.956
which was amazing.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.236
It was so amazing in fact,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.556
that for the next 100 years,
between 1900 and 2000,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.076
humans built just billions and billions
of dollars of infrastructure

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.356
to essentially help artists do two things.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.436
First, put their art on a thing,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.676
and second, get that thing
around the world

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.316
to the people who wanted the art.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.156
So, so much industry
is devoted to these two problems.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.133
Oh my gosh, there are trucking companies,

00:03:57.157 --> 00:04:01.836
and brick-and-mortar and marketing firms,
and CD jewel case manufacturers,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.860
all devoted to these two problems.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.996
And then we all know what happened.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.676
10 years ago, the internet matures

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.756
and we get Spotify
and Facebook and YouTube

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.596
and iTunes and Google search,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.676
and a hundred years of infrastructure

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.276
and supply chains and distribution systems

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.116
and monetization schemes

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.036
are completely bypassed --

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.260
in a decade.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.196
After 100 years of designing these things,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.116
it's no wonder that it's just totally
broken for creative people right now.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.756
It's no wonder that the monetization
part of the chain doesn't work

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.300
given this new context.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.996
But what gets me super excited
to be a creator right now,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.956
to be alive today and be
a creative person right now,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.156
is realizing that we're only 10 years
into figuring out this new machine --

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.196
to figuring out the next 100 years
of infrastructure for our creators.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.156
And you can tell we're only 10 years in.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.276
There's a lot of trial and error,
some really good ideas forming,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.556
a lot of experimentation.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.796
We're figuring out
what works and what doesn't.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.956
Like Twitch streamers.
Who's heard of Twitch?

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.396
Twitch streamers are making
three to five thousand bucks a month

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.676
streaming gaming content.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.980
The big ones are making
over 100,000 dollars a year.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.796
There's a site called YouNow,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.036
it's an app.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.836
It allows musicians and vloggers
to get paid in digital goods from fans.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.596
So, I'm also working on the problem.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.956
Four years ago I started
a company called Patreon

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.236
with a friend of mine.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.660
We're 80 people now
working on this problem.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.516
It's basically a membership platform

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.756
that makes it really easy
for creators to get paid --

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.996
every month from their fans
to earn a living.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.276
For a creator, it's like having a salary
for being a creative person.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.876
And this is one of our creators.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.316
They're called "Kinda Funny."

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.596
They have about 220,000
subscribers on YouTube.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.036
And when they upload a video,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.836
it gets somewhere around
15,000 views to 100,000 views.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.836
I want you to check yourselves right now.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.076
I think when we hear numbers like that,
when we hear "15,000 views,"

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.516
and we see content like this,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.716
we just snap categorize it
as being not as legitimate

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.716
as a morning show
that you'd hear on the radio

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.116
or a talk show that you'd
see on NBC or something

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.276
But when "Kinda Funny"
launched on Patreon,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.556
within a few weeks, they were
making 31,000 dollars per month

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.076
for this show.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.196
It took off so fast that they decided
to expand their programming

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.476
and add new shows,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.156
and now they launched
a second Patreon page --

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.300
they're making an additional
21,000 dollars per month.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.660
And they're scaling what's essentially
becoming a media company,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.740
financing the whole thing
through membership.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.956
OK, here's another example.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.316
This is Derek Bodner,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.316
a sports journalist who used
to write for Philadelphia Magazine

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.596
until a few months ago when
the magazine cut out all sports coverage.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.596
Now he writes articles
and publishes them on his own website --

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.716
he's still covering sports,
but for himself.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.596
And he's making 4,800 bucks
a month from 1,700 patrons,

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.596
financing it through membership.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.876
This is Crash Course --

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.020
free educational content for the world.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.836
This show is actually
on the PBS digital network --

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.196
29,000 dollars per month.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.436
This is a duo sailing around the world,

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.036
getting paid every month
for documenting their travels

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.556
from 1,400 patrons.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.116
This is a podcast,
"Chapo Trap House", making --

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.996
actually, since I screenshotted this,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.516
they're making an additional
2,000 dollars per month,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.140
so they're now making 56,000 dollars
per month for their podcast.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.596
And Patreon's not the only one
working on the problem.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.516
Even Google's starting to work on this.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.716
A couple years ago,
they launched Fan Funding;

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.636
more recently, they launched Super Chat

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.036
as a way for creators
to monetize live streaming.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.636
Newspapers are starting
to experiment with membership.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.596
New York Times has a membership program;

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.876
The Guardian has over 200,000
paying subscribers

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.140
to its membership program.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.116
There's this bubbling soup
of ideas and experiments

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.636
and progress right now,

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.500
and it's pointing in the direction
of getting creators paid.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.596
And it's working.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.196
It's not, like, perfect yet,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.676
but it's really working.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.556
So, Patreon has over 50,000 creators
on the platform making salaries --

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.636
getting paid every month
for putting art online,

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.996
for being a creative person.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.476
The next hundred years
of infrastructure is on the way

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.276
and it's going to be different
this time because of this --

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.676
because of the direct connection
between the person who makes the thing

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.380
and the person who likes the thing.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.396
About seven or eight years ago,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.420
I went to a cocktail party.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.916
This is when the band
had hit our first machine,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.436
so things were really cranking.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.836
We had just made
about 400,000 dollars in one year

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.556
through iTunes sales
and brand deals and stuff like that.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.380
And this guy comes up to me and says,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.716
"Hey, Jack, what do you do?"

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.220
I said, "I'm a musician."

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.196
And he just sobered up immediately,

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.236
and he stuck out his hand,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.516
put a hand on my shoulder,

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.276
and in a real earnest,
very nice voice he was like,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.681
"I hope you make it someday."

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:53.585
(Laughter)

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.900
And ...

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.116
I have so many moments like that
logged in my memory.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.996
I just cringe thinking of that.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:09.700
It's so embarrassing to just
not feel valued as a creative person.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.556
But as a species,

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.996
we are leaving that cocktail party behind.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.156
We're leaving that culture,

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.380
we're out of there.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.716
We're going to get so good
at paying creators,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.980
within 10 years,

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.796
kids graduating high school and college
are going to think of being a creator

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.076
as just being an option --

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.053
I could be a doctor, I could be a lawyer,

00:09:31.077 --> 00:09:33.396
I could be a podcaster,
I could have a web comic.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.476
It's just going to be
something you can do.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.740
We're figuring it out.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.860
It's going to be a viable and sustainable
and respected profession.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.836
Creators are going to come out
the other end of this weird 100 years,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.380
this century-long journey,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.100
with an awesome new machine.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.540
And they're going to be paid,
and they're going to be valued.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.796
Thanks, everybody.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.980
(Applause)

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.300
I think it went pretty well.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.956
I want artists who saw that
to not give up --

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.516
to know that we're getting there.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.156
It's not there yet,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.420
but in a couple years,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.396
there will be so many systems
and tools for them

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.396
to just make a living online,

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.716
and if they've got a podcast
that's starting to take off,

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.876
but they're not able
to make money on it yet,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.116
that's happening

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.556
and they're going to be paid.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.780
It's happening.
