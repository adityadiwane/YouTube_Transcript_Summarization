00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Those of you who know me know how passionate I am

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
about opening the space frontier.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
And I want to tell you that story.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.160
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
We have something called the Genome 100 --

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
Craig Venter chairs that event.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
And I met Professor Hawking,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
and he said his dream was to travel into space.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
And I said, "I can't take you there,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.160
You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
Come back down, you weigh twice as much.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
You do it again and again.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.160
You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness --

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
We set out to do this.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
It took us 11 years to become operational.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.160
(Laughter)

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
And he wanted to go.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
We worked hard to get all the permissions.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
We had a press conference,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
give him 25 seconds of zero-g.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.160
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
And what he said, for me, was very moving.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
of being wiped out by disaster ...

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.160
up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
We had about 20 people who made donations --

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities --

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
who flew with us.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
A few TEDsters here.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
We set up a whole ER.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.160
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
We had everything all set in case of an emergency;

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
We took off from the shuttle landing facility,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
where the shuttle takes off and lands.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
carefully suspended him into zero-g.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
Once he was there, [we] let him go

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
to experience what weightlessness was truly like.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And after that first parabola, you know,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
So we did a second parabola.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
(Laughter)

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.160
(Applause)

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
And a third.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.160
(Applause)

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
that Isaac Newton did.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.160
(Laughter)

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
And a seventh and an eighth.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.160
(Laughter)

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
He was so happy.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
We are living on a precious jewel,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
Please join us in this epic adventure.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.160
Thank you so much.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.160
(Applause)
