00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:14.338
One of my earliest memories

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:17.458
is of trying to wake up
one of my relatives and not being able to.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:20.435
And I was just a little kid,
so I didn't really understand why,

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:21.769
but as I got older,

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:23.936
I realized we had
drug addiction in my family,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.794
including later cocaine addiction.

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:30.597
I'd been thinking about it a lot lately,
partly because it's now exactly 100 years

00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:33.667
since drugs were first banned
in the United States and Britain,

00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:36.206
and we then imposed that
on the rest of the world.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.726
It's a century since we made
this really fateful decision

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.803
to take addicts and punish them
and make them suffer,

00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:48.214
because we believed that would deter them;
it would give them an incentive to stop.

00:00:48.238 --> 00:00:53.207
And a few years ago, I was looking at
some of the addicts in my life who I love,

00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:56.620
and trying to figure out
if there was some way to help them.

00:00:56.644 --> 00:00:59.894
And I realized there were loads
of incredibly basic questions

00:00:59.918 --> 00:01:01.728
I just didn't know the answer to,

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:04.168
like, what really causes addiction?

00:01:04.192 --> 00:01:07.608
Why do we carry on with this approach
that doesn't seem to be working,

00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:10.537
and is there a better way out there
that we could try instead?

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:12.251
So I read loads of stuff about it,

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.942
and I couldn't really find
the answers I was looking for,

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:18.502
so I thought, okay, I'll go and sit
with different people around the world

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:20.190
who lived this and studied this

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:22.755
and talk to them and see
if I could learn from them.

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:26.256
And I didn't realize I would end up
going over 30,000 miles at the start,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.164
but I ended up going and meeting
loads of different people,

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:31.943
from a transgender crack dealer
in Brownsville, Brooklyn,

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:35.521
to a scientist who spends a lot of time
feeding hallucinogens to mongooses

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:36.831
to see if they like them --

00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:39.936
it turns out they do, but only
in very specific circumstances --

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.731
to the only country that's ever
decriminalized all drugs,

00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:45.110
from cannabis to crack, Portugal.

00:01:45.134 --> 00:01:47.711
And the thing I realized
that really blew my mind is,

00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:51.519
almost everything we think
we know about addiction is wrong,

00:01:51.543 --> 00:01:54.630
and if we start to absorb
the new evidence about addiction,

00:01:54.654 --> 00:01:58.076
I think we're going to have to change
a lot more than our drug policies.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.501
But let's start with what we think
we know, what I thought I knew.

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:03.606
Let's think about this middle row here.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.392
Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went
off and used heroin three times a day.

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:10.861
Some of you look a little more
enthusiastic than others at this prospect.

00:02:10.885 --> 00:02:11.885
(Laughter)

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:14.114
Don't worry,
it's just a thought experiment.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.219
Imagine you did that, right?

00:02:16.243 --> 00:02:17.393
What would happen?

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:21.221
Now, we have a story about what would
happen that we've been told for a century.

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.742
We think, because there are
chemical hooks in heroin,

00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:25.529
as you took it for a while,

00:02:25.553 --> 00:02:28.107
your body would become
dependent on those hooks,

00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:29.895
you'd start to physically need them,

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.243
and at the end of those 20 days,
you'd all be heroin addicts. Right?

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:34.499
That's what I thought.

00:02:34.523 --> 00:02:38.381
First thing that alerted me to the fact
that something's not right with this story

00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:40.059
is when it was explained to me.

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:43.798
If I step out of this TED Talk today
and I get hit by a car and I break my hip,

00:02:43.822 --> 00:02:47.135
I'll be taken to hospital
and I'll be given loads of diamorphine.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.721
Diamorphine is heroin.

00:02:48.745 --> 00:02:52.179
It's actually much better heroin
than you're going to buy on the streets,

00:02:52.203 --> 00:02:55.135
because the stuff you buy
from a drug dealer is contaminated.

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.983
Actually, very little of it is heroin,

00:02:57.007 --> 00:02:59.823
whereas the stuff you get
from the doctor is medically pure.

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:02.419
And you'll be given it for quite
a long period of time.

00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:04.301
There are loads of people in this room,

00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:07.286
you may not realize it,
you've taken quite a lot of heroin.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.863
And anyone who is watching this
anywhere in the world, this is happening.

00:03:10.887 --> 00:03:13.240
And if what we believe
about addiction is right --

00:03:13.264 --> 00:03:15.836
those people are exposed
to all those chemical hooks --

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.070
What should happen?
They should become addicts.

00:03:18.094 --> 00:03:20.036
This has been studied really carefully.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.965
It doesn't happen; you will have noticed
if your grandmother had a hip replacement,

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.013
she didn't come out as a junkie.
(Laughter)

00:03:26.037 --> 00:03:29.626
And when I learned this,
it seemed so weird to me,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.156
so contrary to everything I'd been told,
everything I thought I knew,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.971
I just thought it couldn't be right,
until I met a man called Bruce Alexander.

00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:39.593
He's a professor
of psychology in Vancouver

00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:41.532
who carried out an incredible experiment

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:43.918
I think really helps us
to understand this issue.

00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:45.680
Professor Alexander explained to me,

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:48.641
the idea of addiction we've all
got in our heads, that story,

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:50.692
comes partly from a series of experiments

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:52.802
that were done earlier
in the 20th century.

00:03:52.826 --> 00:03:54.132
They're really simple.

00:03:54.156 --> 00:03:57.136
You can do them tonight at home
if you feel a little sadistic.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.717
You get a rat and you put it in a cage,
and you give it two water bottles:

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:04.485
One is just water, and the other is water
laced with either heroin or cocaine.

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.517
If you do that, the rat will almost always
prefer the drug water

00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:09.679
and almost always
kill itself quite quickly.

00:04:09.703 --> 00:04:12.180
So there you go, right?
That's how we think it works.

00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:15.776
In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes
along and he looks at this experiment

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.056
and he noticed something.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.559
He said ah, we're putting
the rat in an empty cage.

00:04:19.583 --> 00:04:21.816
It's got nothing to do
except use these drugs.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.355
Let's try something different.

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.307
So Professor Alexander built a cage
that he called "Rat Park,"

00:04:26.331 --> 00:04:28.847
which is basically heaven for rats.

00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:31.950
They've got loads of cheese,
they've got loads of colored balls,

00:04:31.974 --> 00:04:33.358
they've got loads of tunnels.

00:04:33.382 --> 00:04:36.573
Crucially, they've got loads of friends.
They can have loads of sex.

00:04:36.597 --> 00:04:41.387
And they've got both the water bottles,
the normal water and the drugged water.

00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:44.096
But here's the fascinating thing:

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.578
In Rat Park, they don't
like the drug water.

00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:49.291
They almost never use it.

00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:51.868
None of them ever use it compulsively.

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:53.293
None of them ever overdose.

00:04:53.317 --> 00:04:56.707
You go from almost 100 percent overdose
when they're isolated

00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:59.957
to zero percent overdose when they
have happy and connected lives.

00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:03.227
Now, when he first saw this,
Professor Alexander thought,

00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:06.490
maybe this is just a thing about rats,
they're quite different to us.

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:08.991
Maybe not as different as we'd like,
but, you know --

00:05:09.015 --> 00:05:11.126
But fortunately, there was
a human experiment

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.255
into the exact same principle happening
at the exact same time.

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.257
It was called the Vietnam War.

00:05:16.281 --> 00:05:20.864
In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American
troops were using loads of heroin,

00:05:20.888 --> 00:05:23.496
and if you look at the news
reports from the time,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.178
they were really worried, because
they thought, my God, we're going to have

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:30.402
hundreds of thousands of junkies
on the streets of the United States

00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:32.342
when the war ends; it made total sense.

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:35.652
Now, those soldiers who were using
loads of heroin were followed home.

00:05:35.676 --> 00:05:38.630
The Archives of General Psychiatry
did a really detailed study,

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:40.558
and what happened to them?

00:05:40.582 --> 00:05:44.142
It turns out they didn't go to rehab.
They didn't go into withdrawal.

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:47.452
Ninety-five percent of them just stopped.

00:05:47.476 --> 00:05:49.877
Now, if you believe the story
about chemical hooks,

00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:53.365
that makes absolutely no sense,
but Professor Alexander began to think

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.696
there might be a different
story about addiction.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.561
He said, what if addiction isn't
about your chemical hooks?

00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:01.231
What if addiction is about your cage?

00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:04.369
What if addiction is an adaptation
to your environment?

00:06:04.393 --> 00:06:05.543
Looking at this,

00:06:05.547 --> 00:06:08.645
there was another professor
called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.116
who said, maybe we shouldn't
even call it addiction.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.864
Maybe we should call it bonding.

00:06:12.888 --> 00:06:15.787
Human beings have a natural
and innate need to bond,

00:06:15.811 --> 00:06:19.365
and when we're happy and healthy,
we'll bond and connect with each other,

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.019
but if you can't do that,

00:06:22.043 --> 00:06:25.843
because you're traumatized or isolated
or beaten down by life,

00:06:25.867 --> 00:06:29.166
you will bond with something
that will give you some sense of relief.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.762
Now, that might be gambling,
that might be pornography,

00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:33.938
that might be cocaine,
that might be cannabis,

00:06:33.962 --> 00:06:37.592
but you will bond and connect
with something because that's our nature.

00:06:37.616 --> 00:06:40.332
That's what we want as human beings.

00:06:40.356 --> 00:06:43.844
And at first, I found this quite
a difficult thing to get my head around,

00:06:43.868 --> 00:06:46.299
but one way that helped me
to think about it is,

00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:49.712
I can see, I've got over by my seat
a bottle of water, right?

00:06:49.736 --> 00:06:53.260
I'm looking at lots of you, and lots
of you have bottles of water with you.

00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:55.099
Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:59.766
Totally legally, all of those bottles
of water could be bottles of vodka, right?

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.476
We could all be getting drunk --
I might after this -- (Laughter) --

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.652
but we're not.

00:07:04.676 --> 00:07:08.153
Now, because you've been able to afford
the approximately gazillion pounds

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:11.558
that it costs to get into a TED Talk,
I'm guessing you guys could afford

00:07:11.582 --> 00:07:13.936
to be drinking vodka
for the next six months.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.907
You wouldn't end up homeless.

00:07:15.931 --> 00:07:19.532
You're not going to do that,
and the reason you're not going to do that

00:07:19.556 --> 00:07:21.435
is not because anyone's stopping you.

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:23.652
It's because you've got
bonds and connections

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:25.200
that you want to be present for.

00:07:25.224 --> 00:07:27.701
You've got work you love.
You've got people you love.

00:07:27.725 --> 00:07:29.746
You've got healthy relationships.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.416
And a core part of addiction,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.917
I came to think, and I believe
the evidence suggests,

00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:38.755
is about not being able to bear
to be present in your life.

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:41.118
Now, this has really
significant implications.

00:07:41.142 --> 00:07:44.276
The most obvious implications
are for the War on Drugs.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.836
In Arizona, I went out
with a group of women

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.694
who were made to wear t-shirts
saying, "I was a drug addict,"

00:07:51.718 --> 00:07:56.471
and go out on chain gangs and dig graves
while members of the public jeer at them,

00:07:56.495 --> 00:08:00.171
and when those women get out of prison,
they're going to have criminal records

00:08:00.195 --> 00:08:02.815
that mean they'll never work
in the legal economy again.

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:06.536
Now, that's a very extreme example,
obviously, in the case of the chain gang,

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.626
but actually almost
everywhere in the world

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.650
we treat addicts to some degree like that.

00:08:10.674 --> 00:08:13.532
We punish them. We shame them.
We give them criminal records.

00:08:13.556 --> 00:08:16.291
We put barriers between them reconnecting.

00:08:16.315 --> 00:08:19.294
There was a doctor in Canada,
Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man,

00:08:19.318 --> 00:08:23.189
who said to me, if you wanted to design
a system that would make addiction worse,

00:08:23.213 --> 00:08:24.820
you would design that system.

00:08:24.844 --> 00:08:27.700
Now, there's a place that decided
to do the exact opposite,

00:08:27.724 --> 00:08:29.557
and I went there to see how it worked.

00:08:29.581 --> 00:08:32.976
In the year 2000, Portugal had
one of the worst drug problems in Europe.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.975
One percent of the population was addicted
to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing,

00:08:36.999 --> 00:08:39.767
and every year, they tried
the American way more and more.

00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:42.744
They punished people and stigmatized them
and shamed them more,

00:08:42.768 --> 00:08:44.587
and every year, the problem got worse.

00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:48.322
And one day, the Prime Minister and
the leader of the opposition got together,

00:08:48.346 --> 00:08:50.325
and basically said, look, we can't go on

00:08:50.349 --> 00:08:53.878
with a country where we're having
ever more people becoming heroin addicts.

00:08:53.902 --> 00:08:56.061
Let's set up a panel
of scientists and doctors

00:08:56.085 --> 00:08:58.567
to figure out what would
genuinely solve the problem.

00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:01.840
And they set up a panel led by
an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão,

00:09:01.864 --> 00:09:03.490
to look at all this new evidence,

00:09:03.514 --> 00:09:05.086
and they came back and they said,

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:09.406
"Decriminalize all drugs
from cannabis to crack, but" --

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.700
and this is the crucial next step --

00:09:11.724 --> 00:09:15.345
"take all the money we used to spend
on cutting addicts off,

00:09:15.369 --> 00:09:16.766
on disconnecting them,

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.430
and spend it instead
on reconnecting them with society."

00:09:20.454 --> 00:09:25.026
And that's not really what we think of
as drug treatment

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.908
in the United States and Britain.

00:09:26.932 --> 00:09:28.513
So they do do residential rehab,

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:31.345
they do psychological therapy,
that does have some value.

00:09:31.369 --> 00:09:34.752
But the biggest thing they did
was the complete opposite of what we do:

00:09:34.776 --> 00:09:37.270
a massive program
of job creation for addicts,

00:09:37.294 --> 00:09:39.890
and microloans for addicts
to set up small businesses.

00:09:39.914 --> 00:09:41.555
So say you used to be a mechanic.

00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:44.376
When you're ready, they'll go
to a garage, and they'll say,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.287
if you employ this guy for a year,
we'll pay half his wages.

00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:50.044
The goal was to make sure
that every addict in Portugal

00:09:50.068 --> 00:09:52.449
had something to get out
of bed for in the morning.

00:09:52.473 --> 00:09:55.644
And when I went and met the addicts
in Portugal,

00:09:55.668 --> 00:09:57.922
what they said is,
as they rediscovered purpose,

00:09:57.946 --> 00:10:01.051
they rediscovered bonds
and relationships with the wider society.

00:10:01.075 --> 00:10:03.695
It'll be 15 years this year
since that experiment began,

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:05.362
and the results are in:

00:10:05.386 --> 00:10:07.244
injecting drug use is down in Portugal,

00:10:07.268 --> 00:10:09.859
according to the British
Journal of Criminology,

00:10:09.883 --> 00:10:12.446
by 50 percent, five-zero percent.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.146
Overdose is massively down,
HIV is massively down among addicts.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.521
Addiction in every study
is significantly down.

00:10:18.545 --> 00:10:22.384
One of the ways you know it's worked
so well is that almost nobody in Portugal

00:10:22.408 --> 00:10:24.089
wants to go back to the old system.

00:10:24.113 --> 00:10:25.977
Now, that's the political implications.

00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:29.000
I actually think there's a layer
of implications

00:10:29.024 --> 00:10:30.660
to all this research below that.

00:10:30.684 --> 00:10:33.946
We live in a culture where people
feel really increasingly vulnerable

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.926
to all sorts of addictions,
whether it's to their smartphones

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.284
or to shopping or to eating.

00:10:38.308 --> 00:10:40.615
Before these talks began --
you guys know this --

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:43.479
we were told we weren't allowed
to have our smartphones on,

00:10:43.503 --> 00:10:46.124
and I have to say, a lot of you
looked an awful lot like

00:10:46.148 --> 00:10:49.133
addicts who were told their dealer
was going to be unavailable

00:10:49.157 --> 00:10:51.062
for the next couple of hours. (Laughter)

00:10:51.086 --> 00:10:53.933
A lot of us feel like that,
and it might sound weird to say,

00:10:53.957 --> 00:10:57.350
I've been talking about how disconnection
is a major driver of addiction

00:10:57.374 --> 00:10:58.803
and weird to say it's growing,

00:10:58.827 --> 00:11:02.399
because you think we're the most connected
society that's ever been, surely.

00:11:02.423 --> 00:11:05.356
But I increasingly began to think
that the connections we have

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.480
or think we have, are like a kind
of parody of human connection.

00:11:08.504 --> 00:11:11.341
If you have a crisis in your life,
you'll notice something.

00:11:11.365 --> 00:11:14.275
It won't be your Twitter followers
who come to sit with you.

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:17.157
It won't be your Facebook friends
who help you turn it round.

00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:20.324
It'll be your flesh and blood friends
who you have deep and nuanced

00:11:20.348 --> 00:11:22.590
and textured, face-to-face
relationships with,

00:11:22.614 --> 00:11:27.149
and there's a study I learned about from
Bill McKibben, the environmental writer,

00:11:27.173 --> 00:11:29.356
that I think tells us a lot about this.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.754
It looked at the number of close friends
the average American believes

00:11:32.778 --> 00:11:34.705
they can call on in a crisis.

00:11:34.729 --> 00:11:37.723
That number has been declining
steadily since the 1950s.

00:11:37.747 --> 00:11:40.597
The amount of floor space
an individual has in their home

00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:42.664
has been steadily increasing,

00:11:42.688 --> 00:11:44.568
and I think that's like a metaphor

00:11:44.592 --> 00:11:46.450
for the choice we've made as a culture.

00:11:46.474 --> 00:11:51.325
We've traded floorspace for friends,
we've traded stuff for connections,

00:11:51.349 --> 00:11:54.946
and the result is we are one of the
loneliest societies there has ever been.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.137
And Bruce Alexander, the guy who did
the Rat Park experiment, says,

00:11:58.161 --> 00:12:01.708
we talk all the time in addiction
about individual recovery,

00:12:01.732 --> 00:12:03.635
and it's right to talk about that,

00:12:03.659 --> 00:12:06.190
but we need to talk much more
about social recovery.

00:12:06.214 --> 00:12:09.843
Something's gone wrong with us,
not just with individuals but as a group,

00:12:09.867 --> 00:12:12.276
and we've created a society where,
for a lot of us,

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.761
life looks a whole lot more
like that isolated cage

00:12:14.785 --> 00:12:16.832
and a whole lot less like Rat Park.

00:12:16.856 --> 00:12:19.888
If I'm honest, this isn't
why I went into it.

00:12:19.912 --> 00:12:23.218
I didn't go in to the discover
the political stuff, the social stuff.

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.581
I wanted to know how to help
the people I love.

00:12:25.605 --> 00:12:28.844
And when I came back from this
long journey and I'd learned all this,

00:12:28.868 --> 00:12:31.576
I looked at the addicts in my life,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.106
and if you're really candid,
it's hard loving an addict,

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.988
and there's going to be lots of people
who know in this room.

00:12:39.012 --> 00:12:41.236
You are angry a lot of the time,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.261
and I think one of the reasons
why this debate is so charged

00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:48.085
is because it runs through the heart
of each of us, right?

00:12:48.109 --> 00:12:51.056
Everyone has a bit of them
that looks at an addict and thinks,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.831
I wish someone would just stop you.

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:56.617
And the kind of scripts we're told for how
to deal with the addicts in our lives

00:12:56.641 --> 00:12:57.813
is typified by, I think,

00:12:57.837 --> 00:13:00.790
the reality show "Intervention,"
if you guys have ever seen it.

00:13:00.814 --> 00:13:03.488
I think everything in our lives
is defined by reality TV,

00:13:03.512 --> 00:13:04.957
but that's another TED Talk.

00:13:04.981 --> 00:13:07.169
If you've ever seen
the show "Intervention,"

00:13:07.193 --> 00:13:08.649
it's a pretty simple premise.

00:13:08.673 --> 00:13:11.769
Get an addict, all the people
in their life, gather them together,

00:13:11.793 --> 00:13:15.425
confront them with what they're doing,
and they say, if you don't shape up,

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:16.787
we're going to cut you off.

00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:19.526
So what they do is they take
the connection to the addict,

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.646
and they threaten it,
they make it contingent

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.048
on the addict behaving the way they want.

00:13:24.072 --> 00:13:27.799
And I began to think, I began to see
why that approach doesn't work,

00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:32.373
and I began to think that's almost like
the importing of the logic of the Drug War

00:13:32.397 --> 00:13:34.254
into our private lives.

00:13:34.278 --> 00:13:37.946
So I was thinking,
how could I be Portuguese?

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.475
And what I've tried to do now,
and I can't tell you I do it consistently

00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:43.448
and I can't tell you it's easy,

00:13:43.472 --> 00:13:45.956
is to say to the addicts in my life

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.206
that I want to deepen
the connection with them,

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.900
to say to them, I love you
whether you're using or you're not.

00:13:51.924 --> 00:13:54.756
I love you, whatever state you're in,

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.171
and if you need me,
I'll come and sit with you

00:13:57.195 --> 00:13:59.795
because I love you and I don't
want you to be alone

00:13:59.819 --> 00:14:01.815
or to feel alone.

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:03.881
And I think the core of that message --

00:14:03.905 --> 00:14:06.574
you're not alone, we love you --

00:14:06.598 --> 00:14:09.663
has to be at every level
of how we respond to addicts,

00:14:09.687 --> 00:14:12.310
socially, politically and individually.

00:14:12.334 --> 00:14:16.582
For 100 years now, we've been singing
war songs about addicts.

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:20.506
I think all along we should have been
singing love songs to them,

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.778
because the opposite of addiction
is not sobriety.

00:14:24.802 --> 00:14:28.633
The opposite of addiction is connection.

00:14:28.657 --> 00:14:30.606
Thank you.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:37.630
(Applause)
