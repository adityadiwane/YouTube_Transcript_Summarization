00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.060
Paying close attention to something:

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.340
Not that easy, is it?

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.356
It's because our attention is pulled
in so many different directions at a time,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.460
and it's in fact pretty impressive
if you can stay focused.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.236
Many people think that attention
is all about what we are focusing on,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.060
but it's also about what information
our brain is trying to filter out.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.860
There are two ways
you direct your attention.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.980
First, there's overt attention.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.596
In overt attention,
you move your eyes towards something

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.180
in order to pay attention to it.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.156
Then there's covert attention.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.196
In covert attention,
you pay attention to something,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.780
but without moving your eyes.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.500
Think of driving for a second.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.796
Your overt attention,
your direction of the eyes,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.476
are in front,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.276
but that's your covert attention

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.380
which is constantly scanning
the surrounding area,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.300
where you don't actually look at them.

00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:19.276
I'm a computational neuroscientist,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.396
and I work on cognitive
brain-machine interfaces,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.460
or bringing together
the brain and the computer.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.140
I love brain patterns.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.236
Brain patterns are important for us

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.756
because based on them
we can build models for the computers,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.196
and based on these models

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.436
computers can recognize
how well our brain functions.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.060
And if it doesn't function well,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.820
then these computers themselves
can be used as assistive devices

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.780
for therapies.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.940
But that also means something,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.676
because choosing the wrong patterns

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.596
will give us the wrong models

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.276
and therefore the wrong therapies.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.500
Right?

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.116
In case of attention,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.420
the fact that we can

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.116
shift our attention not only by our eyes

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.460
but also by thinking --

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.340
that makes covert attention
an interesting model for computers.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.556
So I wanted to know
what are the brainwave patterns

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.260
when you look overtly
or when you look covertly.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.020
I set up an experiment for that.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.516
In this experiment
there are two flickering squares,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.900
one of them flickering
at a slower rate than the other one.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.236
Depending on which of these flickers
you are paying attention to,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.220
certain parts of your brain
will start resonating in the same rate

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.460
as that flickering rate.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.756
So by analyzing your brain signals,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.820
we can track where exactly
you are watching

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.140
or you are paying attention to.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.036
So to see what happens in your brain
when you pay overt attention,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.316
I asked people to look directly
in one of the squares

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.620
and pay attention to it.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.876
In this case, not surprisingly,
we saw that these flickering squares

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.836
appeared in their brain signals

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.220
which was coming
from the back of their head,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.780
which is responsible for the processing
of your visual information.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.436
But I was really interested

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.620
to see what happens in your brain
when you pay covert attention.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.196
So this time I asked people
to look in the middle of the screen

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.100
and without moving their eyes,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.660
to pay attention
to either of these squares.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.556
When we did that,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.516
we saw that both of these flickering rates
appeared in their brain signals,

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.740
but interestingly,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.996
only one of them,
which was paid attention to,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.676
had stronger signals,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.956
so there was something in the brain

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.516
which was handling this information

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.740
so that thing in the brain was basically
the activation of the frontal area.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.236
The front part of your brain
is responsible

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.140
for higher cognitive functions as a human.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.420
The frontal part,
it seems that it works as a filter

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.836
trying to let information come in
only from the right flicker

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.500
that you are paying attention to

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.180
and trying to inhibit the information
coming from the ignored one.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.516
The filtering ability of the brain
is indeed a key for attention,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.316
which is missing in some people,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.820
for example in people with ADHD.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.476
So a person with ADHD
cannot inhibit these distractors,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.260
and that's why they can't focus
for a long time on a single task.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.956
But what if this person

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.516
could play a specific computer game

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.420
with his brain connected to the computer,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.380
and then train his own brain

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.620
to inhibit these distractors?

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.980
Well, ADHD is just one example.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.276
We can use these cognitive
brain-machine interfaces

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.500
for many other cognitive fields.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.356
It was just a few years ago

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.100
that my grandfather had a stroke,
and he lost complete ability to speak.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.796
He could understand everybody,
but there was no way to respond,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.300
even not writing
because he was illiterate.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.340
So he passed away in silence.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.956
I remember thinking at that time:

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.876
What if we could have a computer

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.260
which could speak for him?

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.876
Now, after years that I am in this field,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.220
I can see that this might be possible.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.916
Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.380
when people think
about images or even letters,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.476
like the letter A generates
a different brainwave pattern

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.220
than the letter B, and so on.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.460
Could a computer one day
communicate for people who can't speak?

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.900
What if a computer

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.340
can help us understand
the thoughts of a person in a coma?

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.276
We are not there yet,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.036
but pay close attention.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.756
We will be there soon.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.276
Thank you.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.932
(Applause)
