00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:29.642
It's wonderful to be back.

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.368
I love this wonderful gathering.

00:00:32.392 --> 00:00:34.589
And you must be wondering, "What on earth?

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:36.265
Have they put up the wrong slide?"

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:37.447
No, no.

00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:42.638
Look at this magnificent beast,

00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:46.166
and ask the question: Who designed it?

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:52.062
This is TED; this is
Technology, Entertainment, Design,

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:53.825
and there's a dairy cow.

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:57.210
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal.

00:00:58.104 --> 00:01:00.302
And I was thinking,
how do I introduce this?

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:04.976
And I thought, well, maybe
that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.980
you know: "Poems are made by fools
like me, but only God can make a tree."

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:12.668
And you might say,
"Well, God designed the cow."

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:14.795
But, of course, God got a lot of help.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:18.834
This is the ancestor of cattle.

00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:20.032
This is the aurochs.

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:23.760
And it was designed by natural selection,

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:27.211
the process of natural selection,
over many millions of years.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.663
And then it became domesticated,
thousands of years ago.

00:01:32.274 --> 00:01:36.923
And human beings became its stewards,

00:01:36.947 --> 00:01:39.177
and, without even knowing
what they were doing,

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:43.497
they gradually redesigned it
and redesigned it and redesigned it.

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:49.759
And then more recently, they really began
to do reverse engineering on this beast

00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:52.554
and figure out just what
the parts were, how they worked

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:56.000
and how they might be optimized --
how they might be made better.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.696
Now, why am I talking about cows?

00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:05.181
Because I want to say that
much the same thing is true of religions.

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:10.688
Religions are natural phenomena --
they're just as natural as cows.

00:02:11.862 --> 00:02:15.454
They have evolved over millennia.

00:02:16.438 --> 00:02:20.149
They have a biological base,
just like the aurochs.

00:02:20.798 --> 00:02:22.866
They have become domesticated,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.217
and human beings have been redesigning
their religions for thousands of years.

00:02:29.138 --> 00:02:32.976
This is TED, and I want
to talk about design.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.913
Because what I've been doing
for the last four years --

00:02:35.937 --> 00:02:37.957
really since the first time you saw me --

00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:40.984
some of you saw me at TED
when I was talking about religion --

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:42.501
and in the last four years,

00:02:42.525 --> 00:02:45.548
I've been working
just about non-stop on this topic.

00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:50.479
And you might say it's about
the reverse engineering of religions.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.153
Now that very idea, I think,
strikes terror in many people,

00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:01.777
or anger, or anxiety
of one sort or another.

00:03:02.743 --> 00:03:05.170
And that is the spell
that I want to break.

00:03:05.194 --> 00:03:08.909
I want to say, no, religions
are an important natural phenomenon.

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:12.181
We should study them
with the same intensity

00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:15.372
that we study all the other
important natural phenomena,

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:18.976
like global warming, as we heard
so eloquently last night from Al Gore.

00:03:20.128 --> 00:03:23.976
Today's religions are brilliantly
designed -- brilliantly designed.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.953
They are immensely powerful
social institutions

00:03:28.977 --> 00:03:34.257
and many of their features
can be traced back to earlier features

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:37.540
that we can really make sense of
by reverse engineering.

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:44.705
And, as with the cow, there's a mixture
of evolutionary design --

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.698
designed by natural selection itself --

00:03:46.722 --> 00:03:49.829
and intelligent design --

00:03:49.853 --> 00:03:51.667
more or less intelligent design --

00:03:51.691 --> 00:03:53.389
and redesigned by human beings

00:03:53.413 --> 00:03:56.293
who are trying
to redesign their religions.

00:03:57.564 --> 00:04:01.144
You don't do book talks at TED,

00:04:01.168 --> 00:04:05.292
but I'm going to have
just one slide about my book,

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:07.989
because there is one message in it

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:10.177
which I think this group
really needs to hear.

00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:13.733
And I would be very interested
to get your responses to this.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.695
It's the one policy proposal
that I make in the book,

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:23.082
at this time, when I claim
not to know enough about religion

00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:25.725
to know what other
policy proposals to make.

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:30.297
And it's one that echoes remarks
that you've heard already today.

00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:31.480
Here's my proposal,

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:34.434
I'm going to just take a couple
of minutes to explain it:

00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:40.002
Education on world religions
for all of our children --

00:04:40.026 --> 00:04:42.169
in primary school, in high school,

00:04:42.193 --> 00:04:45.458
in public schools, in private schools
and in home schooling.

00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:48.179
So what I'm proposing is,

00:04:48.203 --> 00:04:54.063
just as we require reading, writing,
arithmetic, American history,

00:04:54.087 --> 00:05:01.087
so we should have a curriculum on facts
about all the religions of the world --

00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:05.976
about their history,
about their creeds, about their texts,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.661
their music, their symbolisms,
their prohibitions, their requirements.

00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:16.813
And this should be presented
factually, straightforwardly,

00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:22.301
with no particular spin,
to all of the children in the country.

00:05:23.507 --> 00:05:26.800
And as long as you teach them that,

00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:28.976
you can teach them anything else you like.

00:05:29.713 --> 00:05:33.705
That, I think, is maximal tolerance
for religious freedom.

00:05:34.363 --> 00:05:38.976
As long as you inform your children
about other religions,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.146
then you may -- and as early as you like
and whatever you like --

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.369
teach them whatever creed
you want them to learn.

00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:48.592
But also let them know
about other religions.

00:05:48.616 --> 00:05:51.000
Now, why do I say that?

00:05:52.365 --> 00:05:58.171
Because democracy depends
on an informed citizenship.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.000
Informed consent is the very bedrock
of our understanding of democracy.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.976
Misinformed consent is not worth it.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.223
It's like a coin flip;
it doesn't count, really.

00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:15.976
Democracy depends on informed consent.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.333
This is the way we treat people
as responsible adults.

00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:28.550
Now, children below the age of consent
are a special case.

00:06:30.608 --> 00:06:36.199
Parents -- I'm going to use a word
that Pastor Rick just used --

00:06:36.223 --> 00:06:38.365
parents are stewards of their children.

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:40.484
They don't own them.

00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:43.188
You can't own your children.

00:06:43.212 --> 00:06:46.895
You have a responsibility to the world,

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.660
to the state, to them,
to take care of them right.

00:06:52.843 --> 00:06:58.890
You may teach them whatever creed
you think is most important,

00:06:58.914 --> 00:07:03.740
but I say you have a responsibility
to let them be informed

00:07:03.764 --> 00:07:06.296
about all the other creeds
in the world, too.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.468
The reason I've taken this time
is I've been fascinated to hear

00:07:11.492 --> 00:07:13.000
some of the reactions to this.

00:07:14.663 --> 00:07:19.779
One reviewer for a Roman Catholic
newspaper called it "totalitarian."

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:25.000
It strikes me as practically libertarian.

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:29.094
Is it totalitarian to require
reading, writing and arithmetic?

00:07:29.118 --> 00:07:30.277
I don't think so.

00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:32.280
All I'm saying is --

00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:38.228
and facts, facts only;
no values, just facts --

00:07:38.252 --> 00:07:40.000
about all the world's religions.

00:07:41.683 --> 00:07:43.606
Another reviewer called it "hilarious."

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.557
Well, I'm really bothered by the fact

00:07:48.581 --> 00:07:51.200
that anybody would think
that was hilarious.

00:07:51.224 --> 00:07:55.205
It seems to me to be such a plausible,

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:59.625
natural extension of the democratic
principles we already have

00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:04.669
that I'm shocked to think anybody
would find that just ridiculous.

00:08:05.002 --> 00:08:08.519
I know many religions

00:08:08.543 --> 00:08:15.180
are so anxious about preserving the purity
of their faith among their children

00:08:15.204 --> 00:08:20.692
that they are intent on keeping
their children ignorant of other faiths.

00:08:22.145 --> 00:08:23.994
I don't think that's defensible.

00:08:25.184 --> 00:08:27.818
But I'd really be pleased
to get your answers on that --

00:08:27.842 --> 00:08:29.369
any reactions to that -- later.

00:08:29.393 --> 00:08:30.858
But now I'm going to move on.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.976
Back to the cow.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.364
This picture, which I pulled
off the web --

00:08:36.388 --> 00:08:39.693
the fellow on the left is really
an important part of this picture.

00:08:39.717 --> 00:08:40.976
That's the steward.

00:08:41.305 --> 00:08:46.814
Cows couldn't live without human
stewards -- they're domesticated.

00:08:46.838 --> 00:08:49.576
They're a sort of ectosymbiont.

00:08:50.132 --> 00:08:54.774
They depend on us for their survival.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.723
And Pastor Rick
was just talking about sheep.

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.446
I'm going to talk about sheep, too.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.453
There's a lot of serendipitous
convergence here.

00:09:04.007 --> 00:09:07.916
How clever it was of sheep
to acquire shepherds!

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.273
(Laughter)

00:09:10.297 --> 00:09:12.082
Think of what this got them.

00:09:12.438 --> 00:09:14.976
They could outsource all their problems:

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.611
protection from predators,
food-finding ...

00:09:17.635 --> 00:09:18.642
(Laughter)

00:09:18.666 --> 00:09:20.001
... health maintenance.

00:09:20.025 --> 00:09:21.918
(Laughter)

00:09:22.712 --> 00:09:27.500
The only cost in most flocks --
not even this -- a loss of free mating.

00:09:29.665 --> 00:09:30.831
What a deal!

00:09:31.673 --> 00:09:33.549
"How clever of sheep!" you might say.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.074
Except, of course,
it wasn't the sheep's cleverness.

00:09:36.098 --> 00:09:40.487
We all know sheep are not exactly rocket
scientists -- they're not very smart.

00:09:41.427 --> 00:09:43.550
It wasn't the cleverness
of the sheep at all.

00:09:43.574 --> 00:09:44.976
They were clueless.

00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:48.135
But it was a very clever move.

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:49.482
Whose clever move was it?

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.976
It was the clever move
of natural selection itself.

00:09:53.818 --> 00:09:59.601
Francis Crick, the co-discoverer
of the structure of DNA

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:01.388
with Jim Watson,

00:10:01.412 --> 00:10:04.229
once joked about what he called
Orgel's Second Rule.

00:10:04.578 --> 00:10:09.829
Leslie Orgel is a molecular
biologist, brilliant guy,

00:10:09.853 --> 00:10:11.223
and Orgel's Second Rule is:

00:10:11.247 --> 00:10:13.024
Evolution is cleverer than you are.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.363
Now, that is not Intelligent Design --
not from Francis Crick.

00:10:21.479 --> 00:10:23.170
Evolution is cleverer than you are.

00:10:23.194 --> 00:10:26.328
If you understand Orgel's Second Rule,
then you understand

00:10:26.352 --> 00:10:31.255
why the Intelligent Design movement
is basically a hoax.

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:37.630
The designs discovered
by the process of natural selection

00:10:37.654 --> 00:10:40.034
are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.

00:10:40.058 --> 00:10:44.976
Again and again biologists are fascinated
with the brilliance of what's discovered.

00:10:45.283 --> 00:10:48.448
But the process itself is without purpose,

00:10:48.472 --> 00:10:50.647
without foresight, without design.

00:10:51.358 --> 00:10:52.889
When I was here four years ago,

00:10:52.913 --> 00:10:55.834
I told the story about an ant
climbing a blade of grass.

00:10:55.858 --> 00:10:59.724
And why the ant was doing it
was because its brain had been infected

00:10:59.748 --> 00:11:04.920
with a lancet fluke that was needed
to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow

00:11:04.944 --> 00:11:07.318
in order to reproduce.

00:11:07.342 --> 00:11:08.976
So it was sort of a spooky story.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.746
And I think some people
may have misunderstood.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.374
Lancet flukes aren't smart.

00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:18.108
I submit that the intelligence
of a lancet fluke is down there,

00:11:18.132 --> 00:11:20.312
somewhere between petunia and carrot.

00:11:20.336 --> 00:11:22.638
They're not really bright.
They don't have to be.

00:11:22.662 --> 00:11:24.249
The lesson we learn from this is:

00:11:24.273 --> 00:11:26.976
you don't have to have a mind
to be a beneficiary.

00:11:27.797 --> 00:11:32.289
The design is there in nature,
but it's not in anybody's head.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:33.976
It doesn't have to be.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.683
That's the way evolution works.

00:11:36.635 --> 00:11:38.762
Question: Was domestication
good for sheep?

00:11:39.223 --> 00:11:41.270
It was great for their genetic fitness.

00:11:41.294 --> 00:11:43.976
And here I want to remind you
of a wonderful point

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.976
that Paul MacCready made
at TED three years ago.

00:11:47.997 --> 00:11:49.155
Here's what he said:

00:11:50.012 --> 00:11:52.643
"Ten thousand years ago,
at the dawn of agriculture,

00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:55.079
human population, plus livestock and pets,

00:11:55.103 --> 00:12:00.210
was approximately a tenth of one percent
of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass."

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:02.377
That was just 10,000 years ago.

00:12:03.234 --> 00:12:05.278
Yesterday, in biological terms.

00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:08.484
What is it today? Does anybody
remember what he told us?

00:12:09.167 --> 00:12:11.210
98 percent.

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:14.432
That is what we have done on this planet.

00:12:14.456 --> 00:12:17.525
Now, I talked to Paul afterwards --
I wanted to check to find out

00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:20.422
how he'd calculated this, and get
the sources and so forth --

00:12:20.446 --> 00:12:23.145
and he also gave me a paper
that he had written on this.

00:12:23.169 --> 00:12:25.991
And there was a passage in it
which he did not present here

00:12:26.015 --> 00:12:28.610
and I think it is so good,
I'm going to read it to you:

00:12:28.634 --> 00:12:31.774
"Over billions of years
on a unique sphere,

00:12:31.798 --> 00:12:34.639
chance has painted
a thin covering of life:

00:12:34.663 --> 00:12:38.026
complex, improbable,
wonderful and fragile.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.976
Suddenly, we humans --
a recently arrived species

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.448
no longer subject to the checks
and balances inherent in nature --

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:47.290
have grown in population,
technology and intelligence

00:12:47.314 --> 00:12:49.257
to a position of terrible power.

00:12:49.281 --> 00:12:51.152
We now wield the paintbrush."

00:12:52.358 --> 00:12:55.747
We heard about the atmosphere
as a thin layer of varnish.

00:12:55.771 --> 00:12:58.976
Life itself is just a thin coat
of paint on this planet.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.910
And we're the ones
that hold the paintbrush.

00:13:02.576 --> 00:13:03.837
And how can we do that?

00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:07.373
The key to our domination
of the planet is culture.

00:13:08.557 --> 00:13:10.585
And the key to culture is religion.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.220
Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth.

00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.000
They would be puzzled by many things.

00:13:18.683 --> 00:13:21.397
Anybody know what this is?
I'll tell you what it is.

00:13:22.562 --> 00:13:27.855
This is a million people gathering
on the banks of the Ganges in 2001,

00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:31.341
perhaps the largest single gathering
of human beings ever,

00:13:31.365 --> 00:13:33.166
as seen from satellite photograph.

00:13:33.597 --> 00:13:34.749
Here's a big crowd.

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:36.573
Here's another crowd in Mecca.

00:13:37.153 --> 00:13:39.961
Martians would be amazed by this.

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.807
They'd want to know how it originated,

00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:44.418
what it was for
and how it perpetuates itself.

00:13:45.061 --> 00:13:47.386
Actually, I'm going to pass over this.

00:13:48.156 --> 00:13:49.411
The ant isn't alone.

00:13:49.435 --> 00:13:54.784
There's all sorts of wonderful cases
of species which -- in that case --

00:13:56.617 --> 00:14:00.323
A parasite gets into a mouse
and needs to get into the belly of a cat.

00:14:00.347 --> 00:14:03.208
And it turns the mouse
into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless,

00:14:03.232 --> 00:14:06.015
so it runs out in the open,
where it'll be eaten by a cat.

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:07.706
True story.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.742
In other words, we have these hijackers --

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.250
you've seen this slide before,
from four years ago --

00:14:12.274 --> 00:14:16.160
a parasite that infects the brain
and induces even suicidal behavior,

00:14:16.184 --> 00:14:19.423
on behalf of a cause
other than one's own genetic fitness.

00:14:20.314 --> 00:14:21.935
Does that ever happen to us?

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:25.324
Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully.

00:14:27.102 --> 00:14:29.109
The Arabic word "Islam"
means "submission."

00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:32.149
It means "surrender of self-interest
to the will of Allah."

00:14:32.617 --> 00:14:34.400
But I'm not just talking about Islam.

00:14:34.424 --> 00:14:36.573
I'm talking also about Christianity.

00:14:36.597 --> 00:14:39.935
This is a parchment music page
that I found in a Paris bookstall

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:41.227
50 years ago.

00:14:41.251 --> 00:14:43.000
And on it, it says, in Latin:

00:14:44.528 --> 00:14:47.488
"Semen est verbum Dei.
Sator autem Christus."

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:50.976
The word of God is the seed
and the sower of the seed is Christ.

00:14:51.418 --> 00:14:53.263
Same idea. Well, not quite.

00:14:53.621 --> 00:14:58.273
But in fact, Christians, too ...

00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:01.932
glory in the fact
that they have surrendered to God.

00:15:01.956 --> 00:15:03.304
I'll give you a few quotes.

00:15:03.328 --> 00:15:05.162
"The heart of worship is surrender.

00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:10.167
Surrendered people obey God's words,
even if it doesn't make sense."

00:15:11.182 --> 00:15:13.366
Those words are by Rick Warren.

00:15:13.802 --> 00:15:16.278
Those are from "The Purpose Driven Life."

00:15:16.898 --> 00:15:20.524
And I want to turn now, briefly,
to talk about that book, which I've read.

00:15:20.548 --> 00:15:21.891
You've all got a copy,

00:15:21.915 --> 00:15:24.107
and you've just heard the man.

00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:27.838
And what I want to do now
is say a bit about this book

00:15:27.862 --> 00:15:29.297
from the design standpoint,

00:15:29.321 --> 00:15:31.615
because I think it's actually
a brilliant book.

00:15:33.369 --> 00:15:36.584
First of all, the goal -- and you
heard just now what the goal is --

00:15:36.608 --> 00:15:39.919
it's to bring purpose to the lives
of millions, and he has succeeded.

00:15:39.943 --> 00:15:43.715
Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure
we all agree, it is a wonderful goal.

00:15:43.739 --> 00:15:44.890
He's absolutely right.

00:15:44.914 --> 00:15:48.722
There are lots of people out there
who don't have purpose in their life,

00:15:48.746 --> 00:15:51.556
and bringing purpose to their life
is a wonderful goal.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.172
I give him an A+ on this.

00:15:53.196 --> 00:15:55.020
(Laughter)

00:15:55.044 --> 00:15:56.647
Is the goal achieved?

00:15:58.822 --> 00:15:59.976
Yes.

00:16:01.266 --> 00:16:04.000
Thirty million copies of this book.

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:06.976
Al Gore, eat your heart out.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.657
(Laughter)

00:16:10.681 --> 00:16:14.302
Just exactly what Al is trying
to do, Rick is doing.

00:16:14.326 --> 00:16:17.267
This is a fantastic achievement.

00:16:18.028 --> 00:16:21.143
And the means -- how does he do it?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.976
It's a brilliant redesign
of traditional religious themes --

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.301
updating them, quietly dropping
obsolete features,

00:16:28.325 --> 00:16:30.483
putting new interpretations
on other features.

00:16:30.507 --> 00:16:34.198
This is the evolution of religion that's
been going on for thousands of years,

00:16:34.222 --> 00:16:37.015
and he's just the latest
brilliant practitioner of it.

00:16:38.833 --> 00:16:41.389
I don't have to tell you this;
you just heard the man.

00:16:41.413 --> 00:16:45.976
Excellent insights into human psychology,
wise advice on every page.

00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:50.407
Moreover, he invites us
to look under the hood.

00:16:50.431 --> 00:16:51.780
I really appreciated that.

00:16:51.804 --> 00:16:54.248
For instance, he has an appendix
where he explains

00:16:54.272 --> 00:16:57.332
his choice of translations
of different Bible verses.

00:16:57.999 --> 00:17:03.000
The book is clear, vivid, accessible,
beautifully formatted.

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:05.976
Just enough repetition.

00:17:06.528 --> 00:17:07.814
That's really important.

00:17:08.568 --> 00:17:12.260
Every time you read it or say it,
you make another copy in your brain.

00:17:13.871 --> 00:17:17.616
Every time you read it or say it,
you make another copy in your brain.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.648
(Laughter)

00:17:18.672 --> 00:17:19.916
With me, everybody --

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.916
(Audience and Dan Dennett)
Every time you read it or say it,

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.241
you make another copy in your brain.

00:17:25.265 --> 00:17:26.426
Thank you.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.743
And now we come to my problem.

00:17:28.767 --> 00:17:31.976
Because I'm absolutely sincere
in my appreciation

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.976
of all that I said about this book.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.218
But I wish it were better.

00:17:36.242 --> 00:17:38.178
I have some problems with the book.

00:17:38.202 --> 00:17:41.981
And it would just be insincere of me
not to address those problems.

00:17:42.346 --> 00:17:46.109
I wish he could do this with a revision,

00:17:46.133 --> 00:17:48.564
a Mark 2 version of his book.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.116
"The truth will set you free."

00:17:52.536 --> 00:17:54.443
That's what it says in the Bible,

00:17:54.467 --> 00:17:56.975
and it's something
that I want to live by, too.

00:17:57.418 --> 00:18:02.081
My problem is, some of the bits in it
I don't think are true.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:05.459
Now some of this
is a difference of opinion.

00:18:07.173 --> 00:18:10.038
And that's not my main complaint,
that's worth mentioning.

00:18:10.062 --> 00:18:13.251
Here's a passage -- it's very much
what he said, anyway:

00:18:13.275 --> 00:18:15.774
"If there was no God
we would all be accidents,

00:18:15.798 --> 00:18:18.909
the result of astronomical
random chance in the Universe.

00:18:18.933 --> 00:18:22.311
You could stop reading this book
because life would have no purpose

00:18:22.335 --> 00:18:23.819
or meaning or significance.

00:18:23.843 --> 00:18:25.425
There would be no right or wrong

00:18:25.449 --> 00:18:27.595
and no hope beyond
your brief years on Earth."

00:18:27.619 --> 00:18:29.528
Now, I just do not believe that.

00:18:29.552 --> 00:18:35.732
By the way, I find -- Homer Groening's
film presented a beautiful alternative

00:18:35.756 --> 00:18:37.097
to that very claim.

00:18:37.861 --> 00:18:41.266
Yes, there is meaning and a reason
for right or wrong.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:47.524
We don't need a belief in God
to be good or to have meaning in us.

00:18:47.548 --> 00:18:51.809
But that, as I said,
is just a difference of opinion.

00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:53.976
That's not what I'm really worried about.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.579
How about this: "God designed
this planet's environment

00:18:57.603 --> 00:18:59.110
just so we could live in it."

00:19:00.213 --> 00:19:04.655
I'm afraid that a lot of people
take that sentiment to mean

00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:07.299
that we don't have to do
the sorts of things

00:19:07.323 --> 00:19:09.711
that Al Gore is trying so hard
to get us to do.

00:19:09.735 --> 00:19:11.976
I am not happy with that sentiment at all.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.572
And then I find this: "All the evidence
available in the biological sciences

00:19:16.596 --> 00:19:20.280
supports the core proposition that
the cosmos is a specially designed whole

00:19:20.304 --> 00:19:23.583
with life and mankind
as its fundamental goal and purpose,

00:19:23.607 --> 00:19:26.291
a whole in which all facets
of reality have their meaning

00:19:26.315 --> 00:19:28.332
and explanation in this central fact."

00:19:28.356 --> 00:19:30.615
Well, that's Michael Denton.
He's a creationist.

00:19:31.833 --> 00:19:34.976
And here, I think, "Wait a minute."
I read this again.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.039
I read it three or four times and I think,

00:19:37.063 --> 00:19:39.607
"Is he really endorsing
Intelligent Design?

00:19:39.631 --> 00:19:41.618
Is he endorsing creationism here?"

00:19:41.642 --> 00:19:42.877
And you can't tell.

00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:45.006
So I'm sort of thinking,
"Well, I don't know,

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.427
I don't know if I want
to get upset with this yet."

00:19:47.451 --> 00:19:51.535
But then I read on, and I read this:
"First, Noah had never seen rain,

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:55.416
because prior to the Flood, God irrigated
the earth from the ground up."

00:19:56.614 --> 00:20:00.976
I wish that sentence weren't in there,
because I think it is false.

00:20:01.537 --> 00:20:04.704
And I think that thinking this way
about the history of the planet,

00:20:04.728 --> 00:20:08.451
after we've just been hearing
about the history of the planet

00:20:08.475 --> 00:20:11.607
over millions of years,

00:20:11.631 --> 00:20:14.818
discourages people
from scientific understanding.

00:20:14.842 --> 00:20:21.387
Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms

00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:25.517
and scientific factoids and information
in a very interesting way.

00:20:25.541 --> 00:20:28.905
Here's one: "God deliberately shaped
and formed you to serve him

00:20:28.929 --> 00:20:30.974
in a way that makes your ministry unique.

00:20:30.998 --> 00:20:34.641
He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail
that created you."

00:20:37.808 --> 00:20:39.976
I think that's false.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.698
Now, maybe we want to treat it
as metaphorical.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:47.197
Here's another one: "For instance,
your brain can store 100 trillion facts.

00:20:47.221 --> 00:20:50.266
Your mind can handle
15,000 decisions a second."

00:20:50.964 --> 00:20:53.638
Well, it would be interesting
to find the interpretation

00:20:53.662 --> 00:20:55.043
where I would accept that.

00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:57.733
There might be some way
of treating that as true.

00:20:58.511 --> 00:21:01.819
"Anthropologists have noted
that worship is a universal urge,

00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:04.498
hardwired by God into
the very fiber of our being --

00:21:04.522 --> 00:21:07.411
an inbuilt need to connect with God."

00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:10.560
Well, the sense of which I agree with him,

00:21:10.584 --> 00:21:12.964
except I think it has
an evolutionary explanation.

00:21:12.988 --> 00:21:16.809
And what I find
deeply troubling in this book

00:21:16.833 --> 00:21:20.586
is that he seems to be arguing
that if you want to be moral,

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.779
if you want to have meaning in your life,

00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:25.270
you have to be an Intelligent Designer,

00:21:25.294 --> 00:21:28.815
you have to deny the theory of evolution
by natural selection.

00:21:28.839 --> 00:21:30.318
And I think, on the contrary,

00:21:30.342 --> 00:21:33.283
that it is very important
to solving the world's problems

00:21:33.307 --> 00:21:36.167
that we take evolutionary
biology seriously.

00:21:37.427 --> 00:21:39.338
Whose truth are we going to listen to?

00:21:40.649 --> 00:21:43.201
Well, this is from
"The Purpose Driven Life":

00:21:43.225 --> 00:21:46.518
"The Bible must become
the authoritative standard for my life:

00:21:46.542 --> 00:21:48.281
the compass I rely on for direction,

00:21:48.305 --> 00:21:51.122
the counsel I listen to
for making wise decisions,

00:21:51.146 --> 00:21:53.553
and the benchmark I use
for evaluating everything."

00:21:54.458 --> 00:21:58.845
Well maybe, OK, but what's going
to follow from this?

00:21:58.869 --> 00:22:01.011
And here's one that does concern me.

00:22:02.463 --> 00:22:04.816
Remember I quoted him
before with this line:

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.637
"Surrendered people obey God's word,
even if it doesn't make sense."

00:22:10.335 --> 00:22:13.139
And that's a problem.

00:22:14.843 --> 00:22:15.843
(Sighs)

00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:17.511
"Don't ever argue with the Devil.

00:22:17.535 --> 00:22:19.266
He's better at arguing than you are,

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.676
having had thousands
of years to practice."

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.927
Now, Rick Warren
didn't invent this clever move.

00:22:25.951 --> 00:22:27.141
It's an old move.

00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:30.200
It's a very clever
adaptation of religions.

00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:33.820
It's a wild card for disarming
any reasonable criticism.

00:22:35.546 --> 00:22:37.268
"You don't like my interpretation?

00:22:37.292 --> 00:22:39.244
You've got a reasonable objection to it?

00:22:39.268 --> 00:22:40.764
Don't listen, don't listen!

00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:43.000
That's the Devil speaking."

00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:49.786
This discourages the sort
of reasoning citizenship

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.862
it seems to me that we want to have.

00:22:52.668 --> 00:22:54.976
I've got one more problem,
then I'm through.

00:22:55.298 --> 00:22:59.605
And I'd really like to get
a response if Rick is able to do it.

00:23:00.593 --> 00:23:02.372
"In the Great Commission, Jesus said,

00:23:02.396 --> 00:23:05.258
'Go to all people of all nations
and make them my disciples.

00:23:05.282 --> 00:23:08.497
Baptize them in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit,

00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:10.788
and teach them to do
everything I've told you.'"

00:23:10.812 --> 00:23:14.128
The Bible says Jesus is the only one
who can save the world.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:18.976
We've seen many wonderful maps
of the world in the last day or so.

00:23:19.297 --> 00:23:21.623
Here's one, not as beautiful
as the others;

00:23:21.647 --> 00:23:23.976
it simply shows
the religions of the world.

00:23:25.066 --> 00:23:28.976
Here's one that shows the sort of current
breakdown of the different religions.

00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:36.609
Do we really want to commit ourselves

00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:41.553
to engulfing all the other religions,

00:23:41.577 --> 00:23:44.943
when their holy books are telling them,

00:23:44.967 --> 00:23:49.426
"Don't listen to the other side,
that's just Satan talking!"?

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:55.787
It seems to me that
that's a very problematic ship

00:23:55.811 --> 00:23:57.976
to get on for the future.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.976
I found this sign as I was driving
to Maine recently,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.667
in front of a church:
"Good without God becomes zero."

00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:06.864
Sort of cute.

00:24:07.205 --> 00:24:09.254
A very clever little meme.

00:24:11.589 --> 00:24:17.193
I don't believe it and I think this idea,
popular as it is --

00:24:17.217 --> 00:24:19.308
not in this guise, but in general --

00:24:19.332 --> 00:24:22.585
is itself one of the main
problems that we face.

00:24:22.609 --> 00:24:29.280
If you are like me, you know
many wonderful, committed, engaged

00:24:29.304 --> 00:24:34.976
atheists, agnostics, who are being
very good without God.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.705
And you also know many religious people
who hide behind their sanctity

00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:42.498
instead of doing good works.

00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:46.554
So, I wish we could drop this meme.

00:24:46.578 --> 00:24:48.571
I wish this meme would go extinct.

00:24:48.595 --> 00:24:50.342
Thanks very much for your attention.

00:24:50.366 --> 00:24:52.900
(Applause)
