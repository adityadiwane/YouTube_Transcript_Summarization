00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:14.023
A couple of years ago,

00:00:14.023 --> 00:00:16.241
Harvard Business School chose

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:18.990
the best business model of that year.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.054
It chose Somali piracy.

00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:25.270
Pretty much around the same time,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.103
I discovered that there were 544 seafarers

00:00:31.103 --> 00:00:34.489
being held hostage on ships,

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.579
often anchored just off the Somali coast

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.007
in plain sight.

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.632
And I learned these two facts, and I thought,

00:00:41.632 --> 00:00:44.073
what's going on in shipping?

00:00:44.073 --> 00:00:46.644
And I thought, would that happen
in any other industry?

00:00:46.644 --> 00:00:50.155
Would we see 544 airline pilots

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:51.785
held captive in their jumbo jets

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:55.272
on a runway for months, or a year?

00:00:55.272 --> 00:00:59.098
Would we see 544 Greyhound bus drivers?

00:00:59.098 --> 00:01:00.977
It wouldn't happen.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.755
So I started to get intrigued.

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:06.269
And I discovered another fact,

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:08.252
which to me was more astonishing

00:01:08.252 --> 00:01:11.337
almost for the fact that I hadn't known it before

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.996
at the age of 42, 43.

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:19.315
That is how fundamentally 
we still depend on shipping.

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:21.660
Because perhaps the general public

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.785
thinks of shipping as an old-fashioned industry,

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.323
something brought by sailboat

00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:30.708
with Moby Dicks and Jack Sparrows.

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:32.602
But shipping isn't that.

00:01:32.602 --> 00:01:37.479
Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.082
Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade.

00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:46.647
Shipping has quadrupled in size since 1970.

00:01:46.647 --> 00:01:49.639
We are more dependent on it now than ever.

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:53.398
And yet, for such an enormous industry --

00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:56.875
there are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea —

00:01:56.875 --> 00:02:00.268
it's become pretty much invisible.

00:02:00.268 --> 00:02:04.557
Now that sounds absurd in Singapore to say that,

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.903
because here shipping is so present

00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:10.285
that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel.

00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:11.965
(Laughter)

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.981
But elsewhere in the world,

00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:16.227
if you ask the general public what they know

00:02:16.227 --> 00:02:19.063
about shipping and how much
trade is carried by sea,

00:02:19.063 --> 00:02:23.680
you will get essentially a blank face.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.713
You will ask someone on the street

00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:27.436
if they've heard of Microsoft.

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:29.273
I should think they'll say yes,

00:02:29.273 --> 00:02:31.468
because they'll know that they make software

00:02:31.468 --> 00:02:33.363
that goes on computers,

00:02:33.363 --> 00:02:36.508
and occasionally works.

00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:40.113
But if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk,

00:02:40.113 --> 00:02:42.814
I doubt you'd get the same response,

00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:44.261
even though Maersk,

00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:47.952
which is just one shipping company amongst many,

00:02:47.952 --> 00:02:50.934
has revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft.

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:52.415
[$60.2 billion]

00:02:52.415 --> 00:02:54.338
Now why is this?

00:02:54.338 --> 00:02:56.251
A few years ago,

00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:59.523
the first sea lord of the British admiralty --

00:02:59.523 --> 00:03:01.328
he is called the first sea lord,

00:03:01.328 --> 00:03:05.823
although the chief of the army is not called a land lord —

00:03:05.823 --> 00:03:08.266
he said that we, and he meant

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:10.948
in the industrialized nations in the West,

00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:14.760
that we suffer from sea blindness.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.404
We are blind to the sea

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:19.330
as a place of industry or of work.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.623
It's just something we fly over,

00:03:21.623 --> 00:03:24.628
a patch of blue on an airline map.

00:03:24.628 --> 00:03:27.953
Nothing to see, move along.

00:03:27.953 --> 00:03:31.598
So I wanted to open my own eyes

00:03:31.598 --> 00:03:34.675
to my own sea blindness,

00:03:34.675 --> 00:03:38.045
so I ran away to sea.

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:40.396
A couple of years ago, I took a passage

00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:42.770
on the Maersk Kendal,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.112
a mid-sized container ship

00:03:44.112 --> 00:03:47.340
carrying nearly 7,000 boxes,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.237
and I departed from Felixstowe,

00:03:49.237 --> 00:03:51.000
on the south coast of England,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.161
and I ended up right here in Singapore

00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:54.654
five weeks later,

00:03:54.654 --> 00:03:59.558
considerably less jet-lagged than I am right now.

00:03:59.558 --> 00:04:02.800
And it was a revelation.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.995
We traveled through five seas,

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:07.542
two oceans, nine ports,

00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:10.289
and I learned a lot about shipping.

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:12.007
And one of the first things that surprised me

00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:14.394
when I got on board Kendal

00:04:14.394 --> 00:04:17.139
was, where are all the people?

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.759
I have friends in the Navy who tell me

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.898
they sail with 1,000 sailors at a time,

00:04:21.898 --> 00:04:25.237
but on Kendal there were only 21 crew.

00:04:25.237 --> 00:04:28.114
Now that's because shipping is very efficient.

00:04:28.114 --> 00:04:31.178
Containerization has made it very efficient.

00:04:31.178 --> 00:04:33.272
Ships have automation now.

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:36.001
They can operate with small crews.

00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:37.790
But it also means that, in the words

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.250
of a port chaplain I once met,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.295
the average seafarer you're going to find

00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:46.434
on a container ship is either tired or exhausted,

00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:49.213
because the pace of modern shipping

00:04:49.213 --> 00:04:51.534
is quite punishing for what the shipping calls

00:04:51.534 --> 00:04:53.965
its human element,

00:04:53.965 --> 00:04:56.417
a strange phrase which they don't seem to realize

00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:58.821
sounds a little bit inhuman.

00:04:58.821 --> 00:05:01.496
So most seafarers now working on container ships

00:05:01.496 --> 00:05:05.573
often have less than two hours in port at a time.

00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:07.211
They don't have time to relax.

00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:09.455
They're at sea for months at a time,

00:05:09.455 --> 00:05:10.770
and even when they're on board,

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.072
they don't have access to what

00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:16.506
a five-year-old would take for granted, the Internet.

00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:19.332
And another thing that surprised me
when I got on board Kendal

00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:22.317
was who I was sitting next to --

00:05:22.327 --> 00:05:27.576
Not the queen; I can't imagine why
they put me underneath her portrait --

00:05:27.576 --> 00:05:30.345
But around that dining table in the officer's saloon,

00:05:30.345 --> 00:05:32.173
I was sitting next to a Burmese guy,

00:05:32.173 --> 00:05:35.438
I was opposite a Romanian, a Moldavian, an Indian.

00:05:35.438 --> 00:05:37.675
On the next table was a Chinese guy,

00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:40.717
and in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos.

00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:43.677
So that was a normal working ship.

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.700
Now how is that possible?

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.592
Because the biggest dramatic change

00:05:47.592 --> 00:05:49.436
in shipping over the last 60 years,

00:05:49.436 --> 00:05:51.948
when most of the general public stopped noticing it,

00:05:51.948 --> 00:05:54.567
was something called an open registry,

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:57.372
or a flag of convenience.

00:05:57.372 --> 00:05:59.959
Ships can now fly the flag of any nation

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:02.911
that provides a flag registry.

00:06:02.911 --> 00:06:05.186
You can get a flag from the landlocked nation

00:06:05.186 --> 00:06:07.310
of Bolivia, or Mongolia,

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.285
or North Korea, though that's not very popular.

00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:11.708
(Laughter)

00:06:11.708 --> 00:06:13.819
So we have these very multinational,

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:18.600
global, mobile crews on ships.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.312
And that was a surprise to me.

00:06:21.312 --> 00:06:24.429
And when we got to pirate waters,

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:27.555
down the Bab-el-Mandeb strait
and into the Indian Ocean,

00:06:27.555 --> 00:06:29.307
the ship changed.

00:06:29.307 --> 00:06:32.450
And that was also shocking, because suddenly,

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.664
I realized, as the captain said to me,

00:06:34.664 --> 00:06:36.666
that I had been crazy to choose to go

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:39.718
through pirate waters on a container ship.

00:06:39.718 --> 00:06:41.709
We were no longer allowed on deck.

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:44.305
There were double pirate watches.

00:06:44.305 --> 00:06:48.582
And at that time, there were those 
544 seafarers being held hostage,

00:06:48.582 --> 00:06:50.550
and some of them were held hostage for years

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.321
because of the nature of shipping
and the flag of convenience.

00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:55.403
Not all of them, but some of them were,

00:06:55.403 --> 00:07:00.117
because for the minority
of unscrupulous ship owners,

00:07:00.117 --> 00:07:02.662
it can be easy to hide behind

00:07:02.662 --> 00:07:07.661
the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience.

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:11.600
What else does our sea blindness mask?

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.919
Well, if you go out to sea on a ship

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.914
or on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel,

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:18.783
you'll see very black smoke.

00:07:18.783 --> 00:07:21.318
And that's because shipping

00:07:21.318 --> 00:07:23.905
has very tight margins,
and they want cheap fuel,

00:07:23.905 --> 00:07:26.076
so they use something called bunker fuel,

00:07:26.076 --> 00:07:28.592
which was described to me
by someone in the tanker industry

00:07:28.592 --> 00:07:30.758
as the dregs of the refinery,

00:07:30.758 --> 00:07:34.015
or just one step up from asphalt.

00:07:34.015 --> 00:07:37.412
And shipping is the greenest method of transport.

00:07:37.412 --> 00:07:39.755
In terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile,

00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:42.726
it emits about a thousandth of aviation

00:07:42.726 --> 00:07:44.841
and about a tenth of trucking.

00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:48.077
But it's not benign, because there's so much of it.

00:07:48.077 --> 00:07:50.607
So shipping emissions are
about three to four percent,

00:07:50.607 --> 00:07:52.782
almost the same as aviation's.

00:07:52.782 --> 00:07:54.171
And if you put shipping emissions

00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:57.551
on a list of the countries' carbon emissions,

00:07:57.551 --> 00:07:59.164
it would come in about sixth,

00:07:59.164 --> 00:08:01.278
somewhere near Germany.

00:08:01.278 --> 00:08:05.296
It was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships

00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:07.891
pollute in terms of particles and soot

00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:09.291
and noxious gases

00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:11.869
as much as all the cars in the world.

00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:13.269
And the good news is that

00:08:13.269 --> 00:08:15.464
people are now talking about sustainable shipping.

00:08:15.464 --> 00:08:17.951
There are interesting initiatives going on.

00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:20.206
But why has it taken so long?

00:08:20.206 --> 00:08:22.553
When are we going to start talking and thinking

00:08:22.553 --> 00:08:26.589
about shipping miles as well as air miles?

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.394
I also traveled to Cape Cod to look

00:08:29.394 --> 00:08:33.321
at the plight of the North Atlantic right whale,

00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:35.477
because this to me was one
of the most surprising things

00:08:35.477 --> 00:08:37.433
about my time at sea,

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:39.230
and what it made me think about.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.383
We know about man's impact on the ocean

00:08:42.383 --> 00:08:44.815
in terms of fishing and overfishing,

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:46.623
but we don't really know much about

00:08:46.623 --> 00:08:48.806
what's happening underneath the water.

00:08:48.806 --> 00:08:51.411
And in fact, shipping has a role to play here,

00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:55.057
because shipping noise has contributed

00:08:55.057 --> 00:08:58.250
to damaging the acoustic
habitats of ocean creatures.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.242
Light doesn't penetrate beneath
the surface of the water,

00:09:01.242 --> 00:09:03.869
so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins

00:09:03.869 --> 00:09:06.173
and even 800 species of fish

00:09:06.173 --> 00:09:09.064
communicate by sound.

00:09:09.064 --> 00:09:10.777
And a North Atlantic right whale

00:09:10.777 --> 00:09:13.984
can transmit across hundreds of miles.

00:09:13.984 --> 00:09:15.947
A humpback can transmit a sound

00:09:15.947 --> 00:09:17.885
across a whole ocean.

00:09:17.885 --> 00:09:19.840
But a supertanker can also be heard

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.911
coming across a whole ocean,

00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:24.475
and because the noise that
propellers make underwater

00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:27.812
is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use,

00:09:27.812 --> 00:09:30.846
then it can damage their acoustic habitat,

00:09:30.846 --> 00:09:32.536
and they need this for breeding,

00:09:32.536 --> 00:09:34.187
for finding feeding grounds,

00:09:34.187 --> 00:09:36.710
for finding mates.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.551
And the acoustic habitat of the
North Atlantic right whale

00:09:39.551 --> 00:09:42.901
has been reduced by up to 90 percent.

00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:47.513
But there are no laws governing 
acoustic pollution yet.

00:09:47.513 --> 00:09:50.769
And when I arrived in Singapore,

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:55.673
and I apologize for this, but I 
didn't want to get off my ship.

00:09:55.676 --> 00:09:58.635
I'd really loved being on board Kendal.

00:09:58.635 --> 00:10:00.530
I'd been well treated by the crew,

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.071
I'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain,

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:08.143
and I would happily have signed up
for another five weeks,

00:10:08.143 --> 00:10:09.974
something that the captain also said

00:10:09.974 --> 00:10:12.247
I was crazy to think about.

00:10:12.247 --> 00:10:14.491
But I wasn't there for nine months at a time

00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:16.446
like the Filipino seafarers,

00:10:16.446 --> 00:10:18.685
who, when I asked them to describe their job to me,

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:21.007
called it "dollar for homesickness."

00:10:21.007 --> 00:10:22.485
They had good salaries,

00:10:22.485 --> 00:10:25.516
but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life

00:10:25.516 --> 00:10:29.205
in a dangerous and often difficult element.

00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:31.291
But when I get to this part, I'm in two minds,

00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:34.216
because I want to salute those seafarers

00:10:34.216 --> 00:10:36.403
who bring us 90 percent of everything

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:40.069
and get very little thanks or recognition for it.

00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:42.790
I want to salute the 100,000 ships

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.113
that are at sea

00:10:44.113 --> 00:10:46.646
that are doing that work, coming in and out

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.875
every day, bringing us what we need.

00:10:49.875 --> 00:10:52.895
But I also want to see shipping,

00:10:52.895 --> 00:10:56.374
and us, the general public,
who know so little about it,

00:10:56.374 --> 00:10:58.414
to have a bit more scrutiny,

00:10:58.414 --> 00:11:00.518
to be a bit more transparent,

00:11:00.518 --> 00:11:03.790
to have 90 percent transparency.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.691
Because I think we could all benefit

00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:08.796
from doing something very simple,

00:11:08.796 --> 00:11:11.878
which is learning to see the sea.

00:11:11.878 --> 00:11:14.036
Thank you.

00:11:14.036 --> 00:11:18.344
(Applause)
