00:00:12.723 --> 00:00:19.123
I'm 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana.

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:23.244
The air is thick with heat and dust,

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:26.653
and it's hard to breathe.

00:00:26.653 --> 00:00:29.915
I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:34.161
in the darkness, but I can't see much else.

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:38.131
I hear voices talking, but mostly the shaft

00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:42.119
is this cacophony of men coughing,

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:46.030
and stone being broken with primitive tools.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.085
Like the others, I wear a flickering, cheap flashlight

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:54.881
tied to my head with this elastic, tattered band,

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:58.221
and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs

00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:01.250
holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.876
dropping hundreds of feet into the earth.

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:08.956
When my hand slips, I suddenly remember a miner

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:13.237
I had met days before who had lost his grip

00:01:13.237 --> 00:01:17.858
and fell countless feet down that shaft.

00:01:17.858 --> 00:01:20.389
As I stand talking to you today,

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:23.893
these men are still deep in that hole,

00:01:23.893 --> 00:01:27.408
risking their lives without payment or compensation,

00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:30.548
and often dying.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:35.736
I got to climb out of that hole, and I got to go home,

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:41.918
but they likely never will, because they're trapped in slavery.

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:44.825
For the last 28 years, I've been documenting

00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:47.386
indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:51.181
on six continents, and in 2009 I had the great honor

00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:55.593
of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit.

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:59.165
Amongst all the astonishing people I met there,

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:02.335
I met a supporter of Free the Slaves, an NGO

00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:07.662
dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery.

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:10.551
We started talking about slavery, and really,

00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:13.415
I started learning about slavery,

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:16.624
for I had certainly known it existed in the world,

00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:19.635
but not to such a degree.

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:23.378
After we finished talking, I felt so horrible

00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:26.754
and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge

00:02:26.754 --> 00:02:30.264
of this atrocity in my own lifetime, and I thought,

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:35.132
if I don't know, how many other people don't know?

00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:38.947
It started burning a hole in my stomach, so within weeks,

00:02:38.947 --> 00:02:41.923
I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director

00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:45.194
of Free the Slaves and offer them my help.

00:02:45.194 --> 00:02:49.764
Thus began my journey into modern day slavery.

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:52.906
Oddly, I had been to many of these places before.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:56.387
Some I even considered like my second home.

00:02:56.387 --> 00:03:03.822
But this time, I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet.

00:03:03.822 --> 00:03:06.127
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than

00:03:06.127 --> 00:03:10.282
27 million people enslaved in the world today.

00:03:10.282 --> 00:03:13.762
That's double the amount of people taken from Africa

00:03:13.762 --> 00:03:17.887
during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade.

00:03:17.887 --> 00:03:21.031
A hundred and fifty years ago, an agricultural slave

00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:24.525
cost about three times the annual salary

00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:27.271
of an American worker.

00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:31.264
That equates to about $50,000 in today's money.

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:35.656
Yet today, entire families can be enslaved for generations

00:03:35.656 --> 00:03:40.524
over a debt as small as $18.

00:03:40.524 --> 00:03:43.556
Astonishingly, slavery generates profits

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:49.302
of more than $13 billion worldwide each year.

00:03:49.302 --> 00:03:52.154
Many have been tricked by false promises

00:03:52.154 --> 00:03:56.700
of a good education, a better job, only to find

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.208
that they're forced to work without pay

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:05.876
under the threat of violence, and they cannot walk away.

00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:09.158
Today's slavery is about commerce,

00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:13.188
so the goods that enslaved people produce have value,

00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:18.186
but the people producing them are disposable.

00:04:18.186 --> 00:04:22.576
Slavery exists everywhere, nearly, in the world,

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:29.543
and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world.

00:04:29.543 --> 00:04:34.333
In India and Nepal, I was introduced to the brick kilns.

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:37.124
This strange and awesome sight was like

00:04:37.124 --> 00:04:41.014
walking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno.

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:45.165
Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees,

00:04:45.165 --> 00:04:49.260
men, women, children, entire families in fact,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.411
were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust,

00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:55.031
while mechanically stacking bricks on their head,

00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:58.152
up to 18 at a time, and carrying them

00:04:58.152 --> 00:05:03.102
from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away.

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:06.629
Deadened by monotony and exhaustion,

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:12.214
they work silently, doing this task over and over

00:05:12.214 --> 00:05:15.567
for 16 or 17 hours a day.

00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:19.286
There were no breaks for food, no water breaks,

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:21.838
and the severe dehydration made urinating

00:05:21.838 --> 00:05:24.710
pretty much inconsequential.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.142
So pervasive was the heat and the dust

00:05:27.142 --> 00:05:30.893
that my camera became too hot to even touch

00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:33.345
and ceased working.

00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:36.117
Every 20 minutes, I'd have to run back to our cruiser

00:05:36.117 --> 00:05:39.466
to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:42.521
to revive it, and as I sat there,

00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:47.131
I thought, my camera is getting far better treatment

00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:49.457
than these people.

00:05:49.457 --> 00:05:52.329
Back in the kilns, I wanted to cry,

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:55.507
but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me

00:05:55.507 --> 00:05:59.811
and he said, "Lisa, don't do that. Just don't do that here."

00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:03.704
And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays

00:06:03.704 --> 00:06:06.238
are very dangerous in a place like this,

00:06:06.238 --> 00:06:10.092
not just for me, but for them.

00:06:10.092 --> 00:06:13.742
I couldn't offer them any direct help.

00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:16.535
I couldn't give them money, nothing.

00:06:16.535 --> 00:06:18.332
I wasn't a citizen of that country.

00:06:18.332 --> 00:06:21.420
I could get them in a worse situation

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.200
than they were already in.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.456
I'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work

00:06:26.456 --> 00:06:29.298
within the system for their liberation,

00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:32.767
and I trusted that they would.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:36.204
As for me, I'd have to wait until I got home

00:06:36.204 --> 00:06:40.166
to really feel my heartbreak.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:43.039
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stone

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.789
for miles down mountainous terrain

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:48.687
to trucks waiting at roads below.

00:06:48.687 --> 00:06:51.205
The big sheets of slate were heavier

00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:53.871
than the children carrying them,

00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:55.900
and the kids hoisted them from their heads

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.344
using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope

00:07:00.344 --> 00:07:02.191
and torn cloth.

00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:05.866
It's difficult to witness something so overwhelming.

00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:08.513
How can we affect something so insidious,

00:07:08.513 --> 00:07:11.725
yet so pervasive?

00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:14.437
Some don't even know they're enslaved,

00:07:14.437 --> 00:07:19.443
people working 16, 17 hours a day without any pay,

00:07:19.443 --> 00:07:22.656
because this has been the case all their lives.

00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:26.938
They have nothing to compare it to.

00:07:26.938 --> 00:07:30.312
When these villagers claimed their freedom,

00:07:30.312 --> 00:07:35.727
the slaveholders burned down all of their houses.

00:07:35.727 --> 00:07:37.689
I mean, these people had nothing,

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:41.338
and they were so petrified, they wanted to give up,

00:07:41.338 --> 00:07:45.385
but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere,

00:07:45.385 --> 00:07:46.881
and abolitionists on the ground

00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:49.540
helped them get a quarry lease of their own,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.653
so that now they do the same back-breaking work,

00:07:52.653 --> 00:07:57.160
but they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.583
and they do it in freedom.

00:08:00.583 --> 00:08:02.651
Sex trafficking is what we often think of

00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:04.552
when we hear the word slavery,

00:08:04.552 --> 00:08:06.511
and because of this worldwide awareness,

00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:09.647
I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely

00:08:09.647 --> 00:08:12.469
within this particular industry.

00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:15.311
In Kathmandu, I was escorted by women who had

00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:18.847
previously been sex slaves themselves.

00:08:18.847 --> 00:08:21.205
They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs

00:08:21.205 --> 00:08:26.818
that led to this dirty, dimly fluorescent lit basement.

00:08:26.818 --> 00:08:28.650
This wasn't a brothel, per se.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.961
It was more like a restaurant.

00:08:30.961 --> 00:08:33.221
Cabin restaurants, as they're known in the trade,

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.843
are venues for forced prostitution.

00:08:35.843 --> 00:08:38.875
Each has small, private rooms, where the slaves,

00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:41.506
women, along with young girls and boys,

00:08:41.506 --> 00:08:44.285
some as young as seven years old,

00:08:44.285 --> 00:08:46.275
are forced to entertain the clients,

00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:50.055
encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol.

00:08:50.055 --> 00:08:53.094
Each cubicle is dark and dingy,

00:08:53.094 --> 00:08:57.033
identified with a painted number on the wall,

00:08:57.033 --> 00:09:01.138
and partitioned by plywood and a curtain.

00:09:01.138 --> 00:09:04.689
The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:07.271
at the hands of their customers.

00:09:07.271 --> 00:09:10.337
Standing in the near darkness, I remember feeling

00:09:10.337 --> 00:09:14.423
this quick, hot fear, and in that instant,

00:09:14.423 --> 00:09:16.768
I could only imagine what it must be like

00:09:16.768 --> 00:09:19.431
to be trapped in that hell.

00:09:19.431 --> 00:09:24.033
I had only one way out: the stairs from where I'd come in.

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:25.889
There were no back doors.

00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:28.432
There were no windows large enough to climb through.

00:09:28.432 --> 00:09:32.692
These people have no escape at all,

00:09:32.692 --> 00:09:35.752
and as we take in such a difficult subject,

00:09:35.752 --> 00:09:40.363
it's important to note that slavery, including sex trafficking,

00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:43.292
occurs in our own backyard as well.

00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:47.916
Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture,

00:09:47.916 --> 00:09:50.588
in restaurants, in domestic servitude,

00:09:50.588 --> 00:09:53.220
and the list can go on.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.859
Recently, the New York Times reported that

00:09:55.859 --> 00:10:01.665
between 100,000 and 300,000 American children

00:10:01.665 --> 00:10:05.626
are sold into sex slavery every year.

00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:12.169
It's all around us. We just don't see it.

00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:15.551
The textile industry is another one we often think of

00:10:15.551 --> 00:10:18.437
when we hear about slave labor.

00:10:18.437 --> 00:10:22.760
I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.405
in the silk trade.

00:10:25.405 --> 00:10:27.697
This is a family portrait.

00:10:27.697 --> 00:10:31.585
The dyed black hands are the father, while the blue

00:10:31.585 --> 00:10:34.374
and red hands are his sons.

00:10:34.374 --> 00:10:37.098
They mix dye in these big barrels,

00:10:37.098 --> 00:10:41.063
and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows,

00:10:41.063 --> 00:10:46.025
but the dye is toxic.

00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:49.330
My interpreter told me their stories.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.932
"We have no freedom," they said.

00:10:52.932 --> 00:10:56.036
"We hope still, though, that we could leave this house

00:10:56.036 --> 00:10:57.690
someday and go someplace else

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:04.354
where we actually get paid for our dyeing."

00:11:04.354 --> 00:11:09.293
It's estimated that more than 4,000 children

00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:11.450
are enslaved on Lake Volta,

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.536
the largest man-made lake in the world.

00:11:15.536 --> 00:11:18.510
When we first arrived, I went to have a quick look.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.878
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat,

00:11:21.878 --> 00:11:26.043
two older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense right?

00:11:26.043 --> 00:11:30.091
Wrong. They were all enslaved.

00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:32.920
Children are taken from their families

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.427
and trafficked and vanished,

00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:38.339
and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats

00:11:38.339 --> 00:11:42.886
on the lake, even though they do not know how to swim.

00:11:42.886 --> 00:11:45.221
This young child is eight years old.

00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:47.877
He was trembling when our boat approached,

00:11:47.877 --> 00:11:50.532
frightened it would run over his tiny canoe.

00:11:50.532 --> 00:11:53.871
He was petrified he would be knocked in the water.

00:11:53.871 --> 00:11:57.156
The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta

00:11:57.156 --> 00:12:01.121
often catch the fishing nets, and weary,

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.854
frightened children are thrown into the water

00:12:04.854 --> 00:12:07.005
to untether the lines.

00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:09.852
Many of them drown.

00:12:09.852 --> 00:12:13.192
For as long as he can recall, he's been forced to work

00:12:13.192 --> 00:12:15.365
on the lake.

00:12:15.365 --> 00:12:18.829
Terrified of his master, he will not run away,

00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:22.317
and since he's been treated with cruelty all his life,

00:12:22.317 --> 00:12:24.749
he passes that down to the younger slaves

00:12:24.749 --> 00:12:27.754
that he manages.

00:12:27.754 --> 00:12:29.858
I met these boys at five in the morning,

00:12:29.858 --> 00:12:32.319
when they were hauling in the last of their nets,

00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:35.180
but they had been working since 1 a.m.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.755
in the cold, windy night.

00:12:38.755 --> 00:12:42.021
And it's important to note that these nets weigh

00:12:42.021 --> 00:12:46.437
more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish.

00:12:46.437 --> 00:12:50.940
I want to introduce you to Kofi.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.186
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village.

00:12:54.186 --> 00:12:56.778
I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves

00:12:56.778 --> 00:13:00.707
rehabilitates victims of slavery.

00:13:00.707 --> 00:13:02.788
Here he's seen taking a bath at the well,

00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:05.691
pouring big buckets of water over his head,

00:13:05.691 --> 00:13:07.612
and the wonderful news is,

00:13:07.612 --> 00:13:09.610
as you and I are sitting here talking today,

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.845
Kofi has been reunited with his family,

00:13:12.845 --> 00:13:15.997
and what's even better, his family has been given tools

00:13:15.997 --> 00:13:21.724
to make a living and to keep their children safe.

00:13:21.724 --> 00:13:26.177
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility.

00:13:26.177 --> 00:13:30.748
Who will he become because someone took a stand

00:13:30.748 --> 00:13:34.340
and made a difference in his life?

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.568
Driving down a road in Ghana

00:13:36.568 --> 00:13:38.656
with partners of Free the Slaves,

00:13:38.656 --> 00:13:41.698
a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up

00:13:41.698 --> 00:13:44.645
to our cruiser and tapped on the window.

00:13:44.645 --> 00:13:49.425
He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle.

00:13:49.425 --> 00:13:52.214
At the end of the road, he urged us out of the car,

00:13:52.214 --> 00:13:54.893
and told the driver to quickly leave.

00:13:54.893 --> 00:13:58.238
Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath,

00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:02.135
and said, "This is the path, this is the path. Go."

00:14:02.135 --> 00:14:05.804
As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:09.604
blocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in,

00:14:09.604 --> 00:14:15.130
found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains,

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.946
so I hoisted the photo gear above my head

00:14:16.946 --> 00:14:21.532
as we descended into these waters up to my chest.

00:14:21.532 --> 00:14:25.317
After another two hours of hiking, the winding trail

00:14:25.317 --> 00:14:29.613
abruptly ended at a clearing, and before us

00:14:29.613 --> 00:14:31.629
was a mass of holes

00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:35.449
that could fit into the size of a football field,

00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:41.043
and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring.

00:14:41.043 --> 00:14:44.188
Many women had children strapped to their backs

00:14:44.188 --> 00:14:46.228
while they were panning for gold,

00:14:46.228 --> 00:14:50.531
wading in water poisoned by mercury.

00:14:50.531 --> 00:14:55.409
Mercury is used in the extraction process.

00:14:55.409 --> 00:14:58.565
These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:01.639
in another part of Ghana.

00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:04.460
When they came out of the shaft, they were soaking wet

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.738
from their own sweat.

00:15:06.738 --> 00:15:10.741
I remember looking into their tired, bloodshot eyes,

00:15:10.741 --> 00:15:16.482
for many of them had been underground for 72 hours.

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:20.457
The shafts are up to 300 feet deep, and they carry out

00:15:20.457 --> 00:15:24.026
heavy bags of stone that later will be transported

00:15:24.026 --> 00:15:26.627
to another area, where the stone will be pounded

00:15:26.627 --> 00:15:30.572
so that they can extract the gold.

00:15:30.572 --> 00:15:34.677
At first glance, the pounding site seems full

00:15:34.677 --> 00:15:39.570
of powerful men, but when we look closer,

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.437
we see some less fortunate working on the fringes,

00:15:44.437 --> 00:15:46.580
and children too.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:53.722
All of them are victim to injury, illness and violence.

00:15:53.722 --> 00:15:57.702
In fact, it's very likely that this muscular person

00:15:57.702 --> 00:16:02.237
will end up like this one here, racked with tuberculosis

00:16:02.237 --> 00:16:07.208
and mercury poisoning in just a few years.

00:16:07.208 --> 00:16:11.485
This is Manuru. When his father died,

00:16:11.485 --> 00:16:14.567
his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines.

00:16:14.567 --> 00:16:19.163
When his uncle died, Manuru inherited his uncle's debt,

00:16:19.163 --> 00:16:24.105
which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines.

00:16:24.105 --> 00:16:26.938
When I met him, he had been working in the mines

00:16:26.938 --> 00:16:31.731
for 14 years, and the leg injury that you see here

00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:33.744
is actually from a mining accident,

00:16:33.744 --> 00:16:38.861
one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated.

00:16:38.877 --> 00:16:42.827
On top of that, Manuru has tuberculosis,

00:16:42.827 --> 00:16:45.871
yet he's still forced to work day in and day out

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:48.115
in that mine shaft.

00:16:48.115 --> 00:16:53.278
Even still, he has a dream that he will become free

00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:56.391
and become educated with the help of local activists

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:58.819
like Free the Slaves,

00:16:58.819 --> 00:17:01.171
and it's this sort of determination,

00:17:01.171 --> 00:17:05.049
in the face of unimaginable odds,

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:12.409
that fills me with complete awe.

00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:15.709
I want to shine a light on slavery.

00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:17.964
When I was working in the field,

00:17:17.964 --> 00:17:20.645
I brought lots of candles with me,

00:17:20.645 --> 00:17:23.367
and with the help of my interpreter,

00:17:23.367 --> 00:17:25.683
I imparted to the people I was photographing

00:17:25.683 --> 00:17:28.794
that I wanted to illuminate their stories

00:17:28.794 --> 00:17:30.861
and their plight,

00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:34.366
so when it was safe for them, and safe for me,

00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:37.707
I made these images.

00:17:37.707 --> 00:17:39.940
They knew their image would be seen

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.769
by you out in the world.

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:45.513
I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness

00:17:45.513 --> 00:17:49.442
to them, and that we will do whatever we can

00:17:49.442 --> 00:17:54.132
to help make a difference in their lives.

00:17:54.132 --> 00:17:57.612
I truly believe, if we can see one another

00:17:57.612 --> 00:18:02.096
as fellow human beings, then it becomes very difficult

00:18:02.096 --> 00:18:07.300
to tolerate atrocities like slavery.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.984
These images are not of issues. They are of people,

00:18:10.984 --> 00:18:14.249
real people, like you and me, all deserving

00:18:14.249 --> 00:18:17.729
of the same rights, dignity and respect

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:19.958
in their lives.

00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:23.193
There is not a day that goes by that I don't think

00:18:23.193 --> 00:18:28.472
of these many beautiful, mistreated people

00:18:28.472 --> 00:18:33.041
I've had the tremendous honor of meeting.

00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:36.571
I hope that these images awaken a force

00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:39.617
in those who view them, people like you,

00:18:39.617 --> 00:18:43.893
and I hope that force will ignite a fire,

00:18:43.893 --> 00:18:48.816
and that fire will shine a light on slavery,

00:18:48.816 --> 00:18:52.825
for without that light, the beast of bondage

00:18:52.825 --> 00:18:56.009
can continue to live in the shadows.

00:18:56.009 --> 00:18:58.986
Thank you very much.

00:18:58.986 --> 00:19:12.239
(Applause)
