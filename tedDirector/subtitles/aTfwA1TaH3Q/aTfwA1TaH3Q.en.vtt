00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:14.686
Growing up in Kenya,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.261
I knew I always wanted
to study biochemistry.

00:00:18.908 --> 00:00:24.439
See, I had seen the impact of the high
prevalence of diseases like malaria,

00:00:24.463 --> 00:00:27.156
and I wanted to make medicines
that would cure the sick.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:28.970
So I worked really hard,

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:32.781
got a scholarship to the United States,
where I became a cancer researcher,

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:34.034
and I loved it.

00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:36.519
For someone who wants to cure diseases,

00:00:36.543 --> 00:00:38.254
there is no higher calling.

00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:42.493
Ten years later, I returned
to Kenya to do just that.

00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:44.982
A freshly minted PhD,

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:47.207
ready to take on this horrific illness,

00:00:47.231 --> 00:00:50.142
which in Kenya was almost
certainly a death sentence.

00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:54.372
But instead of landing a job
in a pharmaceutical company

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:56.285
or a hospital,

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.681
I found myself drawn
to a different kind of lab,

00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:01.562
working with a different
kind of patient --

00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:03.940
a patient whose illness was so serious

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:06.849
it impacted every single
person in my country;

00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:09.778
a patient who needed to get healthy fast.

00:01:10.148 --> 00:01:12.551
That patient was my government.

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:15.096
(Laughter)

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:19.524
See, many of us will agree that lots
of governments are unhealthy today.

00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:22.779
(Laughter)

00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:27.437
(Applause)

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:30.376
And Kenya was no exception.

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:33.298
When I returned to Kenya in 2014,

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:36.026
there was 17 percent youth unemployment.

00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:38.953
And Nairobi, the major business hub,

00:01:38.977 --> 00:01:43.052
was rated 177th on the quality
of living index.

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:44.280
It was bad.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.549
Now, an economy is only as healthy
as the entities that make it up.

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:52.157
So when government --

00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:53.926
one of its most vital entities --

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.388
is weak or unhealthy,

00:01:55.412 --> 00:01:57.395
everyone and everything suffers.

00:01:58.342 --> 00:02:01.115
Sometimes you might
put a Band-Aid in place

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:03.651
to try and temporarily stop the pain.

00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:06.534
Maybe some of you here have participated

00:02:06.558 --> 00:02:09.537
in a Band-Aid operation
to an African country --

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:14.043
setting up alternative schools,
building hospitals, digging wells --

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:17.004
because governments there
either weren't or couldn't provide

00:02:17.028 --> 00:02:18.997
the services to their citizens.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.529
We all know this is a temporary solution.

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:26.060
There are just some things
Band-Aids can't fix,

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:31.236
like providing an environment
where businesses feel secure

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.071
that they'll have an equal opportunity

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:36.337
to be able to run and start
their businesses successfully.

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:38.175
Or there are systems in place

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.240
that would protect the private
property that they create.

00:02:41.264 --> 00:02:42.421
I would argue,

00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:45.889
only government is capable of creating
these necessary conditions

00:02:45.913 --> 00:02:47.564
for economies to thrive.

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:53.207
Economies thrive when business are able
to quickly and easily set up shop.

00:02:53.231 --> 00:02:56.603
Business owners create new sources
of income for themselves,

00:02:56.627 --> 00:02:59.078
new jobs get added into the economy

00:02:59.102 --> 00:03:02.666
and then more taxes are paid
to fund public projects.

00:03:03.324 --> 00:03:05.787
New business is good for everyone.

00:03:06.235 --> 00:03:09.065
And it's such an important measure
of economic growth,

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:13.040
the World Bank has a ranking called
the "Ease of Doing Business Ranking,"

00:03:13.064 --> 00:03:16.101
which measures how easy
or difficult it is to start a business

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:17.722
in any given country.

00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:19.365
And as you can imagine,

00:03:20.224 --> 00:03:23.845
starting or running a business
in a country with an ailing government --

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.318
almost impossible.

00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:29.976
The President of Kenya knew this,
which is why in 2014,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.369
he came to our lab and asked
us to partner with him

00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:36.663
to be able to help Kenya
to jump-start business growth.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.231
He set an ambitious goal:

00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:44.520
he wanted Kenya to be ranked top 50
in this World Bank ranking.

00:03:44.987 --> 00:03:47.064
In 2014 when he came,

00:03:47.088 --> 00:03:51.414
Kenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries.

00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:54.047
We had our work cut out for us.

00:03:55.412 --> 00:03:58.113
Fortunately, he came to the right place.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.464
We're not just a Band-Aid kind of team.

00:04:00.488 --> 00:04:04.254
We're a group of computer scientists,
mathematicians, engineers

00:04:04.278 --> 00:04:06.215
and a cancer researcher,

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.685
who understood that in order
to cure the sickness

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.783
of a system as big as government,

00:04:10.807 --> 00:04:13.207
we needed to examine the whole body,

00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:16.318
and then we needed to drill down
all the way from the organs,

00:04:16.342 --> 00:04:17.675
into the tissues,

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.201
all the way to single cells,

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:21.562
so that we could properly
make a diagnosis.

00:04:22.582 --> 00:04:25.413
So with our marching orders
from the President himself,

00:04:25.437 --> 00:04:28.550
we embarked on the purest
of the scientific method:

00:04:28.574 --> 00:04:29.749
collecting data --

00:04:29.773 --> 00:04:31.860
all the data we could get our hands on --

00:04:31.884 --> 00:04:33.141
making hypotheses,

00:04:33.165 --> 00:04:34.402
creating solutions,

00:04:34.426 --> 00:04:35.618
one after the other.

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:40.700
So we met with hundreds of individuals
who worked at government agencies,

00:04:40.724 --> 00:04:44.660
from the tax agency, the lands
office, utilities company,

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:48.152
the agency that's responsible
for registering companies,

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:51.775
and with each of them, we observed
them as they served customers,

00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:56.412
we documented their processes --
most of them were manual.

00:04:57.293 --> 00:05:00.749
We also just went back and looked at
a lot of their previous paperwork

00:05:00.773 --> 00:05:02.941
to try and really understand;

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:06.315
to try and diagnose what bodily
malfunctions had occurred

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.647
that lead to that 136th spot
on the World Bank list.

00:05:10.068 --> 00:05:11.371
What did we find?

00:05:11.794 --> 00:05:15.865
Well, in Kenya it was taking 72 days

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.833
for a business owner
to register their property,

00:05:18.857 --> 00:05:21.254
compared to just one day in New Zealand,

00:05:21.278 --> 00:05:23.656
which was ranked second
on the World Bank list.

00:05:24.647 --> 00:05:29.032
It took 158 days to get
a new electric connection.

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.131
In Korea it took 18 days.

00:05:32.804 --> 00:05:34.857
If you wanted to get a construction permit

00:05:34.881 --> 00:05:36.401
so you could put up a building,

00:05:36.425 --> 00:05:39.996
in Kenya, it was going
to take you 125 days.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.466
In Singapore, which is ranked first,
that would only take you 26 days.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.444
God forbid you had to go to court

00:05:47.468 --> 00:05:51.355
to get help in being able to settle
a dispute to enforce a contract,

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.660
because that process alone
would take you 465 days.

00:05:56.885 --> 00:05:58.817
And if that wasn't bad enough,

00:06:00.495 --> 00:06:04.647
you would lose 40 percent
of your claim in just fees --

00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:07.543
legal fees, enforcement fees, court fees.

00:06:08.928 --> 00:06:11.001
Now, I know what you're thinking:

00:06:12.546 --> 00:06:16.213
for there to exist such inefficiencies
in an African country,

00:06:16.237 --> 00:06:17.597
there must be corruption.

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:21.787
The very cells that run the show
must be corrupt to the bone.

00:06:22.792 --> 00:06:24.324
I thought so, too, actually.

00:06:24.804 --> 00:06:25.957
When we started out,

00:06:25.981 --> 00:06:29.469
I thought I was going to find
so much corruption,

00:06:29.493 --> 00:06:32.989
I was literally going to either die
or get killed in the process.

00:06:33.013 --> 00:06:34.556
(Laughter)

00:06:36.766 --> 00:06:38.721
But when we dug deeper,

00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:41.380
we didn't find corruption
in the classic sense:

00:06:41.926 --> 00:06:44.934
slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness,

00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.275
waiting to grease the palms
of their friends.

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:51.945
What we found was an overwhelming
sense of helplessness.

00:06:53.504 --> 00:06:54.766
Our government was sick,

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.314
because government
employees felt helpless.

00:06:58.813 --> 00:07:01.896
They felt that they were not
empowered to drive change.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.056
And when people feel stuck and helpless,

00:07:06.788 --> 00:07:09.283
they stop seeing their role
in a bigger system.

00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:14.554
They start to think the work they do
doesn't matter in driving change.

00:07:14.578 --> 00:07:16.384
And when that happens,

00:07:16.408 --> 00:07:18.001
things slow down,

00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:19.445
fall through the cracks

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:21.235
and inefficiencies flourish.

00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:24.756
Now imagine with me,

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.718
if you had a process
you had to go through --

00:07:28.742 --> 00:07:30.512
had no other alternative --

00:07:30.536 --> 00:07:33.583
and this process was inefficient, complex

00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:35.671
and very, very slow.

00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:36.919
What would you do?

00:07:38.302 --> 00:07:41.630
I think you might start by trying
to find somebody to outsource it to,

00:07:41.654 --> 00:07:43.999
so that they can just
take care of that for you.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.024
If that doesn't work,

00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:49.137
maybe you'd consider paying somebody

00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:52.541
to just "unofficially" take care
of it on your behalf --

00:07:52.565 --> 00:07:55.323
especially if you thought
nobody was going to catch you.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.980
Not out of malice or greed,

00:07:59.004 --> 00:08:02.095
just trying to make sure that you get
something to work for you

00:08:02.119 --> 00:08:03.277
so you can move on.

00:08:03.738 --> 00:08:06.748
Unfortunately, that
is the beginning of corruption.

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:09.582
And if left to thrive and grow,

00:08:09.606 --> 00:08:11.172
it seeps into the whole system,

00:08:11.196 --> 00:08:12.566
and before you know it,

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.155
the whole body is sick.

00:08:16.416 --> 00:08:17.709
Knowing this,

00:08:17.733 --> 00:08:19.288
we had to start by making sure

00:08:19.312 --> 00:08:23.889
that every single stakeholder
we worked with had a shared vision

00:08:23.913 --> 00:08:25.342
for what we wanted to do.

00:08:26.012 --> 00:08:28.046
So we met with everyone,

00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:31.035
from the clerk whose sole job
is to remove staples

00:08:31.059 --> 00:08:32.608
from application packets,

00:08:33.266 --> 00:08:36.251
to the legal drafters
at the attorney general's office,

00:08:37.007 --> 00:08:40.004
to the clerks who are responsible
for serving business owners

00:08:40.028 --> 00:08:42.460
when they came to access
government services.

00:08:43.377 --> 00:08:44.527
And with them,

00:08:44.551 --> 00:08:46.123
we made sure that they understood

00:08:46.147 --> 00:08:50.894
how their day-to-day actions
were impacting our ability as a country

00:08:50.918 --> 00:08:53.993
to create new jobs
and to attract investments.

00:08:54.425 --> 00:08:57.985
No one's role was too small;
everyone's role was vital.

00:08:59.907 --> 00:09:01.782
Now, guess what we started to see?

00:09:02.814 --> 00:09:04.827
A coalition of government employees

00:09:04.851 --> 00:09:06.963
who are excited and ready to drive change,

00:09:06.987 --> 00:09:09.052
began to grow and form.

00:09:09.747 --> 00:09:12.351
And together we started
to implement changes

00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:15.607
that impacted the service
delivery of our country.

00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:17.829
The result?

00:09:17.853 --> 00:09:19.894
In just two years,

00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:23.878
Kenya's ranking moved from 136 to 92.

00:09:24.844 --> 00:09:30.804
(Applause)

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.729
And in recognition of the significant
reforms we've been able to implement

00:09:36.753 --> 00:09:38.532
in such a short time,

00:09:38.556 --> 00:09:40.437
Kenya was recognized

00:09:40.461 --> 00:09:44.047
to be among the top three
global reformers in the world

00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:45.487
two years in a row.

00:09:46.518 --> 00:09:51.898
(Applause)

00:09:52.984 --> 00:09:54.550
Are we fully healthy?

00:09:55.376 --> 00:09:56.542
No.

00:09:56.969 --> 00:09:59.401
We have some serious work still to do.

00:10:00.156 --> 00:10:03.633
I like to think about these two years
like a weight-loss program.

00:10:03.995 --> 00:10:05.571
(Laughter)

00:10:06.341 --> 00:10:10.303
It's that time after months
of hard, grueling work at the gym,

00:10:10.327 --> 00:10:12.757
and then you get your first
time to weigh yourself,

00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:14.445
and you've lost 20 pounds.

00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:16.609
You're feeling unstoppable.

00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:22.854
Now, some of you may think
this doesn't apply to you.

00:10:22.878 --> 00:10:24.228
You're not from Kenya.

00:10:24.252 --> 00:10:26.394
You don't intend to be an entrepreneur.

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:28.380
But think with me for just a moment.

00:10:29.134 --> 00:10:32.586
When is the last time
you accessed a government service?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.576
Maybe applied for your driver's license,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.168
tried to do your taxes on your own.

00:10:42.464 --> 00:10:45.234
It's easy in this political
and global economy

00:10:45.258 --> 00:10:48.308
to want to give up when we think
about transforming government.

00:10:49.206 --> 00:10:52.707
We can easily resign to the fact
or to the thinking

00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:55.073
that government is too inefficient,

00:10:55.097 --> 00:10:56.253
too corrupt,

00:10:56.277 --> 00:10:57.508
unfixable.

00:10:58.347 --> 00:11:01.784
We might even rarely get
some key government responsibilities

00:11:01.808 --> 00:11:03.008
to other sectors,

00:11:03.032 --> 00:11:04.201
to Band-Aid solutions,

00:11:04.225 --> 00:11:06.793
or to just give up and feel helpless.

00:11:07.849 --> 00:11:11.732
But just because a system is sick
doesn't mean it's dying.

00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:15.316
We cannot afford to give up

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.373
when it comes to the challenges
of fixing our governments.

00:11:19.809 --> 00:11:20.965
In the end,

00:11:22.502 --> 00:11:26.677
what really makes a government healthy
is when healthy cells --

00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:28.692
that's you and I --

00:11:29.654 --> 00:11:31.301
get to the ground,

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:32.609
roll up our sleeves,

00:11:32.633 --> 00:11:34.738
refuse to be helpless

00:11:34.762 --> 00:11:36.558
and believe that sometimes,

00:11:36.582 --> 00:11:39.812
all it takes is for us
to create some space

00:11:39.836 --> 00:11:42.051
for healthy cells to grow and thrive.

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:43.758
Thank you.

00:11:43.782 --> 00:11:50.021
(Applause)
