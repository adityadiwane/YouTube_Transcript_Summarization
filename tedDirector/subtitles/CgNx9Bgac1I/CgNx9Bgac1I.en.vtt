00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
Why do so many people reach success and then fail?

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.330
One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
So we do everything that leads up to success,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
but then we get there. We figure we've made it,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
we sit back in our comfort zone,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
And it doesn't take long to go downhill.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
And I can tell you this happens,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
because it happened to me.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
But then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
I can just sit back and relax."

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.330
Reaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
But then I stopped because I figured, "Hey, I'm good enough.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
I don't need to improve any more."

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.330
Reaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
And the only thing that came was creative block.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
I couldn't come up with any ideas.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
Reaching success, I always focused on clients and projects,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
and ignored the money. Then all this money started pouring in.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
And I got distracted by it.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
when I should have been talking to my clients.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
And reaching success, I always did what I loved.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
But then I got into stuff that I didn't love,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
like management. I am the world's worst manager,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
but I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
the president of the company.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
and here I was, outwardly very successful,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
but inwardly very depressed.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.330
But I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
I bought a fast car.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
(Laughter)

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
It didn't help.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
I was faster but just as depressed.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
So I went to my doctor. I said, "Doc,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.330
I can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
It's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
But money can't buy happiness."

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
He said, "No. But it can buy Prozac."

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
And he put me on anti-depressants.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.330
And yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.330
because I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
(Laughter)

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
And clients didn't call.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.330
(Laughter)

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
Because they could see I was no longer serving them,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
I was only serving myself.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.330
Well, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.330
My partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
And that was great.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.330
Because with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
So I went back to doing the projects I loved.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
I had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
did all the things that took me back up to success.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
But it wasn't a quick trip.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
It took seven years.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
But in the end, business grew bigger than ever.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
And when I went back to following these eight principles,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
And I woke up one day and I said,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
"I don't need Prozac anymore."

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
And I threw it away and haven't needed it since.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
I learned that success isn't a one-way street.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
It's a continuous journey.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
And if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome,"

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
we just keep following these eight principles,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
because that is not only how we achieve success,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
it's how we sustain it.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
So here is to your continued success.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
Thank you very much.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
(Applause)
