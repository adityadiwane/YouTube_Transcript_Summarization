00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm a garbage man.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
because I absolutely hate waste.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I hope, within the next 10 minutes,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
to change the way you think

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
about a lot of the stuff in your life.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
And I'd like to start at the very beginning.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
Think back when you were just a kid.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
How did look at the stuff in your life?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules:

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
It's my stuff if I saw it first.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.260
The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
The more stuff that's mine, the better.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
(Laughter)

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
it's become pretty clear to me

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
as we develop into adults.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And let me tell you why I have that perspective.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Because each and every day

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
at our recycling plants around the world

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
we handle about one million pounds

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
of people's discarded stuff.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
that are disposed each and every year around the world --

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
well less than one percent.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
In fact, the United Nations estimates

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
that there's about 85 billion pounds a year

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
of electronics waste

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
that gets discarded around the world each and every year --

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
that number well more than doubles.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
And of course, the more developed the country,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
the bigger these mountains.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Now when you see these mountains,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
most people think of garbage.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
We see above-ground mines.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
that went into making all of this stuff in the first place.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And it's becoming increasingly important

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
that we figure out how to extract these raw materials

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
from these extremely complicated waste streams.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Because as we've heard all week at TED,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
who want more and more stuff.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And of course, they want the toys and the tools

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
that many of us take for granted.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And what goes into making those toys and tools

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
that we use every single day?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And the metals, we typically get

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
from ore that we mine

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
in ever widening mines

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
and ever deepening mines around the world.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And the plastics, we get from oil,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
which we go to more remote locations

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and drill ever deeper wells to extract.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And these practices have

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
significant economic and environmental implications

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
that we're already starting to see today.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
that have recycling policies in place

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
that require that this stuff be recycled

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
in a responsible manner.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
if it makes it to a recycler, are the metals.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
To put that in perspective --

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
because it's the most common metal --

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
if your stuff makes it to a recycler,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
probably over 90 percent of the metals

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Plastics are a whole other story:

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
well less than 10 percent are recovered.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
In fact, it's more like five percent.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Most of it's incinerated or landfilled.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
have very little value.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
But actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
And there's more plastics produced and consumed

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
around the world on a volume basis

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
every year than steel.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
not recovered at anywhere near the rate

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
of the less valuable material?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
Well it's predominantly because

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
metals are very easy to recycle

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
from other materials and from one another.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
They have very different densities.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
They have different electrical and magnetic properties.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And they even have different colors.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
So it's very easy for either humans or machines

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
to separate these metals

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
from one another and from other materials.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
They have either identical or very similar

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
electrical and magnetic properties.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And any plastic can be any color,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
as you probably well know.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
So the traditional ways of separating materials

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
just simply don't work for plastics.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world --

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
and sadly to say, particularly from the United States,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe --

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
finds its way to developing countries

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
for low-cost recycling.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
People, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
They extract what they can, which is mostly the metals --

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
circuit boards and so forth --

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
which is, again, mostly the plastics.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
in burn houses like you see here.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
And they extract the metals by hand.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
this is certainly not the low-environmental

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
or human health-and-safety solution.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
I call this environmental arbitrage.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And it's not fair, it's not safe

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and it's not sustainable.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Now because the plastics are so plentiful --

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
and by the way,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously --

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
but people do try to recover the plastics.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
This is just one example.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
They store the plastics on the roofs.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
and people try very hard to separate the plastics,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
by color, by shape, by feel,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
by any technique they can.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" technique

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
to try to determine the type of plastic.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
in any significant way.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
And by the way,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
please don't try this technique at home.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
So what are we to do about this space-age material,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
to keep putting back in the ground

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
or certainly send up in smoke.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
So about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
trying to figure out how to separate

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
these very similar materials from each other,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
in the mining world actually, and in the plastics world,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Because after all, we're doing above-ground mining.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And we eventually broke the code.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
This is the last frontier of recycling.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
It's the last major material

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And we finally figured out how to do it.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
And in the process, we started recreating

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
how the plastics industry makes plastics.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
The traditional way to make plastics

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
is with oil or petrochemicals.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
You breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
We said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Well a good place to start is with waste.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and it's plentiful,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
And because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
and recombining them,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
we're using a mining approach to extract the materials.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
We have significantly lower capital costs

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
in our plant equipment.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
We have enormous energy savings.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
compared to making something the traditional way.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
to build a chemical plant

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And we make a drop-in replacement

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Our customers get to enjoy

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
huge CO2 savings.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
They get to close the loop with their products.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
And they get to make more sustainable products.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
In the short time period I have,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
They recover the metals

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
and leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste --

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
a very complex mixture of materials,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
but predominantly plastics.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
We take out the things that aren't plastics,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
wood, glass, paper, you name it.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Even an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
We're sieving the material, we're using magnets,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
we're using air classification.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
At the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite:

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
many different types of plastics

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and many different grades of plastics.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.260
and the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
We use a very highly automated process

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
to sort those plastics,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
not only by type, but by grade.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
And out the end of that part of the process

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
come little flakes of plastic:

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
one type, one grade.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
We push that material to extruders where we melt it,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
push it through small die holes,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
make spaghetti-like plastic strands.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And we chop those strands

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
into what are called pellets.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.260
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
This is the same material

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
that you would get from oil.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
And today,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
we're producing it from your old stuff,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and it's going right back into your new stuff.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:45.260
(Applause)

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So now, instead of your stuff ending up

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
on a hillside in a developing country

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
or literally going up in smoke,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
you can find your old stuff

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
back on top of your desk in new products,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
in your office,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
or back at work in your home.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
And these are just a few examples

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
of companies that are buying our plastic,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
replacing virgin plastic,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
to make their new products.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
So I hope I've changed the way you look at

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
at least some of the stuff in your life.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
We took our clues from mother nature.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
Mother nature wastes very little,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
reuses practically everything.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer --

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
that's a label I've always hated my entire life --

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and think of yourself as just using resources in one form,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
until they can be transformed to another form

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
for another use later in time.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
And finally, I hope you agree with me

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
to change that last toddler rule just a little bit

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
to: "If it's broken, it's my stuff."

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
Thank you for your time.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:52.260
(Applause)
