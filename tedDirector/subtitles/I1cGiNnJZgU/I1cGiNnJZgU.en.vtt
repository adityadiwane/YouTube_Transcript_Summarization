00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:15.900
So have you ever wondered
what it would be like

00:00:15.924 --> 00:00:18.498
to live in a place with no rules?

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:20.804
That sounds pretty cool.

00:00:20.828 --> 00:00:21.866
(Laughter)

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.527
You wake up one morning, however,

00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:26.031
and you discover that the reason
there are no rules

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:29.416
is because there's no government,
and there are no laws.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.507
In fact, all social institutions
have disappeared.

00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:36.071
So there's no schools,

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:37.261
there's no hospitals,

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:38.593
there's no police,

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:39.952
there's no banks,

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:42.530
there's no athletic clubs,

00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:44.057
there's no utilities.

00:00:44.704 --> 00:00:47.896
Well, I know a little bit
about what this is like,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.769
because when I was
a medical student in 1999,

00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:55.278
I worked in a refugee camp
in the Balkans during the Kosovo War.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:57.979
When the war was over,

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.061
I got permission -- unbelievably --
from my medical school

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:02.236
to take some time off

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.431
and follow some of the families
that I had befriended in the camp

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:08.878
back to their village in Kosovo,

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:14.269
and understand how they navigated
life in this postwar setting.

00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:19.551
Postwar Kosovo
was a very interesting place

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:22.744
because NATO troops were there,

00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:26.404
mostly to make sure
the war didn't break out again.

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:29.921
But other than that,
it was actually a lawless place,

00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:33.210
and almost every social institution,
both public and private,

00:01:33.234 --> 00:01:34.509
had been destroyed.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.328
So I can tell you

00:01:39.352 --> 00:01:43.867
that when you go into one
of these situations and settings,

00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:47.698
it is absolutely thrilling ...

00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:49.074
for about 30 minutes,

00:01:49.098 --> 00:01:53.770
because that's about how long it takes
before you run into a situation

00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:58.337
where you realize
how incredibly vulnerable you are.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.307
For me, that moment came
when I had to cross the first checkpoint,

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:05.124
and I realized as I drove up

00:02:05.148 --> 00:02:09.246
that I would be negotiating passage
through this checkpoint

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.484
with a heavily armed individual

00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:14.894
who, if he decided to shoot me
right then and there,

00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:17.248
actually wouldn't be doing
anything illegal.

00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:23.674
But the sense of vulnerability that I had
was absolutely nothing

00:02:23.698 --> 00:02:27.596
in comparison to the vulnerability
of the families that I got to know

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.280
over that year.

00:02:29.304 --> 00:02:34.417
You see, life in a society
where there are no social institutions

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:37.885
is riddled with danger and uncertainty,

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.283
and simple questions like,
"What are we going to eat tonight?"

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.926
are very complicated to answer.

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.909
Questions about security,
when you don't have any security systems,

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:52.351
are terrifying.

00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:55.138
Is that altercation I had
with the neighbor down the block

00:02:55.162 --> 00:02:57.976
going to turn into a violent episode
that will end my life

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.237
or my family's life?

00:02:59.843 --> 00:03:02.769
Health concerns
when there is no health system

00:03:02.793 --> 00:03:04.333
are also terrifying.

00:03:05.114 --> 00:03:08.732
I listened as many families
had to sort through questions like,

00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:11.629
"My infant has a fever.
What am I going to do?"

00:03:12.243 --> 00:03:15.923
"My sister, who is pregnant,
is bleeding. What should I do?

00:03:15.947 --> 00:03:17.121
Who should I turn to?"

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:19.275
"Where are the doctors,
where are the nurses?

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.060
If I could find one, are they trustworthy?

00:03:22.084 --> 00:03:24.817
How will I pay them?
In what currency will I pay them?"

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:27.635
"If I need medications,
where will I find them?

00:03:28.664 --> 00:03:31.559
If I take those medications,
are they actually counterfeits?"

00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:33.082
And on and on.

00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:37.137
So for life in these settings,

00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:41.641
the dominant theme,
the dominant feature of life,

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:45.608
is the incredible vulnerability
that people have to manage

00:03:45.632 --> 00:03:47.181
day in and day out,

00:03:47.205 --> 00:03:50.039
because of the lack of social systems.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.299
And it actually turns out

00:03:51.323 --> 00:03:55.350
that this feature of life
is incredibly difficult to explain

00:03:55.374 --> 00:03:58.349
and be understood by people
who are living outside of it.

00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:03.677
I discovered this when I left Kosovo.

00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:06.906
I came back to Boston,
I became a physician,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.941
I became a global public
health policy researcher.

00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:12.755
I joined the Harvard Medical School

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:15.621
and Brigham and Women's Hospital
Division of Global Health.

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:16.879
And I, as a researcher,

00:04:16.903 --> 00:04:19.557
really wanted to get started
on this problem right away.

00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:23.149
I was like, "How do we reduce
the crushing vulnerability

00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:26.944
of people living in these types
of fragile settings?

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:29.437
Is there any way
we can start to think about

00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:32.166
how to protect and quickly recover

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.999
the institutions
that are critical to survival,

00:04:35.023 --> 00:04:36.536
like the health system?"

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.881
And I have to say,
I had amazing colleagues.

00:04:40.402 --> 00:04:42.288
But one interesting thing about it was,

00:04:42.312 --> 00:04:44.796
this was sort of an unusual
question for them.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.129
They were kind of like,
"Oh, if you work in war,

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:49.402
doesn't that mean
you work on refugee camps,

00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:51.858
and you work on documenting
mass atrocities?" --

00:04:51.882 --> 00:04:54.482
which is, by the way, very,
very, very important.

00:04:55.297 --> 00:05:00.451
So it took me a while to explain
why I was so passionate about this issue,

00:05:00.475 --> 00:05:02.166
until about six years ago.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.255
That's when this landmark study

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:08.388
that looked at and described
the public health consequences of war

00:05:08.412 --> 00:05:09.754
was published.

00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:14.715
They came to an incredible,
provocative conclusion.

00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:18.320
These researchers concluded

00:05:18.344 --> 00:05:21.818
that the vast majority of death
and disability from war

00:05:21.842 --> 00:05:24.475
happens after the cessation of conflict.

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:29.537
So the most dangerous time to be a person
living in a conflict-affected state

00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:31.604
is after the cessation of hostilities;

00:05:31.628 --> 00:05:33.629
it's after the peace deal has been signed.

00:05:33.653 --> 00:05:36.214
It's when that political solution
has been achieved.

00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:39.772
That seems so puzzling,
but of course it's not,

00:05:39.796 --> 00:05:45.601
because war kills people
by robbing them of their clinics,

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:46.802
of their hospitals,

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:48.690
of their supply chains.

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:52.305
Their doctors are targeted, are killed;
they're on the run.

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:56.248
And more invisible
and yet more deadly is the destruction

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:59.808
of the health governance institutions
and their finances.

00:06:00.938 --> 00:06:04.177
So this is really not
surprising at all to me.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.160
But what is surprising
and somewhat dismaying,

00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:12.158
is how little impact this insight has had,

00:06:12.182 --> 00:06:15.766
in terms of how we think
about human suffering and war.

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:18.206
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:06:18.926 --> 00:06:20.837
Last year, you may remember,

00:06:20.861 --> 00:06:24.986
Ebola hit the West African
country of Liberia.

00:06:25.981 --> 00:06:29.849
There was a lot of reporting
about this group, Doctors Without Borders,

00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:32.771
sounding the alarm
and calling for aid and assistance.

00:06:33.322 --> 00:06:37.184
But not a lot of that reporting
answered the question:

00:06:37.208 --> 00:06:39.760
Why is Doctors Without Borders
even in Liberia?

00:06:39.784 --> 00:06:42.460
Doctors Without Borders
is an amazing organization,

00:06:42.484 --> 00:06:46.899
dedicated and designed to provide
emergency care in war zones.

00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:50.278
Liberia's civil war had ended in 2003 --

00:06:50.302 --> 00:06:53.139
that was 11 years
before Ebola even struck.

00:06:54.452 --> 00:06:56.172
When Ebola struck Liberia,

00:06:56.196 --> 00:06:59.823
there were less than 50 doctors
in the entire country

00:06:59.847 --> 00:07:01.709
of 4.5 million people.

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:04.713
Doctors Without Borders is in Liberia

00:07:04.737 --> 00:07:08.118
because Liberia still doesn't really have
a functioning health system,

00:07:08.142 --> 00:07:09.809
11 years later.

00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:13.145
When the earthquake hit Haiti in 2010,

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:16.702
the outpouring of international
aid was phenomenal.

00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:20.397
But did you know that only
two percent of that funding

00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:23.263
went to rebuild
Haitian public institutions,

00:07:23.287 --> 00:07:25.047
including its health sector?

00:07:25.697 --> 00:07:27.114
From that perspective,

00:07:27.138 --> 00:07:30.514
Haitians continue to die
from the earthquake even today.

00:07:31.663 --> 00:07:33.740
I recently met this gentleman.

00:07:33.764 --> 00:07:35.842
This is Dr. Nezar Ismet.

00:07:35.866 --> 00:07:39.702
He's the Minister of Health
in the northern autonomous region of Iraq,

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:41.157
in Kurdistan.

00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:45.063
Here he is announcing
that in the last nine months,

00:07:45.087 --> 00:07:49.129
his country, his region, has increased
from four million people

00:07:49.153 --> 00:07:50.685
to five million people.

00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:52.577
That's a 25 percent increase.

00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:56.467
Thousands of these new arrivals
have experienced incredible trauma.

00:07:56.979 --> 00:08:01.174
His doctors are working
16-hour days without pay.

00:08:02.867 --> 00:08:05.690
His budget has not increased
by 25 percent;

00:08:05.714 --> 00:08:08.109
it has decreased by 20 percent,

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:12.774
as funding has flowed to security concerns
and to short-term relief efforts.

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:15.173
When his health sector fails --

00:08:15.197 --> 00:08:17.610
and if history is any guide, it will --

00:08:17.634 --> 00:08:19.680
how do you think that's going to influence

00:08:19.704 --> 00:08:22.936
the decision making
of the five million people in his region

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.779
as they think about
whether they should flee

00:08:25.803 --> 00:08:28.294
that type of vulnerable living situation?

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.484
So as you can see,
this is a frustrating topic for me,

00:08:32.508 --> 00:08:34.010
and I really try to understand:

00:08:34.034 --> 00:08:37.558
Why the reluctance to protect and support

00:08:37.582 --> 00:08:41.218
indigenous health systems
and security systems?

00:08:41.242 --> 00:08:43.861
I usually tier two concerns,
two arguments.

00:08:44.747 --> 00:08:46.934
The first concern is about corruption,

00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.677
and the concern that people
in these settings are corrupt

00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:51.446
and they are untrustworthy.

00:08:52.076 --> 00:08:55.137
And I will admit that I have met
unsavory characters

00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:57.517
working in health sectors
in these situations.

00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:01.241
But I will tell you that the opposite
is absolutely true

00:09:01.265 --> 00:09:03.295
in every case I have worked on,

00:09:03.319 --> 00:09:07.132
from Afghanistan to Libya, to Kosovo,
to Haiti, to Liberia --

00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:09.255
I have met inspiring people,

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:11.774
who, when the chips were down
for their country,

00:09:11.798 --> 00:09:15.107
they risked everything
to save their health institutions.

00:09:15.131 --> 00:09:18.479
The trick for the outsider
who wants to help

00:09:18.503 --> 00:09:21.407
is identifying who those individuals are,

00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:23.739
and building a pathway for them to lead.

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:26.947
That is exactly what happened
in Afghanistan.

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:30.863
One of the unsung and untold
success stories

00:09:30.887 --> 00:09:33.805
of our nation-building effort
in Afghanistan

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:37.325
involved the World Bank in 2002
investing heavily

00:09:37.349 --> 00:09:42.484
in identifying, training and promoting
Afghani health sector leaders.

00:09:43.869 --> 00:09:47.722
These health sector leaders
have pulled off an incredible feat

00:09:47.746 --> 00:09:49.118
in Afghanistan.

00:09:49.142 --> 00:09:53.089
They have aggressively increased
access to health care

00:09:53.113 --> 00:09:55.129
for the majority of the population.

00:09:55.153 --> 00:09:57.357
They are rapidly improving
the health status

00:09:57.381 --> 00:09:58.652
of the Afghan population,

00:09:58.676 --> 00:10:00.662
which used to be the worst in the world.

00:10:01.765 --> 00:10:04.587
In fact, the Afghan Ministry
of Health does things

00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:06.307
that I wish we would do in America.

00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:08.703
They use things like data to make policy.

00:10:08.727 --> 00:10:09.912
It's incredible.

00:10:09.936 --> 00:10:12.328
(Laughter)

00:10:12.352 --> 00:10:14.281
The other concern I hear a lot about is:

00:10:14.305 --> 00:10:16.907
"We just can't afford it,
we just don't have the money.

00:10:16.931 --> 00:10:18.286
It's just unsustainable."

00:10:19.239 --> 00:10:21.972
I would submit to you
that the current situation

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.731
and the current system we have

00:10:23.755 --> 00:10:27.793
is the most expensive, inefficient system
we could possibly conceive of.

00:10:27.817 --> 00:10:31.195
The current situation
is that when governments like the US --

00:10:31.219 --> 00:10:33.283
or, let's say, the collection
of governments

00:10:33.307 --> 00:10:35.181
that make up the European Commission --

00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:37.854
every year, they spend 15 billion dollars

00:10:37.878 --> 00:10:41.884
on just humanitarian and emergency
and disaster relief worldwide.

00:10:41.908 --> 00:10:45.229
That's nothing about foreign aid,
that's just disaster relief.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:50.940
Ninety-five percent of it
goes to international relief agencies,

00:10:50.964 --> 00:10:55.301
that then have to import resources
into these areas,

00:10:55.325 --> 00:10:59.714
and knit together some type
of temporary health system, let's say,

00:10:59.738 --> 00:11:03.307
which they then dismantle and send away
when they run out of money.

00:11:04.001 --> 00:11:07.931
So our job, it turns out, is very clear.

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:13.776
We, as the global health
community policy experts,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.345
our first job is to become experts
in how to monitor

00:11:19.369 --> 00:11:21.816
the strengths and vulnerabilities
of health systems

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.407
in threatened situations.

00:11:24.431 --> 00:11:26.441
And that's when we see doctors fleeing,

00:11:26.465 --> 00:11:28.402
when we see health resources drying up,

00:11:28.426 --> 00:11:30.861
when we see institutions crumbling --

00:11:30.885 --> 00:11:32.498
that's the emergency.

00:11:32.522 --> 00:11:35.632
That's when we need to sound the alarm
and wave our arms.

00:11:35.656 --> 00:11:37.050
OK?

00:11:37.074 --> 00:11:38.225
Not now.

00:11:38.249 --> 00:11:42.161
Everyone can see that's an emergency,
they don't need us to tell them that.

00:11:42.942 --> 00:11:44.881
Number two:

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:48.242
places like where I work at Harvard
need to take their cue

00:11:48.266 --> 00:11:50.464
from the World Bank experience
in Afghanistan,

00:11:50.488 --> 00:11:52.145
and we need to -- and we will --

00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:57.432
build robust platforms to support
health sector leaders like these.

00:11:58.291 --> 00:11:59.993
These people risk their lives.

00:12:00.017 --> 00:12:03.729
I think we can match their courage
with some support.

00:12:04.245 --> 00:12:05.399
Number three:

00:12:05.423 --> 00:12:08.001
we need to reach out
and make new partnerships.

00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:09.899
At our global health center,

00:12:09.923 --> 00:12:13.935
we have launched a new initiative
with NATO and other security policy makers

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:19.325
to explore with them what they can do
to protect health system institutions

00:12:19.349 --> 00:12:21.064
during deployments.

00:12:21.088 --> 00:12:22.628
We want them to see

00:12:22.652 --> 00:12:27.352
that protecting health systems
and other critical social institutions

00:12:27.376 --> 00:12:29.819
is an integral part of their mission.

00:12:29.843 --> 00:12:32.980
It's not just about avoiding
collateral damage;

00:12:33.004 --> 00:12:34.809
it's about winning the peace.

00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:40.128
But the most important partner
we need to engage is you,

00:12:40.152 --> 00:12:43.584
the American public,
and indeed, the world public.

00:12:43.608 --> 00:12:49.304
Because unless you understand
the value of social institutions,

00:12:49.328 --> 00:12:51.839
like health systems
in these fragile settings,

00:12:52.886 --> 00:12:55.134
you won't support efforts to save them.

00:12:55.158 --> 00:12:57.556
You won't click on that article

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:02.546
that talks about "Hey, all those
doctors are on the run in country X.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.987
I wonder what that means.

00:13:05.011 --> 00:13:06.863
I wonder what that means

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:10.839
for that health system's ability
to, let's say, detect influenza."

00:13:11.673 --> 00:13:15.050
"Hmm, it's probably not good."
That's what I'd tell you.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.754
Up on the screen,

00:13:16.778 --> 00:13:23.058
I've put up my three favorite American
institution defenders and builders.

00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:26.551
Over here is George C. Marshall,

00:13:26.575 --> 00:13:29.404
he was the guy that proposed
the Marshall Plan

00:13:29.428 --> 00:13:33.619
to save all of Europe's economic
institutions after World War II.

00:13:34.119 --> 00:13:36.472
And this Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:13:36.496 --> 00:13:39.642
Her work on human rights
really serves as the foundation

00:13:39.666 --> 00:13:42.694
for all of our international
human rights organizations.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.190
Then my big favorite is Ben Franklin,

00:13:45.214 --> 00:13:48.422
who did many things
in terms of creating institutions,

00:13:48.446 --> 00:13:51.213
but was the midwife of our constitution.

00:13:52.402 --> 00:13:54.126
And I would say to you

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.903
that these are folks who, when our
country was threatened,

00:13:57.927 --> 00:13:59.934
or our world was threatened,

00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.261
they didn't retreat.

00:14:01.285 --> 00:14:03.626
They didn't talk about building walls.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:09.031
They talked about building institutions
to protect human security,

00:14:09.828 --> 00:14:12.442
for their generation and also for ours.

00:14:13.014 --> 00:14:15.812
And I think our generation
should do the same.

00:14:16.503 --> 00:14:17.663
Thank you.

00:14:17.687 --> 00:14:19.916
(Applause)
