Brain magic. What's brain magic all about?

00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:16.351
Brain magic to me indicates
that area of magic

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:18.852
dealing with psychological
and mind-reading effects.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:22.523
So unlike traditional magic,
it uses the power of words,

00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:25.143
linguistic deception,
non-verbal communication

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:29.167
and various other techniques
to create the illusion of a sixth sense.

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:32.112
I'm going to show you all how easy it is

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:34.462
to manipulate the human mind
once you know how.

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:37.591
I want everybody downstairs also
to join in with me and everybody.

00:00:37.615 --> 00:00:40.908
I want everybody to put out your hands
like this for me, first of all.

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:42.534
OK, clap them together, once.

00:00:42.558 --> 00:00:44.136
OK, reverse your hands.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.136
Now, follow my actions exactly.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.208
Now about half the audience has
their left hand up. Why is that?

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:51.859
OK, swap them around,
put your right hand up.

00:00:51.883 --> 00:00:54.456
Cross your hands over,
so your right hand goes over,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.457
interlace your fingers like this,

00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:59.347
then make sure your right thumb
is outside your left thumb --

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:00.520
that's very important.

00:01:00.544 --> 00:01:02.830
Yours is the other way around,
so swap it around.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.370
Excellent, OK. Extend
your fingers like this for me.

00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:07.614
All right. Tap them together once.

00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:11.902
OK, now, if you did not allow me
to deceive your minds,

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:13.582
you would all be able to do this.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.742
(Laughter)

00:01:19.376 --> 00:01:20.955
(Laughter ends)

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.486
Now you can see how easy it is

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.136
for me to manipulate the human mind,
once you know how.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.843
(Laughter)

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:30.105
Now, I remember when I was about 15,

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:31.699
(Laughter)

00:01:31.723 --> 00:01:33.642
I read a copy of Life magazine,

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:38.505
which detailed a story
about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.252
who could sense printed letters --

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:42.148
there's still people trying to do it --

00:01:42.172 --> 00:01:43.299
(Laughter)

00:01:43.323 --> 00:01:46.704
-- who could sense printed letters
and even sense colors, just by touch.

00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:48.136
And she was completely blind.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.399
She could also read
the serial numbers on bills

00:01:50.423 --> 00:01:52.900
when they were placed,
face down, on a hard surface.

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:56.136
Now, I was fascinated,
but at the same time, skeptical.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.399
How could somebody read
using their fingertips?

00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:03.136
You know, if you actually think about it,
if somebody is totally blind --

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.802
a guy yesterday did a demonstration
in one of the rooms,

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:09.094
where people had to close their eyes
and they could just hear things.

00:02:09.118 --> 00:02:12.032
And it's just a really weird thing
to try and figure out.

00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:14.305
How could somebody read
using their fingertips?

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.044
Now earlier on, as part of a TV show
that I have coming up on MTV,

00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:20.136
I attempted to give
a similar demonstration

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.024
of what is now known as second sight.

00:02:23.048 --> 00:02:24.136
So, let's take a look.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.136
(Video) Man: There we go.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.136
I'm going to guide you into the car.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.636
Kathryn Thomas: (Laughter)

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.136
Man: You're OK, keep on going.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.234
KT: How are you?

00:02:32.258 --> 00:02:34.107
Keith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here.

00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:37.136
I'm going to take you
to a secret location, OK?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.124
Kathryn, there was no way
you could see through that blindfold.

00:02:40.148 --> 00:02:42.936
KT: OK, but don't say my name like that.
KB: But you're OK?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.036
KT: Yes.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.136
KB: No way to see through it?
KT: No.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.435
KB: I'll take it off.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.136
Do you want to take the rest off?

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.436
Take it off, you're OK.
We'll stop for a second.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.508
KT: I'm so afraid
of what I'm going to see.

00:02:53.532 --> 00:02:56.208
KB: You're fine, take it off.
You're OK. You're safe.

00:02:56.232 --> 00:02:58.136
Have you ever heard of second sight?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.196
KT: No.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.592
KB: Second sight is whereby
a mind-control expert

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:04.136
can see through somebody else's eyes.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
And I'm going to try that right now.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
KT: God.

I can't see.

I'm looking at the road, all the time.

You're like a freak-ass of nature.

That was the most scary thing
I've ever done in my life!

(Applause)

00:04:54.232 --> 00:04:56.136
KB: Thank you.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.136
By the way, two days ago,
we were going to film this

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.136
down there, at the race course,
and we got a guy into a car,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.136
and we got a camera man in the back,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.697
but halfway through the drive,

00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:08.167
he told me he had,
I think it was a nine-millimeter,

00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:09.360
stuck to his leg.

00:05:09.384 --> 00:05:11.470
So, I stopped pretty quick,
and that was it.

00:05:11.494 --> 00:05:14.763
So, do you believe it's possible
to see through somebody else's eyes?

00:05:14.787 --> 00:05:15.866
That's the question.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.395
Now, most people here
would automatically say no.

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.563
OK, but I want you to realize some facts.

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:22.808
I couldn't see through the blindfold.

00:05:22.832 --> 00:05:25.642
The car was not gimmicked
or tricked in any way.

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:28.604
The girl, I'd never met before, all right.

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:31.108
So, I want you to just think
about it for a moment.

00:05:31.132 --> 00:05:32.786
A lot of people try to come up

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.477
with a logical solution
to what just happened, all right.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.879
But because your brains are not
trained in the art of deception,

00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:40.344
the solutions you come up with

00:05:40.368 --> 00:05:42.724
will, 99 percent of the time,
be way off the mark.

00:05:43.502 --> 00:05:46.136
This is because magic
is all about directing attention.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.077
If, for instance, I didn't want
you to look at my right hand,

00:05:49.101 --> 00:05:50.336
then I don't look at it.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.131
But if I wanted you
to look at my right hand,

00:05:53.155 --> 00:05:54.377
then I look at it, too.

00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:56.520
You see, it's very simple,
once you know how,

00:05:56.544 --> 00:05:58.247
but very complicated in other ways.

00:05:58.271 --> 00:06:00.788
I'm going to give you
some demonstrations right now.

00:06:00.812 --> 00:06:03.670
I need two people to help me out
real quick. Can you come up?

00:06:03.694 --> 00:06:07.730
And let's see, down at the end, here,
can you also come up, real quick?

00:06:07.754 --> 00:06:09.136
Do you mind? Yes, at the end.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.541
OK, give them a round of applause
as they come up.

00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:13.541
You might want to use the stairs, there.

00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:16.137
(Applause)

00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:18.462

for everybody here to realize

I haven't set anything up with you.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.134

00:06:22.158 --> 00:06:24.635

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:22.153
You just take a seat
over here for a second.

00:08:22.177 --> 00:08:24.136
I'm going to use you again, in a moment.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.732
Can you take a seat
right over here, if you don't mind.

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:27.907
Sit right here.
Man: OK.

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:31.136
KB: OK, take a seat. Excellent, OK.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.136
Now, what I want you to do
is look directly at me, OK,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.303
just take a deep breath
in through your nose,

00:08:36.327 --> 00:08:38.877
letting it out through
your mouth, and relax.

00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:42.619
Allow your eyes to close,
on five, four, three, two, one.

00:08:42.643 --> 00:08:44.136
Close your eyes right now.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.136
OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.113
I'm merely placing you in a heightened
state of synchronicity,

00:08:49.137 --> 00:08:51.136
so our minds are along the same lines.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.136
And as you sink and drift and float
into this relaxed state of mind,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.136
I'm going to take your left hand,
and just place it up here.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.331
I want you to hold it there
just for a moment,

00:09:00.355 --> 00:09:02.206
and I only want you to allow your hand

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.609
to sink and drift and float
back to the tabletop

00:09:04.633 --> 00:09:06.136
at the same rate and speed

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.355
as you drift and float into this
relaxed state of awareness,

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:12.418
and allow it to go all the way
down to the tabletop.

00:09:12.442 --> 00:09:15.561
That's it, all the way down,
all the way down.

00:09:15.585 --> 00:09:18.188
and further, and further.

00:09:18.212 --> 00:09:19.481
Excellent.

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:22.410
I want you to allow your hand
to stick firmly to the tabletop.

00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:24.224
OK, now, allow it to stay there.

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:27.742
OK, now, in a moment,
you'll feel a certain pressure, OK,

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:29.811
and I want you
to be aware of the pressure.

00:09:34.436 --> 00:09:36.135
Just be aware of the pressure.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.597
And I only want you to allow your hand

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:43.145
to float slowly back up from the tabletop
as you feel the pressure release,

00:09:43.169 --> 00:09:45.259
but only when you feel
the pressure release.

00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:48.136
Do you understand? Just answer yes or no.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.181
Man: Yes.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.522
KB: Hold it right there.

00:09:56.546 --> 00:09:58.641
And only when you feel
the pressure go back,

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:00.901
allow your hand to drift
back to the tabletop,

00:10:00.925 --> 00:10:02.640
but only when you feel the pressure.

00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:08.791
(Laughter)

00:10:08.815 --> 00:10:11.196
OK, that was wonderfully done.
Let's try it again.

00:10:21.813 --> 00:10:25.719
Excellent. Now that you've got the idea,
let's try something even more interesting.

00:10:25.743 --> 00:10:28.743
Allow it to stick firmly
to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed.

00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:31.783
Can you stand up?
Just stand, stage forward.

00:10:31.807 --> 00:10:34.266
I want you to point directly
at his forehead.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.488
OK.

00:10:35.512 --> 00:10:37.765
Imagine a connection between you and him.

00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:40.784
Only when you want
the pressure to be released,

00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:42.450
make an upward gesture, like this,

00:10:42.474 --> 00:10:44.467
but only when you want it to be released.

00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:46.140
You can wait as long as you want,

00:10:46.164 --> 00:10:48.260
but only when you want
the pressure released.

00:10:55.317 --> 00:10:56.840
OK, let's try it again.

00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:59.136
OK, now, imagine the connection, OK.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.136
Point directly at his forehead.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.018
Only when you want the pressure
released, we'll try it again.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.136
OK, it worked that time, excellent.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.136
And hold it there, both of you.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.399
Only when you want the pressure
to go back, make a downward gesture.

00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:15.995
You can wait as long as you want.

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:21.969
You did it pretty quickly,
but it went down, OK.

00:11:21.993 --> 00:11:24.136
Now, I want you to be aware
that in a moment,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.568
when I snap my fingers,
your eyes will open, again.

00:11:26.592 --> 00:11:29.787
It's OK to remember to forget,
or forget to remember what happened.

00:11:29.811 --> 00:11:32.581
Most people ask you, "What
the hell just happened up here?"

00:11:32.605 --> 00:11:34.988
But it's OK that even though
you're not hypnotized,

00:11:35.012 --> 00:11:37.244
you will forget everything that happened.

00:11:37.268 --> 00:11:40.136
On five, four, three, two, one --
open your eyes, wide awake.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.464
Give them a round of applause,
as they go back to their seats.

00:11:43.488 --> 00:11:45.001
(Applause)

00:11:45.025 --> 00:11:46.392
OK, you can go back.

00:11:46.416 --> 00:11:49.685
(Applause)

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:52.660
I once saw a film called
"The Gods Are Crazy."

00:11:52.684 --> 00:11:55.136
Has anybody here seen that film? Yeah.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.768
Remember when they threw
the Coke out of the airplane,

00:11:57.792 --> 00:12:00.120
and it landed on the ground,
and it didn't break?

00:12:00.144 --> 00:12:02.468
Now, see, that's because
Coke bottles are solid.

00:12:03.006 --> 00:12:06.293
It's nearly impossible
to break a Coke bottle.

00:12:06.317 --> 00:12:07.714
Do you want to try it?

00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:11.835
Good job. She's not taking any chances.

00:12:11.859 --> 00:12:13.136
(Laughter)

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.541
You see, psychokinesis
is the paranormal influence

00:12:15.565 --> 00:12:18.048
of the mind on physical
events and processes.

00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:20.136
For some magicians or mentalists,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.136
sometimes the spoon will bend
or melt, sometimes it will not.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.644
Sometimes the object will slide
across the table, sometimes it will not.

00:12:27.668 --> 00:12:29.940
It depends on how much
energy you have that day,

00:12:29.964 --> 00:12:31.028
so on and so forth.

00:12:31.052 --> 00:12:33.910
We're going to try an experiment
in psychokinesis, right now.

00:12:33.934 --> 00:12:36.063
Come right over here, next to me.
Excellent.

00:12:36.087 --> 00:12:37.872
Now, have a look at the Coke bottle.

00:12:37.896 --> 00:12:41.468
Make sure it is solid, there's only
one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.

00:12:41.492 --> 00:12:44.493
And you can whack it against the table,
if you want; be careful.

00:12:44.517 --> 00:12:46.517
Even though it's solid, I'm standing away.

00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:49.891
I want you to pinch right here
with two fingers and your thumb.

00:12:49.915 --> 00:12:52.469
Excellent.
Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK.

00:12:52.493 --> 00:12:54.446
I want you to examine the shard of glass.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.045
Careful, it's sharp.
Just hold on to it for a moment.

00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:58.236
Now, hold it out here.

00:12:58.261 --> 00:13:02.161
I want you to imagine, right now,
a broken relationship from many years ago.

00:13:02.707 --> 00:13:05.788
I want you to imagine
all the negative energy

00:13:05.812 --> 00:13:07.964
from that broken
relationship, from that guy,

00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:10.492
being imparted into the broken
piece of glass,

00:13:10.516 --> 00:13:12.136
which will represent him, OK.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.208
But I want you to take this
very seriously.

00:13:14.232 --> 00:13:16.518
Stare at the glass,
ignore everybody right here.

00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:19.665
In a moment, you'll feel
a certain sensation, OK,

00:13:19.689 --> 00:13:21.505
and when you feel that sensation,

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:24.136
I want you to drop the piece
of glass into the bottle.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.057
Think of that guy, that ba -- that guy.

00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:30.136
(Laughter)

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.573
I'm trying to be good here.

00:13:31.597 --> 00:13:33.407
OK, and when you feel the sensation --

00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:35.690
it might take a while --
drop it into the glass.

00:13:47.969 --> 00:13:48.969
OK, drop it in.

00:13:49.501 --> 00:13:52.136
Now, imagine all that negative
energy in there.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.793
Imagine his name
and imagine him inside the glass.

00:13:54.817 --> 00:13:57.061
And I want you to release
that negative energy

00:13:57.085 --> 00:13:58.609
by shaking it from side to side.

00:13:59.726 --> 00:14:00.727
(Burst)

00:14:00.751 --> 00:14:03.136
(Laughter)

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.692
That was a lot of negative energy,
built up in there.

00:14:05.716 --> 00:14:07.778
(Laughter)

00:14:07.802 --> 00:14:11.136
(Applause)

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.161
I also want you to look at me
and think of his name.

00:14:14.185 --> 00:14:18.160
OK, think of how many letters
in the title of his name.

00:14:18.184 --> 00:14:19.866
There's five letters in the title.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.137
You didn't react to that,
so it's four letters.

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:24.136
Think of one of the letters in the title.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.136
There's a K in his name, there is a K.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.536
I knew that because my name
starts with a K also,

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.397
but his name doesn't start
with a K, it starts with an M.

00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:33.843
Tell Mike I said hello,
the next time you see him.

00:14:33.867 --> 00:14:35.536
Was that his name?
Nicole: Mm-hmm.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.337
KB: OK, give her a round of applause.

00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:42.969
(Applause)

00:14:42.993 --> 00:14:44.136
Thank you.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.118

00:14:49.329 --> 00:14:50.628
(Applause ends)

00:14:50.652 --> 00:14:53.136
I've got one more thing
to share with you right now.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.541
Actually, Chris, I was going
to pick you for this,

00:14:55.565 --> 00:14:57.804
but instead of picking you,
can you hop up here

00:14:57.828 --> 00:15:00.136
and pick a victim
for this next experiment?

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.732
And it should be a male victim,
that's the only thing.

00:15:02.756 --> 00:15:04.136
Chris Anderson: Oh, OK.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.546
KB: I was going to use you,

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.136
but I decided I might want
to come back another year.

(Laughter)

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:11.311

for saying "eureka,"

00:15:11.335 --> 00:15:14.903

KB: OK, Steve, I want you to take
a seat, right behind here. Excellent.

00:15:24.849 --> 00:15:27.136
Now, Steve -- oh, you
can check underneath.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.523
Go ahead, I've no fancy
assistants underneath there.

00:15:31.547 --> 00:15:34.062
They insist that because I was a magician,

00:15:34.086 --> 00:15:35.626
put a nice, black tablecloth on.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.063
There you are, OK.

00:15:37.087 --> 00:15:38.136
(Laughter)

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.136
I've got four wooden plinths here, Steve.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.136
One, two, three and four.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.399
Now, they're all the exact
same except this one

00:15:45.423 --> 00:15:48.138
obviously has a stainless steel
spike sticking out of it.

00:15:48.162 --> 00:15:50.627
I want you to examine it,
and make sure it's solid.

00:15:53.255 --> 00:15:54.262
Happy?

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:56.240
Steve Jurvetson: Mmm, yes.

KB: OK. Now, Steve, I'm going
to stand in front of the table,

00:15:59.795 --> 00:16:01.567
When I stand in front of the table,

00:16:01.591 --> 00:16:03.706
I want you to put the cups on the plinths,

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.969
in any order you want,
and then mix them all up,

00:16:05.993 --> 00:16:08.764

the spike is, all right?

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.146
I'll block them from view,
so nobody can see what you're doing.

I'll also look away. So, go
ahead and mix them up, now.

00:16:17.766 --> 00:16:19.442
OK, and tell me when you're done.

(Laughter)

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.136
Now, Steve, you know where the spike is,
but nobody else, does? Correct?

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.399
But I don't want you to know either,
so swivel around on your chair.

to make sure I don't do anything funny.

00:17:02.447 --> 00:17:04.494
No, stay around, OK.

00:17:11.036 --> 00:17:12.718
Now, Steve, look back.

00:17:12.742 --> 00:17:16.512
Now you don't know where the spike is,
and I don't know where it is either.

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.003
Now, is there any way to see
through this blindfold?

00:17:19.682 --> 00:17:20.714
SJ: Put this on?

00:17:20.738 --> 00:17:23.485

to see through it? No?

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:26.136
SJ: No, I can't see through it.
KB: Excellent.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.024
Now, I'm going to put on the blindfold.

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:30.481
Don't stack them up, OK.
Give them an extra mix up.

00:17:30.505 --> 00:17:33.786
Don't move the cups, I don't want
anybody to see where the spike is,

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.886
but give the plinths an extra mix up,
and then line them up.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.756
I'll put the blindfold on.
Give them an extra mix up.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.353
No messing around this time.
OK, go ahead, mix them up.

00:17:42.377 --> 00:17:44.377
My hand is at risk here.

00:17:47.136 --> 00:17:48.136
(Laughter)

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.136
Tell me when you're done.

Put out your hand. Your right hand.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.732
Now, if I go this way,
is there another cup over here?

00:18:26.756 --> 00:18:28.136
SJ: Can we do the left hand?

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.136

he do the left hand. Absolutely not.

OK, give me both hands.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.952
Now, put them on both cups.

00:18:57.976 --> 00:19:01.602
Do you think the spike
is under your left or your right hand?

Now, remember, you made
all the decisions all along.

Psychologists, figure this out.
