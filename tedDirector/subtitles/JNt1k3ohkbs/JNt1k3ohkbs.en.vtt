00:00:12.531 --> 00:00:15.107
It was less than a year after September 11,

00:00:15.107 --> 00:00:16.782
and I was at the Chicago Tribune

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:18.656
writing about shootings and murders,

00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:20.118
and it was leaving me feeling

00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:21.900
pretty dark and depressed.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.482
I had done some activism in college,

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.129
so I decided to help a local group

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.838
hang door knockers against animal testing.

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:29.345
I thought it would be a safe way

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:31.227
to do something positive,

00:00:31.227 --> 00:00:33.793
but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever,

00:00:33.793 --> 00:00:36.118
and we were all arrested.

00:00:36.118 --> 00:00:38.330
Police took this blurry photo of me

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.556
holding leaflets as evidence.

00:00:41.556 --> 00:00:43.420
My charges were dismissed,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.556
but a few weeks later,

00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:46.593
two FBI agents knocked on my door,

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:48.354
and they told me that unless I helped them

00:00:48.354 --> 00:00:50.455
by spying on protest groups,

00:00:50.455 --> 00:00:54.272
they would put me on a domestic terrorist list.

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:56.308
I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch,

00:00:56.308 --> 00:00:58.299
but I was terrified,

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:00.183
and when my fear subsided,

00:01:00.183 --> 00:01:02.100
I became obsessed with finding out

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.217
how this happened,

00:01:03.217 --> 00:01:05.395
how animal rights and environmental activists

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:07.609
who have never injured anyone

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.522
could become the FBI's number one

00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:12.726
domestic terrorism threat.

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:14.696
A few years later, I was invited to testify

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:17.200
before Congress about my reporting,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.558
and I told lawmakers that, while everybody

00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:20.283
is talking about going green,

00:01:20.283 --> 00:01:21.821
some people are risking their lives

00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:25.333
to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.382
They're physically putting their bodies on the line

00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:30.807
between the whalers' harpoons and the whales.

00:01:30.807 --> 00:01:32.496
These are everyday people,

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:34.582
like these protesters in Italy

00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:36.644
who spontaneously climbed over

00:01:36.644 --> 00:01:38.945
barbed wire fences to rescue beagles

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:41.106
from animal testing.

00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:43.782
And these movements have been incredibly effective

00:01:43.782 --> 00:01:45.720
and popular,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.581
so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word,

00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:51.145
eco-terrorist,

00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:53.269
to shift how we view them.

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:55.156
They just made it up.

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:57.693
Now these companies have backed new laws

00:01:57.693 --> 00:02:00.432
like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act,

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:02.551
which turns activism into terrorism

00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:05.319
if it causes a loss of profits.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.318
Now most people never even heard about this law,

00:02:08.318 --> 00:02:10.444
including members of Congress.

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:12.355
Less than one percent were in the room

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:14.815
when it passed the House.

00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:17.718
The rest were outside at a new memorial.

00:02:17.718 --> 00:02:19.379
They were praising Dr. King

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.805
as his style of activism was branded as terrorism

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:26.456
if done in the name of animals or the environment.

00:02:26.456 --> 00:02:28.393
Supporters say laws like this are needed

00:02:28.393 --> 00:02:30.242
for the extremists:

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:33.191
the vandals, the arsonists, the radicals.

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:35.453
But right now, companies like TransCanada

00:02:35.453 --> 00:02:38.778
are briefing police in presentations like this one

00:02:38.778 --> 00:02:41.467
about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.605
as terrorists.

00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:47.228
The FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:48.779
are not about violence,

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.492
they're about public relations.

00:02:51.492 --> 00:02:53.465
Today, in multiple countries,

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.953
corporations are pushing new laws

00:02:54.953 --> 00:02:56.667
that make it illegal to photograph

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:59.927
animal cruelty on their farms.

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:02.454
The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago,

00:03:02.454 --> 00:03:04.227
and today we released a lawsuit

00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:05.954
challenging it as unconstitutional

00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:08.527
as a threat to journalism.

00:03:08.527 --> 00:03:10.865
The first of these ag-gag prosecutions,

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:12.300
as they're called,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.952
was a young woman named Amy Meyer,

00:03:13.952 --> 00:03:15.565
and Amy saw a sick cow being moved

00:03:15.565 --> 00:03:18.114
by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:20.528
as she was on the public street.

00:03:20.528 --> 00:03:22.739
And Amy did what any of us would:

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.514
She filmed it.

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:27.563
When I found out about her story, I wrote about it,

00:03:27.563 --> 00:03:30.488
and within 24 hours, it created such an uproar

00:03:30.488 --> 00:03:33.738
that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges.

00:03:33.738 --> 00:03:35.756
But apparently, even exposing stuff like that

00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:37.576
is a threat.

00:03:37.576 --> 00:03:39.240
Through the Freedom of Information Act,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.100
I learned that the counter-terrorism unit

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.177
has been monitoring my articles

00:03:43.177 --> 00:03:45.463
and speeches like this one.

00:03:45.463 --> 00:03:47.689
They even included this nice
little write-up of my book.

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.804
They described it as "compelling and well-written."

00:03:50.804 --> 00:03:55.525
(Applause)

00:03:55.525 --> 00:03:58.760
Blurb on the next book, right?

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.400
The point of all of this is to make us afraid,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.289
but as a journalist, I have an unwavering faith

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:06.120
in the power of education.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.687
Our best weapon is sunlight.

00:04:09.687 --> 00:04:11.574
Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man

00:04:11.574 --> 00:04:14.899
is to prove he's a man and not a piano key.

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:16.461
Over and over throughout history,

00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:18.449
people in power have used fear

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.248
to silence the truth and to silence dissent.

00:04:22.248 --> 00:04:24.287
It's time we strike a new note.

00:04:24.287 --> 00:04:26.262
Thank you.

00:04:26.262 --> 00:04:28.116
(Applause)
