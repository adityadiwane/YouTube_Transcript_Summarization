00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.820
I want you to touch your face.

00:00:15.406 --> 00:00:16.677
Go on.

00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:18.809
What do you feel?

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:20.716
Soft? Squishy?

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:23.923
It's you, right? You're feeling you?

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.632
Well, it's not quite true.

00:00:27.207 --> 00:00:30.452
You're actually feeling
thousands of microscopic creatures

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:33.017
that live on our face and fingers.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.023
You're feeling some of the fungi

00:00:36.047 --> 00:00:38.927
that drifted down
from the air ducts today.

00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:40.918
They set off our allergies

00:00:40.942 --> 00:00:42.494
and smell of mildew.

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:48.009
You're feeling some
of the 100 billion bacterial cells

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:49.679
that live on our skin.

00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:54.179
They've been munching away
at your skin oils and replicating,

00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:56.465
producing the smells of body odor.

00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:00.299
You're likely even touching
the fecal bacteria

00:01:00.323 --> 00:01:03.983
that sprayed onto you the last time
you flushed a toilet,

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:07.131
or those bacteria that live
in our water pipes

00:01:07.155 --> 00:01:09.614
and sprayed onto you
with your last shower.

00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:11.637
Sorry.

00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:13.129
(Laughter)

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:16.717
You're probably even giving
a microscopic high five

00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:20.466
to the two species of mites
that live on our faces,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.158
on all of our faces.

00:01:22.697 --> 00:01:25.343
They've spent the night
squirming across your face

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:28.215
and having sex on the bridge of your nose.

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:30.829
(Laughter)

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.952
Many of them are now leaking
their gut contents onto your pores.

00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:38.032
(Laughter)

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.520
Now look at your finger.

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:42.287
How's it feel? Gross?

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:44.691
In desperate need of soap or bleach?

00:01:46.192 --> 00:01:47.806
That's how you feel now,

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.442
but it's not going to be
how you feel in the future.

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:53.199
For the last 100 years,

00:01:53.223 --> 00:01:55.200
we've had an adversarial relationship

00:01:55.224 --> 00:01:57.839
with the microscopic life nearest us.

00:01:57.863 --> 00:01:59.985
If I told you there was
a bug in your house

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.243
or bacteria in your sink,

00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:03.594
there was a human-devised
solution for that,

00:02:03.618 --> 00:02:06.754
a product to eradicate, exterminate,

00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:08.071
disinfect.

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:12.538
We strive to remove most
of the microscopic life in our world now.

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:18.335
But in doing so, we're ignoring
the best source of new technology

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.575
on this planet.

00:02:20.444 --> 00:02:26.090
The last 100 years have featured
human solutions to microbial problems,

00:02:26.114 --> 00:02:31.578
but the next 100 years will feature
microbial solutions to human problems.

00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:34.700
I'm a scientist, and I work
with researchers

00:02:34.724 --> 00:02:38.000
at North Carolina State University
and the University of Colorado

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:41.618
to uncover the microscopic
life that is nearest us,

00:02:42.637 --> 00:02:46.505
and that's often in our most intimate
and boring environments,

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.687
be it under our couches, in our backyards,

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.130
or in our belly buttons.

00:02:51.903 --> 00:02:54.773
I do this work because it turns out
that we know very little

00:02:54.797 --> 00:02:57.118
about the microscopic life
that's nearest us.

00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:00.574
As of a few years ago,
no scientist could tell you

00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:03.211
what bugs or microorganisms
live in your home --

00:03:04.328 --> 00:03:07.751
your home, the place you know
better than anywhere else.

00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:10.167
And so I and teams of others

00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:12.384
are armed with Q-tips and tweezers

00:03:12.408 --> 00:03:14.274
and advanced DNA techniques

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:16.890
to uncover the microscopic
life nearest us.

00:03:18.042 --> 00:03:22.102
In doing so, we found
over 600 species of bugs

00:03:22.126 --> 00:03:24.026
that live in USA homes,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.547
everything from spiders and cockroaches

00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:29.139
to tiny mites that cling to feathers.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.235
And we found over 100,000 species
of bacteria and fungi

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:37.274
that live in our dust bunnies,

00:03:37.298 --> 00:03:40.832
thousands more that live
on our clothes or in our showers.

00:03:42.146 --> 00:03:43.690
We've gone further still,

00:03:43.714 --> 00:03:45.430
and we looked at the microorganisms

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:49.582
that live inside the bodies
of each of those bugs in our home.

00:03:50.328 --> 00:03:53.738
In each bug, for example, a wasp,

00:03:53.762 --> 00:03:57.972
we see a microscopic jungle
unfold in a petri plate,

00:03:57.996 --> 00:04:01.273
a world of hundreds of vibrant species.

00:04:01.297 --> 00:04:03.750
Behold the biological cosmos!

00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:07.780
So many of the species
you're looking at right now

00:04:07.804 --> 00:04:09.031
don't yet have names.

00:04:09.723 --> 00:04:12.546
Most of the life around us
remains unknown.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.153
I remember the first time I discovered
and got to name a new species.

00:04:17.177 --> 00:04:20.671
It was a fungus that lives
in the nest of a paper wasp.

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:22.920
It's white and fluffy,

00:04:22.944 --> 00:04:25.488
and I named it "mucor nidicola,"

00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:28.515
meaning in Latin that it lives
in the nest of another.

00:04:29.772 --> 00:04:32.616
This is a picture of it
growing on a dinosaur,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.737
because everyone
thinks dinosaurs are cool.

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:38.822
At the time, I was in graduate school,

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:42.568
and I was so excited
that I had found this new life form.

00:04:42.592 --> 00:04:44.368
I called up my dad, and I go,

00:04:44.392 --> 00:04:47.810
"Dad! I just discovered
a new microorganism species."

00:04:48.394 --> 00:04:49.895
And he laughed and he goes,

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.187
"That's great. I hope you also
discovered a cure for it."

00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:54.657
(Laughter)

00:04:54.681 --> 00:04:55.853
"Cure it."

00:04:57.022 --> 00:04:59.729
Now, my dad is my biggest fan,

00:04:59.753 --> 00:05:04.123
so in that crushing moment where he wanted
to kill my new little life form,

00:05:04.147 --> 00:05:06.693
I realized that actually I had failed him,

00:05:06.717 --> 00:05:08.878
both as a daughter and a scientist.

00:05:08.902 --> 00:05:12.828
In my years toiling away in labs
and in people's backyards,

00:05:12.852 --> 00:05:16.532
investigating and cataloging
the microscopic life around us,

00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:19.092
I'd never made clear
my true mission to him.

00:05:20.264 --> 00:05:22.180
My goal is not to find technology

00:05:22.204 --> 00:05:24.604
to kill the new microscopic
life around us.

00:05:25.135 --> 00:05:29.267
My goal is to find new technology
from this life, that will help save us.

00:05:31.315 --> 00:05:37.067
The diversity of life in our homes is more
than a list of 100,000 new species.

00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:41.059
It is 100,000 new sources
of solutions to human problems.

00:05:42.268 --> 00:05:44.969
I know it's hard to believe
that anything that's so small

00:05:44.993 --> 00:05:46.151
or only has one cell

00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:47.494
can do anything powerful,

00:05:47.518 --> 00:05:48.855
but they can.

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.724
These creatures
are microscopic alchemists,

00:05:51.748 --> 00:05:54.606
with the ability to transform
their environment

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.949
with an arsenal of chemical tools.

00:05:57.745 --> 00:06:00.728
This means that they can live
anywhere on this planet,

00:06:00.752 --> 00:06:03.139
and they can eat whatever
food is around them.

00:06:04.372 --> 00:06:08.681
This means they can eat everything
from toxic waste to plastic,

00:06:09.895 --> 00:06:14.410
and they can produce waste products
like oil and battery power

00:06:14.434 --> 00:06:17.276
and even tiny nuggets of real gold.

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:22.110
They can transform the inedible
into nutritive.

00:06:22.567 --> 00:06:24.949
They can make sugar into alcohol.

00:06:25.746 --> 00:06:27.659
They give chocolate its flavor,

00:06:27.683 --> 00:06:29.419
and soil the power to grow.

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:31.440
I'm here to tell you

00:06:31.464 --> 00:06:34.611
that the next 100 years will feature
these microscopic creatures

00:06:34.635 --> 00:06:36.240
solving more of our problems.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.053
And we have a lot of problems
to choose from.

00:06:39.582 --> 00:06:43.509
We've got the mundane:
bad-smelling clothes or bland food.

00:06:44.284 --> 00:06:46.321
And we've got the monumental:

00:06:46.345 --> 00:06:49.646
disease, pollution, war.

00:06:51.146 --> 00:06:52.830
And so this is my mission:

00:06:52.854 --> 00:06:56.084
to not just catalog
the microscopic life around us,

00:06:56.108 --> 00:06:59.357
but to find out what it's uniquely
well-suited to help us with.

00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:01.866
Here's an example.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.522
We started with a pest,

00:07:03.546 --> 00:07:05.894
a wasp that lives on many of our homes.

00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:11.454
Inside that wasp, we plucked out
a little-known microorganism species

00:07:11.478 --> 00:07:12.867
with a unique ability:

00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:14.830
it could make beer.

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:19.231
This is a trait that only
a few species on this planet have.

00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:22.116
In fact, all commercially produced
beer you've ever had

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.643
likely came from one of only
three microorganism species.

00:07:26.549 --> 00:07:30.631
Yet our species, it could make
a beer that tasted like honey,

00:07:31.416 --> 00:07:34.058
and it could also make
a delightfully tart beer.

00:07:34.863 --> 00:07:38.696
In fact, this microorganism species
that lives in the belly of a wasp,

00:07:39.427 --> 00:07:41.724
it could make a valuable sour beer

00:07:41.748 --> 00:07:45.207
better than any other species
on this planet.

00:07:46.496 --> 00:07:49.620
There are now four species
that produce commercial beer.

00:07:51.017 --> 00:07:53.332
Where you used to see a pest,

00:07:53.356 --> 00:07:56.293
now think of tasting
your future favorite beer.

00:07:57.745 --> 00:07:59.274
As a second example,

00:07:59.298 --> 00:08:02.654
I worked with researchers
to dig in the dirt in people's backyards.

00:08:03.313 --> 00:08:07.370
There, we uncovered a microorganism
that could make novel antibiotics,

00:08:07.394 --> 00:08:10.527
antibiotics that can kill
the world's worst superbugs.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.719
This was an awesome thing to find,

00:08:14.743 --> 00:08:16.121
but here's the secret:

00:08:16.984 --> 00:08:18.904
for the last 60 years,

00:08:18.928 --> 00:08:21.217
most of the antibiotics on the market

00:08:21.241 --> 00:08:23.450
have come from similar soil bacteria.

00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:27.114
Every day, you and I
and everyone in this room

00:08:27.138 --> 00:08:28.880
and on this planet,

00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:33.323
are saved by similar soil bacteria
that produce most of our antibiotics.

00:08:35.045 --> 00:08:36.718
Where you used to see dirt,

00:08:36.742 --> 00:08:38.673
now think of medication.

00:08:40.222 --> 00:08:42.868
Perhaps my favorite example
comes from colleagues

00:08:42.892 --> 00:08:45.788
who are studying
a pond scum microorganism,

00:08:45.812 --> 00:08:49.431
which is tragically named after
the cow dung it was first found in.

00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:54.166
It's pretty unremarkable
and would be unworthy of discussion,

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.712
except that the researchers found
that if you feed it to mice,

00:08:57.736 --> 00:08:59.787
it vaccinates against PTSD.

00:09:01.662 --> 00:09:03.566
It vaccinates against fear.

00:09:05.238 --> 00:09:08.460
Where you used to see pond scum,
now think of hope.

00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:12.301
There are so many more microbial examples

00:09:12.325 --> 00:09:14.469
that I don't have time
to talk about today.

00:09:14.942 --> 00:09:20.326
I gave you examples of solutions
that came from just three species,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.696
but imagine what those other
100,000 species in your dust bunnies

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.993
might be able to do.

00:09:26.571 --> 00:09:29.899
In the future, they might be able
to make you sexier

00:09:30.578 --> 00:09:31.885
or smarter

00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:34.732
or perhaps live longer.

00:09:36.303 --> 00:09:38.455
So I want you to look
at your finger again.

00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:41.291
Think about all those
microscopic creatures

00:09:41.315 --> 00:09:42.762
that are unknown.

00:09:42.786 --> 00:09:45.791
Think about in the future
what they might be able to do

00:09:45.815 --> 00:09:46.988
or make

00:09:47.528 --> 00:09:49.674
or whose life they might be able to save.

00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:52.694
How does your finger feel right now?

00:09:53.322 --> 00:09:54.827
A little bit powerful?

00:09:56.384 --> 00:09:58.411
That's because you're feeling the future.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.192
Thank you.

00:10:00.623 --> 00:10:05.244
(Applause)
