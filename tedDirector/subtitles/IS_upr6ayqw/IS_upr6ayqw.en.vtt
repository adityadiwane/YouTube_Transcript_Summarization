00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:15.708
I feel so fortunate that my first job

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:18.140
was working at the Museum of Modern Art

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.594
on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray.

00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:23.980
I learned so much from her.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.748
After the curator Robert Storr

00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:27.267
selected all the paintings

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:30.019
from her lifetime body of work,

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.661
I loved looking at the paintings from the 1970s.

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:36.217
There were some motifs and elements

00:00:36.217 --> 00:00:39.723
that would come up again later in her life.

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:41.362
I remember asking her

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:43.920
what she thought of those early works.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.384
If you didn't know they were hers,

00:00:45.384 --> 00:00:47.954
you might not have been able to guess.

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:50.877
She told me that a few didn't quite meet

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:54.484
her own mark for what she wanted them to be.

00:00:54.484 --> 00:00:55.913
One of the works, in fact,

00:00:55.913 --> 00:00:57.434
so didn't meet her mark,

00:00:57.434 --> 00:01:00.406
she had set it out in the trash in her studio,

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:02.247
and her neighbor had taken it

00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:04.817
because she saw its value.

00:01:04.817 --> 00:01:07.766
In that moment, my view of success

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.282
and creativity changed.

00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:13.170
I realized that success is a moment,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.106
but what we're always celebrating

00:01:15.106 --> 00:01:19.114
is creativity and mastery.

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:22.751
But this is the thing: What gets us to convert success

00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:24.980
into mastery?

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.771
This is a question I've long asked myself.

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:30.352
I think it comes when we start to value

00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:33.944
the gift of a near win.

00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:36.139
I started to understand this when I went

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:38.122
on one cold May day

00:01:38.122 --> 00:01:40.673
to watch a set of varsity archers,

00:01:40.673 --> 00:01:42.970
all women as fate would have it,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.050
at the northern tip of Manhattan

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.469
at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.138
I wanted to see what's called archer's paradox,

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:54.969
the idea that in order to actually hit your target,

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.411
you have to aim at something slightly skew from it.

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.404
I stood and watched as the coach

00:02:01.404 --> 00:02:04.118
drove up these women in this gray van,

00:02:04.118 --> 00:02:07.096
and they exited with this kind of relaxed focus.

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:09.990
One held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.507
and arrows in the left with yellow fletching.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.190
And they passed me and smiled,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.990
but they sized me up as they

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.609
made their way to the turf,

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.363
and spoke to each other not with words

00:02:20.363 --> 00:02:23.080
but with numbers, degrees, I thought,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.378
positions for how they might plan

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.911
to hit their target.

00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.294
I stood behind one archer as her coach

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:31.316
stood in between us to maybe assess

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:33.773
who might need support, and watched her,

00:02:33.773 --> 00:02:35.860
and I didn't understand how even one

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.711
was going to hit the ten ring.

00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:41.359
The ten ring from the standard 75-yard distance,

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.269
it looks as small as a matchstick tip

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.366
held out at arm's length.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.645
And this is while holding 50 pounds of draw weight

00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:52.352
on each shot.

00:02:52.352 --> 00:02:55.044
She first hit a seven, I remember, and then a nine,

00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:56.324
and then two tens,

00:02:56.324 --> 00:02:57.560
and then the next arrow

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.779
didn't even hit the target.

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.780
And I saw that gave her more tenacity,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.566
and she went after it again and again.

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:07.512
For three hours this went on.

00:03:07.512 --> 00:03:09.933
At the end of the practice, one of the archers

00:03:09.933 --> 00:03:12.519
was so taxed that she lied out on the ground

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.460
just star-fished,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.492
her head looking up at the sky,

00:03:16.492 --> 00:03:19.104
trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call

00:03:19.104 --> 00:03:22.990
that still point of the turning world.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.005
It's so rare in American culture,

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.015
there's so little that's vocational about it anymore,

00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:30.609
to look at what doggedness looks like

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.720
with this level of exactitude,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.101
what it means to align your body posture

00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:38.468
for three hours in order to hit a target,

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:42.538
pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity.

00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:44.763
But I stayed because I realized I was witnessing

00:03:44.763 --> 00:03:47.098
what's so rare to glimpse,

00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:50.971
that difference between success and mastery.

00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:53.595
So success is hitting that ten ring,

00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:55.711
but mastery is knowing that it means nothing

00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:59.267
if you can't do it again and again.

00:03:59.267 --> 00:04:02.988
Mastery is not just the same as excellence, though.

00:04:02.988 --> 00:04:04.821
It's not the same as success,

00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:07.054
which I see as an event,

00:04:07.054 --> 00:04:08.640
a moment in time,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.938
and a label that the world confers upon you.

00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:15.072
Mastery is not a commitment to a goal

00:04:15.072 --> 00:04:17.977
but to a constant pursuit.

00:04:17.977 --> 00:04:19.854
What gets us to do this,

00:04:19.854 --> 00:04:22.400
what get us to forward thrust more

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.057
is to value the near win.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.209
How many times have we designated something

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:31.080
a classic, a masterpiece even,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.658
while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished,

00:04:34.658 --> 00:04:36.881
riddled with difficulties and flaws,

00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:39.899
in other words, a near win?

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:41.793
Elizabeth Murray surprised me

00:04:41.793 --> 00:04:45.003
with her admission about her earlier paintings.

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:48.665
Painter Paul Cézanne so often
thought his works were incomplete

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:50.487
that he would deliberately leave them aside

00:04:50.487 --> 00:04:53.037
with the intention of picking them back up again,

00:04:53.037 --> 00:04:54.780
but at the end of his life,

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.995
the result was that he had only signed

00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:59.735
10 percent of his paintings.

00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:03.885
His favorite novel was "The [Unknown]
Masterpiece" by Honoré de Balzac,

00:05:03.885 --> 00:05:09.481
and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself.

00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:11.415
Franz Kafka saw incompletion

00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:14.666
when others would find only works to praise,

00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:17.099
so much so that he wanted all of his diaries,

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.196
manuscripts, letters and even sketches

00:05:19.196 --> 00:05:21.525
burned upon his death.

00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:24.320
His friend refused to honor the request,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.998
and because of that, we now have all the works

00:05:25.998 --> 00:05:27.767
we now do by Kafka:

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:31.160
"America," "The Trial" and "The Castle,"

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.785
a work so incomplete it even stops mid-sentence.

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:37.320
The pursuit of mastery, in other words,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.958
is an ever-onward almost.

00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.934
"Lord, grant that I desire

00:05:43.934 --> 00:05:46.010
more than I can accomplish,"

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.569
Michelangelo implored,

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.000
as if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.949
and he himself was that Adam

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.455
with his finger outstretched

00:05:54.455 --> 00:05:59.028
and not quite touching that God's hand.

00:05:59.028 --> 00:06:03.616
Mastery is in the reaching, not the arriving.

00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:06.921
It's in constantly wanting to close that gap

00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:11.119
between where you are and where you want to be.

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:14.707
Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:18.925
and not for the sake of crafting your career.

00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:21.590
How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.359
live out this phenomenon?

00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:25.864
We see it even in the life

00:06:25.864 --> 00:06:28.674
of the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders,

00:06:28.674 --> 00:06:30.348
who tells me that his triumphs

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.271
are not merely the result

00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:34.066
of a grand achievement,

00:06:34.066 --> 00:06:39.060
but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.796
We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge.

00:06:42.796 --> 00:06:45.491
It's a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington,

00:06:45.491 --> 00:06:48.417
who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire

00:06:48.417 --> 00:06:50.552
was always the next one,

00:06:50.552 --> 00:06:54.211
always the one he had yet to compose.

00:06:54.211 --> 00:06:56.340
Part of the reason that the near win

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.632
is inbuilt to mastery

00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:00.985
is because the greater our proficiency,

00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:03.145
the more clearly we might see

00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:06.363
that we don't know all that we thought we did.

00:07:06.363 --> 00:07:08.994
It's called the Dunning–Kruger effect.

00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:11.921
The Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin

00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:12.949
when they asked him,

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.646
"What do you think increases with knowledge?"

00:07:15.646 --> 00:07:20.328
and he said, "You learn how little you know."

00:07:20.328 --> 00:07:22.652
Success motivates us, but a near win

00:07:22.652 --> 00:07:25.527
can propel us in an ongoing quest.

00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:27.646
One of the most vivid examples of this comes

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:29.436
when we look at the difference

00:07:29.436 --> 00:07:31.382
between Olympic silver medalists

00:07:31.382 --> 00:07:34.333
and bronze medalists after a competition.

00:07:34.333 --> 00:07:36.946
Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell

00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:39.092
studied this difference and found

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:41.616
that the frustration silver medalists feel

00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:43.577
compared to bronze, who are typically a bit

00:07:43.577 --> 00:07:46.050
more happy to have just not received fourth place

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.729
and not medaled at all,

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:49.684
gives silver medalists a focus

00:07:49.684 --> 00:07:52.107
on follow-up competition.

00:07:52.107 --> 00:07:54.389
We see it even in the gambling industry

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:56.375
that once picked up on this phenomenon

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:57.867
of the near win

00:07:57.867 --> 00:08:00.130
and created these scratch-off tickets

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.458
that had a higher than average rate of near wins

00:08:03.458 --> 00:08:06.267
and so compelled people to buy more tickets

00:08:06.267 --> 00:08:08.216
that they were called heart-stoppers,

00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:11.279
and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:14.670
in Britain in the 1970s.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.919
The reason the near win has a propulsion

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:19.803
is because it changes our view of the landscape

00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:22.454
and puts our goals, which we tend to put

00:08:22.454 --> 00:08:25.059
at a distance, into more proximate vicinity

00:08:25.059 --> 00:08:26.905
to where we stand.

00:08:26.905 --> 00:08:30.083
If I ask you to envision what a
great day looks like next week,

00:08:30.083 --> 00:08:33.788
you might describe it in more general terms.

00:08:33.788 --> 00:08:37.439
But if I ask you to describe a
great day at TED tomorrow,

00:08:37.439 --> 00:08:40.900
you might describe it with granular, practical clarity.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.563
And this is what a near win does.

00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:45.109
It gets us to focus on what, right now,

00:08:45.109 --> 00:08:49.890
we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.046
It's Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who in 1984

00:08:53.046 --> 00:08:55.052
missed taking the gold in the heptathlon

00:08:55.052 --> 00:08:57.313
by one third of a second,

00:08:57.313 --> 00:08:59.194
and her husband predicted that would give her

00:08:59.194 --> 00:09:03.156
the tenacity she needed in follow-up competition.

00:09:03.156 --> 00:09:06.528
In 1988, she won the gold in the heptathlon

00:09:06.528 --> 00:09:10.703
and set a record of 7,291 points,

00:09:10.703 --> 00:09:15.810
a score that no athlete has come very close to since.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.521
We thrive not when we've done it all,

00:09:18.521 --> 00:09:21.928
but when we still have more to do.

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:24.010
I stand here thinking and wondering

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.708
about all the different ways

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:28.105
that we might even manufacture a near win

00:09:28.105 --> 00:09:29.370
in this room,

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.439
how your lives might play this out,

00:09:31.439 --> 00:09:36.230
because I think on some gut level we do know this.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.982
We know that we thrive when we stay

00:09:37.982 --> 00:09:39.499
at our own leading edge,

00:09:39.499 --> 00:09:41.965
and it's why the deliberate incomplete

00:09:41.965 --> 00:09:44.458
is inbuilt into creation myths.

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:46.980
In Navajo culture, some craftsmen and women

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.423
would deliberately put an imperfection

00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:51.070
in textiles and ceramics.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.861
It's what's called a spirit line,

00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:55.970
a deliberate flaw in the pattern

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.998
to give the weaver or maker a way out,

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:03.670
but also a reason to continue making work.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.447
Masters are not experts because they take

00:10:05.447 --> 00:10:08.065
a subject to its conceptual end.

00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:09.774
They're masters because they realize

00:10:09.774 --> 00:10:12.352
that there isn't one.

00:10:12.352 --> 00:10:15.462
Now it occurred to me, as I thought about this,

00:10:15.462 --> 00:10:17.250
why the archery coach

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.420
told me at the end of that practice,

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.665
out of earshot of his archers,

00:10:21.665 --> 00:10:23.642
that he and his colleagues never feel

00:10:23.642 --> 00:10:25.902
they can do enough for their team,

00:10:25.902 --> 00:10:28.779
never feel there are enough visualization techniques

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:31.566
and posture drills to help them overcome

00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:33.846
those constant near wins.

00:10:33.846 --> 00:10:36.293
It didn't sound like a complaint, exactly,

00:10:36.293 --> 00:10:38.886
but just a way to let me know,

00:10:38.886 --> 00:10:40.366
a kind of tender admission,

00:10:40.366 --> 00:10:43.631
to remind me that he knew
he was giving himself over

00:10:43.631 --> 00:10:46.786
to a voracious, unfinished path

00:10:46.786 --> 00:10:49.711
that always required more.

00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:52.860
We build out of the unfinished idea,

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.316
even if that idea is our former self.

00:10:57.316 --> 00:11:00.331
This is the dynamic of mastery.

00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:03.364
Coming close to what you thought you wanted

00:11:03.364 --> 00:11:06.090
can help you attain more than you ever dreamed

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.701
you could.

00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:10.575
It's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray

00:11:10.575 --> 00:11:12.590
was thinking when I saw her smiling

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.851
at those early paintings one day

00:11:14.851 --> 00:11:17.922
in the galleries.

00:11:17.922 --> 00:11:20.288
Even if we created utopias, I believe

00:11:20.288 --> 00:11:23.590
we would still have the incomplete.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.754
Completion is a goal,

00:11:25.754 --> 00:11:29.747
but we hope it is never the end.

00:11:29.747 --> 00:11:32.528
Thank you.

00:11:32.528 --> 00:11:36.384
(Applause)
