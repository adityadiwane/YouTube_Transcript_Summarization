00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:18.170
So imagine that a plane is about to crash

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.971
with 250 children and babies,

00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:24.390
and if you knew how to stop that, would you?

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.361
Now imagine

00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:30.000
that 60 planes full of babies under five

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.210
crash every single day.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.982
That's the number of kids

00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:37.307
that never make it to their fifth birthday.

00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:40.547
6.6 million children

00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:44.138
never make it to their fifth birthday.

00:00:44.138 --> 00:00:46.594
Most of these deaths are preventable,

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:48.562
and that doesn't just make me sad,

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:50.258
it makes me angry,

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.616
and it makes me determined.

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:54.506
Diarrhea and pneumonia

00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:56.322
are among the top two killers

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.640
of children under five,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.896
and what we can do to prevent these diseases

00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:03.076
isn't some smart,

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:05.993
new technological innovations.

00:01:05.993 --> 00:01:10.872
It's one of the world's oldest inventions:

00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:14.397
a bar of soap.

00:01:14.397 --> 00:01:15.829
Washing hands with soap,

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.200
a habit we all take for granted,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.484
can reduce diarrhea by half,

00:01:20.484 --> 00:01:24.140
can reduce respiratory infections by one third.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.911
Handwashing with soap

00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:27.560
can have an impact

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.587
on reducing flu, trachoma, SARS,

00:01:32.587 --> 00:01:34.977
and most recently in the case of cholera

00:01:34.977 --> 00:01:37.667
and Ebola outbreak,

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:39.358
one of the key interventions

00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:42.176
is handwashing with soap.

00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:45.431
Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school.

00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:48.254
It stops babies from dying.

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:50.127
Handwashing with soap

00:01:50.127 --> 00:01:52.924
is one of the most cost-effective

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:55.470
ways of saving children's lives.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.126
It can save over 600,000 children every year.

00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:02.090
That's the equivalent of stopping

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.070
10 jumbo jets

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.998
full of babies and children

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:08.709
from crashing every single day.

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.133
I think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:14.415
useful public health intervention.

00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:17.365
So now just take a minute.

00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:19.301
I think you need to get to
know the person next to you.

00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:21.249
Why don't you just shake their hands.

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.493
Please shake their hands.

00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:24.793
All right, get to know each other.

00:02:24.793 --> 00:02:26.328
They look really pretty.

00:02:26.328 --> 00:02:28.101
All right.

00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:30.399
So what if I told you

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.984
that the person whose hands you just shook

00:02:32.984 --> 00:02:34.692
actually didn't wash their hands

00:02:34.692 --> 00:02:37.350
when they were coming out of the toilet?
(Laughter)

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.680
They don't look so pretty anymore, right?

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.836
Pretty yucky, you would agree with me.

00:02:43.836 --> 00:02:45.501
Well, statistics are actually showing

00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:47.917
that four people out of five

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.525
don't wash their hands when
they come out of the toilet,

00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:52.213
globally.

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:54.483
And the same way,

00:02:54.483 --> 00:02:57.227
we don't do it when we've got fancy toilets,

00:02:57.227 --> 00:02:59.677
running water, and soap available,

00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:01.611
it's the same thing in the countries

00:03:01.611 --> 00:03:04.985
where child mortality is really high.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.299
What is it? Is there no soap?

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.548
Actually, soap is available.

00:03:09.548 --> 00:03:13.203
In 90 percent of households in India,

00:03:13.203 --> 00:03:15.883
94 percent of households in Kenya,

00:03:15.883 --> 00:03:17.363
you will find soap.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:21.200
Even in countries where soap is the lowest,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.779
like Ethiopia, we are at 50 percent.

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.006
So why is it?

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:28.939
Why aren't people washing their hands?

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.323
Why is it that Mayank,

00:03:31.323 --> 00:03:33.590
this young boy that I met in India,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.335
isn't washing his hands?

00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:37.947
Well, in Mayank's family,

00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:40.379
soap is used for bathing,

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.371
soap is used for laundry,

00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:45.240
soap is used for washing dishes.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.107
His parents think sometimes

00:03:47.107 --> 00:03:48.671
it's a precious commodity,

00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.938
so they'll keep it in a cupboard.

00:03:50.938 --> 00:03:53.692
They'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it.

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:56.242
On average, in Mayank's family,

00:03:56.242 --> 00:03:58.314
they will use soap for washing hands

00:03:58.314 --> 00:03:59.765
once a day

00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:02.130
at the very best, and sometimes

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.115
even once a week for washing hands with soap.

00:04:05.115 --> 00:04:07.330
What's the result of that?

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.195
Children pick up disease

00:04:09.195 --> 00:04:10.870
in the place that's supposed to love them

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.778
and protect them the most, in their homes.

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:18.326
Think about where you learned to wash your hands.

00:04:18.326 --> 00:04:21.130
Did you learn to wash your hands at home?

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.906
Did you learn to wash your hands in school?

00:04:23.906 --> 00:04:26.386
I think behavioral scientists will tell you

00:04:26.386 --> 00:04:28.925
that it's very difficult to change the habits

00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:33.810
that you have had early in life.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.607
However, we all copy what everyone else does,

00:04:36.607 --> 00:04:39.331
and local cultural norms are something

00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:42.642
that shape how we change our behavior,

00:04:42.642 --> 00:04:45.418
and this is where the private sector comes in.

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:49.218
Every second in Asia and Africa,

00:04:49.218 --> 00:04:52.140
111 mothers

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.858
will buy this bar to protect their family.

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:57.898
Many women in India will tell you

00:04:57.898 --> 00:05:00.124
they learned all about hygiene, diseases,

00:05:00.124 --> 00:05:03.870
from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.745
Iconic brands like this one

00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:07.633
have a responsibility to do good

00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:10.114
in the places where they sell their products.

00:05:10.114 --> 00:05:13.289
It's that belief, plus the scale of Unilever,

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.729
that allows us to keep talking about

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.545
handwashing with soap and
hygiene to these mothers.

00:05:19.545 --> 00:05:22.817
Big businesses and brands can change

00:05:22.817 --> 00:05:24.969
and shift those social norms

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:26.881
and make a difference for those habits

00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:29.061
that are so stubborn.

00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:30.319
Think about it:

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.824
Marketeers spend all their time

00:05:33.824 --> 00:05:38.180
making us switch from one brand to the other.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.170
And actually, they know how to transform

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.203
science and facts into compelling messages.

00:05:44.203 --> 00:05:46.099
Just for a minute, imagine

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.840
when they put all their forces behind

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.790
a message as powerful as handwashing with soap.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.749
The profit motive is transforming health outcomes

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:56.627
in this world.

00:05:56.627 --> 00:05:58.446
But it's been happening for centuries:

00:05:58.446 --> 00:06:01.979
the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.715
in Victorian England

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:05.987
to actually combat cholera.

00:06:05.987 --> 00:06:08.291
Last week, I was in Ghana

00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:09.830
with the minister of health,

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.049
because if you don't know,

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:13.706
there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:15.842
A hundred and eighteen years later,

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:17.762
the solution is exactly the same:

00:06:17.762 --> 00:06:20.258
It's about ensuring that they have access

00:06:20.258 --> 00:06:21.674
to this bar of soap,

00:06:21.674 --> 00:06:23.419
and that they're using it,

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.379
because that's the number one way

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:28.610
to actually stop cholera from spreading.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.010
I think this drive for profit

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.881
is extremely powerful,

00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:34.341
sometimes more powerful than

00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:37.636
the most committed charity or government.

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:39.438
Government is doing what they can,

00:06:39.438 --> 00:06:42.813
especially in terms of the pandemics

00:06:42.813 --> 00:06:45.350
and epidemics such as cholera,

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.805
or Ebola at the moment,

00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:49.345
but with competing priorities.

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:51.850
The budget is not always there.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.713
And when you think about this,

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:55.820
you think about what is required

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.141
to make handwashing a daily habit,

00:06:58.141 --> 00:07:01.962
it requires sustained funding

00:07:01.962 --> 00:07:05.070
to refine this behavior.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.503
In short, those that fight for public health

00:07:09.503 --> 00:07:12.267
are actually dependent upon the soap companies

00:07:12.267 --> 00:07:15.263
to keep promoting handwashing with soap.

00:07:15.263 --> 00:07:18.505
We have friends like USAID,

00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:21.810
the Global Public-Private Partnership
for Handwashing with Soap,

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.970
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.539
Plan, WaterAid,

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:27.046
that all believe

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:30.761
for a win-win-win partnership.

00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:32.746
Win for the public sector,

00:07:32.746 --> 00:07:35.821
because we help them reach their targets.

00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:38.209
Win for the private sector,

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:39.623
because we build new generations

00:07:39.623 --> 00:07:41.420
of future handwashers.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.633
And most importantly,

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:46.240
win for the most vulnerable.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.296
On October 15,

00:07:48.296 --> 00:07:50.648
we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day.

00:07:50.648 --> 00:07:52.368
Schools, communities,

00:07:52.368 --> 00:07:54.248
our friends in the public sector

00:07:54.248 --> 00:07:56.864
and our friends in the private sector —

00:07:56.864 --> 00:07:59.144
yes, on that day even our competitors,

00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:01.130
we all join hands to celebrate

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.112
the world's most important

00:08:03.112 --> 00:08:05.160
public health intervention.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.385
What's required,

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:09.121
and again where the private sector
can make a huge difference,

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:12.887
is coming up with this big, creative thinking

00:08:12.887 --> 00:08:15.128
that drives advocacy.

00:08:15.128 --> 00:08:17.791
If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign,

00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:20.770
we've created great films

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.856
that bring the message of handwashing with soap

00:08:22.856 --> 00:08:24.551
to the everyday person

00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:27.127
in a way that can relate to them.

00:08:27.127 --> 00:08:28.887
We've had over 30 million views.

00:08:28.887 --> 00:08:31.414
Most of these discussions are still happening online.

00:08:31.414 --> 00:08:32.886
I urge you to take five minutes

00:08:32.886 --> 00:08:36.943
and look at those films.

00:08:36.943 --> 00:08:38.472
I come from Mali,

00:08:38.472 --> 00:08:40.815
one of the world's poorest countries.

00:08:40.815 --> 00:08:43.551
I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation

00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:45.729
was around social justice.

00:08:45.729 --> 00:08:49.257
I trained in Europe's premier school of public health.

00:08:49.257 --> 00:08:50.985
I think I'm probably one of the only women

00:08:50.985 --> 00:08:54.426
in my country with this high degree in health,

00:08:54.426 --> 00:08:55.910
and the only one

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.512
with a doctorate in handwashing with soap.

00:08:59.512 --> 00:09:01.248
(Laughter)

00:09:01.248 --> 00:09:05.460
(Applause)

00:09:07.872 --> 00:09:10.223
Nine years ago, I decided,

00:09:10.223 --> 00:09:13.136
with a successful public health career in the making,

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:16.664
that I could make the biggest impact coming,

00:09:16.664 --> 00:09:19.695
selling and promoting the world's best invention

00:09:19.695 --> 00:09:22.230
in public health: soap.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.359
We run today the world's largest

00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:25.730
handwashing program

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.308
by any public health standards.

00:09:28.308 --> 00:09:31.780
We've reached over 183 million people

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.970
in 16 countries.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.806
My team and I have the ambition

00:09:36.806 --> 00:09:40.564
to reach one billion by 2020.

00:09:40.564 --> 00:09:42.758
Over the last four years,

00:09:42.758 --> 00:09:45.486
business has grown double digits,

00:09:45.486 --> 00:09:47.423
whilst child mortality has reduced

00:09:47.423 --> 00:09:51.845
in all the places where soap use has increased.

00:09:51.845 --> 00:09:54.150
It may be uncomfortable for some to hear —

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.405
business growth and lives saved

00:09:56.405 --> 00:09:59.918
somehow equated in the same sentence —

00:09:59.918 --> 00:10:01.837
but it is that business growth

00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:04.133
that allows us to keep doing more.

00:10:04.133 --> 00:10:06.877
Without it, and without talking about it,

00:10:06.877 --> 00:10:10.925
we cannot achieve the change that we need.

00:10:10.925 --> 00:10:13.110
Last week, my team and I

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.406
spent time visiting mothers

00:10:16.406 --> 00:10:18.917
that have all experienced the same thing:

00:10:18.917 --> 00:10:21.349
the death of a newborn.

00:10:21.349 --> 00:10:24.349
I'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful

00:10:24.349 --> 00:10:27.262
and more painful.

00:10:27.262 --> 00:10:29.894
This one is from Myanmar.

00:10:29.894 --> 00:10:31.900
She had the most beautiful smile,

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.110
the smile, I think, that life gives you

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.497
when you've had a second chance.

00:10:36.497 --> 00:10:39.831
Her son, Myo, is her second one.

00:10:39.831 --> 00:10:41.735
She had a daughter

00:10:41.735 --> 00:10:44.127
who passed away at three weeks,

00:10:44.127 --> 00:10:46.480
and we know that the majority

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.820
of children that actually die

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.686
die in the first month of their life,

00:10:49.686 --> 00:10:52.554
and we know that if we give a bar of soap

00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:54.814
to every skilled birth attendant,

00:10:54.814 --> 00:10:57.364
and that if soap is used 
before touching the babies,

00:10:57.364 --> 00:10:58.606
we can reduce and make a change

00:10:58.606 --> 00:11:00.650
in terms of those numbers.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.518
And that's what inspires me,

00:11:02.518 --> 00:11:04.750
inspires me to continue in this mission,

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.134
to know that I can equip her

00:11:07.134 --> 00:11:08.939
with what's needed

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:10.790
so that she can do

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.854
the most beautiful job in the world:

00:11:12.854 --> 00:11:14.980
nurturing her newborn.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.285
And next time you think of a gift

00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:19.375
for a new mom and her family,

00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:22.165
don't look far: buy her soap.

00:11:22.165 --> 00:11:25.373
It's the most beautiful invention in public health.

00:11:25.373 --> 00:11:27.749
I hope you will join us

00:11:27.749 --> 00:11:30.701
and make handwashing part of your daily lives

00:11:30.701 --> 00:11:32.405
and our daily lives

00:11:32.405 --> 00:11:34.629
and help more children like Myo

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:35.757
reach their fifth birthday.

00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:38.164
Thank you.

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:40.378
(Applause)
