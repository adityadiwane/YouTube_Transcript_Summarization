00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:15.467
I'm going to be talking
about statistics today.

00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:18.629
If that makes you immediately feel
a little bit wary, that's OK,

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:21.512
that doesn't make you some
kind of crazy conspiracy theorist,

00:00:21.536 --> 00:00:22.832
it makes you skeptical.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:26.742
And when it comes to numbers,
especially now, you should be skeptical.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.777
But you should also be able to tell
which numbers are reliable

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:30.961
and which ones aren't.

00:00:30.985 --> 00:00:34.191
So today I want to try to give you
some tools to be able to do that.

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:35.384
But before I do,

00:00:35.408 --> 00:00:38.247
I just want to clarify which numbers
I'm talking about here.

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:39.906
I'm not talking about claims like,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.379
"9 out of 10 women recommend
this anti-aging cream."

00:00:42.403 --> 00:00:45.375
I think a lot of us always
roll our eyes at numbers like that.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.383
What's different now is people
are questioning statistics like,

00:00:48.407 --> 00:00:50.421
"The US unemployment
rate is five percent."

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:53.961
What makes this claim different is
it doesn't come from a private company,

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:55.373
it comes from the government.

00:00:55.397 --> 00:00:58.733
About 4 out of 10 Americans
distrust the economic data

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.330
that gets reported by government.

00:01:00.354 --> 00:01:02.845
Among supporters of President Trump
it's even higher;

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:04.502
it's about 7 out of 10.

00:01:04.526 --> 00:01:06.330
I don't need to tell anyone here

00:01:06.354 --> 00:01:09.365
that there are a lot of dividing lines
in our society right now,

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:11.214
and a lot of them start to make sense,

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:14.925
once you understand people's relationships
with these government numbers.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:18.285
On the one hand, there are those who say
these statistics are crucial,

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:20.939
that we need them to make sense
of society as a whole

00:01:20.963 --> 00:01:23.127
in order to move beyond
emotional anecdotes

00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:25.561
and measure progress
in an [objective] way.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.052
And then there are the others,

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:29.232
who say that these statistics are elitist,

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.464
maybe even rigged;

00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:32.882
they don't make sense
and they don't really reflect

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:35.202
what's happening
in people's everyday lives.

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:38.713
It kind of feels like that second group
is winning the argument right now.

00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:40.845
We're living in a world
of alternative facts,

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.804
where people don't find statistics
this kind of common ground,

00:01:43.828 --> 00:01:45.464
this starting point for debate.

00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:46.774
This is a problem.

00:01:46.798 --> 00:01:48.865
There are actually
moves in the US right now

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:51.750
to get rid of some government
statistics altogether.

00:01:51.774 --> 00:01:55.161
Right now there's a bill in congress
about measuring racial inequality.

00:01:55.185 --> 00:01:57.986
The draft law says that government
money should not be used

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.912
to collect data on racial segregation.

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.821
This is a total disaster.

00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:03.593
If we don't have this data,

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:05.395
how can we observe discrimination,

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:06.697
let alone fix it?

00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:07.909
In other words:

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.992
How can a government create fair policies

00:02:10.016 --> 00:02:12.787
if they can't measure
current levels of unfairness?

00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:14.605
This isn't just about discrimination,

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.299
it's everything -- think about it.

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:18.013
How can we legislate on health care

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.308
if we don't have good data
on health or poverty?

00:02:20.332 --> 00:02:22.530
How can we have public debate
about immigration

00:02:22.554 --> 00:02:23.804
if we can't at least agree

00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:26.471
on how many people are entering
and leaving the country?

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:29.553
Statistics come from the state;
that's where they got their name.

00:02:29.577 --> 00:02:31.734
The point was to better
measure the population

00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:33.115
in order to better serve it.

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:34.864
So we need these government numbers,

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:37.535
but we also have to move
beyond either blindly accepting

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:38.827
or blindly rejecting them.

00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:41.848
We need to learn the skills
to be able to spot bad statistics.

00:02:41.872 --> 00:02:43.400
I started to learn some of these

00:02:43.424 --> 00:02:45.590
when I was working
in a statistical department

00:02:45.614 --> 00:02:47.257
that's part of the United Nations.

00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:50.687
Our job was to find out how many Iraqis
had been forced from their homes

00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:51.869
as a result of the war,

00:02:51.893 --> 00:02:53.051
and what they needed.

00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:56.253
It was really important work,
but it was also incredibly difficult.

00:02:56.277 --> 00:02:58.295
Every single day, we were making decisions

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.476
that affected the accuracy
of our numbers --

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.244
decisions like which parts
of the country we should go to,

00:03:03.268 --> 00:03:04.424
who we should speak to,

00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:06.016
which questions we should ask.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.720
And I started to feel
really disillusioned with our work,

00:03:08.744 --> 00:03:11.262
because we thought we were doing
a really good job,

00:03:11.286 --> 00:03:14.564
but the one group of people
who could really tell us were the Iraqis,

00:03:14.588 --> 00:03:18.128
and they rarely got the chance to find
our analysis, let alone question it.

00:03:18.152 --> 00:03:19.983
So I started to feel really determined

00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:22.318
that the one way to make
numbers more accurate

00:03:22.342 --> 00:03:25.395
is to have as many people as possible
be able to question them.

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:26.853
So I became a data journalist.

00:03:26.877 --> 00:03:30.781
My job is finding these data sets
and sharing them with the public.

00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:33.978
Anyone can do this,
you don't have to be a geek or a nerd.

00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:36.357
You can ignore those words;
they're used by people

00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:39.203
trying to say they're smart
while pretending they're humble.

00:03:39.227 --> 00:03:40.816
Absolutely anyone can do this.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.907
I want to give you guys three questions

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.936
that will help you be able to spot
some bad statistics.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.467
So, question number one
is: Can you see uncertainty?

00:03:49.491 --> 00:03:52.855
One of things that's really changed
people's relationship with numbers,

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.520
and even their trust in the media,

00:03:54.544 --> 00:03:56.802
has been the use of political polls.

00:03:56.826 --> 00:03:59.364
I personally have a lot of issues
with political polls

00:03:59.388 --> 00:04:02.764
because I think the role of journalists
is actually to report the facts

00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:04.341
and not attempt to predict them,

00:04:04.365 --> 00:04:07.361
especially when those predictions
can actually damage democracy

00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:10.117
by signaling to people:
don't bother to vote for that guy,

00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:11.346
he doesn't have a chance.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.024
Let's set that aside for now and talk
about the accuracy of this endeavor.

00:04:15.048 --> 00:04:19.656
Based on national elections
in the UK, Italy, Israel

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.444
and of course, the most recent
US presidential election,

00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:24.605
using polls to predict electoral outcomes

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.441
is about as accurate as using the moon
to predict hospital admissions.

00:04:28.465 --> 00:04:32.665
No, seriously, I used actual data
from an academic study to draw this.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.416
There are a lot of reasons why
polling has become so inaccurate.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.410
Our societies have become really diverse,

00:04:38.434 --> 00:04:42.255
which makes it difficult for pollsters
to get a really nice representative sample

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:43.906
of the population for their polls.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.936
People are really reluctant to answer
their phones to pollsters,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.236
and also, shockingly enough,
people might lie.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.071
But you wouldn't necessarily
know that to look at the media.

00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:54.856
For one thing, the probability
of a Hillary Clinton win

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.671
was communicated with decimal places.

00:04:57.695 --> 00:05:00.316
We don't use decimal places
to describe the temperature.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.568
How on earth can predicting the behavior
of 230 million voters in this country

00:05:04.592 --> 00:05:06.421
be that precise?

00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:08.447
And then there were those sleek charts.

00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:12.444
See, a lot of data visualizations
will overstate certainty, and it works --

00:05:12.468 --> 00:05:15.088
these charts can numb
our brains to criticism.

00:05:15.112 --> 00:05:17.670
When you hear a statistic,
you might feel skeptical.

00:05:17.694 --> 00:05:19.329
As soon as it's buried in a chart,

00:05:19.353 --> 00:05:21.482
it feels like some kind
of objective science,

00:05:21.506 --> 00:05:22.755
and it's not.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.882
So I was trying to find ways
to better communicate this to people,

00:05:25.906 --> 00:05:28.410
to show people the uncertainty
in our numbers.

00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:30.680
What I did was I started taking
real data sets,

00:05:30.704 --> 00:05:33.356
and turning them into
hand-drawn visualizations,

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.052
so that people can see
how imprecise the data is;

00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:38.072
so people can see that a human did this,

00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:40.068
a human found the data and visualized it.

00:05:40.092 --> 00:05:42.764
For example, instead
of finding out the probability

00:05:42.788 --> 00:05:44.914
of getting the flu in any given month,

00:05:44.938 --> 00:05:47.730
you can see the rough
distribution of flu season.

00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:48.921
This is --

00:05:48.945 --> 00:05:49.963
(Laughter)

00:05:49.987 --> 00:05:51.473
a bad shot to show in February.

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:53.952
But it's also more responsible
data visualization,

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:56.431
because if you were to show
the exact probabilities,

00:05:56.455 --> 00:05:59.047
maybe that would encourage
people to get their flu jabs

00:05:59.071 --> 00:06:00.527
at the wrong time.

00:06:00.983 --> 00:06:02.676
The point of these shaky lines

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.611
is so that people remember
these imprecisions,

00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:08.862
but also so they don't necessarily
walk away with a specific number,

00:06:08.886 --> 00:06:10.752
but they can remember important facts.

00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:14.800
Facts like injustice and inequality
leave a huge mark on our lives.

00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:19.013
Facts like Black Americans and Native
Americans have shorter life expectancies

00:06:19.037 --> 00:06:20.437
than those of other races,

00:06:20.461 --> 00:06:22.599
and that isn't changing anytime soon.

00:06:22.623 --> 00:06:26.524
Facts like prisoners in the US
can be kept in solitary confinement cells

00:06:26.548 --> 00:06:29.890
that are smaller than the size
of an average parking space.

00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:33.690
The point of these visualizations
is also to remind people

00:06:33.714 --> 00:06:36.064
of some really important
statistical concepts,

00:06:36.088 --> 00:06:37.724
concepts like averages.

00:06:37.748 --> 00:06:39.416
So let's say you hear a claim like,

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.874
"The average swimming pool in the US
contains 6.23 fecal accidents."

00:06:43.898 --> 00:06:46.695
That doesn't mean every single
swimming pool in the country

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:48.913
contains exactly 6.23 turds.

00:06:48.937 --> 00:06:50.354
So in order to show that,

00:06:50.378 --> 00:06:53.219
I went back to the original data,
which comes from the CDC,

00:06:53.243 --> 00:06:55.308
who surveyed 47 swimming facilities.

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.723
And I just spent one evening
redistributing poop.

00:06:57.747 --> 00:07:00.429
So you can kind of see
how misleading averages can be.

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:01.735
(Laughter)

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:05.660
OK, so the second question
that you guys should be asking yourselves

00:07:05.684 --> 00:07:07.185
to spot bad numbers is:

00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:09.176
Can I see myself in the data?

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.113
This question is also
about averages in a way,

00:07:12.137 --> 00:07:14.742
because part of the reason
why people are so frustrated

00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:16.261
with these national statistics,

00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:19.558
is they don't really tell the story
of who's winning and who's losing

00:07:19.582 --> 00:07:20.738
from national policy.

00:07:20.762 --> 00:07:24.080
It's easy to understand why people
are frustrated with global averages

00:07:24.104 --> 00:07:26.783
when they don't match up
with their personal experiences.

00:07:26.807 --> 00:07:30.070
I wanted to show people the way
data relates to their everyday lives.

00:07:30.094 --> 00:07:32.340
I started this advice column
called "Dear Mona,"

00:07:32.364 --> 00:07:35.090
where people would write to me
with questions and concerns

00:07:35.114 --> 00:07:36.898
and I'd try to answer them with data.

00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:38.122
People asked me anything.

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:41.407
questions like, "Is it normal to sleep
in a separate bed to my wife?"

00:07:41.431 --> 00:07:43.022
"Do people regret their tattoos?"

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:45.210
"What does it mean to die
of natural causes?"

00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:48.200
All of these questions are great,
because they make you think

00:07:48.224 --> 00:07:50.560
about ways to find
and communicate these numbers.

00:07:50.584 --> 00:07:53.087
If someone asks you,
"How much pee is a lot of pee?"

00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:55.569
which is a question that I got asked,

00:07:55.593 --> 00:07:58.573
you really want to make sure
that the visualization makes sense

00:07:58.597 --> 00:08:00.344
to as many people as possible.

00:08:00.368 --> 00:08:01.943
These numbers aren't unavailable.

00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:05.474
Sometimes they're just buried
in the appendix of an academic study.

00:08:05.498 --> 00:08:07.337
And they're certainly not inscrutable;

00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:10.336
if you really wanted to test
these numbers on urination volume,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.617
you could grab a bottle
and try it for yourself.

00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:13.649
(Laughter)

00:08:13.673 --> 00:08:15.367
The point of this isn't necessarily

00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:18.268
that every single data set
has to relate specifically to you.

00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:21.172
I'm interested in how many women
were issued fines in France

00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:23.155
for wearing the face veil, or the niqab,

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:25.797
even if I don't live in France
or wear the face veil.

00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:29.656
The point of asking where you fit in
is to get as much context as possible.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.871
So it's about zooming out
from one data point,

00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:33.999
like the unemployment rate
is five percent,

00:08:34.023 --> 00:08:35.780
and seeing how it changes over time,

00:08:35.804 --> 00:08:38.454
or seeing how it changes
by educational status --

00:08:38.478 --> 00:08:41.582
this is why your parents always
wanted you to go to college --

00:08:41.606 --> 00:08:43.638
or seeing how it varies by gender.

00:08:43.662 --> 00:08:45.789
Nowadays, male unemployment rate is higher

00:08:45.813 --> 00:08:47.513
than the female unemployment rate.

00:08:47.537 --> 00:08:50.232
Up until the early '80s,
it was the other way around.

00:08:50.256 --> 00:08:52.373
This is a story of one
of the biggest changes

00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:54.117
that's happened in American society,

00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:57.417
and it's all there in that chart,
once you look beyond the averages.

00:08:57.441 --> 00:08:58.606
The axes are everything;

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.299
once you change the scale,
you can change the story.

00:09:01.323 --> 00:09:04.703
OK, so the third and final question
that I want you guys to think about

00:09:04.727 --> 00:09:06.546
when you're looking at statistics is:

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.443
How was the data collected?

00:09:09.487 --> 00:09:12.426
So far, I've only talked about the way
data is communicated,

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.726
but the way it's collected
matters just as much.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.917
I know this is tough,

00:09:15.941 --> 00:09:19.022
because methodologies can be opaque
and actually kind of boring,

00:09:19.046 --> 00:09:21.919
but there are some simple steps
you can take to check this.

00:09:21.943 --> 00:09:23.782
I'll use one last example here.

00:09:24.129 --> 00:09:28.016
One poll found that 41 percent of Muslims
in this country support jihad,

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.565
which is obviously pretty scary,

00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:32.231
and it was reported everywhere in 2015.

00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:34.870
When I want to check a number like that,

00:09:34.894 --> 00:09:37.395
I'll start off by finding
the original questionnaire.

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:40.345
It turns out that journalists
who reported on that statistic

00:09:40.369 --> 00:09:42.600
ignored a question
lower down on the survey

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.970
that asked respondents
how they defined "jihad."

00:09:44.994 --> 00:09:46.975
And most of them defined it as,

00:09:46.999 --> 00:09:50.941
"Muslims' personal, peaceful struggle
to be more religious."

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:55.159
Only 16 percent defined it as,
"violent holy war against unbelievers."

00:09:55.183 --> 00:09:57.613
This is the really important point:

00:09:57.637 --> 00:09:59.792
based on those numbers,
it's totally possible

00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:02.921
that no one in the survey
who defined it as violent holy war

00:10:02.945 --> 00:10:04.277
also said they support it.

00:10:04.301 --> 00:10:06.509
Those two groups might not overlap at all.

00:10:06.942 --> 00:10:09.579
It's also worth asking
how the survey was carried out.

00:10:09.603 --> 00:10:11.601
This was something called an opt-in poll,

00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:15.027
which means anyone could have found it
on the internet and completed it.

00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:18.390
There's no way of knowing
if those people even identified as Muslim.

00:10:18.414 --> 00:10:21.026
And finally, there were 600
respondents in that poll.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.704
There are roughly three million
Muslims in this country,

00:10:23.728 --> 00:10:25.335
according to Pew Research Center.

00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:28.352
That means the poll spoke to roughly
one in every 5,000 Muslims

00:10:28.376 --> 00:10:29.544
in this country.

00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:30.834
This is one of the reasons

00:10:30.858 --> 00:10:34.465
why government statistics
are often better than private statistics.

00:10:34.489 --> 00:10:37.524
A poll might speak to a couple
hundred people, maybe a thousand,

00:10:37.548 --> 00:10:40.606
or if you're L'Oreal, trying to sell
skin care products in 2005,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.047
then you spoke to 48 women
to claim that they work.

00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:44.097
(Laughter)

00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:47.677
Private companies don't have a huge
interest in getting the numbers right,

00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:49.456
they just need the right numbers.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.500
Government statisticians aren't like that.

00:10:51.524 --> 00:10:53.971
In theory, at least,
they're totally impartial,

00:10:53.995 --> 00:10:57.496
not least because most of them do
their jobs regardless of who's in power.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.682
They're civil servants.

00:10:58.706 --> 00:11:00.670
And to do their jobs properly,

00:11:00.694 --> 00:11:03.057
they don't just speak
to a couple hundred people.

00:11:03.081 --> 00:11:05.399
Those unemployment numbers
I keep on referencing

00:11:05.423 --> 00:11:07.427
come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,

00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:08.786
and to make their estimates,

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.299
they speak to over 140,000
businesses in this country.

00:11:12.323 --> 00:11:14.048
I get it, it's frustrating.

00:11:14.072 --> 00:11:17.187
If you want to test a statistic
that comes from a private company,

00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:20.572
you can buy the face cream for you
and a bunch of friends, test it out,

00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:23.187
if it doesn't work,
you can say the numbers were wrong.

00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:25.357
But how do you question
government statistics?

00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.011
You just keep checking everything.

00:11:27.035 --> 00:11:28.948
Find out how they collected the numbers.

00:11:28.972 --> 00:11:32.097
Find out if you're seeing everything
on the chart you need to see.

00:11:32.121 --> 00:11:35.086
But don't give up on the numbers
altogether, because if you do,

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.549
we'll be making public policy
decisions in the dark,

00:11:37.573 --> 00:11:39.835
using nothing but private
interests to guide us.

00:11:39.859 --> 00:11:41.025
Thank you.

00:11:41.049 --> 00:11:43.510
(Applause)
