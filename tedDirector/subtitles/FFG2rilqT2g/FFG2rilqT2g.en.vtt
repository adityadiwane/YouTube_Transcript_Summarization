00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:20.237
George and Charlotte Blonsky, who were

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:23.609
a married couple living in
the Bronx in New York City,

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.854
invented something.

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:28.833
They got a patent in
1965 for what they call,

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:34.508
"a device to assist women in giving birth."

00:00:34.508 --> 00:00:38.438
This device consists of a large, round table

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.191
and some machinery.

00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:43.400
When the woman is ready to deliver her child,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.801
she lies on her back,

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:47.232
she is strapped down to the table,

00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:50.311
and the table is rotated at high speed.

00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:53.736
The child comes flying out

00:00:53.736 --> 00:01:00.767
through centrifugal force.

00:01:01.717 --> 00:01:06.246
If you look at their patent carefully,

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:10.115
especially if you have any
engineering background or talent,

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:11.574
you may decide that you see

00:01:11.574 --> 00:01:18.261
one or two points where the design is 
not perfectly adequate. (Laughter)

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:21.030
Doctor Ivan Schwab in California

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.984
is one of the people, 
one of the main people,

00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:24.570
who helped answer the question,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.281
"Why don't woodpeckers get headaches?"

00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:31.498
And it turns out the answer to that

00:01:31.498 --> 00:01:33.722
is because their brains

00:01:33.722 --> 00:01:35.493
are packaged inside their skulls

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:37.993
in a way different from the way

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:40.497
our brains, we being human beings,

00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:44.456
true, have our brains packaged.

00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:46.839
They, the woodpeckers, typically

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:49.027
will peck, they will bang their head

00:01:49.027 --> 00:01:54.318
on a piece of wood thousands 
of times every day. Every day!

00:01:54.318 --> 00:01:56.231
And as far as anyone knows,

00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:57.437
that doesn't bother them in the slightest.

00:01:57.437 --> 00:01:59.703
How does this happen?

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:02.629
Their brain does not slosh around like ours does.

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:05.341
Their brain is packed in very tightly,

00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:08.197
at least for blows coming 
right from the front.

00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:10.140
Not too many people paid attention

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.224
to this research until
the last few years

00:02:13.224 --> 00:02:15.839
when, in this country especially,

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.227
people are becoming curious about

00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:19.422
what happens to the brains
of football players

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:22.150
who bang their heads repeatedly.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.218
And the woodpecker maybe relates to that.

00:02:27.218 --> 00:02:29.311
There was a paper published

00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:31.056
in the medical journal The Lancet

00:02:31.056 --> 00:02:32.486
in England a few years ago called

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:39.903
" A man who pricked his finger
and smelled putrid for 5 years."

00:02:39.903 --> 00:02:41.711
Dr. Caroline Mills and her team

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:45.810
received this patient and didn't 
really know what to do about it.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.670
The man had cut his finger,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.143
he worked processing chickens,

00:02:51.143 --> 00:02:53.579
and then he started to
smell really, really bad.

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.798
So bad that when 
he got in a room

00:02:54.798 --> 00:02:56.115
with the doctors and the nurses,

00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:58.874
they couldn't stand being 
in the room with him.

00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:00.675
It was intolerable.

00:03:00.675 --> 00:03:02.174
They tried every drug,

00:03:02.174 --> 00:03:03.992
every other treatment
they could think of.

00:03:03.992 --> 00:03:06.223
After a year, he still 
smelled putrid.

00:03:06.223 --> 00:03:08.032
After two years, still smelled putrid.

00:03:08.032 --> 00:03:11.262
Three years, four years,
still smelled putrid.

00:03:11.262 --> 00:03:14.299
After five years, it went away on its own.

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.998
It's a mystery.

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:20.347
In New Zealand, Dr. Lianne Parkin

00:03:20.347 --> 00:03:25.909
and her team tested an old 
tradition in her city.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.636
They live in a city that has huge hills,

00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:30.255
San Francisco-grade hills.

00:03:30.255 --> 00:03:32.372
And in the winter there,
it gets very cold

00:03:32.372 --> 00:03:33.556
and very icy.

00:03:33.556 --> 00:03:35.150
There are lots of injuries.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.415
The tradition that they tested,

00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:39.047
they tested by asking people

00:03:39.047 --> 00:03:41.446
who were on their way to 
work in the morning,

00:03:41.446 --> 00:03:43.389
to stop and try something out.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.392
Try one of two conditions.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.145
The tradition is that in the winter,

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:52.861
in that city, you wear your socks
on the outside of your boots.

00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:56.260
And what they discovered by experiment,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.429
and it was quite graphic when they saw it,

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:59.844
was that it's true.

00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:03.163
That if you wear your socks on the 
outside rather than the inside,

00:04:03.163 --> 00:04:08.516
you're much more likely 
to survive and not slip and fall.

00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:13.894
Now, I hope you will agree
with me that these things

00:04:13.894 --> 00:04:16.109
I've just described to you,

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.289
each of them, deserves some kind of prize.
(Laughter)

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.924
And that's what they got,

00:04:23.924 --> 00:04:27.199
each of them got an Ig Nobel prize.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.191
In 1991, I, together with bunch of other people,

00:04:31.191 --> 00:04:34.094
started the Ig Nobel prize ceremony.

00:04:34.094 --> 00:04:37.026
Every year we give out 10 prizes.

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:44.009
The prizes are based on just 
one criteria. It's very simple.

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.993
It's that you've done something that 
makes people laugh and then think.

00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:53.837
What you've done makes 
people laugh and then think.

00:04:58.582 --> 00:05:01.893
their only possible reaction is to laugh.

00:05:01.893 --> 00:05:03.816
And then a week later,

00:05:03.816 --> 00:05:05.507
it's still rattling around in their heads

00:05:05.507 --> 00:05:08.267
and all they want to do 
is tell their friends about it.

00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:10.465
That's the quality we look for.

00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:13.250
Every year, we get in the neighborhood

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.692
of 9,000 new nominations 
for the Ig Nobel prize.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:20.521
Of those, consistently between 10 percent

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:23.004
and 20 percent of those nominations

00:05:23.004 --> 00:05:26.914
are people who nominate themselves.

00:05:26.914 --> 00:05:30.881
Those self-nominees almost never win.

00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:35.200
It's very difficult, numerically, 
to win a prize if you want to.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.045
Even if you don't want to,

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.761
it's very difficult numerically.

00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:43.411
You should know that when 
we choose somebody

00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:44.683
to win an Ig Nobel prize,

00:05:44.683 --> 00:05:48.259
We get in touch with that person, very quietly.

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.820
We offer them the chance to decline

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.202
this great honor if they want to.

00:05:54.202 --> 00:05:57.526
Happily for us, almost everyone 
who's offered a prize

00:05:57.526 --> 00:06:01.035
decides to accept.

00:06:01.035 --> 00:06:03.976
What do you get if you
win an Ig Nobel prize?

00:06:03.976 --> 00:06:05.553
Well, you get several things.

00:06:05.553 --> 00:06:09.083
You get an Ig Nobel prize.

00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:11.414
The design is different every year.

00:06:11.414 --> 00:06:16.220
These are always handmade
from extremely cheap materials.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.881
You're looking at a picture

00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:21.910
of the prize we gave last year, 2013.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.946
Most prizes in the world also give

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:28.644
their winners some cash, some money.

00:06:28.644 --> 00:06:29.707
We don't have any money,

00:06:29.707 --> 00:06:31.218
so we can't give them.

00:06:31.218 --> 00:06:34.094
In fact, the winners have to
pay their own way

00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:36.898
to come to the Ig Nobel ceremony,

00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:38.761
which most of them do.

00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:41.754
Last year, though, we did manage
to scrape up some money.

00:06:41.754 --> 00:06:46.265
Last year, each of the 10
Ig Nobel prize winners

00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:52.043
received from us 10 trillion dollars.

00:06:52.043 --> 00:06:57.476
A $10 trillion bill from Zimbabwe. (Laughter)

00:06:57.476 --> 00:07:00.300
You may remember that 
Zimbabwe had a little adventure

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.895
for a few years there of inflation.

00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:04.515
They ended up printing bills

00:07:04.515 --> 00:07:08.371
that were in denominations as
large as 100 trillion dollars.

00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:11.156
The man responsible, who runs
the national bank there, by the way,

00:07:11.156 --> 00:07:13.929
won an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics.

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:15.681
The other thing you win is an invitation

00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:17.184
to come to the ceremony,

00:07:17.184 --> 00:07:18.926
which happens at Harvard University.

00:07:18.926 --> 00:07:20.061
And when you get there,

00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:22.778
you come to Harvard's biggest 
meeting place and classroom.

00:07:22.778 --> 00:07:24.063
It fits 1,100 people,

00:07:24.063 --> 00:07:25.189
it's jammed to the gills,

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:26.020
and up on the stage,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.814
waiting to shake your hand,

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:30.086
waiting to hand you your Ig Nobel prize,

00:07:30.086 --> 00:07:32.735
are a bunch of Nobel prize winners.

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:34.034
That's the heart of the ceremony.

00:07:34.034 --> 00:07:36.184
The winners are kept secret until that moment,

00:07:36.184 --> 00:07:38.611
even the Nobel laureates 
who will shake their hand

00:07:38.611 --> 00:07:41.854
don't know who they are
until they're announced.

00:07:41.854 --> 00:07:44.974
I am going to tell you 
about just a very few

00:07:44.974 --> 00:07:48.028
of the other medical-related prizes we've given.

00:07:48.028 --> 00:07:50.284
Keep in mind, we've given 230 prizes. 

00:07:50.284 --> 00:07:52.578
There are lots of these people
who walk among you.

00:07:52.578 --> 00:07:54.698
Maybe you have one.

00:07:54.698 --> 00:07:56.842
A paper was published about 30 years ago

00:07:56.842 --> 00:07:59.352
called "Injuries due to Falling Coconuts."

00:07:59.352 --> 00:08:01.307
It was written by Dr. Peter Barss,

00:08:01.307 --> 00:08:03.518
who is Canadian.

00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:05.704
Dr. Barss came to the ceremony

00:08:05.704 --> 00:08:07.571
and explained that as a young doctor,

00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:09.052
he wanted to see the world.

00:08:09.052 --> 00:08:11.341
So he went to Papua New Guinea.

00:08:11.341 --> 00:08:13.680
When he got there, he went to work
in a hospital, and he was curious

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.195
what kinds of things happen to people
that bring them to the hospital.

00:08:19.195 --> 00:08:20.493
He looked through the 
records, and he discovered

00:08:20.493 --> 00:08:23.283
that a surprisingly large number of people

00:08:23.283 --> 00:08:24.449
in that hospital were there

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:27.996
because of injuries due to falling coconuts.

00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:29.782
One typical thing that happens is

00:08:29.782 --> 00:08:33.581
people will come from the highlands,
where there are not many coconut trees,

00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:35.829
down to visit their relatives on the coast,

00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:37.289
where there are lots.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:38.679
And they'll think that a coconut tree

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.348
is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down.

00:08:41.348 --> 00:08:43.955
A coconut tree that is 90 feet tall,

00:08:43.955 --> 00:08:46.178
and has coconuts that weigh two pounds

00:08:46.178 --> 00:08:50.230
that can drop off at any time.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.023
A team of doctors in Europe

00:08:52.023 --> 00:08:55.532
published a series of papers
about colonoscopies.

00:08:55.532 --> 00:08:57.562
You're all familiar with colonoscopies,

00:08:57.562 --> 00:08:58.854
one way or another.

00:08:58.854 --> 00:09:00.169
Or in some cases,

00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:03.674
one way and another.

00:09:03.674 --> 00:09:07.023
They, in these papers,

00:09:07.023 --> 00:09:11.191
explained to their fellow doctors
who perform colonoscopies,

00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:13.162
how to minimize the chance

00:09:13.162 --> 00:09:15.823
that when you perform a colonoscopy,

00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:19.413
your patient will explode. (Laughter)

00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:21.373
Dr. Emmanuel Ben-Soussan

00:09:21.373 --> 00:09:22.547
one of the authors,

00:09:22.547 --> 00:09:25.706
flew in from Paris to the ceremony,

00:09:25.706 --> 00:09:27.597
where he explained the history of this,

00:09:27.597 --> 00:09:28.773
that in the 1950s,

00:09:28.773 --> 00:09:34.101
when colonoscopies were becoming
a common technique for the first time,

00:09:34.101 --> 00:09:36.740
people were figuring out how to do it well.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.500
And there were some difficulties at first.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.471
The basic problem, I'm sure you're familiar with,

00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:48.800
that you're looking inside a 
long, narrow, dark place.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.355
And so, you want to have a larger space.

00:09:52.355 --> 00:09:54.486
You add some gas to inflate it

00:09:54.486 --> 00:09:56.400
so you have room to look around.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.127
Now, that's added to the 
gas, the methane gas,

00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:00.635
that's already inside.

00:10:00.635 --> 00:10:03.635
The gas that they used at first,
in many cases, was oxygen.

00:10:03.635 --> 00:10:06.084
So they added oxygen to methane gas.

00:10:06.084 --> 00:10:07.799
And then they wanted to be able to see,

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:09.047
they needed light,

00:10:09.047 --> 00:10:10.452
so they'd put in a light source,

00:10:10.452 --> 00:10:12.228
which in the 1950s was very hot.

00:10:12.228 --> 00:10:15.546
So you had methane gas, which is flammable,

00:10:15.546 --> 00:10:18.338
oxygen and heat.

00:10:18.338 --> 00:10:23.476
They stopped using oxygen pretty quickly.
(Laughter)

00:10:23.476 --> 00:10:25.997
Now it's rare that patients will explode,

00:10:25.997 --> 00:10:31.736
but it does still happen.

00:10:31.736 --> 00:10:35.311
The final thing that I want 
to tell you about is a prize

00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:37.742
we gave to Dr. Elena Bodnar.

00:10:37.742 --> 00:10:41.867
Dr. Elena Bodnar invented a brassiere

00:10:41.867 --> 00:10:43.425
that in an emergency

00:10:43.425 --> 00:10:44.618
can be quickly separated 

00:10:44.618 --> 00:10:48.137
into a pair of protective face masks.

00:10:48.137 --> 00:10:49.904
One to save your life,

00:10:49.904 --> 00:10:55.228
one to save the life of some 
lucky bystander. (Laughter)

00:10:55.228 --> 00:10:58.255
Why would someone do this, you might wonder.

00:10:58.255 --> 00:11:00.387
Dr. Bodnar came to the ceremony

00:11:00.387 --> 00:11:03.348
and she explained that 
she grew up in Ukraine.

00:11:03.348 --> 00:11:05.064
She was one of the doctors who treated victims

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.108
of the Chernobyl power plant meltdown.

00:11:07.108 --> 00:11:09.692
And they later discovered that

00:11:09.692 --> 00:11:11.617
a lot of the worst medical problems

00:11:11.617 --> 00:11:13.739
came from the particles people breathed in.

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.667
So she was always thinking after that

00:11:15.667 --> 00:11:17.294
about could there be some simple mask

00:11:17.294 --> 00:11:21.990
that was available everywhere
when the unexpected happens.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.603
Years later, she moved to America.

00:11:23.603 --> 00:11:24.447
She had a baby,

00:11:24.447 --> 00:11:26.203
One day she looked, and on the floor,

00:11:26.203 --> 00:11:29.274
her infant son had picked up her bra,

00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:31.133
and had her bra on his face.

00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:32.814
And that's where the idea came from.

00:11:32.814 --> 00:11:34.817
She came to the Ig Nobel ceremony

00:11:34.817 --> 00:11:37.157
with the first prototype of the bra

00:11:37.157 --> 00:11:41.511
and she demonstrated:

00:11:41.511 --> 00:12:05.275
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:10.265 --> 00:12:18.694

00:12:55.663 --> 00:12:59.283
I myself own an emergency bra. (Laughter)

00:12:59.283 --> 00:13:01.621
It's my favorite bra,

00:13:01.621 --> 00:13:04.273
but I would be happy to 
share it with any of you,

00:13:04.273 --> 00:13:06.122
should the need arise.

00:13:06.122 --> 00:13:07.078
Thank you.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:12.075
(Applause)
