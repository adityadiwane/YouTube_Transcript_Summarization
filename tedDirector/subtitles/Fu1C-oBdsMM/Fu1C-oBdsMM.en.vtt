00:00:13.643 --> 00:00:14.782
All right, so let's take

00:00:14.782 --> 00:00:17.122
four subjects that obviously go together:

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:21.851
big data, tattoos, immortality and the Greeks.

00:00:21.851 --> 00:00:22.681
Right?

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:26.100
Now, the issue about tattoos is that,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.305
without a word, tattoos really do shout.

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:34.365
[Beautiful]

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:36.263
[Intriguing]

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:39.578
So you don't have to say a lot.

00:00:39.578 --> 00:00:43.245
[Allegiance]

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:47.648
[Very intimate]

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:50.273
[Serious mistakes]

00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:53.361
(Laughter)

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:58.218
And tattoos tell you a lot of stories.

00:00:58.218 --> 00:00:59.963
If I can ask an indiscreet question,

00:00:59.963 --> 00:01:03.439
how many of you have tattoos?

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:04.946
A few, but not most.

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:07.733
What happens if Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn,

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.631
cell phones, GPS, Foursquare, Yelp, Travel Advisor,

00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:13.391
all these things you deal with every day

00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.751
turn out to be electronic tattoos?

00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:17.373
And what if they provide as much information

00:01:17.373 --> 00:01:22.350
about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would?

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.536
What's ended up happening over the past few decades

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:27.642
is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:30.321
or as a great celebrity

00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:33.042
is now being applied to you every day by all these people

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:36.029
who are Tweeting, blogging, following you,

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:40.349
watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself.

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:44.763
And electronic tattoos also shout.

00:01:44.763 --> 00:01:47.107
And as you're thinking of the consequences of that,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.043
it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff, among other things,

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.822
because it's not just the electronic tattoos,

00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:56.894
it's facial recognition that's getting really good.

00:01:56.894 --> 00:02:00.692
So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names,

00:02:00.692 --> 00:02:04.749
although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes. (Laughter)

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.758
But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this,

00:02:07.758 --> 00:02:11.766
take a picture, say, of this guy right here,

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:15.430
get the name, and download all the records

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.049
before you utter a word or speak to somebody,

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.425
because everybody turns out to be

00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:24.026
absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos.

00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:26.518
And so there's companies like face.com that now have

00:02:26.518 --> 00:02:30.302
about 18 billion faces online.

00:02:30.302 --> 00:02:31.891
Here's what happened to this company.

00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:34.554
[Company sold to Facebook, June 18, 2012...]

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:37.207
There are other companies that will place a camera

00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:39.630
like this — this has nothing to do with Facebook —

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.942
they take your picture, they tie it to the social media,

00:02:41.942 --> 00:02:44.069
they figure out you really like to wear black dresses,

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.505
so maybe the person in the store comes up and says,

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:48.805
"Hey, we've got five black dresses

00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:52.038
that would just look great on you."

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.158
So what if Andy was wrong?

00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:55.428
Here's Andy's theory.

00:02:55.428 --> 00:02:57.272
[In the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes.]

00:02:57.272 --> 00:02:58.378
What if we flip this?

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:03.059
What if you're only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes? (Laughter)

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.075
Well, then, because of electronic tattoos,

00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:10.736
maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality,

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:12.314
because these tattoos will live

00:03:12.314 --> 00:03:15.091
far longer than our bodies will.

00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:16.982
And if that's true, then what we want to do

00:03:16.982 --> 00:03:20.391
is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks

00:03:20.391 --> 00:03:23.700
and one lesson from a Latin American.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.523
Why the Greeks?

00:03:25.523 --> 00:03:27.380
Well, the Greeks thought about what happens

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.338
when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time.

00:03:32.338 --> 00:03:35.018
So lesson number one: Sisyphus.

00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:38.044
Remember? He did a horrible thing, condemned for all time

00:03:38.044 --> 00:03:40.427
to roll this rock up, it would roll back down,

00:03:40.427 --> 00:03:42.400
roll back up, roll back down.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.803
It's a little like your reputation.

00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:46.238
Once you get that electronic tattoo,

00:03:46.238 --> 00:03:49.166
you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time,

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:51.474
so as you go through this stuff,

00:03:51.474 --> 00:03:54.559
just be careful what you post.

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:57.938
Myth number two: Orpheus, wonderful guy,

00:03:57.938 --> 00:04:01.666
charming to be around, great partier, great singer,

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:04.883
loses his beloved, charms his way into the underworld,

00:04:04.883 --> 00:04:07.490
only person to charm his way into the underworld,

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.835
charms the gods of the underworld,

00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:12.730
they release his beauty on the condition

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.842
he never look at her until they're out.

00:04:15.842 --> 00:04:17.681
So he's walking out and walking out and walking out

00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:21.939
and he just can't resist. He looks at her, loses her forever.

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.773
With all this data out here, it might be a good idea

00:04:24.773 --> 00:04:30.521
not to look too far into the past of those you love.

00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:33.362
Lesson number three: Atalanta.

00:04:33.362 --> 00:04:37.811
Greatest runner. She would challenge anybody.

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.221
If you won, she would marry you.

00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:43.146
If you lost, you died.

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:45.490
How did Hippomenes beat her?

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.416
Well, he had all these wonderful little golden apples,

00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:50.034
and she'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.

00:04:50.034 --> 00:04:52.038
She'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.

00:04:52.038 --> 00:04:56.284
She kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race.

00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:59.514
Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples

00:04:59.514 --> 00:05:02.086
come and reach you and you want to post about them

00:05:02.086 --> 00:05:05.922
or tweet about them or send a late-night message.

00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:09.170
And then, of course, there's Narcissus.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.717
Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus.

00:05:12.717 --> 00:05:15.013
(Laughter)

00:05:15.013 --> 00:05:17.581
But as you're thinking about Narcissus,

00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:21.661
just don't fall in love with your own reflection.

00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:23.452
Last lesson, from a Latin American:

00:05:23.452 --> 00:05:26.213
This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges.

00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:27.402
When he was threatened by the thugs

00:05:27.402 --> 00:05:30.035
of the Argentine military junta,

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:32.288
he came back and said, "Oh, come on,

00:05:32.288 --> 00:05:35.733
how else can you threaten, other than with death?"

00:05:35.733 --> 00:05:38.853
The interesting thing, the original thing,

00:05:38.853 --> 00:05:42.045
would be to threaten somebody with immortality.

00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:43.505
And that, of course, is what we are all

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:47.681
now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:48.766
Thank you.

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:52.497
(Applause)
