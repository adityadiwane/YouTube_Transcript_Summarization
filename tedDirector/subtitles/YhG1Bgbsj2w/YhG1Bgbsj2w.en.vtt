00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Namaste. Good morning.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I'm very happy to be here in India.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
over these last particularly 11 years

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
with V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues,"

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
traveling the world,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
to stop violence against women.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
What I want to talk about today

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
is this particular cell,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And I want to call it the girl cell.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And it's in men as well as in women.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.260
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
is central to the evolution of our species

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and the continuation of the human race.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And I want you imagine that at some point in history

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.260
a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.260
understood that the suppression of this particular cell,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
the oppression of these cells,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
the reinterpretation of these cells,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
the undermining of these cells,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and the crushing, eradicating, destroying,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
reducing these cells,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
basically began the process of killing off the girl cell,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
which was, by the way, patriarchy.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And it is essential to balance, to wisdom

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and to actually the future of all of us.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260
is compassion,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and it's empathy, and it's passion itself,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and it's vulnerability,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and it's openness, and it's intensity,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and it's association, and it's relationship,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and it is intuitive.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and that vulnerability is our greatest strength,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and that emotions have inherent logic,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And then let's remember that we've been taught

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
the exact opposite by the powers that be,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
that compassion clouds your thinking,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
that it gets in the way,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
that vulnerability is weakness,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
that emotions are not to be trusted,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and you're not supposed to take things personally,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
which is one of my favorites.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
I think the whole world has essentially

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
been brought up not to be a girl.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
How do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
To be a boy really means not to be a girl.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
To be a man means not to be a girl.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
To be a woman means not to be a girl.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
To be strong means not to be a girl.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
To be a leader means not to be a girl.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
I actually think that

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
being a girl is so powerful

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
that we've had to train everyone not to be that.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.260
(Laughter)

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And I'd also like to say that the irony

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
of course, is that denying girl,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
suppressing girl, suppressing emotion,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
refusing feeling has lead thus here.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Where we have now come to live in a world where

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
the most extreme forms of violence,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
the most horrific poverty,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
genocide, mass rapes,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
the destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And because we have suppressed our girl cells

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and suppressed our girl-ship,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
we do not feel what is going on.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
So, we are not being charged with

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
the adequate response to what is happening.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
I want to talk a little bit about

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
For me, it was the turning point of my life.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
a lot of violence.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
But the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.260
really was the turning point in my soul.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
I went and I spent time

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
in a place called Bukavu

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
In the Congo, for those of you who don't know,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
there has been a war raging for the last 12 years,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
a war that has killed nearly six million people.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.260
It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
have been raped there.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
I sat with women

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
Their stories were so horrific,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.260
that to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And I will tell you that what happened

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
is through that shattering,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.260
listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
so they had holes, literally, inside them

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
where their pee and poop came out of them.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Listening to the story of 80-year-old women

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
who were tied to chains and circled,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
all in the name of economic exploitation

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.260
to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
My mind was so shattered.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.260
But what happened for me is that that shattering

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
actually emboldened me

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
in a way I have never been emboldened.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
That shattering, that opening of my girl cell,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.260
that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
allowed me to become more courageous, and braver,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and actually more clever

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
than I had been in the past in my life.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
I want to say that I think the powers that be

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
know that empire-building

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.260
is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and excavating the Earth, and destroying things.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
I remember, for example, when my father,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
who was very, very violent, used to beat me.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
And he would actually say, while he was beating me,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
"Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry."

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.260
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
of what he was doing.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.260
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And I think in some ways

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
we've been much harsher to men

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
in the annihilation of their girl cell.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.260
(Applause)

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.260
I see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet:

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
to be tough, to be hardened,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.260
to distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
I actually realized once in Kosovo,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
when I watched a man break down,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
that bullets are actually hardened tears,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.260
that when we don't allow men to have their girl self

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
and have their vulnerability, and have their compassion,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and violent.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
And I think we have taught men to be secure

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
when they are insecure,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
to pretend they know things when they don't know things,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
or why would we be where we are?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
And I will tell you a very funny story.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
On my way here on the airplane, I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And all these men, literally at least 10 men,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
were in their little seats watching chick flicks.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
And they were all alone, and I thought, "This is the secret life of men."

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.260
(Laughter)

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
I've traveled, as I said,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
to many, many countries,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and I've seen, if we do what we do to the girl inside us

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
then obviously it's horrific to think

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
what we do to girls in the world.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
And we heard from Sunitha yesterday,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
and Kavita about what we do to girls.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
But I just want to say that

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
who are literally being treated like ashtrays.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and brothers and fathers and uncles.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
I've seen that we cut girls and we control them

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and we keep them illiterate,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
or we make them feel bad about being too smart.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
We silence them. We make them feel guilty

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
for being smart. We get them to behave,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
to tone it down, not to be too intense.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
We sell them, we kill them as embryos,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
we enslave them, we rape them.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
We are so accustomed to robbing girls

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
of the subject of being the subjects of their lives

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
that we have now actually objectified them

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and turned them into commodities.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
The selling of girls is rampant across the planet.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.260
And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
But I also want to talk about the fact that

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
if one in eight people on the planet

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
are girls between the ages of 10 to 24,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
they are they key, really, in the developing world,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
that keep them where society wants them to be,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
including lack of access to healthcare,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
education, healthy foods,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
labor force participation.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
The burden of all the household tasks

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
usually falls on girls and younger siblings,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
The state of girls, the condition of girls,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
will, in my belief -- and that's the girl inside us

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
and the girl in the world -- determine whether

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
the species survives.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
And what I want to suggest is that,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
having talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
"I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World,"

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
I've been talking to girls for five years,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
is that the verb that's been enforced on girl

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
is the verb "to please."

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Girls are trained to please.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
I want to change the verb.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
I want us all to change the verb.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
I want the verb to be "educate,"

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
or "activate," or "engage,"

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
or "confront," or "defy," or "create."

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
If we teach girls to change the verb

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
we will actually enforce the girl inside us

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
and the girl inside them.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
And I have to now share a few stories

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
of girls I've seen across the planet

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
who have engaged their girl,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
who have taken on their girl in spite of

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
all the circumstances around them.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
I know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.260
for example, who is demanding that she take a boat

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
and go around the entire world by herself.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
There is a teenage girl who just recently

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
went out and knew that she needed 56 stars

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
tattooed on the right side of her face.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
There is a girl, Julia Butterfly Hill,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
who lived for a year in a tree

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
because she wanted to protect the wild oaks.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.260
There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
who I have adopted as my daughter

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
And this girl, when she was 17 years old,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
wore a burqa in Afghanistan,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
and went into the stadiums

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.260
and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
underneath her burqa, with a video.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
And that video became the video that went out all over the world

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.260
after 9/11 to show what was going on in Afghanistan.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
I want to talk about Rachel Corrie

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
to say, "End the occupation."

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
and rolled over by that tank.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.260
in Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
And she was holding her baby.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And I asked her if she loved her baby.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.260
"Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
It's my baby and it's full of love."

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.260
The capacity for girls to overcome situations

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.260
and to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
There is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Dorcas is 15 years old,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
and she was trained in self-defense.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
A few months ago she was picked up on the street

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
by three older men.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
They kidnapped her, they put her in a car.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And through her self-defense, she grabbed their Adam's apples,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
she punched them in the eyes

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and she got herself free and out of the car.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
In Kenya, in August,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
a house we opened seven years ago

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.260
Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
she was female genitally mutilated.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
And she made a decision as many women do across this planet,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
that what was done to her would not be enforced and done

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
to other women and girls.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
So, for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.260
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
and what a mutilated vagina looked like.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
we asked her what we could do for her,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.260
and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster."

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
So, we got her a Jeep. And then she saved 4,500 girls.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
And then we asked her, "Okay, what else do you need?"

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
And she said, "Well, now, I need a house."

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
So, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
in Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
And it was a house where girls could run away,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
they could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
they could go to school.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And in the years that Agnes has had the house,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
she has changed the situation there.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
She has literally become deputy mayor.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
She's changed the rules.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
When we were there she was doing a ritual

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
where she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
Jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
and there's a drought in Kenya.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
So cows are dying, and cows are the most

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
valued possession.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
And Jaclyn overheard her father

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
talking to an old man about

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
how he was about to sell her for the cows.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
And she knew that meant she would be cut.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
She knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.260
So, one afternoon, she'd heard about the safe house,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
Jaclyn left her father's house

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
and she walked for two days, two days

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
through Masai land.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
She imagined her father killing her on one hand,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
and Mama Agnes greeting her,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
And when she got to the house she was greeted.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
Agnes took her in, and Agnes loved her,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
and Agnes supported her for the year.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
She went to school and she found her voice,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
and she found her identity, and she found her heart.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
Then, her time was ready

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
when she had to go back to talk to her father

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
about the reconciliation, after a year.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
I had the privilege of being in the hut

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
when she was reunited with her father and reconciled.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
In that hut, we walked in,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
and her father and his four wives were sitting there,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
and her sisters who had just returned because

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
they had all fled when she had fled,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
and her primary mother, who had been beaten

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
in standing up for her with the elders.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
When her father saw her and saw who she had become,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
in her full girl self,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
he threw his arms around her and broke down crying.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.260
He said, "You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
We will not cut you.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
And I give you my word, here and now,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
that we will not cut your sisters either."

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
And what she said to him was,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
"You were willing to sell me for four cows,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.260
and a calf and some blankets.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
But I promise you, now that I will be educated

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
I will always take care of you,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
and I will come back and I will build you a house.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life."

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
For me, that is the power of girls.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
And that is the power of transformation.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
I want to close today

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
with a new piece from my book.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
And I want to do it tonight

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
for the girl in everybody here.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
And I want to do it for Sunitha.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.260
the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.260
But I really want to do it for each and every person here,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
to value the girl in us,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
to value the part that cries,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
to value the part that's emotional,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
to value the part that's vulnerable,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.260
to understand that's where the future lies.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
This is called "I'm An Emotional Creature."

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
I was asking girls if they like being a girl,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
and all the girls were like, "No, I hate it. I can't stand it.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
It's all bad. My brothers get everything."

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
And this girl just sat up and went, "I love being a girl.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
I'm an emotional creature!"

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.260
(Laughter)

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
This is for her:

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
I love being a girl.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
I can feel what you're feeling

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
as you're feeling inside the feeling before.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.260
I am an emotional creature.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
Things do not come to me as intellectual theories

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
or hard-pressed ideas.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
Oh, I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
even though she appears to give you what you want.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
I know when a storm is coming.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
I am an emotional creature.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
I love that I do not take things lightly.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
Everything is intense to me,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
the way I walk in the street, the way my momma wakes me up,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.260
the way it's unbearable when I lose, the way I hear bad news.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
I am an emotional creature.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
Don't you say all negative

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
that it's only only a teenage thing,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
or it's only because I'm a girl.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
These feelings make me better.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
I am an emotional creature.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
There is a particular way of knowing.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
It's like the older women somehow forgot.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.260
I rejoice that it's still in my body.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.260
Oh, I know when the coconut's about to fall.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.260
I know we have pushed the Earth too far.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
I know my father isn't coming back,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
and that no one's prepared for the fire.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
I know that lipstick means more than show,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
and boys are super insecure,

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.260
and so-called terrorists are made, not born.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
I know that one kiss

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
could take away all my decision-making ability.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
(Laughter)

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.260
And you know what? Sometimes it should.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
This is not extreme. It's a girl thing,

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.260
what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
Don't tell me not to cry, to calm it down,

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
not to be so extreme, to be reasonable.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.260
I am an emotional creature.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.260
It's how the earth got made, how the wind continues to pollinate.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:40.260
You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
I am an emotional creature.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off?

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.260
I am your remaining memory.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260
I can take you back.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
Nothing's been diluted.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
Nothing's leaked out.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.260
I love, hear me, I love

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:01.260
that I can feel the feelings inside you,

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
even if they stop my life,

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260
even if they break my heart,

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.260
even if they take me off track,

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
they make me responsible.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.260
I am an emotional, I am an emotional,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.260
incondotional, devotional creature.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.260
And I love, hear me,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.260
I love, love, love being a girl.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.260
Can you say it with me?

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.260
I love, I love, love, love

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.260
being a girl!

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.260
Thank you very much.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:48.260
(Applause)
