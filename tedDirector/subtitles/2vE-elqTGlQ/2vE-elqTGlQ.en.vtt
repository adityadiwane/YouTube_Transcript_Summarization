00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.356
So 24 years ago,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.156
I was brought to The New Yorker

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.700
as art editor

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.836
to rejuvenate

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.876
what had by then become
a somewhat staid institution

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.396
and to bring in new artists

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.116
and to try to bring the magazine
from its ivory tower

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.476
into engaging with its time.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.196
And it was just
the right thing for me to do

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.836
because I've always been captivated
by how an image can --

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.556
a simple drawing --

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.316
can cut through the torrent of images
that we see every single day.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.796
How it can capture a moment,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.036
how it can crystallize
a social trend or a complex event

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.236
in a way that a lot of words
wouldn't be able to do --

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.060
and reduce it to its essence
and turn it into a cartoon.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.396
So I went to the library

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.356
and I looked at the first cover
drawn by Rea Irvin in 1925 --

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.780
a dandy looking at a butterfly
through his monocle,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.340
and we call it Eustace Tilley.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.916
And I realized that
as the magazine had become known

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.396
for its in-depth research
and long reports,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.356
some of the humor
had gotten lost along the way,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.276
because now often Eustace Tilley
was seen as a haughty dandy,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.396
but in fact, in 1925,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.836
when Rea Irvin first drew this image,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.636
he did it as part of a humor magazine

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.876
to amuse the youth of the era,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.980
which was the flappers
of the roaring twenties.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.156
And in the library,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.116
I found the images
that really captured the zeitgeist

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.556
of the Great Depression.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.996
And it showed us
not just how people dressed

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.556
or what their cars looked like,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.836
but also what made them laugh,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.156
what their prejudices were.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.756
And you really got a sense

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.260
of what it felt like
to be alive in the '30s.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.156
So I called on contemporary artists,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.396
such as Adrian Tomine here.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.556
I often call on narrative artists --

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.236
cartoonists, children's book authors --

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.780
and I give them themes such as,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.996
you know, what it's like
to be in the subway,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.196
or Valentine's Day,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.596
and they send me sketches.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.516
And once the sketches
are approved by the editor,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.900
David Remnick,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.156
it's a go.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.156
And I love the way

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.436
those images are actually
not telling you what to think.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.676
But they do make you think,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.716
because the artist is actually --

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.996
it's almost a puzzle;

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.516
the artist is drawing the dots,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.236
and you, the reader,
have to complete the picture.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.636
So to get this image
on the left by Anita Kunz,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.716
or the one on right by Tomer Hanuka,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.876
you have to play spot the differences.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.820
And it is something that ...

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.236
It's really exciting to see

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.316
how the engagement with the reader ...

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.276
how those images really capture --

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.836
play with the stereotypes.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.236
But when you get it,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.820
it rearranges the stereotypes
that are in your head.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.676
But the images don't
just have to show people,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.036
sometimes it can be a feeling.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.100
Right after September 11,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.596
I was at a point,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.836
like everybody else,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.076
where I really didn't know how to deal
with what we were going through,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.516
and I felt that no image
could capture this moment,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.036
and I wanted to just do a black cover,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.756
like no cover.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.476
And I talked to my husband,
cartoonist Art Spiegelman,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.356
and mentioned to him
that I was going to propose that,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.956
and he said, "Oh, if you're
going to do a black cover,

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.996
then why don't you do
the silhouette of the Twin Towers,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.556
black on black?"

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.116
And I sat down to draw this,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.620
and as soon as I saw it,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.276
a shiver ran down my spine

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.500
and I realized

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.116
that in this refusal to make an image,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.156
we had found a way to capture loss

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.676
and mourning

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.980
and absence.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.076
And it's been a profound thing
that I learned in the process --

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.036
that sometimes some of the images
that say the most

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.140
do it with the most spare means.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.276
And a simple image can speak volumes.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.556
So this is the image
that we published by Bob Staake

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.420
right after the election of Barack Obama,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.116
and captured a historic moment.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.356
But we can't really plan for this,

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.756
because in order to do this,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.116
we have to let the artist
experience the emotions that we all feel

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.620
when that is happening.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.956
So back in November 2016,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.756
during the election last year,

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.916
the only image that we
could publish was this,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.876
which was on the stand
on the week that everybody voted.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.236
(Laughter)

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.716
Because we knew
somebody would feel this --

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.956
(Laughter)

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.660
when the result of the election
was announced.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.140
And when we found out the result,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.276
we really were at a loss,

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.316
and this is the image
that was sent by Bob Staake again,

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.380
and that really hit a chord.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.356
And again,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.836
we can't really figure out
what's going to come next,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.556
but here it felt like we didn't
know how to move forward,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.036
but we did move forward,

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:32.276
and this is the image that we published
after Donald Trump's election

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.716
and at the time of the Women's March

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.060
all over the US.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.796
So over those 24 years,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.596
I have seen over 1,000 images
come to life week after week,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.196
and I'm often asked
which one is my favorite,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.076
but I can't pick one

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.036
because what I'm most proud of
is how different every image is,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.276
one from the other.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.756
And that's due to the talent
and the diversity

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.740
of all of the artists that contribute.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.196
And now, well,

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.076
now, we're owned by Russia,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.316
so --

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.556
(Laughter)

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.276
In a rendering by Barry Blitt here,

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.516
Eustace has become
Eustace Vladimirovich Tilley.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.636
And the butterfly is none other
than a flabbergasted Donald Trump

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.876
flapping his wings,

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.956
trying to figure out
how to control the butterfly effect,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.556
and the famed logo
that was drawn by Rae Irvin in 1925

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.180
is now in Cyrillic.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.996
So, what makes me really excited
about this moment

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.780
is the way that ...

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.556
You know, free press
is essential to our democracy.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.236
And we can see from
the sublime to the ridiculous

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.676
that artists can capture what is going on

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.316
in a way that an artist

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:04.476
armed with just India ink and watercolor

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:10.476
can capture and enter
into the cultural dialogue.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.476
It puts those artists
at the center of that culture,

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.316
and that's exactly
where I think they should be.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.740
Because the main thing we need
right now is a good cartoon.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.436
Thank you.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.940
(Applause)
