00:00:13.793 --> 00:00:18.785
So, people are more afraid of insects
than they are of dying.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:20.587
(Laughter)

00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:25.119
At least, according to a 1973
"Book of Lists" survey

00:00:25.143 --> 00:00:32.143
which preceded all those online best,
worst, funniest lists that you see today.

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:35.805
Only heights and public speaking

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.365
exceeded the six-legged
as sources of fear.

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:43.436
And I suspect if you had put
spiders in there,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.989
the combinations of insects and spiders
would have just topped the chart.

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:50.839
Now, I am not one of those people.

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:53.009
I really love insects.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:57.084
I think they're interesting and beautiful,

00:00:57.108 --> 00:00:58.596
and sometimes even cute.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.087
(Laughter)

00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:01.479
And I'm not alone.

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:05.209
For centuries, some
of the greatest minds in science,

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:08.245
from Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson,

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:13.550
have drawn inspiration from studying
some of the smallest minds on Earth.

00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:16.362
Well, why is that?

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:19.431
What is that keeps us
coming back to insects?

00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:24.654
Some of it, of course, is just the sheer
magnitude of almost everything about them.

00:01:24.678 --> 00:01:27.665
They're more numerous
than any other kind of animal.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.513
We don't even know how many species
of insects there are,

00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:33.254
because new ones
are being discovered all the time.

00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:36.903
There are at least a million,
maybe as many as 10 million.

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:41.485
This means that you could have
an insect-of-the-month calendar

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.494
and not have to reuse a species
for over 80,000 years.

00:01:45.518 --> 00:01:48.418
(Laughter)

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:50.130
Take that, pandas and kittens!

00:01:50.154 --> 00:01:52.482
(Laughter)

00:01:52.506 --> 00:01:55.974
More seriously, insects are essential.

00:01:55.998 --> 00:01:57.445
We need them.

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.869
It's been estimated
that 1 out of every 3 bites of food

00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:03.567
is made possible by a pollinator.

00:02:04.972 --> 00:02:08.199
Scientist use insects to make fundamental
discoveries

00:02:08.223 --> 00:02:11.124
about everything from the structure
of our nervous systems

00:02:11.148 --> 00:02:13.296
to how our genes and DNA work.

00:02:14.388 --> 00:02:16.266
But what I love most about insects

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.071
is what they can tell us
about our own behavior.

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.596
Insects seem like they do
everything that people do.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.159
They meet, they mate,
they fight, they break up.

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.570
And they do so with what looks
like love or animosity.

00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:36.876
But what drives their behaviors is really
different than what drives our own,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.474
and that difference
can be really illuminating.

00:02:40.234 --> 00:02:42.101
There's nowhere where that's more true

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:45.686
than when it comes to one
of our most consuming interests -- sex.

00:02:46.142 --> 00:02:48.975
Now, I will maintain.
and I think I can defend,

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.400
what may seem like a surprising statement.

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:56.296
I think sex in insects is more
interesting than sex in people.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.107
(Laughter)

00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:01.270
And the wild variety that we see

00:03:01.294 --> 00:03:04.207
makes us challenge
some of our own assumptions

00:03:04.231 --> 00:03:06.955
about what it means to be male and female.

00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:09.314
Of course, to start with,

00:03:09.338 --> 00:03:12.295
a lot of insects don't need
to have sex at all to reproduce.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.749
Female aphids can make little, tiny clones
of themselves without ever mating.

00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.914
Virgin birth, right there.

00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:20.226
On your rose bushes.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.446
(Laughter)

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.011
When they do have sex,

00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:28.292
even their sperm is more
interesting than human sperm.

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:30.691
There are some kinds of fruit flies

00:03:30.715 --> 00:03:34.192
whose sperm is longer
than the male's own body.

00:03:34.216 --> 00:03:38.476
And that's important because the males
use their sperm to compete.

00:03:38.873 --> 00:03:43.060
Now, male insects do compete with weapons,
like the horns on these beetles.

00:03:43.553 --> 00:03:47.797
But they also compete
after mating with their sperm.

00:03:48.726 --> 00:03:53.852
Dragonflies and damselflies have penises
that look kind of like Swiss Army knives

00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:55.969
with all of the attachments pulled out.

00:03:55.993 --> 00:03:57.863
(Laughter)

00:03:57.887 --> 00:04:02.033
They use these formidable devices
like scoops,

00:04:02.057 --> 00:04:06.794
to remove the sperm from previous males
that the female has mated with.

00:04:06.818 --> 00:04:08.885
(Laughter)

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.606
So, what can we learn from this?

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.309
(Laughter)

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:22.343
All right, it is not a lesson in the sense
of us imitating them

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:25.891
or of them setting
an example for us to follow.

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:29.241
Which, given this,
is probably just as well.

00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:32.839
And also, did I mention sexual cannibalism
is rampant among insects?

00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:35.191
So, no, that's not the point.

00:04:35.215 --> 00:04:36.952
But what I think insects do,

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:42.965
is break a lot of the rules
that we humans have about the sex roles.

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:48.848
So, people have this idea that nature
dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.827
of what males and females are like.

00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:54.004
So that males are always
supposed to be dominant and aggressive,

00:04:54.028 --> 00:04:55.770
and females are passive and coy.

00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:57.744
But that's just not the case.

00:04:58.606 --> 00:05:00.668
So for example, take katydids,

00:05:00.692 --> 00:05:03.534
which are relatives of crickets
and grasshoppers.

00:05:03.558 --> 00:05:07.035
The males are very picky
about who they mate with,

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:10.284
because they not only transfer
sperm during mating,

00:05:10.308 --> 00:05:14.774
they also give the female
something called a nuptial gift.

00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:18.475
You can see two katydids
mating in these photos.

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:20.819
In both panels,
the male's the one on the right,

00:05:20.843 --> 00:05:24.423
and that sword-like appendage
is the female's egg-laying organ.

00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:27.653
The white blob is the sperm,

00:05:27.677 --> 00:05:31.063
the green blob is the nuptial gift,

00:05:31.087 --> 00:05:34.453
and the male manufactures
this from his own body

00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:36.655
and it's extremely costly to produce.

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:39.387
It can weigh up to a third
of his body mass.

00:05:39.985 --> 00:05:42.519
I will now pause for a moment
and let you think about

00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:46.706
what it would be like if human men,
every time they had sex,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.777
had to produce something
that weighed 50, 60, 70 pounds.

00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:56.408
(Laughter)

00:05:56.432 --> 00:05:59.671
Okay, they would not be able
to do that very often.

00:05:59.695 --> 00:06:01.192
(Laughter)

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:03.617
And indeed, neither can the katydids.

00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:06.255
And so what that means

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:10.087
is the katydid males are very choosy

00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:13.191
about who they offer
these nuptial gifts to.

00:06:13.215 --> 00:06:15.141
Now, the gift is very nutritious,

00:06:15.165 --> 00:06:17.859
and the female eats it
during and after mating.

00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:20.240
So, the bigger it is,
the better off the male is,

00:06:20.264 --> 00:06:22.440
because that means more time for his sperm

00:06:22.464 --> 00:06:24.912
to drain into her body
and fertilize her eggs.

00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:29.871
But it also means that the males
are very passive about mating,

00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:33.420
whereas the females
are extremely aggressive and competitive,

00:06:33.444 --> 00:06:37.760
in an attempt to get as many of these
nutritious nuptial gifts as they can.

00:06:37.784 --> 00:06:41.579
So, it's not exactly
a stereotypical set of rules.

00:06:42.974 --> 00:06:44.685
Even more generally though,

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:49.773
males are actually not all that important
in the lives of a lot of insects.

00:06:49.797 --> 00:06:54.226
In the social insects --
the bees and wasps and ants --

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.845
the individuals that you see every day --

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:59.314
the ants going back and forth
to your sugar bowl,

00:06:59.338 --> 00:07:02.347
the honey bees that are flitting
from flower to flower --

00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:04.670
all of those are always female.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.876
People have had a hard time getting
their head around that idea for millennia.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.998
The ancient Greeks knew that there was
a class of bees, the drones,

00:07:15.022 --> 00:07:17.073
that are larger than the workers,

00:07:17.097 --> 00:07:19.667
although they disapproved
of the drones' laziness

00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:22.746
because they could see that
the drones just hang around the hive

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.295
until the mating flight --

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.538
they're the males.

00:07:25.562 --> 00:07:27.581
They hang around until the mating flight,

00:07:27.605 --> 00:07:30.344
but they don't participate
in gathering nectar or pollen.

00:07:30.368 --> 00:07:32.652
The Greeks couldn't figure out
the drones' sex,

00:07:32.676 --> 00:07:37.243
and part of the confusion was that they
were aware of the stinging ability of bees

00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:40.124
but they found it difficult to believe

00:07:40.148 --> 00:07:43.395
that any animals that bore such a weapon
could possibly be a female.

00:07:43.705 --> 00:07:46.715
Aristotle tried to get involved as well.

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:51.327
He suggested, "OK, if the stinging
individuals are going to be the males ..."

00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:53.817
Then he got confused,
because that would have meant

00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:56.570
the males were also taking care
of the young in a colony,

00:07:56.594 --> 00:08:01.002
and he seemed to think
that would be completely impossible.

00:08:01.026 --> 00:08:04.075
He then concluded that maybe
bees had the organs of both sexes

00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:05.250
in the same individual,

00:08:05.274 --> 00:08:07.843
which is not that far-fetched,
some animals do that,

00:08:07.867 --> 00:08:10.120
but he never really
did get it figured out.

00:08:10.744 --> 00:08:14.530
And you know, even today,
my students, for instance,

00:08:14.554 --> 00:08:19.245
call every animal they see,
including insects, a male.

00:08:19.585 --> 00:08:23.121
And when I tell them
that the ferocious army-ant soldiers

00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:26.078
with their giant jaws,
used to defend the colony,

00:08:26.102 --> 00:08:29.204
are all always female,

00:08:29.228 --> 00:08:31.562
they seem to not quite believe me.

00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:32.731
(Laughter)

00:08:32.755 --> 00:08:37.955
And certainly all of the movies --
Antz, Bee Movie --

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:43.834
portray the main character
in the social insects as being male.

00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:46.673
Well, what difference does this make?

00:08:46.697 --> 00:08:48.334
These are movies. They're fiction.

00:08:48.358 --> 00:08:49.980
They have talking animals in them.

00:08:50.004 --> 00:08:53.684
What difference does it make
if they talk like Jerry Seinfeld?

00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:55.872
I think it does matter,

00:08:55.896 --> 00:08:58.760
and it's a problem that actually
is part of a much deeper one

00:08:58.784 --> 00:09:02.913
that has implications
for medicine and health

00:09:02.937 --> 00:09:05.571
and a lot of other aspects of our lives.

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:09.088
You all know that scientists
use what we call model systems,

00:09:09.112 --> 00:09:12.473
which are creatures --
white rats or fruit flies --

00:09:12.497 --> 00:09:17.051
that are kind of stand-ins
for all other animals, including people.

00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:20.019
And the idea is
that what's true for a person

00:09:20.043 --> 00:09:22.454
will also be true for the white rat.

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:25.458
And by and large,
that turns out to be the case.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:29.243
But you can take the idea
of a model system too far.

00:09:29.924 --> 00:09:32.193
And what I think we've done,

00:09:32.217 --> 00:09:37.668
is use males, in any species,
as though they are the model system.

00:09:37.692 --> 00:09:38.915
The norm.

00:09:38.939 --> 00:09:41.486
The way things are supposed to be.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.559
And females as a kind of variant --

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:48.310
something special that you only study
after you get the basics down.

00:09:49.802 --> 00:09:52.485
And so, back to the insects.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:53.857
I think what that means

00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:56.700
is that people just couldn't see
what was in front of them.

00:09:56.724 --> 00:10:03.160
Because they assumed that the world's
stage was largely occupied by male players

00:10:03.184 --> 00:10:07.036
and females would only have
minor, walk-on roles.

00:10:07.626 --> 00:10:13.065
But when we do that, we really miss out
on a lot of what nature is like.

00:10:13.588 --> 00:10:20.587
And we can also miss out on the way
natural, living things, including people,

00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:22.001
can vary.

00:10:22.025 --> 00:10:27.100
And I think that's why we've used males
as models in a lot of medical research,

00:10:27.124 --> 00:10:29.189
something that we know now to be a problem

00:10:29.213 --> 00:10:33.610
if we want the results to apply
to both men and women.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.287
Well, the last thing
I really love about insects

00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:40.572
is something that a lot of people
find unnerving about them.

00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:42.363
They have little, tiny brains

00:10:42.387 --> 00:10:45.780
with very little cognitive ability,
the way we normally think of it.

00:10:46.398 --> 00:10:51.074
They have complicated behavior,
but they lack complicated brains.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.037
And so, we can't just think of them
as though they're little people

00:10:57.061 --> 00:11:00.606
because they don't do things
the way that we do.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.730
I really love that it's difficult
to anthropomorphize insects,

00:11:04.754 --> 00:11:08.277
to look at them and just think of them
like they're little people

00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:10.439
in exoskeletons, with six legs.

00:11:10.927 --> 00:11:12.188
(Laughter)

00:11:12.212 --> 00:11:15.757
Instead, you really have to accept them
on their own terms,

00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:20.914
because insects make us question
what's normal and what's natural.

00:11:21.527 --> 00:11:26.160
Now, you know, people write fiction
and talk about parallel universes.

00:11:26.184 --> 00:11:29.482
They speculate about the supernatural,

00:11:29.506 --> 00:11:32.939
maybe the spirits of the departed
walking among us.

00:11:34.537 --> 00:11:37.733
The allure of another world

00:11:37.757 --> 00:11:43.911
is something that people say is part of
why they want to dabble in the paranormal.

00:11:44.376 --> 00:11:46.665
But as far as I'm concerned,

00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:48.858
who needs to be able to see dead people,

00:11:48.882 --> 00:11:50.560
when you can see live insects?

00:11:51.262 --> 00:11:52.424
Thank you.

00:11:52.448 --> 00:11:56.931
(Applause)
