00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:13.894
My name is Tom,

00:00:13.918 --> 00:00:17.070
and I've come here today to come clean

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:20.527
about what I do for money.

00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:24.027
Basically, I use my mouth in strange ways

00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:26.217
in exchange for cash.

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:27.312
(Laughter)

00:00:27.336 --> 00:00:30.511
I usually do this kind of thing
in seedy downtown bars

00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:32.134
and on street corners,

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:35.230
so this mightn't be
the most appropriate setting,

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:39.063
but I'd like to give you guys
a bit of a demonstration

00:00:39.087 --> 00:00:42.210
about what I do.

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:54.659
(Beatboxing)

00:02:14.108 --> 00:02:17.752
And now, for my next number,

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:22.286
I'd like to return to the classics.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.356
(Applause)

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.743
We're going to take it back,

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:28.876
way back,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.962
back into time.

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:42.129
(Beatboxing: "Billie Jean")

00:02:53.987 --> 00:02:57.715
♫ Billie Jean is not my lover ♫

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.646
♫ She's just a girl who claims
that I am the one ♫

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.619
♫ But the kid is not my son ♫

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:11.541
(Applause) All right.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.459
Wassup.

00:03:16.483 --> 00:03:18.968
Thank you very much, TEDx.

00:03:18.992 --> 00:03:21.498
If you guys haven't
figured it out already,

00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:23.719
my name's Tom Thum, and I'm a beatboxer,

00:03:23.743 --> 00:03:26.120
which means all the sounds
that you just heard

00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:29.071
were made entirely using just my voice,

00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:31.184
and the only thing was my voice.

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:33.126
And I can assure you

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.776
there are absolutely no effects

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.147
on this microphone whatsoever.

00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:45.304
And I'm very, very stoked —

00:03:45.328 --> 00:03:46.645
(Applause)

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.399
You guys are just applauding
for everything. It's great.

00:03:50.423 --> 00:03:54.807
Look at this, Mom! I made it!

00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:57.883
I'm very, very stoked to be here today,

00:03:57.907 --> 00:03:59.907
representing my kinfolk

00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:03.135
and all those that haven't
managed to make a career

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.733
out of an innate ability
for inhuman noisemaking.

00:04:06.757 --> 00:04:09.668
Because it is a bit of a niche market,

00:04:09.692 --> 00:04:12.032
and there's not much work going on,

00:04:12.056 --> 00:04:13.518
especially where I'm from.

00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:14.876
You know, I'm from Brisbane,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.498
which is a great city to live in.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:19.381
Yeah! All right! Most of Brisbane's here.
That's good.

00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:20.898
(Laughter)

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:23.259
You know, I'm from Brizzy,

00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:24.966
which is a great city to live in,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.337
but let's be honest --

00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:30.202
it's not exactly the cultural
hub of the Southern Hemisphere.

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:33.606
So I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.374
and outside Australia,

00:04:35.398 --> 00:04:38.469
and so the pursuit of this
crazy passion of mine

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:39.839
has enabled me to see

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.391
so many amazing places in the world.

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:47.734
So I'd like to share with you,
if I may, my experiences.

00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:49.652
So ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:49.676 --> 00:04:52.625
I would like to take you on a journey

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:54.182
throughout the continents

00:04:54.206 --> 00:04:58.359
and throughout sound itself.

00:04:58.383 --> 00:05:02.688
We start our journey
in the central deserts.

00:05:02.712 --> 00:05:12.662
(Didgeridoo)

00:05:12.686 --> 00:05:16.197
(Airplane)

00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:17.617
India.

00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:31.693
(Beatboxing)

00:05:31.717 --> 00:05:37.063
(Sitar)

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.848
China.

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:51.690
(Guzheng)

00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:58.489
(Beatboxing)

00:05:58.513 --> 00:06:00.602
Germany.

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:14.106
(Beatboxing)

00:06:19.077 --> 00:06:20.795
Party, party, yeah.

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:25.906
(Laughter)

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.363
And before we reach our final destination,

00:06:29.387 --> 00:06:30.966
ladies and gentlemen,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.300
I would like to share
with you some technology

00:06:33.324 --> 00:06:36.563
that I brought all the way
from the thriving metropolis of Brisbane.

00:06:36.587 --> 00:06:40.608
These things in front of me
here are called Kaoss Pads,

00:06:40.632 --> 00:06:43.636
and they allow me to do a whole
lot of different things

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.745
with my voice.

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:48.243
For example, the one on the left here

00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:50.488
allows me to add

00:06:50.512 --> 00:06:53.585
a little bit of reverb to my sound,

00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:55.224
which gives me that --

00:06:55.248 --> 00:07:01.456
(Trumpet) --

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.030
flavor.

00:07:03.054 --> 00:07:04.382
(Laughter)

00:07:04.406 --> 00:07:06.088
And the other ones here,

00:07:06.112 --> 00:07:08.174
I can use them in unison

00:07:08.198 --> 00:07:11.003
to mimic the effect of a drum machine

00:07:11.027 --> 00:07:12.070
or something like that.

00:07:12.094 --> 00:07:14.933
I can sample in my own sounds
and I can play it back

00:07:14.957 --> 00:07:19.976
just by hitting the pads here.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:33.535
(Noises)

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:39.605
TEDx.

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:48.313
(Music)

00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:01.884
(Applause)

00:08:01.908 --> 00:08:06.264
I got way too much time on my hands.

00:08:06.288 --> 00:08:07.622
And last but not least,

00:08:07.646 --> 00:08:10.668
the one on my right here allows me to

00:08:10.692 --> 00:08:14.328
loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop

00:08:14.352 --> 00:08:16.935
my voice.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:20.005
So with all that in mind,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:22.855
I would like to take you on a journey

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:25.135
to a completely separate part of Earth

00:08:25.159 --> 00:08:27.808
as I transform the Sydney Opera House

00:08:27.832 --> 00:08:32.095
into a smoky downtown jazz bar.

00:08:32.119 --> 00:08:35.914
All right boys, take it away.

00:08:35.938 --> 00:08:40.262
(Music)

00:08:45.482 --> 00:08:47.254
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce you

00:08:47.278 --> 00:08:48.850
to a very special friend of mine,

00:08:48.874 --> 00:08:51.028
one of the greatest
double bassists I know.

00:08:51.052 --> 00:08:55.582
Mr. Smokey Jefferson, let's take
it for a walk. Come on, baby.

00:08:55.606 --> 00:09:01.954
(Music)

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:40.470
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:40.494 --> 00:09:42.875
I'd like to introduce you
to the star of the show,

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:45.162
one of the greatest jazz
legends of our time.

00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:47.763
Music lovers and jazz lovers alike,

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.946
please give a warm hand of applause

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.705
for the one and only Mr. Peeping Tom.
Take it away.

00:09:53.729 --> 00:09:58.163
(Music)

00:09:58.187 --> 00:10:05.291
(Applause)

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.393
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:11:16.417 --> 00:11:21.494
(Applause)
