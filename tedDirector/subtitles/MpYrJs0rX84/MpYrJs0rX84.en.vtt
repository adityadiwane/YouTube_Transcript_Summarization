00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.319
So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:21.328
and Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema.

00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:23.881
Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:28.150
as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.673
at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends

00:00:31.673 --> 00:00:34.219
of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.408
The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.

00:00:37.408 --> 00:00:40.592
So as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says,

00:00:40.592 --> 00:00:43.641
"Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:47.375
just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?"

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:51.286
And I sat, and I was like, "Man, I would buy that, eh?"

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:54.821
So I went home, and I did a little research,

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:58.253
and I found some very shocking statistics.

00:00:58.253 --> 00:01:01.270
Over 2.5 billion people in the world today

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.271
do not have proper access to water and sanitation.

00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:06.394
Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa,

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:09.161
and five million of them are in South Africa.

00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:11.701
Various diseases thrive in this environment,

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:15.048
the most drastic of which is called trachoma.

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:17.849
Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:21.158
getting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma

00:01:21.158 --> 00:01:23.842
can leave you permanently blind.

00:01:23.842 --> 00:01:27.575
The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind

00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:30.320
each and every year. The shocking part about it

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.017
is that to avoid being infected with trachoma,

00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:34.890
all you have to do is wash your face:

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.703
no medicine, no pills, no injections.

00:01:37.703 --> 00:01:40.606
So after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself,

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:42.958
"Okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myself

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.671
and the fact that I don't want to bathe, I at least need

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:48.311
to do it to try to save the world." (Laughter)

00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:53.264
So with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone --

00:01:53.264 --> 00:01:56.119
I didn't have a laptop, I didn't have Internet much,

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.064
except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe —

00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:02.105
I did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions,

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:05.842
creams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities --

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:07.370
I did high school science --

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.108
and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper,

00:02:11.108 --> 00:02:14.480
and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.969
So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.718
Now we need to get this thing into practice.

00:02:19.718 --> 00:02:23.714
Fast forward four years later, after having written

00:02:23.714 --> 00:02:26.298
a 40-page business plan on the cell phone,

00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:28.397
having written my patent on the cell phone,

00:02:28.397 --> 00:02:31.090
I'm the youngest patent-holder in the country,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.991
and — ("No more bathing!") —

00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:36.596
I can't say any more than that. (Laughter)

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:40.338
I had invented DryBath, the world's first

00:02:40.338 --> 00:02:43.124
bath-substituting lotion.

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:47.457
You literally put it on your skin, and you don't have to bathe.

00:02:47.457 --> 00:02:51.842
(Laughter)

00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:54.531
So after having tried to make it work in high school

00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:58.048
with the limited resources I had, I went to university,

00:02:58.048 --> 00:03:00.751
met a few people, got it into practice,

00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:03.803
and we have a fully functioning product that's ready

00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:06.600
to go to the market. It's actually available on the market.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.526
So we learned a few lessons in commercializing

00:03:09.526 --> 00:03:11.953
and making DryBath available.

00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:14.309
One of the things we learned was that poor communities

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:16.569
don't buy products in bulk.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.046
They buy products on demand. A person in Alex

00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:21.440
doesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.850
each day, even though it's more expensive.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.496
So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:29.386
You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:33.073
And the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bath

00:03:33.073 --> 00:03:35.283
for five rand.

00:03:35.283 --> 00:03:37.975
After creating that model, we also learned a lot

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:39.716
in terms of implementing the product.

00:03:39.716 --> 00:03:42.034
We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs

00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:44.222
really want DryBath. (Laughter)

00:03:44.222 --> 00:03:46.405
At least once a week.

00:03:46.405 --> 00:03:49.017
Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters

00:03:49.017 --> 00:03:52.148
of water on average each time they skipped a bath,

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:55.083
and also we would save two hours a day for kids

00:03:55.083 --> 00:03:58.149
who are in rural areas, two hours more for school,

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:59.933
two hours more for homework,

00:03:59.933 --> 00:04:02.781
two hours more to just be a kid.

00:04:02.781 --> 00:04:05.428
After seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:07.792
to our key value proposition,

00:04:07.792 --> 00:04:10.035
which was cleanliness and convenience.

00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:12.667
DryBath is a rich man's convenience

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:15.037
and a poor man's lifesaver.

00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:18.509
Having put the product into practice, we are actually now

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.553
on the verge of selling the product

00:04:20.553 --> 00:04:23.666
onto a multinational to take it to the retail market,

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:27.191
and one question I have for the audience today is,

00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:29.464
on the gravel roads of Limpopo,

00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:32.813
with an allowance of 50 rand a week,

00:04:32.813 --> 00:04:36.635
I came up with a way for the world not to bathe.

00:04:36.635 --> 00:04:39.343
What's stopping you? (Applause)

00:04:39.343 --> 00:04:42.289
I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet.

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.354
And another key thing that I learned a lot

00:04:45.354 --> 00:04:46.702
throughout this whole process,

00:04:46.702 --> 00:04:50.787
last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.

00:04:50.787 --> 00:04:53.656
I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur

00:04:53.656 --> 00:04:56.412
in the world, the first African to get that accolade,

00:04:56.412 --> 00:05:01.407
and one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this

00:05:01.407 --> 00:05:05.043
just because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you.

00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:07.225
(Applause.)
