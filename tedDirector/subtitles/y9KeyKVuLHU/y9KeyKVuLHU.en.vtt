00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.515
Have you ever wondered
what animals think and feel?

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.904
Let's start with a question:

00:00:19.654 --> 00:00:23.773
Does my dog really love me,
or does she just want a treat?

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:29.958
Well, it's easy to see
that our dog really loves us,

00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:32.063
easy to see, right,

00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:35.737
what's going on in that fuzzy little head.

00:00:36.593 --> 00:00:37.968
What is going on?

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:40.881
Something's going on.

00:00:41.864 --> 00:00:46.263
But why is the question always
do they love us?

00:00:46.287 --> 00:00:48.398
Why is it always about us?

00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:51.065
Why are we such narcissists?

00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:55.713
I found a different question
to ask animals.

00:00:57.911 --> 00:00:59.328
Who are you?

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.805
There are capacities of the human mind

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:09.691
that we tend to think are capacities
only of the human mind.

00:01:10.176 --> 00:01:11.534
But is that true?

00:01:12.047 --> 00:01:16.022
What are other beings
doing with those brains?

00:01:16.554 --> 00:01:18.907
What are they thinking and feeling?

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.203
Is there a way to know?

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:22.901
I think there is a way in.

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:24.615
I think there are several ways in.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.072
We can look at evolution,
we can look at their brains

00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:31.576
and we can watch what they do.

00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:37.255
The first thing to remember is:
our brain is inherited.

00:01:38.253 --> 00:01:41.960
The first neurons came from jellyfish.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.275
Jellyfish gave rise
to the first chordates.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.967
The first chordates gave rise
to the first vertebrates.

00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:51.695
The vertebrates came out of the sea,

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.055
and here we are.

00:01:54.737 --> 00:02:00.327
But it's still true that a neuron,
a nerve cell, looks the same

00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:03.768
in a crayfish, a bird or you.

00:02:04.427 --> 00:02:07.968
What does that say
about the minds of crayfish?

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.437
Can we tell anything about that?

00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:14.490
Well, it turns out that
if you give a crayfish

00:02:14.514 --> 00:02:17.171
a lot of little tiny electric shocks

00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:19.491
every time it tries
to come out of its burrow,

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:21.700
it will develop anxiety.

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:26.551
If you give the crayfish the same drug

00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:29.498
used to treat anxiety disorder in humans,

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:32.603
it relaxes and comes out and explores.

00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:37.395
How do we show how much
we care about crayfish anxiety?

00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:39.259
Mostly, we boil them.

00:02:39.283 --> 00:02:40.599
(Laughter)

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.848
Octopuses use tools,
as well as do most apes

00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:50.215
and they recognize human faces.

00:02:50.808 --> 00:02:55.592
How do we celebrate the ape-like
intelligence of this invertebrate?

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.446
Mostly boiled.

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.975
If a grouper chases a fish
into a crevice in the coral,

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:07.975
it will sometimes go to where it knows
a moray eel is sleeping

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:11.572
and it will signal
to the moray, "Follow me,"

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:14.137
and the moray will understand that signal.

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:17.793
The moray may go into the crevice
and get the fish,

00:03:17.817 --> 00:03:20.475
but the fish may bolt
and the grouper may get it.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.911
This is an ancient partnership that we
have just recently found out about.

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:30.020
How do we celebrate
that ancient partnership?

00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:31.622
Mostly fried.

00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:36.518
A pattern is emerging and it says
a lot more about us

00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:38.702
than it does about them.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.015
Sea otters use tools

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:45.016
and they take time away
from what they're doing

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.181
to show their babies what to do,
which is called teaching.

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:51.883
Chimpanzees don't teach.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.809
Killer whales teach
and killer whales share food.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.913
When evolution makes something new,

00:04:00.937 --> 00:04:05.290
it uses the parts it has
in stock, off the shelf,

00:04:05.314 --> 00:04:07.776
before it fabricates a new twist.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.976
And our brain has come to us

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.401
through the enormity
of the deep sweep of time.

00:04:14.425 --> 00:04:18.014
If you look at the human brain
compared to a chimpanzee brain,

00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:21.702
what you see is we have basically
a very big chimpanzee brain.

00:04:21.726 --> 00:04:25.667
It's a good thing ours is bigger,
because we're also really insecure.

00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:27.753
(Laughter)

00:04:27.777 --> 00:04:30.893
But, uh oh, there's a dolphin,

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:33.893
a bigger brain with more convolutions.

00:04:34.777 --> 00:04:37.484
OK, maybe you're saying,
all right, well, we see brains,

00:04:37.508 --> 00:04:39.935
but what does that
have to say about minds?

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:44.218
Well, we can see the working of the mind

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.951
in the logic of behaviors.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.161
So these elephants, you can see,

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:52.785
obviously, they are resting.

00:04:53.118 --> 00:04:57.482
They have found a patch of shade
under the palm trees

00:04:57.506 --> 00:05:00.306
under which to let their babies sleep,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.949
while they doze but remain vigilant.

00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:06.343
We make perfect sense of that image

00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:09.998
just as they make perfect sense
of what they're doing

00:05:10.022 --> 00:05:13.824
because under the arc of the same sun
on the same plains,

00:05:13.848 --> 00:05:17.274
listening to the howls
of the same dangers,

00:05:17.298 --> 00:05:21.709
they became who they are
and we became who we are.

00:05:22.536 --> 00:05:24.712
We've been neighbors for a very long time.

00:05:24.736 --> 00:05:28.180
No one would mistake
these elephants as being relaxed.

00:05:28.204 --> 00:05:31.116
They're obviously very
concerned about something.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.116
What are they concerned about?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.320
It turns out that if you record
the voices of tourists

00:05:37.344 --> 00:05:42.038
and you play that recording
from a speaker hidden in bushes,

00:05:42.062 --> 00:05:45.697
elephants will ignore it,
because tourists never bother elephants.

00:05:46.102 --> 00:05:50.844
But if you record the voices of herders

00:05:50.868 --> 00:05:55.957
who carry spears and often hurt elephants
in confrontations at water holes,

00:05:55.981 --> 00:06:00.675
the elephants will bunch up
and run away from the hidden speaker.

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.058
Not only do elephants know
that there are humans,

00:06:04.082 --> 00:06:06.618
they know that there are
different kinds of humans,

00:06:06.642 --> 00:06:10.224
and that some are OK
and some are dangerous.

00:06:10.248 --> 00:06:15.315
They have been watching us for much longer
than we have been watching them.

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:17.629
They know us better than we know them.

00:06:18.272 --> 00:06:21.120
We have the same imperatives:

00:06:21.144 --> 00:06:25.639
take care of our babies,
find food, try to stay alive.

00:06:26.478 --> 00:06:30.307
Whether we're outfitted for hiking
in the hills of Africa

00:06:30.331 --> 00:06:34.514
or outfitted for diving under the sea,
we are basically the same.

00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:36.516
We are kin under the skin.

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:39.402
The elephant has the same skeleton,

00:06:39.426 --> 00:06:41.768
the killer whale has the same skeleton,

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:43.028
as do we.

00:06:45.674 --> 00:06:47.936
We see helping where help is needed.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.188
We see curiosity in the young.

00:06:52.467 --> 00:06:56.070
We see the bonds of family connections.

00:06:57.776 --> 00:06:59.823
We recognize affection.

00:07:00.522 --> 00:07:02.683
Courtship is courtship.

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:06.682
And then we ask, "Are they conscious?"

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.200
When you get general anesthesia,
it makes you unconscious,

00:07:10.224 --> 00:07:13.059
which means you have
no sensation of anything.

00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:16.654
Consciousness is simply
the thing that feels like something.

00:07:17.292 --> 00:07:21.441
If you see, if you hear, if you feel,
if you're aware of anything,

00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:24.517
you are conscious, and they are conscious.

00:07:27.165 --> 00:07:28.331
Some people say

00:07:28.355 --> 00:07:30.960
well, there are certain things
that make humans humans,

00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:32.906
and one of those things is empathy.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.617
Empathy is the mind's ability
to match moods with your companions.

00:07:39.442 --> 00:07:41.025
It's a very useful thing.

00:07:41.049 --> 00:07:43.209
If your companions start to move quickly,

00:07:43.233 --> 00:07:45.468
you have to feel like
you need to hurry up.

00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:47.222
We're all in a hurry now.

00:07:47.246 --> 00:07:50.733
The oldest form of empathy
is contagious fear.

00:07:50.757 --> 00:07:53.603
If your companions suddenly
startle and fly away,

00:07:53.627 --> 00:07:55.791
it does not work very well for you to say,

00:07:55.815 --> 00:07:58.718
"Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left."

00:07:58.742 --> 00:08:00.274
(Laughter)

00:08:03.136 --> 00:08:06.975
Empathy is old, but empathy,
like everything else in life,

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:10.910
comes on a sliding scale
and has its elaboration.

00:08:10.934 --> 00:08:14.655
So there's basic empathy:
you feel sad, it makes me sad.

00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:16.616
I see you happy, it makes me happy.

00:08:17.192 --> 00:08:19.975
Then there's something
that I call sympathy,

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.859
a little more removed:

00:08:22.365 --> 00:08:25.832
"I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother
has just passed away.

00:08:25.856 --> 00:08:29.483
I don't feel that same grief,
but I get it; I know what you feel

00:08:29.507 --> 00:08:30.920
and it concerns me."

00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:33.561
And then if we're motivated
to act on sympathy,

00:08:33.585 --> 00:08:35.391
I call that compassion.

00:08:36.061 --> 00:08:39.611
Far from being the thing
that makes us human,

00:08:39.635 --> 00:08:42.975
human empathy is far from perfect.

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:48.010
We round up empathic creatures,
we kill them and we eat them.

00:08:48.034 --> 00:08:50.901
Now, maybe you say OK,
well, those are different species.

00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:54.643
That's just predation,
and humans are predators.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:09:00.003
But we don't treat our own kind
too well either.

00:09:01.212 --> 00:09:04.366
People who seem to know
only one thing about animal behavior

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.363
know that you must never attribute
human thoughts and emotions

00:09:08.387 --> 00:09:10.188
to other species.

00:09:10.723 --> 00:09:12.544
Well, I think that's silly,

00:09:12.568 --> 00:09:16.690
because attributing human thoughts
and emotions to other species

00:09:16.714 --> 00:09:20.965
is the best first guess about what
they're doing and how they're feeling,

00:09:20.989 --> 00:09:24.302
because their brains
are basically the same as ours.

00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:26.057
They have the same structures.

00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:31.131
The same hormones that create
mood and motivation in us

00:09:31.155 --> 00:09:33.413
are in those brains as well.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:40.120
It is not scientific to say that they
are hungry when they're hunting

00:09:40.144 --> 00:09:43.091
and they're tired when
their tongues are hanging out,

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:45.805
and then say when they're playing
with their children

00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:47.740
and acting joyful and happy,

00:09:47.764 --> 00:09:52.553
we have no idea if they can possibly
be experiencing anything.

00:09:52.577 --> 00:09:54.571
That is not scientific.

00:09:55.619 --> 00:09:58.304
So OK, so a reporter said to me,

00:09:58.328 --> 00:10:02.636
"Maybe, but how do you really know
that other animals can think and feel?"

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.715
And I started to rifle
through all the hundreds

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:08.238
of scientific references
that I put in my book

00:10:08.262 --> 00:10:11.502
and I realized that the answer
was right in the room with me.

00:10:11.526 --> 00:10:15.279
When my dog gets off the rug
and comes over to me --

00:10:15.303 --> 00:10:17.065
not to the couch, to me --

00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:21.266
and she rolls over on her back
and exposes her belly,

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.158
she has had the thought,
"I would like my belly rubbed.

00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:29.101
I know that I can go over to Carl,

00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:31.438
he will understand what I'm asking.

00:10:32.084 --> 00:10:34.580
I know I can trust him
because we're family.

00:10:35.406 --> 00:10:38.121
He'll get the job done,
and it will feel good."

00:10:38.145 --> 00:10:40.031
(Laughter)

00:10:40.055 --> 00:10:43.384
She has thought and she has felt,

00:10:43.408 --> 00:10:46.072
and it's really not
more complicated than that.

00:10:46.096 --> 00:10:50.709
But we see other animals
and we say, "Oh look, killer whales,

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:53.143
wolves, elephants:

00:10:53.167 --> 00:10:54.778
that's not how they see it."

00:10:55.714 --> 00:11:00.008
That tall-finned male is L41.

00:11:00.032 --> 00:11:02.079
He's 38 years old.

00:11:02.103 --> 00:11:05.575
The female right on his left side is L22.

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:07.451
She's 44.

00:11:07.475 --> 00:11:10.110
They've known each other for decades.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.622
They know exactly who they are.

00:11:12.646 --> 00:11:14.197
They know who their friends are.

00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:15.919
They know who their rivals are.

00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:18.056
Their life follows the arc of a career.

00:11:18.802 --> 00:11:21.036
They know where they are all the time.

00:11:22.863 --> 00:11:25.238
This is an elephant named Philo.

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:27.495
He was a young male.

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:29.337
This is him four days later.

00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:36.329
Humans not only can feel grief,
we create an awful lot of it.

00:11:38.648 --> 00:11:40.962
We want to carve their teeth.

00:11:42.153 --> 00:11:45.457
Why can't we wait for them to die?

00:11:47.998 --> 00:11:51.466
Elephants once ranged from the shores
of the Mediterranean Sea

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.565
all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope.

00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:56.975
In 1980, there were vast
strongholds of elephant range

00:11:56.999 --> 00:11:59.187
in Central and Eastern Africa.

00:11:59.211 --> 00:12:03.548
And now their range is shattered
into little shards.

00:12:03.572 --> 00:12:08.251
This is the geography of an animal
that we are driving to extinction,

00:12:08.275 --> 00:12:12.124
a fellow being, the most
magnificent creature on land.

00:12:13.288 --> 00:12:17.316
Of course, we take much better care
of our wildlife in the United States.

00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:21.916
In Yellowstone National Park,
we killed every single wolf.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.389
We killed every single wolf
south of the Canadian border, actually.

00:12:25.413 --> 00:12:29.806
But in the park, park rangers
did that in the 1920s,

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.421
and then 60 years later
they had to bring them back,

00:12:32.445 --> 00:12:35.352
because the elk numbers
had gotten out of control.

00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:37.785
And then people came.

00:12:37.809 --> 00:12:41.533
People came by the thousands
to see the wolves,

00:12:41.557 --> 00:12:45.052
the most accessibly
visible wolves in the world.

00:12:45.512 --> 00:12:48.764
And I went there and I watched
this incredible family of wolves.

00:12:48.788 --> 00:12:50.241
A pack is a family.

00:12:50.265 --> 00:12:53.840
It has some breeding adults
and the young of several generations.

00:12:55.158 --> 00:12:59.774
And I watched the most famous, most stable
pack in Yellowstone National Park.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.500
And then, when they wandered
just outside the border,

00:13:03.524 --> 00:13:06.205
two of their adults were killed,

00:13:06.229 --> 00:13:08.482
including the mother,

00:13:08.506 --> 00:13:10.684
which we sometimes call the alpha female.

00:13:11.502 --> 00:13:15.745
The rest of the family immediately
descended into sibling rivalry.

00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:19.112
Sisters kicked out other sisters.

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:23.046
That one on the left tried for days
to rejoin her family.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.762
They wouldn't let her
because they were jealous of her.

00:13:25.786 --> 00:13:28.599
She was getting too much attention
from two new males,

00:13:28.623 --> 00:13:30.641
and she was the precocious one.

00:13:30.665 --> 00:13:32.318
That was too much for them.

00:13:32.342 --> 00:13:35.067
She wound up wandering
outside the park and getting shot.

00:13:36.463 --> 00:13:39.872
The alpha male wound up
being ejected from his own family.

00:13:40.436 --> 00:13:42.439
As winter was coming in,

00:13:42.463 --> 00:13:46.213
he lost his territory,
his hunting support,

00:13:46.237 --> 00:13:48.708
the members of his family and his mate.

00:13:50.883 --> 00:13:54.507
We cause so much pain to them.

00:13:55.665 --> 00:14:00.625
The mystery is, why don't
they hurt us more than they do?

00:14:01.855 --> 00:14:05.053
This whale had just finished eating
part of a grey whale

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:07.656
with his companions
who had killed that whale.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.764
Those people in the boat
had nothing at all to fear.

00:14:11.999 --> 00:14:13.988
This whale is T20.

00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:18.739
He had just finished tearing a seal
into three pieces with two companions.

00:14:19.168 --> 00:14:21.860
The seal weighed about as much
as the people in the boat.

00:14:21.884 --> 00:14:23.387
They had nothing to fear.

00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:25.611
They eat seals.

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.385
Why don't they eat us?

00:14:30.823 --> 00:14:34.583
Why can we trust them around our toddlers?

00:14:36.488 --> 00:14:42.390
Why is it that killer whales have returned
to researchers lost in thick fog

00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:45.744
and led them miles until the fog parted

00:14:45.768 --> 00:14:48.933
and the researchers' home
was right there on the shoreline?

00:14:48.957 --> 00:14:50.973
And that's happened more than one time.

00:14:53.171 --> 00:14:55.746
In the Bahamas, there's a woman
named Denise Herzing,

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.094
and she studies spotted dolphins
and they know her.

00:14:59.118 --> 00:15:01.716
She knows them very well.
She knows who they all are.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.002
They know her.
They recognize the research boat.

00:15:04.026 --> 00:15:06.256
When she shows up,
it's a big happy reunion.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.595
Except, one time showed up and they
didn't want to come near the boat,

00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:11.693
and that was really strange.

00:15:11.717 --> 00:15:13.881
And they couldn't figure out
what was going on

00:15:13.905 --> 00:15:15.405
until somebody came out on deck

00:15:15.429 --> 00:15:18.064
and announced that one
of the people onboard had died

00:15:18.088 --> 00:15:19.859
during a nap in his bunk.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.666
How could dolphins know
that one of the human hearts

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.159
had just stopped?

00:15:26.818 --> 00:15:29.108
Why would they care?

00:15:29.132 --> 00:15:31.325
And why would it spook them?

00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:38.410
These mysterious things just hint at
all of the things that are going on

00:15:38.434 --> 00:15:41.176
in the minds that are with us on Earth

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.431
that we almost never think about at all.

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:48.430
At an aquarium in South Africa

00:15:48.454 --> 00:15:51.678
was a little baby bottle-nosed
dolphin named Dolly.

00:15:52.178 --> 00:15:58.322
She was nursing, and one day
a keeper took a cigarette break

00:15:58.346 --> 00:16:02.453
and he was looking into the window
into their pool, smoking.

00:16:02.477 --> 00:16:04.851
Dolly came over and looked at him,

00:16:04.875 --> 00:16:08.753
went back to her mother,
nursed for a minute or two,

00:16:08.777 --> 00:16:10.580
came back to the window

00:16:10.604 --> 00:16:16.269
and released a cloud of milk
that enveloped her head like smoke.

00:16:16.293 --> 00:16:19.399
Somehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin

00:16:19.423 --> 00:16:23.712
got the idea of using milk
to represent smoke.

00:16:24.211 --> 00:16:27.559
When human beings use one thing
to represent another,

00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:29.608
we call that art.

00:16:29.632 --> 00:16:31.655
(Laughter)

00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:33.210
The things that make us human

00:16:33.234 --> 00:16:36.314
are not the things
that we think make us human.

00:16:36.781 --> 00:16:39.105
What makes us human is that,

00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:42.265
of all these things that our minds
and their minds have,

00:16:42.289 --> 00:16:44.529
we are the most extreme.

00:16:46.347 --> 00:16:48.636
We are the most compassionate,

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.677
most violent, most creative

00:16:51.701 --> 00:16:56.361
and most destructive animal
that has ever been on this planet,

00:16:56.385 --> 00:17:00.109
and we are all of those things
all jumbled up together.

00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:05.579
But love is not the thing
that makes us human.

00:17:06.242 --> 00:17:08.594
It's not special to us.

00:17:09.674 --> 00:17:13.645
We are not the only ones
who care about our mates.

00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:17.007
We are not the only ones
who care about our children.

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:23.874
Albatrosses frequently fly six,
sometimes ten thousand miles

00:17:23.898 --> 00:17:28.385
over several weeks to deliver
one meal, one big meal,

00:17:28.409 --> 00:17:30.385
to their chick who is waiting for them.

00:17:30.835 --> 00:17:35.233
They nest on the most remote islands
in the oceans of the world,

00:17:35.257 --> 00:17:37.630
and this is what it looks like.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:43.550
Passing life from one generation
to the next is the chain of being.

00:17:43.574 --> 00:17:46.550
If that stops, it all goes away.

00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:51.625
If anything is sacred, that is,
and into that sacred relationship

00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:54.480
comes our plastic trash.

00:17:54.504 --> 00:17:57.191
All of these birds
have plastic in them now.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.641
This is an albatross six months old,
ready to fledge --

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:06.666
died, packed with red cigarette lighters.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.975
This is not the relationship
we are supposed to have

00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:11.585
with the rest of the world.

00:18:11.609 --> 00:18:14.933
But we, who have named
ourselves after our brains,

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:19.581
never think about the consequences.

00:18:21.041 --> 00:18:24.161
When we welcome new
human life into the world,

00:18:24.185 --> 00:18:28.688
we welcome our babies
into the company of other creatures.

00:18:28.712 --> 00:18:30.805
We paint animals on the walls.

00:18:30.829 --> 00:18:32.657
We don't paint cell phones.

00:18:32.681 --> 00:18:34.824
We don't paint work cubicles.

00:18:34.848 --> 00:18:38.749
We paint animals to show them
that we are not alone.

00:18:39.316 --> 00:18:41.059
We have company.

00:18:42.527 --> 00:18:47.267
And every one of those animals
in every painting of Noah's ark,

00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:51.631
deemed worthy of salvation
is in mortal danger now,

00:18:51.655 --> 00:18:53.908
and their flood is us.

00:18:55.704 --> 00:18:58.003
So we started with a question:

00:18:58.027 --> 00:18:59.891
Do they love us?

00:19:01.999 --> 00:19:04.047
We're going to ask another question.

00:19:04.999 --> 00:19:08.609
Are we capable of using what we have

00:19:09.918 --> 00:19:14.091
to care enough to simply
let them continue?

00:19:16.725 --> 00:19:18.066
Thank you very much.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:23.730
(Applause)
