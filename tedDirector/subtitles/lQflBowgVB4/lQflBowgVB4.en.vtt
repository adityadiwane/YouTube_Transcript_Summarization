00:00:12.782 --> 00:00:14.687
Imagine you're in Rome,

00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:17.914
and you've made your way
to the Vatican Museums.

00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.544
And you've been shuffling
down long corridors,

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:26.008
past statues, frescoes,
lots and lots of stuff.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.725
You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:34.125
At last -- a long corridor,
a stair and a door.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.147
You're at the threshold
of the Sistine Chapel.

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:38.935
So what are you expecting?

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:41.483
Soaring domes? Choirs of angels?

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:43.665
We don't really have any of that there.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.998
Instead, you may ask yourself,
what do we have?

00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:50.646
Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.625
And I mean literally, you're surrounded
by painted curtains,

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.064
the original decoration of this chapel.

00:00:56.088 --> 00:01:00.632
Churches used tapestries not just
to keep out cold during long masses,

00:01:00.656 --> 00:01:04.111
but as a way to represent
the great theater of life.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:09.762
The human drama in which each one of us
plays a part is a great story,

00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:12.595
a story that encompasses the whole world

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.684
and that came to unfold
in the three stages

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.950
of the painting in the Sistine Chapel.

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:21.743
Now, this building started out
as a space for a small group

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:24.109
of wealthy, educated Christian priests.

00:01:24.528 --> 00:01:27.205
They prayed there.
They elected their pope there.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.381
Five hundred years ago,

00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:30.912
it was the ultimate
ecclesiastical man cave.

00:01:31.548 --> 00:01:37.419
So, you may ask, how can it be
that today it attracts and delights

00:01:37.443 --> 00:01:40.109
five million people a year,

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.372
from all different backgrounds?

00:01:42.396 --> 00:01:46.932
Because in that compressed space,
there was a creative explosion,

00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:51.788
ignited by the electric excitement
of new geopolitical frontiers,

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:56.107
which set on fire the ancient
missionary tradition of the Church

00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:59.409
and produced one of the greatest
works of art in history.

00:02:00.064 --> 00:02:04.578
Now, this development took place
as a great evolution,

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:07.337
moving from the beginning of a few elite,

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:10.792
and eventually able to speak
to audiences of people

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:12.838
that come from all over the world.

00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:15.976
This evolution took place in three stages,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.111
each one linked
to a historical circumstance.

00:02:19.135 --> 00:02:21.166
The first one was rather limited in scope.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.723
It reflected the rather
parochial perspective.

00:02:24.096 --> 00:02:28.350
The second one took place after
worldviews were dramatically altered

00:02:28.374 --> 00:02:31.065
after Columbus's historical voyage;

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.496
and the third,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.496
when the Age of Discovery
was well under way

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.029
and the Church rose to the challenge

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:39.456
of going global.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.342
The original decoration of this church
reflected a smaller world.

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:45.680
There were busy scenes

00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:49.561
that told the stories of the lives
of Jesus and Moses,

00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:53.622
reflecting the development
of the Jewish and Christian people.

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:55.983
The man who commissioned this,
Pope Sixtus IV,

00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.326
assembled a dream team of Florentine art,

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.249
including men like Sandro Botticelli

00:03:02.273 --> 00:03:05.850
and the man who would become
Michelangelo's future painting teacher,

00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:07.412
Ghirlandaio.

00:03:07.436 --> 00:03:12.781
These men, they blanketed the walls
with a frieze of pure color,

00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:16.106
and in these stories you'll notice
familiar landscapes,

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.996
the artists using Roman monuments
or a Tuscan landscape

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.448
to render a faraway story,
something much more familiar.

00:03:23.472 --> 00:03:27.117
With the addition of images
of the Pope's friends and family,

00:03:27.141 --> 00:03:29.974
this was a perfect decoration
for a small court

00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:31.767
limited to the European continent.

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:37.114
But in 1492, the New World was discovered,

00:03:37.138 --> 00:03:39.082
horizons were expanding,

00:03:39.106 --> 00:03:45.462
and this little 133 by 46-foot
microcosm had to expand as well.

00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:46.806
And it did,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.782
thanks to a creative genius,

00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:51.623
a visionary and an awesome story.

00:03:52.208 --> 00:03:54.757
Now, the creative genius
was Michelangelo Buonarroti,

00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:59.171
33 years old when he was tapped
to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling,

00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:01.076
and the deck was stacked against him --

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.996
he had trained in painting
but had left to pursue sculpture.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.478
There were angry patrons in Florence
because he had left a stack

00:04:07.502 --> 00:04:09.176
of incomplete commissions,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.863
lured to Rome by the prospect
of a great sculptural project,

00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:15.468
and that project had fallen through.

00:04:15.492 --> 00:04:18.621
And he had been left with a commission
to paint 12 apostles

00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:21.566
against a decorative background
in the Sistine Chapel ceiling,

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.128
which would look like
every other ceiling in Italy.

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:27.446
But genius rose to the challenge.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.968
In an age when a man dared
to sail across the Atlantic Ocean,

00:04:30.992 --> 00:04:34.520
Michelangelo dared to chart
new artistic waters.

00:04:35.027 --> 00:04:37.263
He, too, would tell a story --

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:40.819
no Apostles -- but a story
of great beginnings,

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:42.515
the story of Genesis.

00:04:43.087 --> 00:04:46.018
Not really an easy sell,
stories on a ceiling.

00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:50.850
How would you be able to read
a busy scene from 62 feet below?

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.729
The painting technique that had been
handed on for 200 years

00:04:53.753 --> 00:04:57.067
in Florentine studios was not equipped
for this kind of a narrative.

00:04:57.694 --> 00:05:00.662
But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter,

00:05:00.686 --> 00:05:02.970
and so he played to his strengths.

00:05:02.994 --> 00:05:06.476
Instead of being accustomed
to filling space with busyness,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.299
he took a hammer and chisel
and hacked away at a piece of marble

00:05:10.323 --> 00:05:12.753
to reveal the figure within.

00:05:12.777 --> 00:05:14.945
Michelangelo was an essentialist;

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:19.355
he would tell his story
in massive, dynamic bodies.

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:24.146
This plan was embraced
by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.791
a man who was unafraid
of Michelangelo's brazen genius.

00:05:27.815 --> 00:05:29.697
He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,

00:05:29.721 --> 00:05:33.828
and he had been steeped in art
for 30 years and he knew its power.

00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:36.916
And history has handed down the moniker
of the Warrior Pope,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.730
but this man's legacy to the Vatican --
it wasn't fortresses and artillery,

00:05:40.754 --> 00:05:42.070
it was art.

00:05:42.094 --> 00:05:44.673
He left us the Raphael Rooms,
the Sistine Chapel.

00:05:44.697 --> 00:05:46.342
He left St. Peter's Basilica

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:52.069
as well as an extraordinary collection
of Greco-Roman sculptures --

00:05:52.093 --> 00:05:56.233
decidedly un-Christian works
that would become the seedbed

00:05:56.257 --> 00:06:00.142
of the world's first modern museum,
the Vatican Museums.

00:06:00.847 --> 00:06:02.271
Julius was a man

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:06.079
who envisioned a Vatican
that would be eternally relevant

00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:08.192
through grandeur and through beauty,

00:06:08.216 --> 00:06:09.588
and he was right.

00:06:09.612 --> 00:06:14.600
The encounter between these two giants,
Michelangelo and Julius II,

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.061
that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.

00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:20.428
Michelangelo was so committed
to this project,

00:06:20.452 --> 00:06:24.835
that he succeeded in getting the job done
in three and a half years,

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:29.128
using a skeleton crew and spending
most of the time, hours on end,

00:06:29.152 --> 00:06:32.843
reaching up above his head
to paint the stories on the ceiling.

00:06:33.424 --> 00:06:35.474
So let's look at this ceiling

00:06:35.498 --> 00:06:38.329
and see storytelling gone global.

00:06:38.353 --> 00:06:42.765
No more familiar artistic references
to the world around you.

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.432
There's just space
and structure and energy;

00:06:47.456 --> 00:06:52.053
a monumental painted framework
which opens onto nine panels,

00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:56.010
more driven by sculptural form
than painterly color.

00:06:56.034 --> 00:06:59.811
And we stand in the far end
by the entrance,

00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:03.941
far from the altar and from the gated
enclosure intended for the clergy

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:09.212
and we peer into the distance,
looking for a beginning.

00:07:09.236 --> 00:07:13.252
And whether in scientific inquiry
or in biblical tradition,

00:07:13.276 --> 00:07:16.596
we think in terms of a primal spark.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.753
Michelangelo gave us an initial energy

00:07:18.777 --> 00:07:21.518
when he gave us the separation
of light and dark,

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:24.931
a churning figure blurry in the distance,

00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:27.439
compressed into a tight space.

00:07:27.463 --> 00:07:29.792
The next figure looms larger,

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:33.243
and you see a figure hurtling
from one side to the next.

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:38.253
He leaves in his wake
the sun, the moon, vegetation.

00:07:38.277 --> 00:07:42.284
Michelangelo didn't focus
on the stuff that was being created,

00:07:42.308 --> 00:07:44.352
unlike all the other artists.

00:07:44.376 --> 00:07:47.719
He focused on the act of creation.

00:07:47.743 --> 00:07:52.117
And then the movement stops,
like a caesura in poetry

00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:53.393
and the creator hovers.

00:07:53.417 --> 00:07:54.696
So what's he doing?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.575
Is he creating land? Is he creating sea?

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:02.290
Or is he looking back over his handiwork,
the universe and his treasures,

00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:04.045
just like Michelangelo must have,

00:08:04.069 --> 00:08:06.666
looking back over his work in the ceiling

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.484
and proclaiming, "It is good."

00:08:10.388 --> 00:08:12.493
So now the scene is set,

00:08:12.517 --> 00:08:16.195
and you get to the culmination
of creation, which is man.

00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:20.549
Adam leaps to the eye, a light figure
against a dark background.

00:08:20.573 --> 00:08:22.331
But looking closer,

00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:25.007
that leg is pretty languid on the ground,

00:08:25.031 --> 00:08:27.321
the arm is heavy on the knee.

00:08:27.345 --> 00:08:31.022
Adam lacks that interior spark

00:08:31.046 --> 00:08:33.334
that will impel him to greatness.

00:08:33.358 --> 00:08:38.123
That spark is about to be conferred
by the creator in that finger,

00:08:38.147 --> 00:08:40.818
which is one millimeter
from the hand of Adam.

00:08:40.842 --> 00:08:42.787
It puts us at the edge of our seats,

00:08:42.811 --> 00:08:45.826
because we're one moment
from that contact,

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.751
through which that man
will discover his purpose,

00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:51.759
leap up and take his place
at the pinnacle of creation.

00:08:51.783 --> 00:08:55.044
And then Michelangelo threw a curveball.

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:56.896
Who is in that other arm?

00:08:57.531 --> 00:08:59.227
Eve, first woman.

00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:02.160
No, she's not an afterthought.
She's part of the plan.

00:09:02.184 --> 00:09:04.657
She's always been in his mind.

00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:08.886
Look at her, so intimate with God
that her hand curls around his arm.

00:09:09.329 --> 00:09:14.737
And for me, an American art historian
from the 21st century,

00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:17.613
this was the moment
that the painting spoke to me.

00:09:17.637 --> 00:09:20.985
Because I realized that this
representation of the human drama

00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:23.922
was always about men and women --

00:09:23.946 --> 00:09:27.736
so much so, that the dead center,
the heart of the ceiling,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.174
is the creation of woman, not Adam.

00:09:30.198 --> 00:09:34.122
And the fact is, that when you see them
together in the Garden of Eden,

00:09:34.146 --> 00:09:35.683
they fall together

00:09:35.707 --> 00:09:40.099
and together their proud posture
turns into folded shame.

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:43.316
You are at critical juncture
now in the ceiling.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.423
You are exactly at the point
where you and I can go

00:09:46.447 --> 00:09:47.902
no further into the church.

00:09:47.926 --> 00:09:51.282
The gated enclosure keeps us
out of the inner sanctum,

00:09:51.306 --> 00:09:53.819
and we are cast out
much like Adam and Eve.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.599
The remaining scenes in the ceiling,

00:09:55.623 --> 00:09:58.467
they mirror the crowded chaos
of the world around us.

00:09:58.491 --> 00:10:00.715
You have Noah and his Ark and the flood.

00:10:00.739 --> 00:10:04.329
You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice
and a covenant with God.

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:05.639
Maybe he's the savior.

00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:09.763
Oh, but no, Noah is the one
who grew grapes, invented wine,

00:10:09.787 --> 00:10:11.945
got drunk and passed out
naked in his barn.

00:10:12.385 --> 00:10:14.759
It is a curious way to design the ceiling,

00:10:14.783 --> 00:10:16.707
now starting out with God creating life,

00:10:16.731 --> 00:10:19.226
ending up with some guy
blind drunk in a barn.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.706
And so, compared with Adam,

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.248
you might think Michelangelo
is making fun of us.

00:10:24.693 --> 00:10:26.736
But he's about to dispel the gloom

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.278
by using those bright colors
right underneath Noah:

00:10:30.302 --> 00:10:33.692
emerald, topaz, scarlet
on the prophet Zechariah.

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:36.695
Zechariah foresees a light
coming from the east,

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:40.407
and we are turned at this juncture
to a new destination,

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:44.306
with sibyls and prophets
who will lead us on a parade.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.628
You have the heroes and heroines
who make safe the way,

00:10:47.652 --> 00:10:50.136
and we follow the mothers and fathers.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.245
They are the motors of this great
human engine, driving it forward.

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:57.176
And now we're at the keystone
of the ceiling,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.379
the culmination of the whole thing,

00:10:59.403 --> 00:11:02.633
with a figure that looks like
he's about to fall out of his space

00:11:02.657 --> 00:11:03.997
into our space,

00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:05.304
encroaching our space.

00:11:05.328 --> 00:11:07.869
This is the most important juncture.

00:11:07.893 --> 00:11:09.765
Past meets present.

00:11:09.789 --> 00:11:13.005
This figure, Jonah, who spent
three days in the belly of the whale,

00:11:13.029 --> 00:11:15.882
for the Christians, is the symbol
of the renewal of humanity

00:11:15.906 --> 00:11:17.169
through Jesus' sacrifice,

00:11:17.193 --> 00:11:19.941
but for the multitudes
of visitors to that museum

00:11:19.965 --> 00:11:22.735
from all faiths who visit there every day,

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:29.345
he is the moment the distant past
encounters and meets immediate reality.

00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:34.684
All of this brings us to the yawning
archway of the altar wall,

00:11:34.708 --> 00:11:37.471
where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment,

00:11:37.495 --> 00:11:41.361
painted in 1534 after the world
had changed again.

00:11:41.385 --> 00:11:43.409
The Reformation had splintered the Church,

00:11:43.433 --> 00:11:46.301
the Ottoman Empire had made
Islam a household word

00:11:46.325 --> 00:11:49.819
and Magellan had found a route
into the Pacific Ocean.

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:54.505
How is a 59-year-old artist who has never
been any further than Venice

00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:56.723
going to speak to this new world?

00:11:56.747 --> 00:11:59.790
Michelangelo chose to paint destiny,

00:11:59.814 --> 00:12:01.634
that universal desire,

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:03.278
common to all of us,

00:12:03.302 --> 00:12:06.471
to leave a legacy of excellence.

00:12:06.495 --> 00:12:09.426
Told in terms of the Christian vision
of the Last Judgment,

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.762
the end of the world,

00:12:10.786 --> 00:12:13.924
Michelangelo gave you a series of figures

00:12:13.948 --> 00:12:17.103
who are wearing these
strikingly beautiful bodies.

00:12:17.127 --> 00:12:19.849
They have no more covers,
no more portraits

00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:21.110
except for a couple.

00:12:21.134 --> 00:12:23.852
It's a composition only out of bodies,

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:27.262
391, no two alike,

00:12:27.286 --> 00:12:29.740
unique like each and every one of us.

00:12:29.764 --> 00:12:33.506
They start in the lower corner,
breaking away from the ground,

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.252
struggling and trying to rise.

00:12:36.276 --> 00:12:38.732
Those who have risen
reach back to help others,

00:12:38.756 --> 00:12:40.593
and in one amazing vignette,

00:12:40.617 --> 00:12:43.709
you have a black man and a white man
pulled up together

00:12:43.733 --> 00:12:46.455
in an incredible vision of human unity

00:12:46.479 --> 00:12:47.921
in this new world.

00:12:47.945 --> 00:12:51.452
The lion's share of the space
goes to the winner's circle.

00:12:51.476 --> 00:12:56.312
There you find men and women
completely nude like athletes.

00:12:56.336 --> 00:12:58.648
They are the ones
who have overcome adversity,

00:12:58.672 --> 00:13:02.386
and Michelangelo's vision
of people who combat adversity,

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.684
overcome obstacles --

00:13:03.708 --> 00:13:05.602
they're just like athletes.

00:13:05.626 --> 00:13:09.055
So you have men and women
flexing and posing

00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:11.163
in this extraordinary spotlight.

00:13:11.555 --> 00:13:14.100
Presiding over this assembly is Jesus,

00:13:14.124 --> 00:13:16.142
first a suffering man on the cross,

00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:18.570
now a glorious ruler in Heaven.

00:13:18.594 --> 00:13:21.612
And as Michelangelo
proved in his painting,

00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:24.214
hardship, setbacks and obstacles,

00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:27.472
they don't limit excellence,
they forge it.

00:13:28.276 --> 00:13:30.864
Now, this does lead us to one odd thing.

00:13:30.888 --> 00:13:32.705
This is the Pope's private chapel,

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:35.886
and the best way you can describe that
is indeed a stew of nudes.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.673
But Michelangelo was trying to use
only the best artistic language,

00:13:39.697 --> 00:13:42.285
the most universal artistic language
he could think of:

00:13:42.309 --> 00:13:44.069
that of the human body.

00:13:44.093 --> 00:13:49.899
And so instead of the way of showing
virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery,

00:13:49.923 --> 00:13:54.188
he borrowed from Julius II's
wonderful collection of sculptures

00:13:54.212 --> 00:13:58.463
in order to show inner strength
as external power.

00:13:59.368 --> 00:14:02.733
Now, one contemporary did write

00:14:02.757 --> 00:14:06.615
that the chapel was too beautiful
to not cause controversy.

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:07.988
And so it did.

00:14:08.012 --> 00:14:11.550
Michelangelo soon found
that thanks to the printing press,

00:14:11.574 --> 00:14:14.696
complaints about the nudity
spread all over the place,

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.016
and soon his masterpiece of human drama
was labeled pornography,

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.215
at which point he added
two more portraits,

00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:23.723
one of the man who criticized him,
a papal courtier,

00:14:23.747 --> 00:14:27.879
and the other one of himself
as a dried up husk, no athlete,

00:14:27.903 --> 00:14:30.324
in the hands of a long-suffering martyr.

00:14:30.348 --> 00:14:34.016
The year he died he saw
several of these figures covered over,

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.659
a triumph for trivial distractions
over his great exhortation to glory.

00:14:40.167 --> 00:14:41.931
And so now we stand

00:14:41.955 --> 00:14:43.685
in the here and now.

00:14:43.709 --> 00:14:46.029
We are caught in that space

00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:48.318
between beginnings and endings,

00:14:48.342 --> 00:14:52.574
in the great, huge totality
of the human experience.

00:14:52.598 --> 00:14:56.569
The Sistine Chapel forces us
to look around as if it were a mirror.

00:14:56.593 --> 00:14:57.890
Who am I in this picture?

00:14:57.914 --> 00:14:59.220
Am I one of the crowd?

00:14:59.244 --> 00:15:00.617
Am I the drunk guy?

00:15:00.641 --> 00:15:02.097
Am I the athlete?

00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:04.381
And as we leave this haven
of uplifting beauty,

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:08.349
we are inspired to ask ourselves
life's biggest questions:

00:15:08.373 --> 00:15:13.211
Who am I, and what role do I play
in this great theater of life?

00:15:13.549 --> 00:15:14.720
Thank you.

00:15:14.744 --> 00:15:18.192
(Applause)

00:15:18.216 --> 00:15:21.187
Bruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.

00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:25.067
Elizabeth, you mentioned
this whole issue of pornography,

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:29.904
too many nudes and too many
daily life scenes and improper things

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.420
in the eyes of the time.

00:15:32.444 --> 00:15:34.050
But actually the story is bigger.

00:15:34.074 --> 00:15:37.094
It's not just touching up
and covering up some of the figures.

00:15:37.118 --> 00:15:39.742
This work of art was almost
destroyed because of that.

00:15:40.383 --> 00:15:43.408
Elizabeth Lev: The effect
of the Last Judgment was enormous.

00:15:43.432 --> 00:15:46.382
The printing press made sure
that everybody saw it.

00:15:46.406 --> 00:15:49.691
And so, this wasn't something
that happened within a couple of weeks.

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:54.183
It was something that happened
over the space of 20 years

00:15:54.207 --> 00:15:56.131
of editorials and complaints,

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:57.323
saying to the Church,

00:15:57.347 --> 00:15:59.922
"You can't possibly tell us
how to live our lives.

00:15:59.946 --> 00:16:03.286
Did you notice you have
pornography in the Pope's chapel?"

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.770
And so after complaints and insistence

00:16:05.794 --> 00:16:08.510
of trying to get this work destroyed,

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:10.695
it was finally the year
that Michelangelo died

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:12.800
that the Church finally
found a compromise,

00:16:12.824 --> 00:16:14.355
a way to save the painting,

00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:17.696
and that was in putting up
these extra 30 covers,

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.467
and that happens to be
the origin of fig-leafing.

00:16:20.491 --> 00:16:22.079
That's where it all came about,

00:16:22.103 --> 00:16:26.233
and it came about from a church
that was trying to save a work of art,

00:16:26.257 --> 00:16:28.428
not indeed deface or destroyed it.

00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:31.675
BG: This, what you just gave us,
is not the classic tour

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:34.673
that people get today
when they go to the Sistine Chapel.

00:16:34.697 --> 00:16:36.800
(Laughter)

00:16:36.824 --> 00:16:38.605
EL: I don't know, is that an ad?

00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:40.306
(Laughter)

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.318
BG: No, no, no, not necessarily,
it is a statement.

00:16:43.342 --> 00:16:47.256
The experience of art today
is encountering problems.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.155
Too many people want to see this there,

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:53.306
and the result is five million people
going through that tiny door

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.647
and experiencing it
in a completely different way

00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:56.837
than we just did.

00:16:56.861 --> 00:17:00.390
EL: Right. I agree. I think it's really
nice to be able to pause and look.

00:17:00.414 --> 00:17:02.715
But also realize,
even when you're in those days,

00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:04.751
with 28,000 people a day,

00:17:04.775 --> 00:17:07.885
even those days when you're in there
with all those other people,

00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:10.314
look around you and think
how amazing it is

00:17:10.338 --> 00:17:13.934
that some painted plaster
from 500 years ago

00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:17.066
can still draw all those people
standing side by side with you,

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:19.065
looking upwards with their jaws dropped.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:24.014
It's a great statement about how beauty
truly can speak to us all

00:17:24.038 --> 00:17:26.725
through time and through geographic space.

00:17:26.749 --> 00:17:27.943
BG: Liz, grazie.

00:17:27.967 --> 00:17:29.174
EL: Grazie a te.

00:17:29.198 --> 00:17:30.374
BG: Thank you.

00:17:30.398 --> 00:17:32.261
(Applause)
