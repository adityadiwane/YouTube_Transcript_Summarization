00:00:15.814 --> 00:00:18.045
It's wonderful to be here

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:20.131
to talk about my journey,

00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:21.865
to talk about the wheelchair

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:24.505
and the freedom it has bought me.

00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:27.142
I started using a wheelchair 16 years ago

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:29.276
when an extended illness

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:32.862
changed the way I could access the world.

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:35.239
When I started using the wheelchair,

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.824
it was a tremendous new freedom.

00:00:37.824 --> 00:00:40.910
I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.480
It was like having an enormous new toy.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.510
I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.018
Just being out on the street was exhilarating.

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:55.420
But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.972
people's reaction completely changed towards me.

00:00:58.972 --> 00:01:01.452
It was as if they couldn't see me anymore,

00:01:01.452 --> 00:01:05.451
as if an invisibility cloak had descended.

00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:08.672
They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:12.900
of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.812
When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair,

00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:21.366
they used words like "limitation," "fear,"

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:24.391
"pity" and "restriction."

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:29.160
I realized I'd internalized these responses

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.697
and it had changed who I was on a core level.

00:01:32.697 --> 00:01:36.887
A part of me had become alienated from myself.

00:01:36.887 --> 00:01:40.472
I was seeing myself not from my perspective,

00:01:40.472 --> 00:01:44.634
but vividly and continuously from the perspective

00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:47.531
of other people's responses to me.

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:52.656
As a result, I knew I needed to make my own stories

00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:54.895
about this experience,

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:57.671
new narratives to reclaim my identity.

00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:00.775
["Finding Freedom: 'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.' â€” Davis 2009, TEDx Women"]

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:02.853
I started making work

00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:05.669
that aimed to communicate something

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:10.787
of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair --

00:02:10.787 --> 00:02:15.401
a power chair -- to negotiate the world.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:21.986
I was working to transform these internalized responses,

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:25.781
to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped

00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:28.962
my identity when I started using a wheelchair,

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:32.726
by creating unexpected images.

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:38.947
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with.

00:02:38.947 --> 00:02:40.988
When I literally started leaving

00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:44.554
traces of my joy and freedom,

00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:46.502
it was exciting to see

00:02:46.502 --> 00:02:51.004
the interested and surprised responses from people.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.893
It seemed to open up new perspectives,

00:02:53.893 --> 00:02:56.788
and therein lay the paradigm shift.

00:02:56.788 --> 00:02:58.862
It showed that an arts practice

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:01.205
can remake one's identity

00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:05.989
and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar.

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.902
So when I began to dive, in 2005,

00:03:09.902 --> 00:03:13.428
I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity

00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:16.087
in just the same way as a wheelchair does,

00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:18.679
but the associations attached to scuba gear

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.279
are ones of excitement and adventure,

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:25.103
completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair.

00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:28.247
So I thought, "I wonder what'll happen

00:03:28.247 --> 00:03:32.559
if I put the two together?" (Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:36.751
And the underwater wheelchair that has resulted

00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:39.458
has taken me on the most amazing journey

00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:41.727
over the last seven years.

00:03:41.727 --> 00:03:45.215
So to give you an idea of what that's like,

00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:48.101
I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes

00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:50.197
from creating this spectacle,

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:53.998
and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on.

00:03:53.998 --> 00:04:02.838
(Music)

00:07:23.695 --> 00:07:30.496
(Applause)

00:07:30.496 --> 00:07:33.475
It is the most amazing experience,

00:07:33.475 --> 00:07:37.116
beyond most other things I've experienced in life.

00:07:37.116 --> 00:07:40.213
I literally have the freedom to move

00:07:40.213 --> 00:07:42.852
in 360 degrees of space

00:07:42.852 --> 00:07:46.612
and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom.

00:07:46.612 --> 00:07:49.229
And the incredibly unexpected thing

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:53.419
is that other people seem to see and feel that too.

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:55.797
Their eyes literally light up,

00:07:55.797 --> 00:07:59.051
and they say things like, "I want one of those,"

00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:02.733
or, "If you can do that, I can do anything."

00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:06.355
And I'm thinking, it's because in that moment

00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:08.908
of them seeing an object

00:08:08.908 --> 00:08:10.819
they have no frame of reference for,

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:13.619
or so transcends the frames of reference

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:15.364
they have with the wheelchair,

00:08:15.364 --> 00:08:18.396
they have to think in a completely new way.

00:08:18.396 --> 00:08:22.740
And I think that moment of completely new thought

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.238
perhaps creates a freedom

00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:29.264
that spreads to the rest of other people's lives.

00:08:29.264 --> 00:08:32.456
For me, this means that they're seeing

00:08:32.456 --> 00:08:34.806
the value of difference,

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.726
the joy it brings

00:08:36.726 --> 00:08:40.546
when instead of focusing on loss or limitation,

00:08:40.546 --> 00:08:44.950
we see and discover the power and joy

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:49.357
of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives.

00:08:49.357 --> 00:08:51.056
For me, the wheelchair becomes

00:08:51.056 --> 00:08:53.401
a vehicle for transformation.

00:08:53.401 --> 00:08:57.181
In fact, I now call the underwater wheelchair "Portal,"

00:08:57.181 --> 00:08:59.385
because it's literally pushed me through

00:08:59.385 --> 00:09:01.263
into a new way of being,

00:09:01.263 --> 00:09:04.997
into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness.

00:09:04.997 --> 00:09:06.542
And the other thing is,

00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:09.014
that because nobody's seen or heard

00:09:09.014 --> 00:09:11.509
of an underwater wheelchair before,

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:14.352
and creating this spectacle is about creating

00:09:14.352 --> 00:09:17.189
new ways of seeing, being and knowing,

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:20.137
now you have this concept in your mind.

00:09:20.137 --> 00:09:23.936
You're all part of the artwork too.

00:09:23.936 --> 00:09:31.458
(Applause)
