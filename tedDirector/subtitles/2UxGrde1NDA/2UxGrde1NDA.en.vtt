00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:15.737
I'd like to introduce you to an organism:

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:19.193
a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.

00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:22.015
It's a mold with an identity
crisis, because it's not a mold,

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:23.945
so let's get that straight to start with.

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:26.481
It is one of 700 known slime molds

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:28.618
belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba.

00:00:28.618 --> 00:00:31.241
It is a single-celled organism, a cell,

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:33.481
that joins together with other cells

00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:35.713
to form a mass super-cell

00:00:35.713 --> 00:00:37.953
to maximize its resources.

00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:40.113
So within a slime mold you might find thousands

00:00:40.113 --> 00:00:42.360
or millions of nuclei,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.121
all sharing a cell wall,

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:47.229
all operating as one entity.

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:48.833
In its natural habitat,

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.629
you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands,

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.330
eating rotting vegetation,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.870
but you might equally find it

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.412
in research laboratories,

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:02.614
classrooms, and even artists' studios.

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:05.549
I first came across the slime
mold about five years ago.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.106
A microbiologist friend of mine

00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:10.230
gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.238
and told me to go home and play with it.

00:01:13.238 --> 00:01:15.245
The only instructions I was given,

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:17.029
that it likes it dark and damp

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:21.360
and its favorite food is porridge oats.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.378
I'm an artist who's worked for many years

00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:26.225
with biology, with scientific processes,

00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:29.236
so living material is not uncommon for me.

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:31.341
I've worked with plants, bacteria,

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:32.860
cuttlefish, fruit flies.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.462
So I was keen to get my new collaborator home

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:36.838
to see what it could do.

00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:40.040
So I took it home and I watched.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.810
I fed it a varied diet.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.734
I observed as it networked.

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:47.010
It formed a connection between food sources.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.848
I watched it leave a trail behind it,

00:01:49.848 --> 00:01:51.607
indicating where it had been.

00:01:51.607 --> 00:01:54.555
And I noticed that when it was
fed up with one petri dish,

00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:57.534
it would escape and find a better home.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.262
I captured my observations

00:01:59.262 --> 00:02:01.022
through time-lapse photography.

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:03.860
Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.441
so it's not really ideal for live viewing

00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:09.294
unless there's some form of
really extreme meditation,

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:11.822
but through the time lapse,

00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:14.918
I could observe some really interesting behaviors.

00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:18.418
For instance, having fed on a nice pile of oats,

00:02:18.418 --> 00:02:22.862
the slime mold goes off to explore new territories

00:02:22.862 --> 00:02:25.594
in different directions simultaneously.

00:02:25.594 --> 00:02:27.833
When it meets itself,

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:29.700
it knows it's already there,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.654
it recognizes it's there,

00:02:31.654 --> 00:02:33.201
and instead retreats back

00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:36.881
and grows in other directions.

00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:39.205
I was quite impressed by this feat,

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:42.755
at how what was essentially
just a bag of cellular slime

00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:45.985
could somehow map its territory,

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:49.457
know itself, and move with seeming intention.

00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:53.110
I found countless scientific studies,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.155
research papers, journal articles,

00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:59.379
all citing incredible work with this one organism,

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.343
and I'm going to share a few of those with you.

00:03:01.343 --> 00:03:04.303
For example, a team in Hokkaido University in Japan

00:03:04.303 --> 00:03:06.335
filled a maze with slime mold.

00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:08.431
It joined together and formed a mass cell.

00:03:08.431 --> 00:03:10.783
They introduced food at two points,

00:03:10.783 --> 00:03:11.981
oats of course,

00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.627
and it formed a connection

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:15.041
between the food.

00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.525
It retracted from empty areas and dead ends.

00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:20.335
There are four possible routes through this maze,

00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:22.440
yet time and time again,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.607
the slime mold established the shortest

00:03:24.607 --> 00:03:27.060
and the most efficient route.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.311
Quite clever.

00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:30.050
The conclusion from their experiment

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.047
was that the slime mold had
a primitive form of intelligence.

00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:36.910
Another study exposed cold air at
regular intervals to the slime mold.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.255
It didn't like it. It doesn't like it cold.

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:40.448
It doesn't like it dry.

00:03:40.448 --> 00:03:42.563
They did this at repeat intervals,

00:03:42.563 --> 00:03:44.221
and each time, the slime mold

00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:47.351
slowed down its growth in response.

00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.195
However, at the next interval,

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:52.019
the researchers didn't put the cold air on,

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.313
yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation

00:03:55.313 --> 00:03:56.649
of it happening.

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:59.175
It somehow knew that it was about the time

00:03:59.175 --> 00:04:01.131
for the cold air that it didn't like.

00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:02.820
The conclusion from their experiment

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.090
was that the slime mold was able to learn.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.321
A third experiment:

00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:09.088
the slime mold was invited

00:04:09.088 --> 00:04:13.280
to explore a territory covered in oats.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.327
It fans out in a branching pattern.

00:04:16.327 --> 00:04:18.975
As it goes, each food node it finds,

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:21.675
it forms a network, a connection to,

00:04:21.675 --> 00:04:23.423
and keeps foraging.

00:04:23.423 --> 00:04:25.864
After 26 hours, it established

00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:27.481
quite a firm network

00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:29.271
between the different oats.

00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:31.091
Now there's nothing remarkable in this

00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.503
until you learn that the center oat that it started from

00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:35.517
represents the city of Tokyo,

00:04:35.517 --> 00:04:39.583
and the surrounding oats are
suburban railway stations.

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:42.064
The slime mold had replicated

00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:44.480
the Tokyo transport network

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.135
— (Laughter) —

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:49.130
a complex system developed over time

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.030
by community dwellings, civil
engineering, urban planning.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.303
What had taken us well over 100 years

00:04:55.303 --> 00:04:58.469
took the slime mold just over a day.

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.122
The conclusion from their experiment

00:05:00.122 --> 00:05:02.632
was that the slime mold can form efficient networks

00:05:02.632 --> 00:05:05.255
and solve the traveling salesman problem.

00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:07.519
It is a biological computer.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:10.143
As such, it has been mathematically modeled,

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.804
algorithmically analyzed.

00:05:11.804 --> 00:05:14.509
It's been sonified, replicated, simulated.

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.479
World over, teams of researchers

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.449
are decoding its biological principles

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.590
to understand its computational rules

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.844
and applying that learning
to the fields of electronics,

00:05:24.844 --> 00:05:27.080
programming and robotics.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.234
So the question is,

00:05:29.234 --> 00:05:31.254
how does this thing work?

00:05:31.254 --> 00:05:33.414
It doesn't have a central nervous system.

00:05:33.414 --> 00:05:35.112
It doesn't have a brain,

00:05:35.112 --> 00:05:36.940
yet it can perform behaviors

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.928
that we associate with brain function.

00:05:38.928 --> 00:05:40.836
It can learn, it can remember,

00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:43.593
it can solve problems, it can make decisions.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.308
So where does that intelligence lie?

00:05:46.308 --> 00:05:48.800
So this is a microscopy, a video I shot,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.453
and it's about 100 times magnification,

00:05:51.453 --> 00:05:54.320
sped up about 20 times,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.106
and inside the slime mold,

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:59.548
there is a rhythmic pulsing flow,

00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:01.716
a vein-like structure carrying

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:05.488
cellular material, nutrients and chemical information

00:06:05.488 --> 00:06:07.346
through the cell,

00:06:07.346 --> 00:06:10.964
streaming first in one direction
and then back in another.

00:06:10.964 --> 00:06:14.781
And it is this continuous, synchronous oscillation

00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.037
within the cell that allows it to form

00:06:17.037 --> 00:06:20.019
quite a complex understanding of its environment,

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:23.388
but without any large-scale control center.

00:06:23.388 --> 00:06:25.969
This is where its intelligence lies.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.213
So it's not just academic researchers

00:06:29.213 --> 00:06:31.857
in universities that are interested in this organism.

00:06:31.857 --> 00:06:34.730
A few years ago, I set up SliMoCo,

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.070
the Slime Mould Collective.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.293
It's an online, open, democratic network

00:06:40.293 --> 00:06:42.389
for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.118
to share knowledge and experimentation

00:06:45.118 --> 00:06:48.086
across disciplinary divides

00:06:48.086 --> 00:06:51.781
and across academic divides.

00:06:51.781 --> 00:06:55.221
The Slime Mould Collective
membership is self-selecting.

00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:58.017
People have found the collective

00:06:58.017 --> 00:07:01.715
as the slime mold finds the oats.

00:07:01.715 --> 00:07:03.408
And it comprises of scientists

00:07:03.408 --> 00:07:04.967
and computer scientists and researchers

00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:07.254
but also artists like me,

00:07:07.254 --> 00:07:12.346
architects, designers, writers, activists, you name it.

00:07:12.346 --> 00:07:16.529
It's a very interesting, eclectic membership.

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:17.866
Just a few examples:

00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:20.991
an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum;

00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:22.563
a collaborative team

00:07:22.563 --> 00:07:26.341
who are combining biological and electronic design

00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:29.486
with 3D printing technologies in a workshop;

00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:31.620
another artist who is using the slime mold

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.720
as a way of engaging a community

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.724
to map their area.

00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:38.886
Here, the slime mold is being used directly

00:07:38.886 --> 00:07:41.764
as a biological tool, but metaphorically

00:07:41.764 --> 00:07:43.748
as a symbol for ways of talking

00:07:43.748 --> 00:07:47.602
about social cohesion, communication

00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:49.466
and cooperation.

00:07:49.466 --> 00:07:51.976
Other public engagement activities,

00:07:51.976 --> 00:07:53.994
I run lots of slime mold workshops,

00:07:53.994 --> 00:07:56.456
a creative way of engaging with the organism.

00:07:56.456 --> 00:07:58.140
So people are invited to come and learn

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.036
about what amazing things it can do,

00:08:00.036 --> 00:08:02.682
and they design their own petri dish experiment,

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.998
an environment for the slime mold to navigate

00:08:04.998 --> 00:08:06.636
so they can test its properties.

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:09.080
Everybody takes home a new pet

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.020
and is invited to post their results

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.438
on the Slime Mould Collective.

00:08:14.438 --> 00:08:15.886
And the collective has enabled me

00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:18.248
to form collaborations

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.841
with a whole array of interesting people.

00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:22.434
I've been working with filmmakers

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:25.900
on a feature-length slime mold documentary,

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.558
and I stress feature-length,

00:08:28.558 --> 00:08:30.267
which is in the final stages of edit

00:08:30.267 --> 00:08:33.293
and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon.

00:08:33.293 --> 00:08:34.773
(Laughter)

00:08:34.773 --> 00:08:38.108
It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is

00:08:38.108 --> 00:08:40.981
the world's first human slime mold experiment.

00:08:40.981 --> 00:08:43.953
This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year.

00:08:43.953 --> 00:08:48.644
We invited people to become
slime mold for half an hour.

00:08:48.644 --> 00:08:51.985
So we essentially tied people together

00:08:51.985 --> 00:08:54.309
so they were a giant cell,

00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:57.153
and invited them to follow slime mold rules.

00:08:57.153 --> 00:09:00.584
You have to communicate through oscillations,

00:09:00.584 --> 00:09:01.880
no speaking.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.813
You have to operate as one entity, one mass cell,

00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:08.397
no egos,

00:09:08.397 --> 00:09:10.982
and the motivation for moving

00:09:10.982 --> 00:09:12.890
and then exploring the environment

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.789
is in search of food.

00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:18.420
So a chaotic shuffle ensued
as this bunch of strangers

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.328
tied together with yellow ropes
wearing "Being Slime Mold" t-shirts

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:25.284
wandered through the museum park.

00:09:25.284 --> 00:09:28.610
When they met trees, they had to reshape

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.742
their connections and reform as a mass cell

00:09:31.742 --> 00:09:35.729
through not speaking.

00:09:35.729 --> 00:09:39.087
This is a ludicrous experiment in many, many ways.

00:09:39.087 --> 00:09:41.036
This isn't hypothesis-driven.

00:09:41.036 --> 00:09:43.479
We're not trying to prove, demonstrate anything.

00:09:43.479 --> 00:09:45.613
But what it did provide us was a way

00:09:45.613 --> 00:09:47.961
of engaging a broad section of the public

00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:52.392
with ideas of intelligence, agency, autonomy,

00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:54.721
and provide a playful platform

00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:58.453
for discussions about

00:09:58.453 --> 00:10:00.837
the things that ensued.

00:10:00.837 --> 00:10:03.170
One of the most exciting things

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.030
about this experiment

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.217
was the conversation that happened afterwards.

00:10:08.217 --> 00:10:12.040
An entirely spontaneous symposium
happened in the park.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.069
People talked about the human psychology,

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:15.726
of how difficult it was to let go

00:10:15.726 --> 00:10:19.035
of their individual personalities and egos.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:22.218
Other people talked about bacterial communication.

00:10:22.218 --> 00:10:24.197
Each person brought in their own

00:10:24.197 --> 00:10:27.054
individual interpretation,

00:10:27.054 --> 00:10:28.959
and our conclusion from this experiment was that

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:32.865
the people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative,

00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:35.661
especially when given beer.

00:10:35.661 --> 00:10:37.627
We didn't just give them oats.

00:10:37.627 --> 00:10:39.189
We gave them beer as well.

00:10:39.189 --> 00:10:41.383
But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold,

00:10:41.383 --> 00:10:43.367
and the slime mold, for me,

00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:45.736
is a fascinating subject matter.

00:10:45.736 --> 00:10:47.593
It's biologically fascinating,

00:10:47.593 --> 00:10:49.177
it's computationally interesting,

00:10:49.177 --> 00:10:51.251
but it's also a symbol,

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:54.909
a way of engaging with ideas of community,

00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:58.563
collective behavior, cooperation.

00:10:58.563 --> 00:11:00.689
A lot of my work draws on the scientific research,

00:11:00.689 --> 00:11:03.873
so this pays homage to the maze experiment

00:11:03.873 --> 00:11:05.455
but in a different way.

00:11:05.455 --> 00:11:07.813
And the slime mold is also my working material.

00:11:07.813 --> 00:11:13.030
It's a coproducer of photographs, prints, animations,

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.629
participatory events.

00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:16.977
Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose

00:11:16.977 --> 00:11:18.883
to work with me, exactly,

00:11:18.883 --> 00:11:21.485
it is a collaboration of sorts.

00:11:21.485 --> 00:11:23.577
I can predict certain behaviors

00:11:23.577 --> 00:11:25.633
by understanding how it operates,

00:11:25.633 --> 00:11:27.363
but I can't control it.

00:11:27.363 --> 00:11:28.947
The slime mold has the final say

00:11:28.947 --> 00:11:31.078
in the creative process.

00:11:31.078 --> 00:11:34.567
And after all, it has its own internal aesthetics.

00:11:34.567 --> 00:11:36.371
These branching patterns that we see

00:11:36.371 --> 00:11:38.921
we see across all forms, scales of nature,

00:11:38.921 --> 00:11:41.721
from river deltas to lightning strikes,

00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:45.757
from our own blood vessels to neural networks.

00:11:45.757 --> 00:11:48.220
There's clearly significant rules at play

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.485
in this simple yet complex organism,

00:11:50.485 --> 00:11:54.277
and no matter what our disciplinary
perspective or our mode of inquiry,

00:11:54.277 --> 00:11:56.060
there's a great deal that we can learn

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.829
from observing and engaging

00:11:57.829 --> 00:12:00.950
with this beautiful, brainless blob.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.165
I give you Physarum polycephalum.

00:12:04.165 --> 00:12:05.918
Thank you.

00:12:05.918 --> 00:12:06.880
(Applause)
