00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Have you ever wondered

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
what is inside your dental plaque?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Probably not, but people like me do.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I'm an archeological geneticist

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
at the Center for Evolutionary Medicine

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
at the University of Zurich,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
by conducting genetic research

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And through this work, I hope to better understand

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
so that we can improve

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
and better manage our health in the future.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
There are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
and one way is to extract human DNA

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
from ancient bones.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And from these extracts,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and look for changes that might be related to adaptations,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
risk factors and inherited diseases.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
But this is only one half of the story.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
The most important health challenges today

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
are not caused by simple mutations in our genome,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
between genetic variation,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
diet, microbes and parasites

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and our immune response.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
All of these diseases

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
have a strong evolutionary component

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
that directly relates to the fact

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
that we live today in a very different environment

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
than the ones in which our bodies evolved.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
And in order to understand these diseases,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
we need to move past studies of the human genome alone

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and towards a more holistic approach

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
to human health in the past.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
But there are a lot of challenges for this.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
And first of all, what do we even study?

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Skeletons are ubiquitous; they're found all over the place.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
But of course, all of the soft tissue has decomposed,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and the skeleton itself

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
has limited health information.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Mummies are a great source of information,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
except that they're really geographically limited

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and limited in time as well.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Coprolites are fossilized human feces,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and they're actually extremely interesting.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
You can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
but they are very rare.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
(Laughter)

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
So to address this problem,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
I put together a team of international researchers

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
in Switzerland, Denmark and the U.K.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.260
to study a very poorly studied, little known material

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
that's found on people everywhere.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
It's a type of fossilized dental plaque

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
that is called officially dental calculus.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Many of you may know it by the term tartar.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
It's what the dentist cleans off your teeth

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
every time that you go in for a visit.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And in a typical dentistry visit,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
you may have about 15 to 30 milligrams removed.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
But in ancient times before tooth brushing,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
up to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
over a lifetime.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And what's really important about dental calculus

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
it's abundant in quantity before the present day

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
and it's ubiquitous worldwide.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
We find it in every population around the world at all time periods

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
going back tens of thousands of years.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And we even find it in neanderthals and animals.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And so previous studies

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
had only focused on microscopy.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
They'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and what they had found was things like pollen

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and plant starches,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and they'd found muscle cells from animal meats

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and bacteria.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
And so what my team of researchers, what we wanted to do,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
is say, can we apply

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
genetic and proteomic technology

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
to go after DNA and proteins,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
to really understand what's going on?

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And what we found

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
We also have found immune proteins

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
related to infection and inflammation

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and proteins and DNA related to diet.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
But what was surprising to us, and also quite exciting,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
is we also found bacteria

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
So it gives us virtual access to the lungs,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
which is where many important diseases reside.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
And we also found bacteria

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
that normally inhabit the gut.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And so we can also now virtually gain access

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
to this even more distant organ system

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
that, from the skeleton alone,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
has long decomposed.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
And so by applying ancient DNA sequencing

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and protein mass spectrometry technologies

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
to ancient dental calculus,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
we can generate immense quantities of data

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
of the dynamic interplay

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
between diet, infection and immunity

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
thousands of years ago.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
So what started out as an idea,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
is now being implemented

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
to churn out millions of sequences

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
that we can use to investigate

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
And from this information

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
we can learn about how pathogens evolve

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and also why they continue to make us sick.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
And I hope I have convinced you

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
of the value of dental calculus.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And as a final parting thought,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
on behalf of future archeologists,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
I would like to ask you to please think twice

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
before you go home and brush your teeth.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
(Applause)

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Thank you.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
(Applause)
