00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:18.267
I'm actually going to share
something with you

00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:21.188
I haven't talked about
probably in more than 10 years.

00:00:21.212 --> 00:00:24.236
So bear with me as I take you
through this journey.

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:26.357
When I was 22 years old,

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:29.883
I came home from work,
put a leash on my dog

00:00:29.907 --> 00:00:31.661
and went for my usual run.

00:00:32.613 --> 00:00:34.300
I had no idea that at that moment,

00:00:34.324 --> 00:00:36.236
my life was going to change forever.

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:39.665
While I was preparing my dog for the run,

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:43.632
a man was finishing drinking at a bar,

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:45.997
picked up his car keys, got into a car

00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:47.553
and headed south,

00:00:47.577 --> 00:00:49.251
or wherever he was.

00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:52.084
I was running across the street,

00:00:52.108 --> 00:00:54.288
and the only thing
that I actually remember

00:00:54.312 --> 00:00:56.779
is feeling like a grenade
went off in my head.

00:00:57.478 --> 00:01:01.160
And I remember
putting my hands on the ground

00:01:01.184 --> 00:01:03.046
and feeling my life's blood

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.498
emptying out of my neck and my mouth.

00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:10.658
What had happened is, he ran a red light

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:12.259
and hit me and my dog.

00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:14.845
She ended up underneath the car.

00:01:16.157 --> 00:01:17.718
I flew out in front of the car,

00:01:17.742 --> 00:01:19.932
and then he ran over my legs.

00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:22.178
My left leg got caught up
in the wheel well --

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:23.475
spun it around.

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:28.515
The bumper of the car hit my throat,

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.039
slicing it open.

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:32.950
I ended up with blunt chest trauma.

00:01:33.608 --> 00:01:37.601
Your aorta comes up behind your heart,
it's your major artery --

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:42.462
and it was severed, so my blood
was gurgling out of my mouth.

00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:46.081
It foamed, and ... horrible things
were happening to me.

00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:50.151
I had no idea what was going on,

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:51.826
but strangers intervened,

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.348
kept my heart moving, beating.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.046
I say "moving," because it was quivering,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.736
and they were trying to put
a beat back into it.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.031
Somebody was smart
and put a Bic pen in my neck

00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:07.389
to open up my airway,
so I could get some air in there.

00:02:07.413 --> 00:02:08.736
And my lung collapsed,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.735
so somebody cut me open
and put a pen in there as well,

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:17.033
to stop that catastrophic
event from happening.

00:02:18.857 --> 00:02:21.053
Somehow I ended up at the hospital.

00:02:21.077 --> 00:02:22.340
I was wrapped in ice,

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:25.382
and then eventually put
into a drug-induced coma.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.851
Eighteen months later, I woke up.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.736
I was blind, I couldn't speak

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.649
and I couldn't walk.

00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:36.505
I was 64 pounds.

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:44.532
The hospital really has no idea
what to do with people like that.

00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:47.326
And in fact, they started
to call me a "gomer."

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.216
That's another story
we won't even get into.

00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:55.026
I had so many surgeries
to put my neck back together,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.736
to repair my heart a few times.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.278
Some things worked, some things didn't.

00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:01.193
I had lots of titanium put in me;

00:03:01.217 --> 00:03:02.629
cadaver bones,

00:03:02.653 --> 00:03:05.431
to try to get my feet
moving the right way.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.655
And I ended up with a plastic nose,

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:09.869
porcelain teeth
and all kinds of other things.

00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:12.271
But eventually,
I started to look human again.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.190
But ...

00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:21.345
It's hard sometimes
to talk about these things,

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:22.637
so bear with me.

00:03:23.553 --> 00:03:25.931
I had more than 50 surgeries.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.556
But who's counting?

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.363
(Laughter)

00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:32.634
So eventually, the hospital decided
it was time for me to go.

00:03:32.658 --> 00:03:35.492
They needed to open up
space for somebody else

00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:38.736
that they thought could come back

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.736
from whatever they were going through.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.618
Everybody lost faith in me
being able to recover.

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:48.197
So they basically put a map
up on the wall, threw a dart,

00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.216
and it landed at a senior home,
here in Colorado.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.999
And I know all of you
are scratching your head:

00:03:55.023 --> 00:03:56.250
"A senior citizens' home?

00:03:56.274 --> 00:03:58.404
What in the world
are you going to do there?"

00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:00.859
But if you think about
all of the skills and talent

00:04:00.883 --> 00:04:03.431
that are in this room right now,

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:05.494
that's what a senior home has.

00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:07.580
So there were all these skills and talents

00:04:07.604 --> 00:04:09.087
that these seniors had.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.425
The one advantage
they had over most of you

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:13.600
is wisdom,

00:04:13.624 --> 00:04:15.814
because they had a long life.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.964
And I needed that wisdom
at that moment in my life.

00:04:19.615 --> 00:04:21.411
But imagine what it was like for them

00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:23.332
when I showed up at their doorstep.

00:04:24.277 --> 00:04:27.840
At that point, I had gained
four pounds, so I was 68 pounds.

00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:29.504
I was bald.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.146
I was wearing hospital scrubs.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.837
And somebody donated tennis shoes for me.

00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:38.030
And I had a white cane in one hand

00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:41.062
and a suitcase full of medical
records in another hand.

00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:43.634
So the senior citizens realized

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.950
that they needed to have
an emergency meeting.

00:04:45.974 --> 00:04:47.736
(Laughter)

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.736
So they pulled back
and they were looking at each other,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.831
and they were going, "OK,
what skills do we have in this room?

00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:56.990
This kid needs a lot of work."

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:02.338
So they eventually started
matching their talents and skills

00:05:02.362 --> 00:05:03.736
to all of my needs.

00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:06.435
But one of the first things
they needed to do

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:08.634
was assess what I needed right away.

00:05:08.658 --> 00:05:11.797
I needed to figure out how to eat
like a normal human being,

00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:15.162
since I'd been eating
through a tube in my chest

00:05:15.186 --> 00:05:16.736
and through my veins.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.963
So I had to go
through trying to eat again.

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:21.736
And they went through that process.

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.736
And then they had to figure out:

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.511
"Well, she needs furniture.

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:28.616
She is sleeping in the corner
of this apartment."

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.736
So they went to their storage lockers

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.736
and all gathered their extra furniture --

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.901
gave me pots and pans, blankets --

00:05:36.298 --> 00:05:37.474
everything.

00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:42.055
And then the next thing that I needed

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:43.245
was a makeover.

00:05:43.556 --> 00:05:44.706
(Laughter)

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.285
So out went the green scrubs,

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:49.175
and in came the polyester
and floral prints.

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.490
(Laughter)

00:05:53.514 --> 00:05:55.622
We're not going to talk
about the hairstyles

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:58.724
they tried to force on me
once my hair grew back.

00:05:59.263 --> 00:06:00.998
But I did say no to the blue hair.

00:06:01.022 --> 00:06:03.155
(Laughter)

00:06:04.577 --> 00:06:08.253
So eventually, what went on is,

00:06:08.277 --> 00:06:11.157
they decided that, well,
I need to learn to speak.

00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:12.985
You can't be an independent person

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.736
if you're not able to speak
and you can't see.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.677
So they figured not being able
to see is one thing,

00:06:18.701 --> 00:06:20.279
but they need to get me to talk.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.736
So while Sally, the office manager,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.656
was teaching me to speak in the day --

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.805
it's hard, because when you're a kid,
you take things for granted.

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:31.526
You learn things unconsciously.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.017
But for me, I was an adult
and it was embarrassing,

00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:38.943
and I had to learn how to coordinate
my new throat with my tongue

00:06:38.967 --> 00:06:41.736
and my new teeth and my lips,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.231
and capture the air and get the word out.

00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:46.083
So, I acted like a two-year-old,

00:06:46.107 --> 00:06:47.843
and refused to work.

00:06:49.412 --> 00:06:51.900
But the men had a better idea.

00:06:51.924 --> 00:06:54.246
They were going to make it fun for me.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.045
So they were teaching me
cuss-word Scrabble at night.

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:01.184
(Laughter)

00:07:02.372 --> 00:07:06.002
And then, secretly,
how to swear like a sailor.

00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:07.039
(Laughter)

00:07:07.063 --> 00:07:10.871
I'm going to just leave it
to your imagination

00:07:10.895 --> 00:07:13.411
as to what my first words were --

00:07:13.435 --> 00:07:14.426
(Laughter)

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.427
when Sally finally got
my confidence built.

00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:19.640
(Laughter)

00:07:19.664 --> 00:07:21.664
So I moved on from there.

00:07:21.688 --> 00:07:24.864
And a former teacher
who happened to have Alzheimer's

00:07:24.888 --> 00:07:27.219
took on the task of teaching me to write.

00:07:28.616 --> 00:07:30.933
The redundancy was actually good for me.

00:07:30.957 --> 00:07:32.736
So, we'll just keep moving on.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.970
(Laughter)

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:41.824
One of the pivotal times for me

00:07:41.848 --> 00:07:44.515
was actually learning
to cross the street again

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:46.181
as a blind person.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.729
So close your eyes.

00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:52.415
Now imagine you have to cross a street.

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:55.002
You don't know how far that street is,

00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:58.736
and you don't know
if you're going straight.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.319
And you hear cars whizzing back and forth,

00:08:02.168 --> 00:08:03.736
and you had a horrible accident

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.053
that landed you in this situation.

00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:09.107
So there were two obstacles
I had to get through.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.549
One was post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:16.953
Every time I approached
the corner or the curb,

00:08:16.977 --> 00:08:18.264
I would panic.

00:08:18.288 --> 00:08:20.089
And the second one

00:08:20.113 --> 00:08:23.247
was actually trying to figure out
how to cross that street.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.646
So one of the seniors just came up to me,

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.002
and she pushed me
up to the corner and said,

00:08:30.026 --> 00:08:33.021
"When you think it's time to go,
just stick the cane out there.

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:34.872
If it's hit, don't cross the street."

00:08:34.896 --> 00:08:40.391
(Laughter)

00:08:40.415 --> 00:08:41.840
Made perfect sense.

00:08:41.864 --> 00:08:43.001
(Laughter)

00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:46.614
But by the third cane
that went whizzing across the road --

00:08:46.638 --> 00:08:47.989
(Laughter)

00:08:48.013 --> 00:08:51.070
they realized that they needed
to put their resources together,

00:08:51.094 --> 00:08:52.564
and they raised funds

00:08:52.588 --> 00:08:54.675
so that I could go
to the Braille Institute

00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:59.296
and actually gain the skills
to be a blind person,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.318
and also to go get a guide dog,

00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:02.712
who transformed my life.

00:09:03.215 --> 00:09:04.984
And I was able to return to college

00:09:05.008 --> 00:09:08.736
because of the senior citizens
who invested in me,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.893
and also the guide dog
and skill set I had gained.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.030
Ten years later, I gained my sight back.

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:16.443
Not magically --

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:20.094
I opted in for three surgeries,

00:09:20.118 --> 00:09:21.988
and one of them was experimental.

00:09:22.012 --> 00:09:23.736
It was actually robotic surgery

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.258
that removed a hematoma
from behind my eye.

00:09:28.356 --> 00:09:33.185
The biggest change for me
was that the world moved forward,

00:09:33.209 --> 00:09:37.251
that there were innovations
and all kinds of new things --

00:09:37.275 --> 00:09:39.204
cellphones, laptops,

00:09:39.228 --> 00:09:41.875
all these things
that I had never seen before.

00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:43.551
And as a blind person,

00:09:43.575 --> 00:09:46.094
your visual memory fades,

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:50.136
and is replaced with how you
feel about things

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.979
and how things sound

00:09:52.003 --> 00:09:53.360
and how things smell.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.246
So one day, I was in my room

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.343
and I saw this thing sitting in my room.

00:09:59.367 --> 00:10:00.736
I thought it was a monster,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.875
so I was walking around it.

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:04.901
And I go, "I'm just going to touch it."

00:10:04.925 --> 00:10:06.307
And I touched it and I went,

00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:08.449
"Oh my God, it's a laundry basket."

00:10:09.592 --> 00:10:12.474
(Laughter)

00:10:13.477 --> 00:10:17.513
Everything is different
when you're a sighted person,

00:10:17.537 --> 00:10:19.199
because you take that for granted.

00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:23.234
But when you're blind,
you have the tactile memory for things.

00:10:24.075 --> 00:10:26.624
The biggest change for me
was looking down at my hands

00:10:26.648 --> 00:10:29.468
and seeing that I'd lost
10 years of my life.

00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:33.620
I thought that time
had stood still for some reason

00:10:33.644 --> 00:10:35.478
and moved on for family and friends.

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:36.986
But when I looked down,

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.580
I realized that time
marched on for me, too,

00:10:39.604 --> 00:10:41.328
and that I needed to get caught up.

00:10:41.352 --> 00:10:42.827
So I got going on it.

00:10:44.427 --> 00:10:48.347
We didn't have words like "crowdsourcing"
and "radical collaboration"

00:10:48.371 --> 00:10:49.736
when I had my accident.

00:10:50.113 --> 00:10:51.876
But the concept held true --

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.313
people working with people to rebuild me;

00:10:54.337 --> 00:10:57.146
people working with people
to reeducate me.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.987
I wouldn't be standing here today

00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:02.736
if it wasn't for extreme
radical collaboration.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.054
Thank you so much.

00:11:04.078 --> 00:11:07.561
(Applause)
