00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Today, I'm going to take you

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
around the world in 18 minutes.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
My base of operations is in the U.S.,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
but let's start at the other end of the map,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
in Kyoto, Japan,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
where I was living with a Japanese family

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
while I was doing part of my dissertational research

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
15 years ago.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I knew even then that I would encounter

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
cultural differences and misunderstandings,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
but they popped up when I least expected it.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
On my first day,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
I went to a restaurant,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
After a pause, the waiter said,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
"One does not put sugar in green tea."

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
"I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
But I really like my tea sweet."

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
In response, he gave me an even more courteous version

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
of the same explanation.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
"One does not put sugar

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
in green tea."

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
"I understand," I said,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
"that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
but I'd like to put some sugar

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
in my green tea."

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
(Laughter)

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Surprised by my insistence,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
the waiter took up the issue with the manager.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Pretty soon,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
a lengthy discussion ensued,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and finally the manager came over to me and said,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
"I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
(Laughter)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
I ordered a cup of coffee,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
which the waiter brought over promptly.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Resting on the saucer

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
were two packets of sugar.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
My failure to procure myself

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
a cup of sweet, green tea

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
was not due to a simple misunderstanding.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
This was due to a fundamental difference

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
in our ideas about choice.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
From my American perspective,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
when a paying customer makes a reasonable request

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
based on her preferences,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
she has every right to have that request met.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
The American way, to quote Burger King,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
is to "have it your way,"

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
because, as Starbucks says,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
"happiness is in your choices."

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
(Laughter)

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
But from the Japanese perspective,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better --

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
(Laughter)

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
in this case, the ignorant gaijin --

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
from making the wrong choice.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Let's face it: the way I wanted my tea

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
was inappropriate according to cultural standards,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and they were doing their best to help me save face.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Americans tend to believe

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
that they've reached some sort of pinnacle

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
in the way they practice choice.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
They think that choice, as seen through the American lens

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
best fulfills an innate and universal

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
desire for choice in all humans.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Unfortunately,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
these beliefs are based on assumptions

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
that don't always hold true

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
in many countries, in many cultures.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
At times they don't even hold true

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
at America's own borders.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and the problems associated with them.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
about some of your own assumptions

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
and how they were shaped by your backgrounds.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
First assumption:

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
if a choice affects you,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
then you should be the one to make it.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
This is the only way to ensure

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
that your preferences and interests

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
will be most fully accounted for.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
It is essential for success.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
In America, the primary locus of choice

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
is the individual.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
regardless of what other people want or recommend.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
It's called "being true to yourself."

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
But do all individuals benefit

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
from taking such an approach to choice?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
in which we sought the answer to this very question.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
In one study,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
which we ran in Japantown, San Francisco,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
into the laboratory,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and we divided them up into three groups.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
The first group came in,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and they were greeted by Miss Smith,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
and they even got to choose which marker

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
they would write their answers with.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
When the second group of children came in,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
they were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
but this time Miss Smith told them

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
which anagrams to do

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and which markers to write their answers with.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Now when the third group came in,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
they were told that their anagrams and their markers

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
had been chosen by their mothers.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
(Laughter)

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
In reality,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
the kids who were told what to do,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
whether by Miss Smith or their mothers,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
were actually given the very same activity,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
which their counterparts in the first group

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
had freely chosen.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
With this procedure, we were able to ensure

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
that the kids across the three groups

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
all did the same activity,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
making it easier for us to compare performance.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Such small differences in the way we administered the activity

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
yielded striking differences

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
in how well they performed.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Anglo-Americans,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
they did two and a half times more anagrams

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
when they got to choose them,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
as compared to when it was

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
It didn't matter who did the choosing,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
if the task was dictated by another,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
their performance suffered.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
(Laughter)

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
One girl named Mary said,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
"You asked my mother?"

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
(Laughter)

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
In contrast,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Asian-American children

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
performed best when they believed

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
their mothers had made the choice,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
second best when they chose for themselves,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
A girl named Natsumi

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
and tugged on her skirt and asked,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
"Could you please tell my mommy

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
I did it just like she said?"

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
The first-generation children were strongly influenced

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
by their immigrant parents'

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
approach to choice.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
For them, choice was not just a way

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
of defining and asserting

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
their individuality,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
but a way to create community and harmony

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
by deferring to the choices

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
of people whom they trusted and respected.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
If they had a concept of being true to one's self,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
then that self, most likely,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
[was] composed, not of an individual,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
but of a collective.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Success was just as much about pleasing key figures

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
as it was about satisfying

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
one's own preferences.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Or, you could say that

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
the individual's preferences were shaped

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
by the preferences of specific others.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
The assumption then that we do best

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
when the individual self chooses

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
only holds

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
when that self

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
is clearly divided from others.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
When, in contrast,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
two or more individuals

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
see their choices and their outcomes

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
as intimately connected,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
then they may amplify one another's success

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
by turning choosing

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
into a collective act.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
To insist that they choose independently

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
might actually compromise

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
both their performance

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and their relationships.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
Yet that is exactly what

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
the American paradigm demands.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
It leaves little room for interdependence

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
It requires that everyone treat choice

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
as a private and self-defining act.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
People that have grown up in such a paradigm

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
might find it motivating,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
but it is a mistake to assume

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
that everyone thrives under the pressure

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
of choosing alone.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
The second assumption which informs the American view of choice

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
goes something like this.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
The more choices you have,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
the more likely you are

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
to make the best choice.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
So bring it on, Walmart, with 100,000 different products,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and Amazon, with 27 million books

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and Match.com with -- what is it? --

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
15 million date possibilities now.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
You will surely find the perfect match.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
Let's test this assumption

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
by heading over to Eastern Europe.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Here, I interviewed people

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
who were residents of formerly communist countries,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
who had all faced the challenge

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
of transitioning to a more

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
democratic and capitalistic society.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
One of the most interesting revelations

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
came not from an answer to a question,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
but from a simple gesture of hospitality.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
When the participants arrived for their interview,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
I offered them a set of drinks:

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite --

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
seven, to be exact.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
During the very first session,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
which was run in Russia,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
one of the participants made a comment

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
that really caught me off guard.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
"Oh, but it doesn't matter.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
It's all just soda. That's just one choice."

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
(Murmuring)

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
I was so struck by this comment that from then on,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
I started to offer all the participants

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
those seven sodas,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
and I asked them, "How many choices are these?"

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Again and again,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
they perceived these seven different sodas,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
not as seven choices, but as one choice:

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
soda or no soda.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
When I put out juice and water

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
in addition to these seven sodas,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
now they perceived it as only three choices --

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
juice, water and soda.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
not just to a particular flavor of soda,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
but to a particular brand.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
You know, research shows repeatedly

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
that we can't actually tell the difference

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
between Coke and Pepsi.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Of course, you and I know

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
that Coke is the better choice.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:16.260
(Laughter)

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
For modern Americans who are exposed

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
to more options and more ads associated with options

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
than anyone else in the world,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
choice is just as much about who they are

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
as it is about what the product is.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
and so every choice matters.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
But for Eastern Europeans,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
the sudden availability of all these

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
They were flooded with choice

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
When asked, "What words and images

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
do you associate with choice?"

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Grzegorz from Warsaw said,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
"Ah, for me it is fear.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
There are some dilemmas you see.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
I am used to no choice."

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Bohdan from Kiev said,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
in response to how he felt about

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
the new consumer marketplace,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
"It is too much.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
We do not need everything that is there."

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
A sociologist from

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
the Warsaw Survey Agency explained,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
"The older generation jumped from nothing

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
to choice all around them.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
They were never given a chance to learn

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
how to react."

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And Tomasz, a young Polish man said,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
"I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
I don't mean to say that I want no choice,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
but many of these choices are quite artificial."

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
In reality, many choices are between things

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
that are not that much different.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
The value of choice

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
depends on our ability

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
to perceive differences

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
between the options.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
Americans train their whole lives

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
to play "spot the difference."

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
They practice this from such an early age

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
that they've come to believe that everyone

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
must be born with this ability.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
In fact, though all humans share

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
a basic need and desire for choice,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
we don't all see choice in the same places

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
or to the same extent.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
When someone can't see how one choice

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
is unlike another,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
the process of choosing can be

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
confusing and frustrating.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Instead of making better choices,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
we become overwhelmed by choice,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
sometimes even afraid of it.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
Choice no longer offers opportunities,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
but imposes constraints.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
It's not a marker of liberation,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
but of suffocation

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
by meaningless minutiae.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
In other words,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
choice can develop into the very opposite

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
of everything it represents

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
in America

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
when it is thrust upon those

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
who are insufficiently prepared for it.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
But it is not only other people

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
in other places

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
that are feeling the pressure

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
of ever-increasing choice.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Americans themselves are discovering

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
that unlimited choice

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
seems more attractive in theory

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
than in practice.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
We all have physical, mental

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
and emotional (Laughter) limitations

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
that make it impossible for us

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
to process every single choice we encounter,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
even in the grocery store,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
let alone over the course of our entire lives.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
A number of my studies have shown

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
that when you give people 10 or more options

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
when they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
whether it be health care, investment,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
other critical areas.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
Yet still, many of us believe

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
that we should make all our own choices

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
and seek out even more of them.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
This brings me to the third,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
and perhaps most problematic, assumption:

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
"You must never

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
say no to choice."

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
To examine this, let's go back to the U.S.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
and then hop across the pond to France.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
Right outside Chicago,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
a young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
were about to have their first baby.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
They'd already picked out a name for her,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
Barbara, after her grandmother.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
she started to experience contractions

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and was rushed to the emergency room.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
The baby was delivered through a C-section,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
a loss of oxygen to the brain.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Unable to breathe on her own,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
she was put on a ventilator.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Two days later,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
the doctors gave the Mitchells

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
a choice:

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
They could either remove Barbara

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
off the life support,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
in which case she would die within a matter of hours,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
or they could keep her on life support,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
in which case she might still die

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
within a matter of days.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
If she survived, she would remain

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
in a permanent vegetative state,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
never able to walk, talk

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
or interact with others.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
What do they do?

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
What do any parent do?

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
In a study I conducted

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
American and French parents

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
were interviewed.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
They had all suffered

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
the same tragedy.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
In all cases, the life support was removed,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
and the infants had died.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
But there was a big difference.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
In France, the doctors decided whether and when

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
the life support would be removed,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
while in the United States,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
the final decision rested with the parents.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
We wondered:

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
does this have an effect on how the parents

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
cope with the loss of their loved one?

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
We found that it did.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Even up to a year later,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
American parents

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
were more likely to express negative emotions,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
as compared to their French counterparts.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
French parents were more likely to say things like,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
"Noah was here for so little time,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
but he taught us so much.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
He gave us a new perspective on life."

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
American parents were more likely to say things like,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
"What if? What if?"

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
Another parent complained,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
"I feel as if they purposefully tortured me.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
How did they get me to do that?"

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
And another parent said,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
"I feel as if I've played a role

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
in an execution."

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
But when the American parents were asked

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
if they would rather have had

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
the doctors make the decision,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
they all said, "No."

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
They could not imagine

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
turning that choice over to another,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
even though having made that choice

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
made them feel trapped,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
guilty, angry.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
In a number of cases

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
they were even clinically depressed.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
These parents could not contemplate

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
giving up the choice,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
because to do so would have gone contrary

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
to everything they had been taught

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
and everything they had come to believe

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
about the power

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
and purpose of choice.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
In her essay, "The White Album,"

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
Joan Didion writes,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
"We tell ourselves stories

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
in order to live.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
We interpret what we see,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
select the most workable

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
of the multiple choices.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
We live entirely by the imposition

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
of a narrative line

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
upon disparate images,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
by the idea with which we have learned to freeze

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
the shifting phantasmagoria,

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
which is our actual experience."

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
The story Americans tell,

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
the story upon which

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
the American dream depends,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.260
is the story of limitless choice.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
This narrative

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
promises so much:

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
freedom, happiness,

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
success.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.260
It lays the world at your feet and says,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
"You can have anything, everything."

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
It's a great story,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
and it's understandable why they would be reluctant

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.260
to revise it.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
But when you take a close look,

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
you start to see the holes,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
and you start to see that the story

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
can be told in many other ways.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
Americans have so often tried to

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.260
disseminate their ideas of choice,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.260
believing that they will be, or ought to be,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.260
welcomed with open hearts and minds.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.260
But the history books and the daily news tell us

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.260
it doesn't always work out that way.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
The phantasmagoria,

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
the actual experience that we try to understand

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.260
and organize through narrative,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.260
varies from place to place.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
No single narrative serves the needs

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
of everyone everywhere.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.260
Moreover, Americans themselves

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.260
could benefit from incorporating

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.260
new perspectives into their own narrative,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.260
which has been driving their choices

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.260
for so long.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.260
Robert Frost once said that,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.260
"It is poetry that is lost in translation."

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
This suggests that

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
whatever is beautiful and moving,

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.260
whatever gives us a new way to see,

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.260
cannot be communicated to those

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.260
who speak a different language.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.260
But Joseph Brodsky said that,

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260
"It is poetry

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
that is gained in translation,"

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.260
suggesting that translation

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.260
can be a creative,

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.260
transformative act.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260
When it comes to choice,

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.260
we have far more to gain than to lose

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.260
by engaging in the many

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.260
translations of the narratives.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.260
Instead of replacing

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.260
one story with another,

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.260
we can learn from and revel in

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.260
the many versions that exist

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.260
and the many that have yet to be written.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.260
No matter where we're from

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.260
and what your narrative is,

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.260
we all have a responsibility

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.260
to open ourselves up to a wider array

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.260
of what choice can do,

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.260
and what it can represent.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.260
And this does not lead to

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.260
a paralyzing moral relativism.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.260
Rather, it teaches us when

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.260
and how to act.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.260
It brings us that much closer

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.260
to realizing the full potential of choice,

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.260
to inspiring the hope

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.260
and achieving the freedom

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.260
that choice promises

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.260
but doesn't always deliver.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.260
If we learn to speak to one another,

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.260
albeit through translation,

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.260
then we can begin to see choice

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.260
in all its strangeness,

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.260
complexity

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.260
and compelling beauty.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.260
Thank you.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:20.260
(Applause)

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.260
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.260
Sheena, there is a detail about your biography

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.260
that we have not written in the program book.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.260
But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.260
And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is:

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.260
How does that influence your study of choosing

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.260
because that's an activity

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.260
that for most people is associated with visual inputs

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.260
like aesthetics and color and so on?

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.260
Sheena Iyengar: Well, it's funny that you should ask that

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.260
because one of the things that's interesting about being blind

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.260
is you actually get a different vantage point

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.260
when you observe the way

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.260
sighted people make choices.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.260
And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.260
that are very visual these days.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.260
Yeah, I -- as you would expect --

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.260
get pretty frustrated by choices

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.260
like what nail polish to put on

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.260
because I have to rely on what other people suggest.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.260
And I can't decide.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.260
And so one time I was in a beauty salon,

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.260
and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.260
And one was called "Ballet Slippers."

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.260
And the other one was called "Adorable."

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.260
(Laughter)

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.260
And so I asked these two ladies,

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.260
and the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'"

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.260
"Well, what does it look like?"

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.260
"Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink."

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.260
"Okay, great."

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.260
The other lady tells me to wear "Adorable."

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.260
"What does it look like?"

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.260
"It's a glamorous shade of pink."

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.260
And so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart?

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.260
What's different about them?"

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.260
And they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous."

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.260
Okay, we got that.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.260
And the only thing they had consensus on:

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.260
well, if I could see them, I would

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.260
clearly be able to tell them apart.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.260
(Laughter)

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.260
And what I wondered was whether they were being affected

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.260
by the name or the content of the color,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.260
so I decided to do a little experiment.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.260
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory,

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.260
and I stripped the labels off.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.260
And I brought women into the laboratory,

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.260
and I asked them, "Which one would you pick?"

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.260
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick,

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.260
of putting the same color nail polish

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.260
in both those bottles.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.260
(Laughter)

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.260
(Applause)

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.260
At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.260
Now, of the women that could tell them apart,

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.260
when the labels were off, they picked "Adorable,"

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.260
and when the labels were on,

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.260
they picked "Ballet Slippers."

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.260
So as far as I can tell,

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.260
a rose by any other name

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.260
probably does look different

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.260
and maybe even smells different.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.260
BG: Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:24:01.260
(Applause)
