00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.385
These are simple objects:

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:18.180
clocks, keys, combs, glasses.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.520
They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.517
carried with them on their final journey.

00:00:23.517 --> 00:00:26.240
We are all familiar with these mundane,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.974
everyday objects.

00:00:27.974 --> 00:00:29.559
The fact that some of the victims carried

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.973
personal items such as
toothpaste and a toothbrush

00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:35.492
is a clear sign they had no idea

00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:37.320
what was about to happen to them.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.711
Usually, they were told that they were going to be

00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:42.199
exchanged for prisoners of war.

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.212
These items have been recovered

00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:47.050
from numerous mass graves across my homeland,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.580
and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.714
from newly discovered mass graves,

00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:53.250
20 years after the war.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.333
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.611
During the four years of conflict

00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:02.457
that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s,

00:01:02.457 --> 00:01:05.888
approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians,

00:01:05.888 --> 00:01:07.823
went missing, presumed killed,

00:01:07.823 --> 00:01:09.803
and another 100,000 were killed

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.530
during combat operations.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.159
Most of them were killed

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.932
either in the early days of the war

00:01:14.932 --> 00:01:16.298
or towards the end of the hostilities,

00:01:16.298 --> 00:01:19.477
when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica

00:01:19.477 --> 00:01:22.522
fell into the hands of the Serb army.

00:01:22.522 --> 00:01:24.640
The international criminal tribunal

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.330
delivered a number of sentences

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.109
for crimes against humanity and genocide.

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.618
Genocide is a systematic and deliberate

00:01:32.618 --> 00:01:36.288
destruction of a racial, political, religious

00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:37.960
or ethnic group.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.540
As much as genocide is about killing.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.561
It is also about destroying their property,

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.451
their cultural heritage,

00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:48.713
and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed.

00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:51.210
Genocide is not only about the killing;

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.383
it is about the denied identity.

00:01:54.383 --> 00:01:55.813
There are always traces â€”

00:01:55.813 --> 00:01:57.532
no such thing as a perfect crime.

00:01:57.532 --> 00:02:00.267
There are always remnants of the perished ones

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:02.785
that are more durable than their fragile bodies

00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:06.523
and our selective and fading memory of them.

00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:09.180
These items are recovered

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.352
from numerous mass graves,

00:02:10.352 --> 00:02:13.766
and the main goal of this collection of the items

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.234
is a unique process

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:18.512
of identifying those who disappeared in the killings,

00:02:18.512 --> 00:02:21.482
the first act of genocide on European soil

00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:22.905
since the Holocaust.

00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:25.419
Not a single body should remain undiscovered

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.285
or unidentified.

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:28.650
Once recovered,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.573
these items that the victims carried with them

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:33.052
on their way to execution

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.409
are carefully cleaned, analyzed,

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.647
catalogued and stored.

00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:40.797
Thousands of artifacts are
packed in white plastic bags

00:02:40.797 --> 00:02:43.200
just like the ones you see on CSI.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.938
These objects are used as a forensic tool

00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:48.393
in visual identification of the victims,

00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:51.640
but they are also used as
very valuable forensic evidence

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.477
in the ongoing war crimes trials.

00:02:54.477 --> 00:02:56.568
Survivors are occasionally called

00:02:56.568 --> 00:02:59.119
to try to identify these items physically,

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:02.449
but physical browsing is extremely difficult,

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.551
an ineffective and painful process.

00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:09.344
Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers

00:03:09.344 --> 00:03:10.486
are done with these objects,

00:03:10.486 --> 00:03:13.417
they become orphans of the narrative.

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:16.319
Many of them get destroyed, believe it or not,

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.956
or they get simply shelved,

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:20.198
out of sight and out of mind.

00:03:20.198 --> 00:03:22.714
I decided a few years ago

00:03:22.714 --> 00:03:25.380
to photograph every single exhumed item

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.281
in order to create a visual archive

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.631
that survivors could easily browse.

00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:34.688
As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community.

00:03:34.688 --> 00:03:37.431
I like to move beyond raising awareness.

00:03:37.431 --> 00:03:39.615
And in this case, someone may

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:41.216
recognize these items

00:03:41.216 --> 00:03:43.912
or at least their photographs will remain

00:03:43.912 --> 00:03:47.714
as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder

00:03:47.714 --> 00:03:49.626
of what happened.

00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:51.764
Photography is about empathy,

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.982
and the familiarity of these
items guarantee empathy.

00:03:54.982 --> 00:03:57.436
In this case, I am merely a tool,

00:03:57.436 --> 00:03:59.090
a forensic, if you like,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.755
and the result is a photography that is as close

00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:04.376
as possible of being a document.

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:07.515
Once all the missing persons are identified,

00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:09.288
only decaying bodies in their graves

00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:11.630
and these everyday items will remain.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.555
In all their simplicity,

00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:15.762
these items are the last testament

00:04:15.762 --> 00:04:17.319
to the identity of the victims,

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:19.347
the last permanent reminder

00:04:19.347 --> 00:04:21.319
that these people ever existed.

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.657
Thank you very much.

00:04:23.657 --> 00:04:27.470
