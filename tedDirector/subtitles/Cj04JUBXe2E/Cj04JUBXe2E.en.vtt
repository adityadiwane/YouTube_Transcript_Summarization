00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
So I am a pediatric cancer doctor

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.330
and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
Now, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
I didn't bring a human brain,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
but I did bring a liter of bone marrow.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
And bone marrow is actually what we use

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
and some other diseases.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.330
So, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
who is a volunteer donor.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
of a child with leukemia.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.330
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
and another doctor across from me.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
Bob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
you know, not too big.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
And the way we do this is we basically

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
place this through the soft tissue,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
and kind of punch it into the hard bone,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
into the tuchus -- that's a technical term --

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.330
and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
each time, with a syringe.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
About 200 times usually.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
And by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
let alone Bob,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
whose rear end looks something more like this,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
like Swiss cheese.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
And there is probably a better way to do this.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
This is it.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
Our standard see-through patient.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
And we have a flexible, powered catheter

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
or suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
We can do multiple passes through that same entry.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
No robots required.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.330
and do this harvest as an outpatient.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.330
So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
And played around with this a little bit.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
And our team members developed this technology.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.330
And eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
but we got 10 times the stem cell activity

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
There will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
And we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
than the standard approach done on the same patient.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
So why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
You all know about embryonic stem cells.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
Adult stem cells are throughout our body,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
for over 40 years.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
such as heart disease, vascular disease,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
orthopedics, tissue engineering,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
even in neurology to treat Parkinson's

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
and diabetes.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
We've just come out, we're commercializing, this year,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
The hope is that this gets more stem cells out,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
which translates to better outcomes.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
It may encourage more people to sign up to be

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
potential live-saving bone marrow donors.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
It may even enable you to bank

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
to use in the future should you need it.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
And ultimately -- and here's a picture of our

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
bone marrow transplant survivors,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
Hopefully this technology will let us

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
have more of these survivors in the future.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
Thanks.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.330
(Applause)
