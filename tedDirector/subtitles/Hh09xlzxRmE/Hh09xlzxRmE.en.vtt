00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.903
It's often said that you can tell
a lot about a person

00:00:15.927 --> 00:00:18.422
by looking at what's on their bookshelves.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.666
What do my bookshelves say about me?

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:26.086
Well, when I asked myself
this question a few years ago,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.411
I made an alarming discovery.

00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.135
I'd always thought of myself
as a fairly cultured,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.584
cosmopolitan sort of person.

00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:37.704
But my bookshelves told
a rather different story.

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:40.091
Pretty much all the titles on them

00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:42.974
were by British or North American authors,

00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:45.534
and there was almost
nothing in translation.

00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:50.177
Discovering this massive,
cultural blind spot in my reading

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:52.002
came as quite a shock.

00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:55.519
And when I thought about it,
it seemed like a real shame.

00:00:55.543 --> 00:00:58.915
I knew there had to be lots
of amazing stories out there

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:02.316
by writers working in languages
other than English.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.642
And it seemed really sad to think
that my reading habits meant

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.023
I would probably never encounter them.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.301
So, I decided to prescribe myself

00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:13.943
an intensive course of global reading.

00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:18.340
2012 was set to be a very
international year for the UK;

00:01:18.364 --> 00:01:20.436
it was the year of the London Olympics.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.982
And so I decided to use it
as my time frame

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.213
to try to read a novel,
short story collection

00:01:27.237 --> 00:01:31.554
or memoir from every country in the world.

00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:34.104
And so I did.

00:01:34.128 --> 00:01:35.755
And it was very exciting

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:37.675
and I learned some remarkable things

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:39.814
and made some wonderful connections

00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:41.707
that I want to share with you today.

00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:45.286
But it started with some
practical problems.

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:50.516
After I'd worked out which of the many
different lists of countries in the world

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.746
to use for my project,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.920
I ended up going with the list
of UN-recognized nations,

00:01:55.944 --> 00:01:57.167
to which I added Taiwan,

00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:00.547
which gave me a total of 196 countries.

00:02:01.143 --> 00:02:03.998
And after I'd worked out
how to fit reading and blogging

00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:06.332
about, roughly, four books a week

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:09.467
around working five days a week,

00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:13.195
I then had to face up to the fact
that I might even not be able

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.947
to get books in English
from every country.

00:02:16.546 --> 00:02:20.291
Only around 4.5 percent
of the literary works published

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:22.966
each year in the UK are translations,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.616
and the figures are similar for much
of the English-speaking world.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.593
Although, the proportion
of translated books published

00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:32.409
in many other countries is a lot higher.

00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:36.409
4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with,

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:38.268
but what that figure doesn't tell you

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:40.965
is that many of those books
will come from countries

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.163
with strong publishing networks

00:02:43.187 --> 00:02:47.354
and lots of industry professionals
primed to go out and sell those titles

00:02:47.378 --> 00:02:49.338
to English-language publishers.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:54.283
So, for example, although well over 100
books are translated from French

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:56.210
and published in the UK each year,

00:02:56.234 --> 00:03:00.647
most of them will come from countries
like France or Switzerland.

00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:03.845
French-speaking Africa, on the other hand,

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:05.511
will rarely ever get a look-in.

00:03:06.284 --> 00:03:09.607
The upshot is that there are
actually quite a lot of nations

00:03:09.631 --> 00:03:13.262
that may have little or even no
commercially available literature

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:14.439
in English.

00:03:15.074 --> 00:03:18.140
Their books remain invisible to readers

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:21.002
of the world's most published language.

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:23.820
But when it came to reading the world,

00:03:23.844 --> 00:03:25.614
the biggest challenge of all for me

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:28.772
was that fact that I didn't
know where to start.

00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:32.559
Having spent my life reading
almost exclusively British

00:03:32.583 --> 00:03:34.232
and North American books,

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:37.845
I had no idea how to go about
sourcing and finding stories

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.580
and choosing them from much
of the rest of the world.

00:03:40.604 --> 00:03:43.989
I couldn't tell you how to source
a story from Swaziland.

00:03:44.013 --> 00:03:46.648
I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia.

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:48.718
There was no hiding it --

00:03:48.742 --> 00:03:52.065
I was a clueless literary xenophobe.

00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:54.995
So how on earth was I
going to read the world?

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:57.634
I was going to have to ask for help.

00:03:57.658 --> 00:04:01.157
So in October 2011, I registered my blog,

00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:02.952
ayearofreadingtheworld.com,

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:05.461
and I posted a short appeal online.

00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:07.092
I explained who I was,

00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:09.124
how narrow my reading had been,

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:11.005
and I asked anyone who cared to

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:13.594
to leave a message suggesting
what I might read

00:04:13.618 --> 00:04:15.302
from other parts of the planet.

00:04:15.913 --> 00:04:19.986
Now, I had no idea whether
anyone would be interested,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.124
but within a few hours
of me posting that appeal online,

00:04:23.148 --> 00:04:25.584
people started to get in touch.

00:04:25.608 --> 00:04:28.106
At first, it was friends and colleagues.

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.017
Then it was friends of friends.

00:04:30.383 --> 00:04:32.660
And pretty soon, it was strangers.

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:36.201
Four days after I put that appeal online,

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:39.956
I got a message from a woman
called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur.

00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:42.967
She said she loved
the sound of my project,

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.890
could she go to her local
English-language bookshop

00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:49.204
and choose my Malaysian book
and post it to me?

00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:51.665
I accepted enthusiastically,

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:53.191
and a few weeks later,

00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:57.763
a package arrived containing
not one, but two books --

00:04:59.263 --> 00:05:01.681
Rafidah's choice from Malaysia,

00:05:02.908 --> 00:05:06.791
and a book from Singapore
that she had also picked out for me.

00:05:08.428 --> 00:05:10.865
Now, at the time, I was amazed

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.465
that a stranger more than 6,000 miles away

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:16.414
would go to such lengths to help someone

00:05:16.438 --> 00:05:18.497
she would probably never meet.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.751
But Rafidah's kindness proved
to be the pattern for that year.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.530
Time and again, people went
out of their way to help me.

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:29.835
Some took on research on my behalf,

00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:32.882
and others made detours
on holidays and business trips

00:05:32.906 --> 00:05:34.842
to go to bookshops for me.

00:05:35.526 --> 00:05:38.762
It turns out, if you want
to read the world,

00:05:38.786 --> 00:05:42.187
if you want to encounter it
with an open mind,

00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:44.141
the world will help you.

00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:46.333
When it came to countries

00:05:46.357 --> 00:05:49.863
with little or no commercially
available literature in English,

00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:51.700
people went further still.

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.901
Books often came from surprising sources.

00:05:56.536 --> 00:05:59.575
My Panamanian read, for example,
came through a conversation

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.618
I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter.

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:07.007
Yes, the Panama Canal
has a Twitter account.

00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:10.105
And when I tweeted at it about my project,

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.508
it suggested that I might like to try
and get hold of the work

00:06:13.532 --> 00:06:16.111
of the Panamanian author
Juan David Morgan.

00:06:16.898 --> 00:06:19.468
I found Morgan's website
and I sent him a message,

00:06:19.492 --> 00:06:21.924
asking if any of his
Spanish-language novels

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:23.938
had been translated into English.

00:06:24.432 --> 00:06:26.863
And he said that nothing
had been published,

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:29.317
but he did have an unpublished translation

00:06:29.341 --> 00:06:31.325
of his novel "The Golden Horse."

00:06:31.887 --> 00:06:33.225
He emailed this to me,

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:36.383
allowing me to become
one of the first people ever

00:06:36.407 --> 00:06:38.251
to read that book in English.

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:41.579
Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith

00:06:41.603 --> 00:06:43.593
to share his work with me in this way.

00:06:44.015 --> 00:06:45.777
From Sweden to Palau,

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:49.792
writers and translators
sent me self-published books

00:06:49.816 --> 00:06:51.546
and unpublished manuscripts of books

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.450
that hadn't been picked
up by Anglophone publishers

00:06:54.474 --> 00:06:56.496
or that were no longer available,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.228
giving me privileged glimpses
of some remarkable imaginary worlds.

00:07:02.008 --> 00:07:03.159
I read, for example,

00:07:03.183 --> 00:07:07.773
about the Southern African king
Ngungunhane, who led the resistance

00:07:07.797 --> 00:07:10.459
against the Portuguese
in the 19th century;

00:07:11.113 --> 00:07:13.884
and about marriage rituals
in a remote village

00:07:13.908 --> 00:07:16.906
on the shores of the Caspian sea
in Turkmenistan.

00:07:18.524 --> 00:07:22.133
I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.450
(Laughter)

00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:28.867
And I read about an orgy
in a tree in Angola.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.022
But perhaps the most amazing example

00:07:35.046 --> 00:07:37.450
of the lengths that people
were prepared to go to

00:07:37.474 --> 00:07:39.101
to help me read the world,

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.574
came towards the end of my quest,

00:07:41.598 --> 00:07:45.432
when I tried to get hold of a book
from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking

00:07:45.456 --> 00:07:48.723
African island nation
of São Tomé and Príncipe.

00:07:49.364 --> 00:07:53.013
Now, having spent several months
trying everything I could think of to find

00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:56.376
a book that had been translated
into English from the nation,

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.642
it seemed as though
the only option left to me

00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:01.873
was to see if I could get something
translated for me from scratch.

00:08:02.404 --> 00:08:03.905
Now, I was really dubious

00:08:03.929 --> 00:08:06.325
whether anyone was going
to want to help with this,

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:08.848
and give up their time
for something like that.

00:08:09.525 --> 00:08:13.788
But, within a week of me putting
a call out on Twitter and Facebook

00:08:13.812 --> 00:08:15.766
for Portuguese speakers,

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.361
I had more people than I could
involve in the project,

00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:23.743
including Margaret Jull Costa,
a leader in her field,

00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:29.068
who has translated the work
of Nobel Prize winner José Saramago.

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.378
With my nine volunteers in place,

00:08:32.402 --> 00:08:34.990
I managed to find a book
by a São Toméan author

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.524
that I could buy enough copies of online.

00:08:37.548 --> 00:08:38.702
Here's one of them.

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:42.832
And I sent a copy out
to each of my volunteers.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:46.030
They all took on a couple
of short stories from this collection,

00:08:46.054 --> 00:08:49.681
stuck to their word, sent
their translations back to me,

00:08:49.705 --> 00:08:53.494
and within six weeks,
I had the entire book to read.

00:08:54.422 --> 00:08:58.884
In that case, as I found so often
during my year of reading the world,

00:08:58.908 --> 00:09:02.993
my not knowing and being open
about my limitations

00:09:03.017 --> 00:09:05.158
had become a big opportunity.

00:09:05.935 --> 00:09:08.122
When it came to São Tomé and Príncipe,

00:09:08.146 --> 00:09:11.492
it was a chance not only
to learn something new

00:09:11.516 --> 00:09:14.191
and discover a new collection of stories,

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:17.161
but also to bring together
a group of people

00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:20.414
and facilitate a joint creative endeavor.

00:09:20.901 --> 00:09:24.801
My weakness had become
the project's strength.

00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:29.485
The books I read that year
opened my eyes to many things.

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:31.696
As those who enjoy reading will know,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.500
books have an extraordinary power
to take you out of yourself

00:09:35.524 --> 00:09:37.668
and into someone else's mindset,

00:09:37.692 --> 00:09:39.534
so that, for a while at least,

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:41.783
you look at the world
through different eyes.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.853
That can be an uncomfortable experience,

00:09:44.877 --> 00:09:46.649
particularly if you're reading a book

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:50.097
from a culture that may have quite
different values to your own.

00:09:50.601 --> 00:09:52.750
But it can also be really enlightening.

00:09:53.402 --> 00:09:57.316
Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas
can help clarify your own thinking.

00:09:57.742 --> 00:09:59.909
And it can also show up blind spots

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.575
in the way you might have
been looking at the world.

00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:05.954
When I looked back at much
of the English-language literature

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:07.664
I'd grown up with, for example,

00:10:07.688 --> 00:10:10.725
I began to see how narrow a lot of it was,

00:10:10.749 --> 00:10:13.561
compared to the richness
that the world has to offer.

00:10:14.886 --> 00:10:17.048
And as the pages turned,

00:10:17.072 --> 00:10:19.538
something else started to happen, too.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.301
Little by little,

00:10:21.325 --> 00:10:25.610
that long list of countries that
I'd started the year with, changed

00:10:25.634 --> 00:10:29.993
from a rather dry, academic
register of place names

00:10:30.017 --> 00:10:32.698
into living, breathing entities.

00:10:33.475 --> 00:10:36.198
Now, I don't want to suggest
that it's at all possible

00:10:36.222 --> 00:10:40.428
to get a rounded picture of a country
simply by reading one book.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.599
But cumulatively, the stories
I read that year

00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:47.683
made me more alive than ever before

00:10:47.707 --> 00:10:53.781
to the richness, diversity and complexity
of our remarkable planet.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.647
It was as though the world's stories

00:10:56.671 --> 00:11:00.571
and the people who'd gone
to such lengths to help me read them

00:11:00.595 --> 00:11:02.500
had made it real to me.

00:11:04.086 --> 00:11:06.621
These days, when I look at my bookshelves

00:11:06.645 --> 00:11:09.770
or consider the works on my e-reader,

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.909
they tell a rather different story.

00:11:12.649 --> 00:11:15.995
It's the story of the power
books have to connect us

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:20.764
across political, geographical,
cultural, social, religious divides.

00:11:21.422 --> 00:11:25.564
It's the tale of the potential
human beings have to work together.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.662
And, it's testament

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:32.309
to the extraordinary times we live
in, where, thanks to the Internet,

00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:34.250
it's easier than ever before

00:11:34.274 --> 00:11:38.703
for a stranger to share a story,
a worldview, a book

00:11:38.727 --> 00:11:42.520
with someone she may never meet,
on the other side of the planet.

00:11:43.595 --> 00:11:46.693
I hope it's a story I'm reading
for many years to come.

00:11:47.074 --> 00:11:49.923
And I hope many more people will join me.

00:11:49.947 --> 00:11:52.561
If we all read more widely,
there'd be more incentive

00:11:52.585 --> 00:11:55.132
for publishers to translate more books,

00:11:55.156 --> 00:11:57.095
and we would all be richer for that.

00:11:57.713 --> 00:11:58.870
Thank you.

00:11:58.894 --> 00:12:02.628
(Applause)
