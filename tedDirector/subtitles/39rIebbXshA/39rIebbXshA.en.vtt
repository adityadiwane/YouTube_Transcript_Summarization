00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.330
"Jó napot, pacák" Which,
as somebody here must surely know,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
means "What's up, guys?" in Magyar,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
that peculiar non-Indo-European
language spoken by Hungarians

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
for which, given the fact
that cognitive diversity is

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
at least as threatened
as biodiversity on this planet,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.330
few would have imagined much
of a future even a century or two ago.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
But there it is: "Jó napot, pacák"

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.330
I said somebody here must
surely know, because

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.664
despite the fact that there aren't
that many Hungarians to begin with,

00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:52.664
and the further fact that, so far
as I know, there's not a drop

00:00:52.664 --> 00:00:56.330
of Hungarian blood in my veins,
at every critical juncture of my life

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.330
there has been a Hungarian friend
or mentor there beside me.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.616
I even have dreams that take
place in landscapes

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.330
I recognize as the landscapes
of Hungarian films,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
especially the early
movies of Miklos Jancso.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.330
So, how do I explain this
mysterious affinity?

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.330
Maybe it's because my native
state of South Carolina,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
which is not much smaller
than present-day Hungary,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
once imagined a future for itself
as an independent country.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
And as a consequence of that presumption,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.330
my hometown was burned
to the ground by an invading army,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.330
an experience that has befallen
many a Hungarian town and village

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
throughout its long and troubled history.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
Or maybe it's because when
I was a teenager back in the '50s,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
my uncle Henry -- having
denounced the Ku Klux Klan

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.330
and been bombed for his trouble
and had crosses burned in his yard,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.330
living under death threat -- took his wife
and children to Massachusetts for safety

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
and went back to South Carolina
to face down the Klan alone.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
That was a very Hungarian thing to do,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.330
as anyone will attest who remembers 1956.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
And of course, from time
to time Hungarians

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.569
have invented
their own equivalent of the Klan.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:13.330
Well, it seems to me that this
Hungarian presence in my life

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.330
is difficult to account for, but ultimately
I ascribe it to an admiration

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
for people with a complex moral awareness,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.330
with a heritage of guilt and defeat
matched by defiance and bravado.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
It's not a typical mindset
for most Americans,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.330
but it is perforce typical
of virtually all Hungarians.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
So, "Jó napot, pacák!"

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.330
I went back to South Carolina
after some 15 years amid the alien corn

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
at the tail end of the 1960s,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
with the reckless
condescension of that era

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
thinking I would save my people.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.330
Never mind the fact that they were slow
to acknowledge they needed saving.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
I labored in that vineyard
for a quarter century before

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.330
making my way to a little kingdom
of the just in upstate South Carolina,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
a Methodist-affiliated institution
of higher learning called Wofford College.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
I knew nothing about Wofford

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
and even less about Methodism,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.330
but I was reassured on the first day
that I taught at Wofford College

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.426
to find, among the auditors
in my classroom,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.330
a 90-year-old Hungarian, surrounded
by a bevy of middle-aged European women

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.950
who seemed to function
as an entourage of Rhinemaidens.

00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:26.330
His name was Sandor Teszler.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.330
He was a puckish widower
whose wife and children were dead

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
and whose grandchildren lived far away.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
In appearance, he resembled
Mahatma Gandhi,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
minus the loincloth,
plus orthopedic boots.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.330
He had been born in 1903 in the provinces

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
in what later would become Yugoslavia.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
He was ostracized as a child,
not because he was a Jew --

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.330
his parents weren't very
religious anyhow --

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.330
but because he had been born
with two club feet,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.330
a condition which, in those days,
required institutionalization

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.330
and a succession of painful operations
between the ages of one and 11.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
He went to the commercial business
high school as a young man

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.330
in Budapest, and there
he was as smart as he was modest

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
and he enjoyed a considerable success.
And after graduation

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
when he went into textile
engineering, the success continued.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
He built one plant after another.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
He married and had two sons. He
had friends in high places who

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
assured him that he was of great
value to the economy.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.330
Once, as he had left
instructions to have done,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
he was summoned in the middle of the night
by the night watchman at one of his plants.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.330
The night watchman had caught
an employee who was stealing socks --

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
it was a hosiery mill, and he simply
backed a truck up to the loading dock

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.330
and was shoveling in mountains of socks.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.330
Mr. Teszler went down to the plant
and confronted the thief and said,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.330
"But why do you steal from me? If you
need money you have only to ask."

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.330
The night watchman, seeing how things
were going and waxing indignant,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
said, "Well, we're going to call
the police, aren't we?"

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
But Mr. Teszler answered, "No,
that will not be necessary.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
He will not steal from us again."

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.330
Well, maybe he was too trusting,
because he stayed where he was

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
long after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.330
and even after the arrests
and deportations began in Budapest.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.330
He took the simple precaution of having
cyanide capsules placed in lockets

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
that could be worn about the necks
of himself and his family.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.330
And then one day, it happened:
he and his family were arrested

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
and they were taken to a death
house on the Danube.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.330
In those early days of the Final
Solution, it was handcrafted brutality;

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.330
people were beaten to death
and their bodies tossed into the river.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.330
But none who entered that death
house had ever come out alive.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.330
And in a twist you would not believe
in a Steven Spielberg film --

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.330
the Gauleiter who was overseeing this
brutal beating was the very same thief

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.330
who had stolen socks
from Mr. Teszler's hosiery mill.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.330
It was a brutal beating. And
midway through that brutality,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
one of Mr. Teszler's sons,
Andrew, looked up and said,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
"Is it time to take
the capsule now, Papa?"

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.330
And the Gauleiter, who afterwards
vanishes from this story,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
leaned down and whispered
into Mr. Teszler's ear,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
"No, do not take the capsule.
Help is on the way."

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
And then resumed the beating.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.569
But help was on the way,
and shortly afterwards

00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:22.330
a car arrived from the Swiss Embassy.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.330
They were spirited to safety. They
were reclassified as Yugoslav citizens

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
and they managed to stay
one step ahead of their pursuers

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.330
for the duration of the War,
surviving burnings and bombings

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.711
and, at the end of the War,
arrest by the Soviets.

00:06:35.735 --> 00:06:39.330
Probably, Mr. Teszler had gotten
some money into Swiss bank accounts

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.330
because he managed to take
his family first to Great Britain,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.569
then to Long Island and then to the center
of the textile industry in the American South.

00:06:47.593 --> 00:06:51.330
Which, as chance would have it,
was Spartanburg, South Carolina,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
the location of Wofford College.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:59.330
And there, Mr. Teszler began all over again
and once again achieved immense success,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
especially after he invented the process

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
for manufacturing a new
fabric called double-knit.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:11.330
And then in the late 1950s, in the aftermath
of Brown v. Board of Education,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
when the Klan was resurgent
all over the South,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.330
Mr. Teszler said, "I have
heard this talk before."

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.330
And he called his top
assistant to him and asked,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
"Where would you say, in this
region, racism is most virulent?"

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.330
"Well, I don't rightly know, Mr. Teszler.
I reckon that would be Kings Mountain."

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.330
"Good. Buy us some land in Kings Mountain

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
and announce we are going
to build a major plant there."

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
The man did as he was told,
and shortly afterwards,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.330
Mr. Teszler received a visit
from the white mayor of Kings Mountain.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
Now, you should know that at that time,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.330
the textile industry in the South
was notoriously segregated.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.330
The white mayor visited
Mr. Teszler and said,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.759
"Mr. Teszler, I trust you’re going
to be hiring a lot of white workers."

00:07:57.783 --> 00:08:01.330
Mr. Teszler told him, "You bring me
the best workers that you can find,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.569
and if they are good
enough, I will hire them."

00:08:03.593 --> 00:08:08.330
He also received a visit from the leader
of the black community,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
a minister, who said, "Mr. Teszler,
I sure hope you're going to

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.854
hire some black workers
for this new plant of yours."

00:08:12.878 --> 00:08:16.330
He got the same answer: "You bring
the best workers that you can find,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
and if they are good
enough, I will hire them."

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.807
As it happens, the black minister did
his job better than the white mayor,

00:08:22.807 --> 00:08:23.807
but that's neither here or there.

00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:27.330
Mr. Teszler hired 16 men:
eight white, eight black.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
They were to be his seed
group, his future foremen.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
He had installed the heavy
equipment for his new process

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
in an abandoned store
in the vicinity of Kings Mountain,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.330
and for two months these 16 men
would live and work together,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.330
mastering the new process.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.330
He gathered them together
after an initial tour of that facility

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
and he asked if there were any questions.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.759
There was hemming and hawing
and shuffling of feet,

00:08:48.783 --> 00:08:51.783
and then one of the white workers
stepped forward and said,

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
"Well, yeah. We’ve looked at this place
and there's only one place to sleep,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
there's only one place to eat,
there's only one bathroom,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.330
there's only one water fountain. Is this
plant going to be integrated or what?"

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.330
Mr. Teszler said, "You are being paid twice the wages
of any other textile workers in this region

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.330
and this is how we do business.
Do you have any other questions?"

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.330
"No, I reckon I don't."

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.330
And two months later when
the main plant opened

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.473
and hundreds of new
workers, white and black,

00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:23.807
poured in to see the facility
for the first time,

00:09:23.831 --> 00:09:29.330
they were met by the 16 foremen, white
and black, standing shoulder to shoulder.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.330
They toured the facility and were asked
if there were any questions, and

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.330
inevitably the same question arose:

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
"Is this plant integrated or what?"

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
And one of the white foremen
stepped forward and said,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.330
"You are being paid twice
the wages of any other workers

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.330
in this industry in this region
and this is how we do business.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
Do you have any other questions?"

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.330
And there were none. In one fell swoop,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.330
Mr. Teszler had integrated the textile
industry in that part of the South.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.330
It was an achievement
worthy of Mahatma Gandhi,

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.330
conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer
and the idealism of a saint.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:10.330
In his eighties, Mr. Teszler, having
retired from the textile industry,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
adopted Wofford College,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
auditing courses every semester,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.330
and because he had a tendency
to kiss anything that moved,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.330
becoming affectionately known as "Opi"
-- which is Magyar for grandfather --

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.330
by all and sundry. Before I got
there, the library of the college

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:31.330
had been named for Mr. Teszler,
and after I arrived in 1993,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.330
the faculty decided to honor itself by naming
Mr. Teszler Professor of the College --

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
partly because at that point
he had already taken

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
all of the courses in the catalog,
but mainly because

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:47.330
he was so conspicuously
wiser than any one of us.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.330
To me, it was immensely reassuring
that the presiding spirit

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.330
of this little Methodist college
in upstate South Carolina

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.330
was a Holocaust survivor
from Central Europe.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.330
Wise he was, indeed, but he also
had a wonderful sense of humor.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.330
And once for an interdisciplinary class,

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.330
I was screening the opening segment
of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal."

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.330
As the medieval knight Antonius Block
returns from the wild goose chase

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
of the Crusades and arrives
on the rocky shore of Sweden,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
only to find the specter
of death waiting for him,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.330
Mr. Teszler sat in the dark
with his fellow students. And

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.330
as death opened his cloak
to embrace the knight

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.330
in a ghastly embrace, I heard
Mr. Teszler's tremulous voice:

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.330
"Uh oh," he said, "This doesn't
look so good." (Laughter)

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:43.330
But it was music that was his greatest
passion, especially opera.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
And on the first occasion
that I visited his house, he gave me

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.330
honor of deciding what piece
of music we would listen to.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.330
And I delighted him by rejecting
"Cavalleria Rusticana"

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.330
in favor of Bela
Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle."

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.330
I love Bartok's music, as did Mr. Teszler,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.330
and he had virtually every recording
of Bartok's music ever issued.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.950
And it was at his house
that I heard for the first time

00:12:06.974 --> 00:12:09.330
Bartok's Third Piano
Concerto and learned from

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:14.330
Mr. Teszler that it had been composed
in nearby Asheville, North Carolina

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
in the last year of the composer's life.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
He was dying of leukemia and he knew it,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
and he dedicated this
concerto to his wife,

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.330
Dita, who was herself a concert pianist.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.330
And into the slow, second movement,
marked "adagio religioso,"

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.330
he incorporated the sounds
of birdsong that he heard

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
outside his window in what he knew
would be his last spring;

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:42.330
he was imagining a future for her
in which he would play no part.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:48.330
And clearly this composition
is his final statement to her --

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
it was first performed after his death --

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
and through her to the world.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:59.330
And just as clearly, it is saying,
"It's okay. It was all so beautiful.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.330
Whenever you hear this, I will be there."

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:08.330
It was only after Mr. Teszler's death
that I learned

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.330
that the marker on the grave of Bela
Bartok in Hartsdale, New York

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:17.330
was paid for by Sandor Teszler.
"Jó napot, Bela!"

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:22.330
Not long before Mr. Teszler’s
own death at the age of 97,

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.330
he heard me hold forth on human iniquity.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.711
I delivered a lecture
in which I described history

00:13:28.735 --> 00:13:32.330
as, on the whole, a tidal wave
of human suffering and brutality,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:37.330
and Mr. Teszler came up to me afterwards
with gentle reproach and said,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:43.330
"You know, Doctor, human beings
are fundamentally good."

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.330
And I made a vow
to myself, then and there,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.330
that if this man who had such
cause to think otherwise

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.664
had reached that conclusion,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.330
I would not presume to differ
until he released me from my vow.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.330
And now he's dead, so
I'm stuck with my vow.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
"Jó napot, Sandor!"

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.330
I thought my skein of Hungarian
mentors had come to an end,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:14.330
but almost immediately I met Francis
Robicsek, a Hungarian doctor --

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.330
actually a heart surgeon in Charlotte, North
Carolina, then in his late seventies --

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.473
who had been a pioneer
in open-heart surgery,

00:14:20.497 --> 00:14:24.330
and, tinkering away
in his garage behind his house,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.330
had invented many of the devices
that are standard parts of those procedures.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:34.330
He's also a prodigious art collector,
beginning as an intern in Budapest

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.330
by collecting 16th- and 17th-century
Dutch art and Hungarian painting,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:43.330
and when he came to this country
moving on to Spanish colonial art,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.330
Russian icons and finally Mayan ceramics.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.330
He's the author of seven books,
six of them on Mayan ceramics.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.330
It was he who broke the Mayan
codex, enabling scholars to relate

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.330
the pictographs on Mayan ceramics
to the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.330
On the occasion of my first
visit, we toured his house

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.330
and we saw hundreds
of works of museum quality,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:08.330
and then we paused in front of a closed
door and Dr. Robicsek said,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.330
with obvious pride, "Now
for the piece De resistance."

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
And he opened the door
and we walked into a

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:20.330
windowless 20-by-20-foot room
with shelves from floor to ceiling, and

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.330
crammed on every shelf
his collection of Mayan ceramics.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.807
Now, I know absolutely nothing
about Mayan ceramics,

00:15:24.807 --> 00:15:27.807
but I wanted to be as ingratiating
as possible so I said,

00:15:27.807 --> 00:15:31.330
"But Dr. Robicsek, this
is absolutely dazzling."

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
"Yes," he said. "That
is what the Louvre said.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.330
They would not leave me alone
until I let them have a piece,

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
but it was not a good one." (Laughter)

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.330
Well, it occurred to me
that I should invite Dr. Robicsek

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.330
to lecture at Wofford
College on -- what else?

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.330
-- Leonardo da Vinci. And further,
I should invite him to meet

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.330
my oldest trustee, who had majored
in French history at Yale

00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:00.330
some 70-odd years before and,
at 89, still ruled the world's

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:05.330
largest privately owned textile
empire with an iron hand.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.330
His name is Roger Milliken.
And Mr. Milliken agreed,

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.330
and Dr. Robicsek agreed.
And Dr. Robicsek visited

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.330
and delivered the lecture
and it was a dazzling success.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.330
And afterwards we convened
at the President's House with Dr. Robicsek

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.330
on one hand, Mr. Milliken on the other.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.473
And it was only at that moment,
as we were sitting down to dinner,

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.045
that I recognized the enormity
of the risk I had created,

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:30.330
because to bring these two titans,
these two masters of the universe

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:35.330
together -- it was like introducing Mothra
to Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.473
If they didn't like each other,
we could all get trampled to death.

00:16:38.473 --> 00:16:40.473
But they did, they did like each other.

00:16:40.473 --> 00:16:43.330
They got along famously
until the very end of the meal,

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.330
and then they got into a furious argument.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.330
And what they were arguing about was this:

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:52.330
whether the second Harry Potter movie
was as good as the first. (Laughter)

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:57.330
Mr. Milliken said it was not.
Dr. Robicsek disagreed.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.330
I was still trying to take
in the notion that these titans,

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.997
these masters of the universe, in their spare
time watch Harry Potter movies,

00:17:05.021 --> 00:17:08.330
when Mr. Milliken thought
he would win the argument by saying,

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.330
"You just think it's so good
because you didn't read the book."

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:15.330
And Dr. Robicsek reeled back in his chair,
but quickly gathered his wits,

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.521
leaned forward and said, "Well,
that is true, but I'll bet you went

00:17:18.545 --> 00:17:23.330
to the movie with a grandchild." "Well,
yes, I did," conceded Mr. Milliken.

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:28.330
"Aha!" said Dr. Robicsek. "I went to the movie
all by myself." (Laughter) (Applause)

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:33.330
And I realized, in this
moment of revelation,

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.330
that what these two men were
revealing was the secret

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.330
of their extraordinary success,
each in his own right.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.330
And it lay precisely
in that insatiable curiosity,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.330
that irrepressible desire to know,
no matter what the subject,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.330
no matter what the cost,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.330
even at a time when the keepers
of the Doomsday Clock

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.426
are willing to bet even money
that the human race won't be around

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:01.330
to imagine anything in the year
2100, a scant 93 years from now.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.330
"Live each day as if it
is your last," said Mahatma Gandhi.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.330
"Learn as if you'll live forever."

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.330
This is what I'm passionate about.
It is precisely this.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:21.330
It is this inextinguishable, undaunted
appetite for learning and experience,

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.521
no matter how risible,
no matter how esoteric,

00:18:23.545 --> 00:18:26.330
no matter how seditious it might seem.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:32.330
This defines the imagined futures
of our fellow Hungarians --

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:37.330
Robicsek, Teszler and Bartok
-- as it does my own.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:41.330
As it does, I suspect,
that of everybody here.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:47.330
To which I need only add, "Ez
a mi munkank; es nem is keves."

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:52.330
This is our task; we know it will be hard.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:58.330
"Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves.
Jó napot, pacák!" (Applause)
