00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
A tourist is backpacking

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
through the highlands of Scotland,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and he stops at a pub to get a drink.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
And the only people in there is a bartender

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and an old man nursing a beer.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
"You see this bar?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
I built this bar with my bare hands

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
from the finest wood in the county.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Gave it more love and care than my own child.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
But do they call me MacGregor the bar builder? No."

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Points out the window.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
"You see that stone wall out there?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I built that stone wall with my bare hands.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Found every stone, placed them just so through the rain and the cold.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No."

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Points out the window.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
"You see that pier on the lake out there?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
I built that pier with my bare hands.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Drove the pilings against the tide of the sand, plank by plank.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.260
But do they call me MacGregor the pier builder? No.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
But you fuck one goat ... "

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:22.260
(Laughter)

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Storytelling --

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
(Laughter)

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
is joke telling.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
It's knowing your punchline,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
your ending,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
knowing that everything you're saying, from the first sentence to the last,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
is leading to a singular goal,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and ideally confirming some truth

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
that deepens our understandings

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
of who we are as human beings.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
We all love stories.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
We're born for them.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Stories affirm who we are.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And nothing does a greater affirmation

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
than when we connect through stories.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
It can cross the barriers of time,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
past, present and future,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and allow us to experience

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
the similarities between ourselves

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and through others, real and imagined.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
The children's television host Mr. Rogers

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
always carried in his wallet

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
a quote from a social worker

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
that said, "Frankly, there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
once you've heard their story."

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And the way I like to interpret that

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.260
is probably the greatest story commandment,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
which is "Make me care" --

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
please, emotionally,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
intellectually, aesthetically,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
just make me care.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
We all know what it's like to not care.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
You've gone through hundreds of TV channels,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
just switching channel after channel,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and then suddenly you actually stop on one.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
It's already halfway over,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
That's not by chance,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
that's by design.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.260
So it got me thinking, what if I told you my history was story,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
how I was born for it,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
how I learned along the way this subject matter?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And to make it more interesting,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
we'll start from the ending

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and we'll go to the beginning.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
it would go something like this:

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And that's what ultimately led me

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
to speaking to you here at TED

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
about story.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And the most current story lesson that I've had

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
was completing the film I've just done

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
this year in 2012.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
The film is "John Carter." It's based on a book called "The Princess of Mars,"

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
which was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
as a character inside this movie, and as the narrator.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And he's summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansion

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
with a telegram saying, "See me at once."

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
But once he gets there,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.260
he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Thing only opens from the inside.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
He insisted,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
no embalming, no open coffin,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
no funeral.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
You don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
by being like the rest of us, huh?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Come, let's go inside.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
AS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
is it's fundamentally making a promise.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
It's making a promise to you

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And that's what all good stories should do at the beginning, is they should give you a promise.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
You could do it an infinite amount of ways.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Sometimes it's as simple as "Once upon a time ... "

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
These Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And I always thought it was such a fantastic device.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
It's like a guy inviting you around the campfire,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
or somebody in a bar saying, "Here, let me tell you a story.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
It didn't happen to me, it happened to somebody else,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
but it's going to be worth your time."

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
A well told promise

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.260
is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
and propels you forward through the story

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
to the end.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
In 2008,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
I pushed all the theories that I had on story at the time

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
to the limits of my understanding on this project.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.260

♫ That it only ♫

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
(Laughter)

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
AS: Storytelling without dialogue.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
It's the purest form of cinematic storytelling.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
It's the most inclusive approach you can take.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
It confirmed something I really had a hunch on,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
is that the audience

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
actually wants to work for their meal.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
They just don't want to know that they're doing that.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
That's your job as a storyteller,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
is to hide the fact

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
that you're making them work for their meal.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
We're born problem solvers.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
We're compelled to deduce

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and to deduct,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
because that's what we do in real life.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
It's this well-organized absence of information

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
that draws us in.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
There's a reason that we're all attracted to an infant or a puppy.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
It's not just that they're damn cute;

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
it's because they can't completely express

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
what they're thinking and what their intentions are.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
And it's like a magnet.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
We can't stop ourselves

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
from wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
I first started

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
really understanding this storytelling device

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
when I was writing with Bob Peterson on "Finding Nemo."

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And we would call this the unifying theory of two plus two.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Make the audience put things together.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Don't give them four,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
give them two plus two.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
The elements you provide and the order you place them in

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
is crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
Editors and screenwriters have known this all along.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
It's the invisible application

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
that holds our attention to story.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
I don't mean to make it sound

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
like this is an actual exact science, it's not.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
That's what's so special about stories,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
they're not a widget, they aren't exact.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Stories are inevitable, if they're good,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
but they're not predictable.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
I took a seminar in this year

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
with an acting teacher named Judith Weston.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And I learned a key insight to character.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
She believed that all well-drawn characters

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
have a spine.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And the idea is that the character has an inner motor,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
a dominant, unconscious goal that they're striving for,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
an itch that they can't scratch.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
She gave a wonderful example of Michael Corleone,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
Al Pacino's character in "The Godfather,"

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
and that probably his spine

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
was to please his father.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
And it's something that always drove all his choices.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Even after his father died,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.260
he was still trying to scratch that itch.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
I took to this like a duck to water.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Wall-E's was to find the beauty.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
Marlin's, the father in "Finding Nemo,"

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
was to prevent harm.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
And Woody's was to do what was best for his child.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
And these spines don't always drive you to make the best choices.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
I'm really blessed to be a parent,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
and watching my children grow, I really firmly believe

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
that you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
and you don't have any say about it,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and there's no changing it.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
All you can do is learn to recognize it

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
and own it.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And some of us are born with temperaments that are positive,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
some are negative.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
But a major threshold is passed

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
when you mature enough

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
to acknowledge what drives you

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
and to take the wheel and steer it.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
As parents, you're always learning who your children are.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
They're learning who they are.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And you're still learning who you are.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
So we're all learning all the time.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
And that's why change is fundamental in story.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
If things go static, stories die,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
because life is never static.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
In 1998,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
I had finished writing "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life"

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
and I was completely hooked on screenwriting.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
So I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
So I researched everything I possibly could.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
And I finally came across this fantastic quote

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
by a British playwright, William Archer:

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
"Drama is anticipation

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
mingled with uncertainty."

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
It's an incredibly insightful definition.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
When you're telling a story,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
have you constructed anticipation?

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
In the short-term, have you made me want to know

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
what will happen next?

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
But more importantly,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
have you made me want to know

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
how it will all conclude in the long-term?

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
Have you constructed honest conflicts

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
with truth that creates doubt

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
in what the outcome might be?

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
An example would be in "Finding Nemo,"

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
in the short tension, you were always worried,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
would Dory's short-term memory

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
make her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
But under that was this global tension

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
of will we ever find Nemo

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
in this huge, vast ocean?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
In our earliest days at Pixar,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
before we truly understood the invisible workings of story,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
we were simply a group of guys just going on our gut, going on our instincts.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And it's interesting to see

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
how that led us places

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
that were actually pretty good.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
You've got to remember that in this time of year,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
1993,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
what was considered a successful animated picture

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
was "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast,"

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
"Aladdin," "Lion King."

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
So when we pitched "Toy Story" to Tom Hanks for the first time,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
he walked in and he said,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
"You don't want me to sing, do you?"

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
And I thought that epitomized perfectly

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
what everybody thought animation had to be at the time.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
But we really wanted to prove

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
that you could tell stories completely different in animation.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
We didn't have any influence then,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
so we had a little secret list of rules

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
that we kept to ourselves.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And they were: No songs,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
no "I want" moment,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
no happy village,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
no love story.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
And the irony is that, in the first year,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
our story was not working at all

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and Disney was panicking.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
So they privately got advice

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
from a famous lyricist, who I won't name,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and he faxed them some suggestions.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
And we got a hold of that fax.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
And the fax said,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
there should be songs,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
there should be an "I want" song,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
there should be a happy village song,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
there should be a love story

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
and there should be a villain.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
And thank goodness

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
we were just too young, rebellious and contrarian at the time.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
That just gave us more determination

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
to prove that you could build a better story.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
And a year after that, we did conquer it.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
And it just went to prove

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
that storytelling has guidelines,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
not hard, fast rules.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Another fundamental thing we learned

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
was about liking your main character.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
And we had naively thought,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
so you've got to start from someplace.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
So let's make him selfish. And this is what you get.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
(Voice Over) Woody: What do you think you're doing?

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
Off the bed.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Hey, off the bed!

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Mr. Potato Head: You going to make us, Woody?

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Woody: No, he is.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Slinky? Slink ... Slinky!

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
Get up here and do your job.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Are you deaf?

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
I said, take care of them.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Slinky: I'm sorry, Woody,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
but I have to agree with them.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
I don't think what you did was right.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Woody: What? Am I hearing correctly?

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
You don't think I was right?

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.260
Who said your job was to think, Spring Wiener?

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
AS: So how do you make a selfish character likable?

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
We realized, you can make him kind,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
generous, funny, considerate,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
as long as one condition is met for him,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
is that he stays the top toy.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
And that's what it really is,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
is that we all live life conditionally.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
as long as certain conditions are met.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
After that, all bets are off.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
And before I'd even decided to make storytelling my career,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
I can now see key things that happened in my youth

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
that really sort of opened my eyes

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
to certain things about story.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
In 1986, I truly understood the notion

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
of story having a theme.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
And that was the year that they restored and re-released

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
"Lawrence of Arabia."

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
And I saw that thing seven times in one month.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
I couldn't get enough of it.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
I could just tell there was a grand design under it --

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
in every shot, every scene, every line.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Yet, on the surface it just seemed

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
to be depicting his historical lineage

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
of what went on.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
Yet, there was something more being said. What exactly was it?

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And it wasn't until, on one of my later viewings,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
that the veil was lifted

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
and it was in a scene where he's walked across the Sinai Desert

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and he's reached the Suez Canal,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and I suddenly got it.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:39.260
(Video) Boy: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Cyclist: Who are you?

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
Who are you?

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
AS: That was the theme: Who are you?

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
Here were all these seemingly disparate

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
events and dialogues

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
that just were chronologically telling the history of him,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
but underneath it was a constant,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
a guideline, a road map.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
Everything Lawrence did in that movie

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
was an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
A strong theme is always running through

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
a well-told story.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
When I was five,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
I was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
that I feel a story should have,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
but is rarely invoked.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And this is what my mother took me to when I was five.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
(Video) Thumper: Come on. It's all right.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
Look.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
The water's stiff.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
Bambi: Yippee!

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
Thumper: Some fun,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
huh, Bambi?

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Come on. Get up.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Like this.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
Ha ha. No, no, no.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
AS: I walked out of there

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
wide-eyed with wonder.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
And that's what I think the magic ingredient is,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
the secret sauce,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
is can you invoke wonder.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
Wonder is honest, it's completely innocent.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
It can't be artificially evoked.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
For me, there's no greater ability

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling --

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
and have them surrender to wonder.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
When it's tapped, the affirmation of being alive,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
it reaches you almost to a cellular level.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
And when an artist does that to another artist,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
it's like you're compelled to pass it on.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
It's like a dormant command

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
that suddenly is activated in you, like a call to Devil's Tower.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
Do unto others what's been done to you.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
The best stories infuse wonder.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
When I was four years old,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
I have a vivid memory

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
of finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
and asking my dad what they were.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
And he said I had a matching pair like that on my head,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
but I couldn't see them because of my hair.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
And he explained that when I was born,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
I was born premature,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
that I came out much too early,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
and I wasn't fully baked;

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
I was very, very sick.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
And when the doctor took a look at this yellow kid with black teeth,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
he looked straight at my mom and said,

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
"He's not going to live."

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
And I was in the hospital for months.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
And many blood transfusions later,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
I lived,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
and that made me special.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
I don't know if I really believe that.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260
I don't know if my parents really believe that,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.260
but I didn't want to prove them wrong.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
Whatever I ended up being good at,

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.260
I would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.260
(Video) (Crying)

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.260
Marlin: There, there, there.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.260
It's okay, daddy's here.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.260
Daddy's got you.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
I promise,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.260
I will never let anything happen to you, Nemo.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.260
AS: And that's the first story lesson I ever learned.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
Use what you know. Draw from it.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
It doesn't always mean plot or fact.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.260
It means capturing a truth from your experiencing it,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.260
expressing values you personally feel

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
deep down in your core.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
here at TEDTalk today.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
Thank you.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:10.260
(Applause)
