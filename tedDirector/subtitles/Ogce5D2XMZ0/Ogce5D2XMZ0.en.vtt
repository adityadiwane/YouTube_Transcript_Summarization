00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.160
I'd like to take you back
about seven years in my life.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.170
Friday afternoon,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.210
a few days before Christmas 2009.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.120
I was the director of operations

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.240
at a consumer products company
in San Francisco,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.010
and I was called into a meeting
that was already in progress.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.140
That meeting turned out
to be my exit interview.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.160
I was fired, along with several others.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.150
I was 64 years old at the time.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.290
It wasn't completely unexpected.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.130
I signed a stack of papers,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.070
gathered my personal effects,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.020
and left to join my wife

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.210
who was waiting for me
at a nearby restaurant,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.030
completely unaware.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.210
Fast-forward several hours,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.220
we both got really silly drunk.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.090
(Laughter)

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.050
So, 40 plus years of continuous employment

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.210
for a variety of companies,
large and small,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.020
was over.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.030
I had a good a network,
a good reputation --

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.170
I thought I'd be just fine.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.010
I was an engineer
in manufacturing and packaging.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.160
I had a good background.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.100
Retirement was, like for so many people,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.090
simply not an option for me.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.050
So I turned to consulting
for the next couple of years

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.090
without any passion whatsoever.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.120
And then an idea began to take root,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.280
born from my concern for our environment.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.000
I wanted to build my own business,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.120
designing and manufacturing
biodegradable packaging from waste --

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.130
paper, agricultural, even textile waste --

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.100
replacing the toxic,
disposable plastic packaging

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.130
to which we've all become addicted.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.220
This is called clean technology,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.230
and it felt really meaningful to me.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.160
A venture that could help to reduce
the billions of pounds

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.070
of single-use plastic packaging
dumped each year

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.150
and polluting our land,
our rivers and our oceans,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.200
and left for future
generations to resolve --

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.040
our grandchildren,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.130
my grandchildren.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.170
And so now at the age of 66,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.220
with 40 years of experience,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.130
I became an entrepreneur
for the very first time.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.160
(Cheers)

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.050
(Applause)

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.110
Thank you.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.150
But there's more.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.200
(Laughter)

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.070
Lots of issues to deal with:

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.110
manufacturing, outsourcing, job creation,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.100
patents, partnerships, funding --

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.230
these are all typical
issues for a start-up,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.180
but hardly typical for me.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.260
And a word about funding.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.210
I live and work in San Francisco.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.140
And if you're looking for funding,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.070
you are typically going to compete
with some very young people

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.030
from the high-tech industry,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.210
and it can be very discouraging
and intimidating.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.200
I have shoes older
than most of these people.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.260
(Laughter)

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.190
I do.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.230
(Laughter)

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.170
But five years later,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.220
I'm thrilled and proud to share with you

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.160
that our revenues have doubled every year,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.010
we have no debt,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.250
we have several marquee clients,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.070
our patent was issued,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.200
I have a wonderful partner

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.230
who's been with me
right from the beginning,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.220
and we've won more than 20 awards
for the work that we've done.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.000
But best of all,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.280
we've made a small dent --

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.040
a very small dent --

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.000
in the worldwide plastic pollution crisis.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.190
(Applause)

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.040
And I am doing the most rewarding
and meaningful work of my life right now.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.060
I can tell you there's lots of resources
available to entrepreneurs of all ages,

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.130
but what I really yearned for
five years ago

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.210
was to find other first-time entrepreneurs

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.270
who were my age.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.140
I wanted to connect with them.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.140
I had no role models, absolutely none.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.280
That 20-something app developer
from Silicon Valley

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.110
was not my role model.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.110
(Laughter)

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.250
I'm sure he was very clever --

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.080
(Laughter)

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.280
I want to do something about that,

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.060
and I want all of us
to do something about that.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.230
I want us to start talking more

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.290
about people who don't become
entrepreneurs until they are seniors.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.020
Talking about these bold
men and women who are checking in

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.270
when their peers, in essence,
are checking out.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.110
And then connecting all these people
across industries, across regions,

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.000
across countries --

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.160
building a community.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.010
You know, the Small Business
Administration tells us

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.090
that 64 percent of new jobs
created in the private sector in the USA

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.060
are thanks to small businesses like mine.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.040
And who's to say
that we'll stay forever small?

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.030
We have an interesting culture

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.130
that really expects
when you reach a certain age,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.220
you're going to be golfing,
or playing checkers,

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.060
or babysitting the grandkids
all of the time.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.230
And I adore my grandchildren --

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.280
(Laughter)

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.190
and I'm also passionate

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.010
about doing something meaningful
in the global marketplace.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.040
And I'm going to have lots of company.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.170
The Census Bureau says that by 2050,

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.270
there will be 84 million seniors
in this country.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.270
That's an amazing number.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.140
That's almost twice as many
as we have today.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.140
Can you imagine how many
first-time entrepreneurs there will be

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.190
among 84 million people?

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.210
And they'll all have
four decades of experience.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.140
(Laughter)

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.270
So when I say, "Let's start talking more
about these wonderful entrepreneurs,"

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.030
I mean, let's talk about their ventures,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.220
just as we do the ventures
of their much younger counterparts.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.140
The older entrepreneurs in this country
have a 70 percent success rate

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.280
starting new ventures.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.260
70 percent success rate.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.150
We're like the Golden State Warriors
of entrepreneurs --

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.170
(Laughter)

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.030
(Applause)

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.290
And that number plummets to 28 percent
for younger entrepreneurs.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.190
This is according to a UK-based
group called CMI.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.290
Aren't the accomplishments
of a 70-year-old entrepreneur

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.140
every bit as meaningful,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.260
every bit as newsworthy,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.010
as the accomplishments
of a 30-year-old entrepreneur?

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.130
Of course they are.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.070
That's why I'd like to make the phrase
"70 over 70" just as --

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.080
(Laughter)

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.030
just as commonplace
as the phrase "30 under 30."

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.050
(Applause)

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.110
Thank you.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.290
(Cheers)

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.200
(Applause)
