00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.094
My name's Seth Priebatsch.
I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.586
I'm a proud Princeton dropout.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.664
Also proud to have relocated
here to Boston,

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.235
where I actually grew up.

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.039
(Applause) Yeah, Boston.

00:00:26.063 --> 00:00:29.365
Easy wins, I should just name
the counties that we've got around here.

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:31.580
I'm also fairly determined
to try and build

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:33.193
a game layer on top of the world.

00:00:33.217 --> 00:00:35.877
This is sort of a new concept
and it's really important,

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:38.998
because while the last decade
was the decade of social,

00:00:39.022 --> 00:00:42.803
the decade where the framework in which
we connect with other people was built,

00:00:42.827 --> 00:00:47.150
this next decade will be the decade
where the game framework is built,

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:50.102
where the motivations we use
to actually influence behavior

00:00:50.126 --> 00:00:52.341
and the framework
in which that is constructed,

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:54.484
is decided upon,
and that's really important.

00:00:54.508 --> 00:00:57.087
I say I want to build a game layer
on top of the world,

00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:58.362
but that's not quite true,

00:00:58.386 --> 00:01:01.536
because it's already under construction;
it's already happening.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.420
And it looks like this right now.

00:01:03.444 --> 00:01:06.236
It looks like the Web did
back in 1997, right?

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.186
It's not very good. It's cluttered.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.100
It's filled with lots of different things
that, in short, aren't that fun.

00:01:12.124 --> 00:01:15.368
There are credit card schemes
and airline mile programs,

00:01:15.392 --> 00:01:18.032
coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes

00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:21.917
that actually do use game dynamics
and are building the game layer --

00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:23.236
they just suck.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.325
They're not very well-designed.

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:26.393
(Laughter)

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:27.961
So that's unfortunate.

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:32.143
But luckily, as my favorite action
hero, Bob the Builder, says,

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:34.403
"We can do better.
We can build this better."

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:38.236
And the tools, the resources
that we use to build a game layer,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.069
are game dynamics themselves.

00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:42.862
And so the crux of this presentation
is going to go through

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:44.624
four really important game dynamics,

00:01:44.648 --> 00:01:47.433
really interesting things,
that, if you use consciously,

00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:50.236
you can use to influence behavior,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.617
both for good, for bad, for in-between.

00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:53.940
Hopefully for good.

00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:57.964
But this is the important stage
in which that framework will get built,

00:01:57.988 --> 00:02:01.085
and so we want to all be thinking
about it consciously now.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.366
Before we jump into that,
there's a question of:

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.541
Why is this important?

00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:05.719
I'm making this claim

00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:07.893
that there's a game layer
on top of the world,

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:10.255
and it's very important
that we build it properly.

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.949
The reason it's so important
is that, in the last decade,

00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:15.859
what we've seen has been
building the social layer,

00:02:15.883 --> 00:02:18.351
has been this framework for connections,

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:21.939
and construction on that layer
is over, it's finished.

00:02:21.963 --> 00:02:23.441
There's still a lot to explore,

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:25.756
still a lot of people
trying to figure out social

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.882
and how we leverage this
and how we use this,

00:02:27.906 --> 00:02:29.689
but the framework itself is done,

00:02:29.713 --> 00:02:31.199
and it's called Facebook.

00:02:32.175 --> 00:02:35.546
And that's OK, right? A lot of people
are very happy with Facebook.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.159
I like it quite a lot.

00:02:37.183 --> 00:02:39.486
They've created this thing
called the Open Graph,

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.236
and they own all of our connections.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.867
They own half a billion people.

00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:45.075
So when you want to build
on the social layer,

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.311
the framework has been decided;
it is the Open Graph API.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.345
And if you're happy with that, fantastic.

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.087
If you're not, too bad.
There's nothing you can do.

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:56.236
And that's a real thing.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.236
I mean, we want to build frameworks
in a way that makes it acceptable

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.347
and makes it productive down the road.

00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.989
So, the social layer
is all about these connections.

00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:08.907
The game layer is all about influence.

00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:11.175
It's not about adding
a social fabric to the web

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.826
and connecting you to other people

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.804
everywhere you are and everywhere you go,

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:17.124
it's actually about using
dynamics, using forces,

00:03:17.148 --> 00:03:20.276
to influence the behavior
of where you are, what you do there,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.453
how you do it.

00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:22.971
That's really, really powerful.

00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:25.727
And it's going to be more important
than the social layer,

00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.646
and affect our lives more deeply
and perhaps more invisibly.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.468
So it's incredibly critical
that at this moment,

00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:33.212
while it's just getting constructed,

00:03:33.236 --> 00:03:35.542
while the frameworks
like Facebook or Open Graph

00:03:35.566 --> 00:03:37.836
are being created
for the game-layer equivalent,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.784
that we think about it very consciously,

00:03:39.808 --> 00:03:42.196
and that we do it in a way
that is open, available,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.709
and can be leveraged for good.

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:46.263
So that's what I want to talk
about for game dynamics,

00:03:46.287 --> 00:03:48.010
because construction has just begun,

00:03:48.034 --> 00:03:50.383
and the more consciously
we can think about this,

00:03:50.407 --> 00:03:53.471
the better we'll be able to use it
for anything we want.

00:03:53.495 --> 00:03:56.641
So like I said, the way you go
through and build on the game layer

00:03:56.665 --> 00:03:59.792
is not with glass and steel and cement.

00:03:59.816 --> 00:04:03.027
And the resources we use are not
this two-dimensional swath of land

00:04:03.051 --> 00:04:04.207
that we have.

00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:05.580
The resources are mindshare,

00:04:05.604 --> 00:04:08.388
and the tools, the raw materials,
are these game dynamics.

00:04:08.412 --> 00:04:10.665
With that, a couple
game dynamics to talk about.

00:04:11.137 --> 00:04:12.662
Back at SCVNGR, we like to joke

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:15.758
that with seven game dynamics,
you can get anyone to do anything.

00:04:15.782 --> 00:04:17.420
Today, I'm going to show you four,

00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:20.922
because I hope to have a competitive
advantage at the end of this, still.

00:04:20.946 --> 00:04:23.077
(Laughter)

00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:25.613
So the first one,
it's a very simple game dynamic.

00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:27.429
It's called the appointment dynamic.

00:04:27.453 --> 00:04:29.260
It's a dynamic in which to succeed,

00:04:29.284 --> 00:04:31.665
players have to do something
at a predefined time,

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.371
generally at a predefined place.

00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:35.671
And these dynamics
are a little scary sometimes,

00:04:35.695 --> 00:04:38.435
because you think, "Other people
can be using forces

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:40.335
that will manipulate how I interact:

00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:42.336
what I do, where I do it, when I do it."

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.848
This sort of "loss of free will"
that occurs in games

00:04:44.872 --> 00:04:46.111
can be frightening.

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:48.720
So with each dynamic,
I'm going to give three examples:

00:04:48.744 --> 00:04:51.610
one that shows how it's already
being used in the real world,

00:04:51.634 --> 00:04:53.260
so you can rationalize it a bit;

00:04:53.284 --> 00:04:56.102
one that shows it in what we consider
a conventional game --

00:04:56.126 --> 00:04:57.518
I think everything is a game,

00:04:57.542 --> 00:05:00.557
but this is more what you'd think
of as a game played on a board

00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:01.734
or on a computer screen;

00:05:01.758 --> 00:05:03.625
and one of how it can be used for good,

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:06.207
so you can see that these forces
can be very powerful.

00:05:06.231 --> 00:05:09.414
So the first one, the most famous
appointment dynamic in the world,

00:05:09.438 --> 00:05:11.175
is something called, "Happy Hour."

00:05:11.656 --> 00:05:14.138
So I had just recently
dropped out of Princeton

00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:16.655
and actually ended up
for the first time in a bar,

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:19.449
and I saw these happy hour things
all over the place.

00:05:19.473 --> 00:05:22.877
And this is simply an appointment dynamic:
come here at a certain time,

00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:24.099
get your drinks half off.

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:27.667
To win, all you have to do is show up
at the right place at the right time.

00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:29.306
This game dynamic is so powerful,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.890
it doesn't just influence our behavior;
it's influenced our entire culture.

00:05:32.914 --> 00:05:34.350
That's a really scary thought,

00:05:34.374 --> 00:05:37.111
that one game dynamic
can change things so powerfully.

00:05:37.135 --> 00:05:39.330
It also exists in more
conventional game forms.

00:05:39.354 --> 00:05:41.505
I'm sure you've all heard
of Farmville by now.

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.415
If you haven't, I recommend playing it.

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:45.908
You won't do anything else
for the rest of your day.

00:05:45.932 --> 00:05:48.060
Farmville has more active
users than Twitter.

00:05:48.084 --> 00:05:49.291
It's incredibly powerful,

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:52.432
and it has this dynamic
where you have to return at a certain time

00:05:52.456 --> 00:05:55.028
to water your fake crops, or they wilt.

00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:58.628
And this is so powerful
that when they tweak their stats,

00:05:58.652 --> 00:06:00.461
when they say your crops wilt

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.236
after eight hours, or after six hours,
or after 24 hours,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.827
it changes the life cycle
of some 70 million people during the day.

00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:10.469
They will return, like clockwork,
at different times.

00:06:10.493 --> 00:06:13.883
So if they wanted the world to end,
if they wanted productivity to stop,

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:15.677
they could make it a 30-minute cycle,

00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:17.695
and no one could do anything else, right?

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.235
(Laughter)

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:20.727
That's a little scary.

00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.013
But this could also be used for good.

00:06:23.037 --> 00:06:24.815
This local company called Vitality

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:27.974
has created a product to help people
take their medicine on time.

00:06:27.998 --> 00:06:29.151
That's an appointment.

00:06:29.175 --> 00:06:31.350
It's something that people
don't do very well.

00:06:31.374 --> 00:06:33.770
They have these GlowCaps
which flash and email you

00:06:33.794 --> 00:06:36.397
and do cool things to remind you
to take your medicine.

00:06:36.421 --> 00:06:38.567
This isn't a game yet,
but really should be.

00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:40.649
You should get points for doing it on time

00:06:40.673 --> 00:06:42.639
and lose points for not doing it on time.

00:06:42.663 --> 00:06:45.434
They should recognize they've built
an appointment dynamic,

00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:46.609
and leverage the games.

00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:49.400
Then you can really achieve good
in some interesting ways.

00:06:49.424 --> 00:06:51.946
We're going to jump onto the next one.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.235
Influence and status.

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.236
This is one of the most famous
game dynamics, used all over the place.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.365
It's used in your wallets, right now.

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.236
We all want that credit card
on the far left, because it's black.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.101
And you see someone at CVS or --

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:06.792
not CVS -- like, Christian Dior --

00:07:06.816 --> 00:07:08.836
(Laughter)

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.128
I don't know. I don't have a black
card; I've got a debit card.

00:07:12.152 --> 00:07:13.937
(Laughter)

00:07:13.961 --> 00:07:16.564
So they whip it out and you see
that black card, and:

00:07:16.588 --> 00:07:19.175
"I want that because it means
they're cooler than I am,

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.350
and I need that."

00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:22.064
And this is used in games as well.

00:07:22.088 --> 00:07:25.461
"Modern Warfare," one of the most
successful selling games of all time.

00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:28.486
I'm only a level four, but I desperately
want to be a level 10,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.427
because they've got that cool red badge,

00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:33.236
and that means that I am somehow
better than everyone else.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.826
And that's very powerful to me.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.959
Status is really good motivator.

00:07:36.983 --> 00:07:39.123
It's also used in more
conventional settings,

00:07:39.147 --> 00:07:41.028
and can be used more consciously there.

00:07:41.052 --> 00:07:44.005
School -- and remember,
I made it through one year,

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:46.646
so I think I'm qualified
to talk on school --

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.773
is a game; it's just not a terribly
well-designed game.

00:07:49.797 --> 00:07:52.331
There are levels. There are C.
There are B. There's A.

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:55.423
There are statuses. I mean,
what is valedictorian, but a status?

00:07:55.447 --> 00:07:59.827
If we called valedictorian
a "White Knight Paladin level 20,"

00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:02.108
I think people would probably
work a lot harder.

00:08:02.132 --> 00:08:04.132
(Laughter)

00:08:04.156 --> 00:08:05.335
(Applause)

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.596
So school is a game,

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.935
and there has been lots of experimentation
on how we do this properly.

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:12.348
But let's use it consciously.

00:08:12.372 --> 00:08:15.625
Why have games you can lose?
Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C?

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:17.172
That sucks. Why not level-up?

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:19.751
At Princeton, they've actually
experimented with this,

00:08:19.775 --> 00:08:21.942
with quizzes where
you gain experience points,

00:08:21.966 --> 00:08:23.697
and you level up from B to an A.

00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:25.236
And it's very powerful.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.148
It can be used in interesting ways.

00:08:28.172 --> 00:08:30.886
The third one I'll talk about
is the progression dynamic,

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.817
where you have to make progress,
move through different steps

00:08:33.841 --> 00:08:35.499
in a very granular fashion.

00:08:35.523 --> 00:08:38.236
This is used all over the place,
including LinkedIn,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.554
where I am an unwhole individual.

00:08:40.578 --> 00:08:43.858
I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn,

00:08:43.882 --> 00:08:45.236
and that bothers me.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.335
And this is so deep-seated in our psyche

00:08:48.359 --> 00:08:50.482
that when we're presented
with a progress bar

00:08:50.506 --> 00:08:53.046
and presented with easy,
granular steps to take

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.657
to try and complete
that progress bar, we will do it.

00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:57.651
We will find a way to move that blue line

00:08:57.675 --> 00:08:59.840
all the way to the right edge
of the screen.

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:02.308
This is used in conventional
games as well.

00:09:02.332 --> 00:09:04.525
I mean, this is a Paladin level 10,

00:09:04.549 --> 00:09:06.153
and that's a Paladin level 20.

00:09:06.177 --> 00:09:09.742
And if you were going to fight
Orcs on the fields of Mordor

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:11.236
against the Ra's Al Ghul,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.546
you'd probably want to be
the bigger one, right?

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.237
I would.

00:09:15.261 --> 00:09:17.772
And so people work very hard to level-up.

00:09:17.796 --> 00:09:21.026
"World of Warcraft" is one
of the most successful games of all time.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.678
The average player spends some six,
six-and-a-half hours a day on it,

00:09:24.702 --> 00:09:28.300
their most dedicated players --
it's like a full-time job, it's insane.

00:09:28.324 --> 00:09:30.766
And they have these systems
where you can level-up.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.570
And that's a very powerful thing.
Progression is powerful.

00:09:34.121 --> 00:09:37.136
It can also be used
in very compelling ways for good.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.182
One of the things we work on at SCVNGR is:

00:09:39.206 --> 00:09:42.614
How do you use games to drive traffic
and business to local businesses,

00:09:42.638 --> 00:09:44.784
to something that is very key
to the economy?

00:09:44.808 --> 00:09:47.102
And here, we have a game that people play.

00:09:47.126 --> 00:09:49.150
They go places,
do challenges, earn points.

00:09:49.174 --> 00:09:51.758
And we've introduced
a progression dynamic into it,

00:09:51.782 --> 00:09:54.890
where, by going to the same place
over and over, doing challenges,

00:09:54.914 --> 00:09:56.208
engaging with the business,

00:09:56.232 --> 00:09:59.394
you move a green bar from the left edge
of the screen to the right,

00:09:59.418 --> 00:10:00.572
and unlock rewards.

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:04.512
This is powerful enough that we can see
it hooks people into these dynamics,

00:10:04.536 --> 00:10:06.634
pulls them back to the same
local businesses,

00:10:06.658 --> 00:10:08.392
creates loyalty, creates engagement,

00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:12.343
and is able to drive meaningful revenue
and fun and engagement to businesses.

00:10:12.367 --> 00:10:16.236
These progression dynamics are powerful
and can be used in the real world.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.613
The final one I want to talk about --
and it's a great one to end on --

00:10:19.637 --> 00:10:21.494
is this concept of communal discovery,

00:10:21.518 --> 00:10:25.776
a dynamic in which everyone
has to work together to achieve something.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.626
Communal discovery is powerful

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.666
because it leverages
the network that is society

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.158
to solve problems.

00:10:33.071 --> 00:10:36.849
This is used in some famous
consumer web stories like Digg,

00:10:36.873 --> 00:10:38.558
which I'm sure you've all heard of.

00:10:38.582 --> 00:10:40.236
Digg is a communal dynamic

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.236
to try to find and source the best news,
the most interesting stories.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
And they made this into a game, initially.

00:10:46.284 --> 00:10:49.448
They had a leader board where,
if you recommended the best stories,

00:10:49.472 --> 00:10:50.824
you would get points.

00:10:50.848 --> 00:10:53.600
And that really motivated people
to find the best stories.

00:10:53.624 --> 00:10:56.236
But it became so powerful,
there was actually a cabal,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.659
a group of people, the top seven
on the leader board,

00:10:59.683 --> 00:11:02.862
who would work together to make sure
they maintained that position,

00:11:02.886 --> 00:11:04.331
recommending people's stories.

00:11:04.355 --> 00:11:06.568
The game became
more powerful than the goal.

00:11:06.592 --> 00:11:10.236
They ended up shutting down the leader
board because, while it was effective,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.164
it was so powerful that it stopped
sourcing the best stories,

00:11:13.188 --> 00:11:15.735
and started having people work
to maintain leadership.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:17.526
So we have to use this one carefully.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.905
It's also used in things
like McDonald's Monopoly,

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.318
where the game is not
the Monopoly you're playing,

00:11:22.342 --> 00:11:25.671
but the cottage industries
that form to try and find Boardwalk.

00:11:25.695 --> 00:11:28.909
There, they're just looking
for a sticker that says "Boardwalk,"

00:11:28.933 --> 00:11:30.991
but it can also be used
to find real things.

00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:32.748
This is the DARPA balloon challenge,

00:11:32.772 --> 00:11:36.113
where they hid a couple balloons
all across the United States and said,

00:11:36.137 --> 00:11:38.567
"Use networks. Try and find
these balloons fastest,

00:11:38.591 --> 00:11:40.237
and the winner will get $40,000."

00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:42.108
The winner was a group out of MIT,

00:11:42.132 --> 00:11:44.728
where they created sort
of a pyramid scheme, a network,

00:11:44.752 --> 00:11:48.181
where the first person to recommend
the location of a balloon got $2,000,

00:11:48.205 --> 00:11:51.136
and anyone else to push
that recommendation up also got a cut.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.151
And in 12 hours, they were able
to find all these balloons,

00:11:54.175 --> 00:11:55.641
all across the country.

00:11:55.665 --> 00:11:57.389
Really powerful dynamic.

00:11:57.413 --> 00:12:00.236
And so, I've got about 20 seconds left,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.308
so if I'm going to leave
you with anything,

00:12:02.332 --> 00:12:04.114
last decade was the decade of social.

00:12:04.138 --> 00:12:06.236
This next decade is the decade of games.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.127
We use game dynamics to build on it.
We build with mindshare.

00:12:09.151 --> 00:12:10.396
We can influence behavior.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.283
It's very powerful. It's very exciting.

00:12:12.307 --> 00:12:15.664
Let's all build it together,
let's do it well and have fun playing.

00:12:15.688 --> 00:12:17.760
(Applause)
