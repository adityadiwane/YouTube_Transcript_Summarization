00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
This is a wheat bread, a whole wheat bread,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
and it's made with a new technique

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
that I've been playing around with,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
and developing and writing about which, for lack of a better name,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
we call the epoxy method.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
And I call it an epoxy method because --

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
it's not very appetizing. I understand that --

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
but -- but

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
if you think about epoxy, what's epoxy?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
It's two resins that are, sort of,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
but when you put the two together,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.160
something happens. A bond takes place,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
and you get this very strong, powerful

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
adhesive.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
Well, in this technique,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
what I've tried to do is kind of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
the artisan bread-baking community,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so --

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America --

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
and put it together to come up with a method

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
that would help to take whole-grain breads.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
And let's face it, everyone's trying to move towards whole grains.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
We finally, after 40 years of knowing

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
that wholegrain was a healthier option,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
and attempting to actually eat them.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
(Laughter)

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
The challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
you know, how do you make it taste good?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
Because whole grain -- it's easy with white flour

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
to make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
It's mainly starch, and starch, when you break it down --

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
what is starch? It's -- thank you -- sugar, yes.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
So a baker, and a good baker,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
knows how to pull or draw forth

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
the inherent sugar trapped in the starch.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
With whole grain bread, you have other obstacles.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
You've got bran, which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
for the bran is fiber.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
It's got germ. Those are the good things,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
So whole grain breads historically

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
have had sort of this onus of being health food breads,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
and people don't like to eat,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
quote, health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
but when we think of something as a health food,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
we think of it as something we eat out of obligation,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
not out of passion and love for the flavor.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
And ultimately, the challenge of the baker,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
the challenge of every culinary student, of every chef,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
is to deliver flavor.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Flavor is king. Flavor rules.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
And -- and

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
but they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
So, this is the challenge for this bread.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
We're going to try this at lunch, and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
I'll explain a bit more about it,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs --

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
is to make a piece of dough

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
the day before that is not leavened.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
It's just dough that is wet.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
It's hydrated dough we call "the soaker" --

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
that helps to start enzyme activity.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And enzymes are the secret, kind of, ingredient in dough

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
that brings out flavor.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160
That's what enzymes are doing.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
And so, if we can release some of those,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
they become accessible to us in our palate.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
They become accessible to the yeast as food.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
They become accessible to the oven for caramelization

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
to give us a beautiful crust.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
The other pre-dough

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a "biga"

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
and that starts to develop flavor also.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
And on day two, we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
And we're hoping that, sort of, the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
enzyme piece of dough

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
and when we put them together and add the final ingredients,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
we can create a bread that does evoke

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
That's the challenge. Okay, so, now, what we --

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.160
in the journey of wheat, let's go back and look at these 12 stages.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
Okay, we're going to start with the first stage.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
And this is what every student has to begin with.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
the first stage of cooking is "mise en place,"

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160
which is just a French way of saying, "get organized."

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
Everything in its place. First stage.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
So in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
We have to develop the gluten.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
There's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
Here's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
because we've got glutenin and gliadin,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160
they create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
And so we, in the mixing process,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
have to develop the gluten,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
we have to activate the leaven or the yeast,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.160
and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Then we get into fermentation, the third stage,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
which is really where the flavor develops. 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
creating carbon dioxide and alcohol --

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
essentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
It's yeast burps and sweat.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
And somehow, this is transformed --

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed --

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160
is that it is a transformational food,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
and we're going to explore that in a minute.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
But then, quickly through the next few stages.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
We, after it's fermented and it's developed,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
started to develop flavor and character,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
we divide it into smaller units.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
And then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre-shape,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
usually a round or a little torpedo shape, sometimes.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
That's called "rounding."

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
And there's a short rest period. It can be for a few seconds.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
It can be for 20 or 30 minutes. We call that resting or benching.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
Then we go into final shaping,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.160
"panning" -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.160
This takes a second, but it's a distinctive stage.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.160
It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
And then, stage nine.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
through all these other stages. Again, developing more flavor.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
The final fermentation takes place in stage nine.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
We call it "proofing."

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
and it goes into the oven -- stage 10.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
Three transformations take place in the oven.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
They give us that beautiful brown crust.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
Only the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
Inside, the proteins --

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
this gluten -- coagulates.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
When it gets to about 160 degrees,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160
the proteins all line up 
and they create structure,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
the gluten structure --

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
And the starches, when they reach about 180 degrees,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
gelatinize.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
And gelatinization is yet another

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
oven transformation.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
Coagulation, caramelization and gelatinization --

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
they -- they kind of swell, and then they burst.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
And they burst, and they spill their guts into the bread.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
So basically now we're eating yeast sweats --

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160
sweat, burps and starch guts.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
Again, transformed in stage 10 in the oven

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
because what went into the oven as dough

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
comes out in stage 11 as bread.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
And stage 11, we call it cooling --

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
because we never really eat the bread right away.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
There's a little carry-over baking.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
The proteins have to set up, strengthen and firm up.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.160
And then we have stage 12, which the textbooks call "packaging,"

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
but my students call "eating."

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
And so, we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
and in a few minutes we will try this,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
and see if we have succeeded

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
But I want to go back now and revisit these steps,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
because I really believe that

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
all things can be understood --

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients --

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
that all things can be understood on four levels:

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.160
the literal, the metaphoric or poetic level,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
the political or ethical level.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.160
And ultimately, the mystical or sometimes called the "anagogical" level.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
In fact, Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
unless you first understand the literal level,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
so that's why we're talking literally about bread.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
But let's kind of look at these stages again

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.160
from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level --

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
all in my quest for answering the question,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
"What is it about bread that's so special?"

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.160
And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
Because what happens is,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
bread begins as wheat or any other grain.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
But what's wheat? Wheat is a grass

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
that grows in the field.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
And, like all grasses, at a certain point it puts out seeds.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
And we harvest those seeds, and those are the wheat kernels.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
Now, in order to harvest it -- I mean, what's harvesting?

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.160
It's just a euphemism for killing, right?

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
We harvest the wheat,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
and in harvesting it, we kill it.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
Now, wheat is alive,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
and as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
Now, at least with seeds we have the potential for future life.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
We can plant those in the ground.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
And we save some of those for the next generation.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
But most of those seeds get crushed

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
and turned into flour.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
And at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
It's not only been killed,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
but it's been denied any potential for creating future life.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
So we turn it into flour.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
So as I said, I think bread is a transformational food.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
The first transformation -- and, by the way,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
the definition of transformation for me is

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
a radical change from one thing into something else.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.160
O.K.? Radical, not subtle.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
Not like hot water made cold,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
or cold water turned hot,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
but water boiled off and becoming steam.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
That's a transformation, two different things.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
Well, in this case, the first transformation

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
is alive to dead.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
I'd call that radical.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
So, we've got now this flour.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
And what do we do? We add some water.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.160
In stage one, we weigh it.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
In stage two, we add water and salt to it, mix it together,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
and we create something that we call "clay."

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
It's like clay.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
And we infuse that clay

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
with an ingredient that we call "leaven."

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
In this case, it's yeast, but yeast is leaven. What does leaven mean?

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven --

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
to vivify, to bring to life.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.160
By the way, what's the Hebrew word for clay? Adam.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
You see, the baker, in this moment,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
has become, in a sense,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
And we know it's alive because in stage three,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
it grows. Growth is the proof of life.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
And while it's growing, all these

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
literal transformations are taking place.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160
Yeast is eating sugar and

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.160
turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
Bacteria is in there, eating the same sugars,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
turning them into acids.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160
In other words, personality and character's being developed in this dough

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160
under the watchful gaze of the baker.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
And the baker's choices all along the way

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
determine the outcome of the product.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
A subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time --

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
it's all about a balancing act between time, temperature

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
and ingredients. That's the art of baking.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.160
So all these things are determined by the baker,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
and the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
And then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
is divided into smaller units, and each of those units

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
are given shape by the baker.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
And as they're shaped, they're raised again,

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
all along proving that they're alive,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
and developing character.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
And at stage 10, we take it to the oven.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160
It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough --

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
a few people do, I think, but not too many.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
I've met some dough eaters, but --

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.160
it's not the staff of life, right? Bread is the staff of life.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
But dough is what we're working with,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
and we take that dough to the oven,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.160
and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
crosses the threshold of 140 degrees,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
it passes what we call the "thermal death point."

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160
The yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
to enliven it, to vivify it,

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
in order to complete its mission,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
which is also to turn this dough into bread,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
has to give up its life.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.160
So you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
It's starting to make sense to me --

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
what goes in is dough,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
what comes out is bread --

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
or it goes in alive,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160
comes out dead.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
Third transformation. First transformation, alive to dead.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.160
Second transformation, dead brought back to life.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
Third transformation, alive to dead --

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
but dough to bread.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
Or another analogy would be,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
And it's what comes out of the oven

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
that is what we call the staff of life.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
This is the product

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.160
that

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.160
everyone in the world eats, that is so difficult to give up.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160
It's so

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
deeply embedded in our psyches that

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
bread is used as a symbol for life.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.160
It's used as a symbol for transformation.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
And so, as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
again completing the life cycle,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
you know, we have a chance to essentially ingest that --

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
it nurtures us, and we continue to carry on

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
and have opportunities to ponder

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
things like this.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
So this is what I've learned from bread.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
This is what bread has taught me in my journey.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
And what we're going to attempt to do

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
with this bread here, again,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
is to use, in addition to everything we talked about,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160
this bread we're going to call "spent grain bread"

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.160
because, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
Beer is basically liquid bread,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
or bread is solid beer.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.160
And --

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.160
(Laughter)

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
they -- they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.160
in the hot, Egyptian sun, and it turned into bread.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
But we've got this bread,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
and what I did here is to try to, again,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.160
evoke even more flavor from this grain,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160
was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160
And if you make this bread, you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
I like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.160
that's actually from, like, some kind of a lager of some sort --

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.160
a light lager or an ale -- that is wheat and barley that's been toasted.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
In other words, the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
by using sprouting and malting and roasting.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
We're going to take some of that, and put it into the bread.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
So now we not only have a high-fiber bread,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
but now fiber on top of fiber.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.160
And so this is, again, hopefully

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
not only a healthy bread,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
but a bread that you will enjoy.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
So, if I, kind of, break this bread,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.160
maybe we can share this now a little bit here.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.160
We'll start a little piece here,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
and I'm going to take a little piece here --

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
I'll leave you

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
with what I call the baker's blessing.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
May your crust be crisp,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
and your bread always rise.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
Thank you.
