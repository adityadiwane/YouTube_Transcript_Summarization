00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:15.111
(Video) Nicholas Negroponte: 
Can we switch to the video disc,

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:17.234
which is in play mode?

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:22.464
I'm really interested in how you put people and computers together.

00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:25.834
We will be using the TV screens or their equivalents

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:30.208
for electronic books of the future.

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:33.822
(Music, crosstalk)

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.369
Very interested in touch-sensitive displays,

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:56.696
high-tech, high-touch, not having
to pick up your fingers to use them.

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:58.496
There is another way where computers

00:00:58.496 --> 00:01:00.959
touch people: wearing, physically wearing.

00:01:08.646 --> 00:01:10.667
Suddenly on September 11th,

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.304
the world got bigger.

00:01:13.304 --> 00:01:16.289
NN: Thank you. (Applause)

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.348
Thank you.

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:20.456
When I was asked to do this,

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:24.652
I was also asked to look at all 14 TED Talks

00:01:24.652 --> 00:01:26.362
that I had given,

00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:28.160
chronologically.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.434
The first one was actually two hours.

00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:31.890
The second one was an hour,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.439
and then they became half hours,

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.375
and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:38.995
(Laughter)

00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:43.163
Imagine seeing your life, 30 years of it, go by,

00:01:43.163 --> 00:01:46.570
and it was, to say the least,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.943
for me, quite a shocking experience.

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:52.536
So what I'm going to do in my time

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:54.080
is try and share with you what happened

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.882
during the 30 years,

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:58.400
and then also make a prediction,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.461
and then tell you a little bit

00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:03.115
about what I'm doing next.

00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:06.066
And I put on a slide

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:10.126
where TED 1 happened in my life.

00:02:10.126 --> 00:02:12.040
And it's rather important

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.100
because I had done 15 years of research before it,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.528
so I had a backlog, so it was easy.

00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:20.288
It's not that I was Fidel Castro

00:02:20.288 --> 00:02:22.121
and I could talk for two hours,

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:23.443
or Bucky Fuller.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.358
I had 15 years of stuff,

00:02:25.358 --> 00:02:27.830
and the Media Lab was about to start.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.630
So that was easy.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.294
But there are a couple of things

00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:33.982
about that period

00:02:33.982 --> 00:02:36.035
and about what happened that are

00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:37.890
really quite important.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.446
One is that

00:02:40.446 --> 00:02:43.342
it was a period when computers

00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:45.979
weren't yet for people.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:49.124
And the other thing that sort of happened

00:02:49.124 --> 00:02:52.195
during that time is that

00:02:52.195 --> 00:02:55.577
we were considered sissy computer scientists.

00:02:55.577 --> 00:02:57.140
We weren't considered the real thing.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.139
So what I'm going to show you is, in retrospect,

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.647
a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted

00:03:03.647 --> 00:03:05.713
than it was at the time.

00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:08.267
So I'm going to characterize the years

00:03:08.267 --> 00:03:10.100
and I'm even going to go back

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.204
to some very early work of mine,

00:03:12.204 --> 00:03:15.090
and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '60s:

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.277
very direct manipulation,

00:03:17.277 --> 00:03:19.932
very influenced as I studied architecture

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:22.019
by the architect Moshe Safdie,

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.781
and you can see that we even built robotic things

00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:27.537
that could build habitat-like structures.

00:03:27.537 --> 00:03:29.224
And this for me was

00:03:29.224 --> 00:03:31.140
not yet the Media Lab,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.957
but was the beginning of what I'll call

00:03:33.957 --> 00:03:35.476
sensory computing,

00:03:35.476 --> 00:03:37.348
and I pick fingers

00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:41.550
partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.705
Papers were published

00:03:43.705 --> 00:03:47.957
about how stupid it was to use fingers.

00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:50.775
Three reasons: One was they were low-resolution.

00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:52.704
The other is your hand would occlude

00:03:52.704 --> 00:03:54.145
what you wanted to see,

00:03:54.145 --> 00:03:55.903
and the third, which was the winner,

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:59.559
was that your fingers would get the screen dirty,

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.885
and hence, fingers would never be

00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:03.673
a device that you'd use.

00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:06.722
And this was a device we built in the '70s,

00:04:06.722 --> 00:04:08.593
which has never even been picked up.

00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:10.034
It's not just touch sensitive,

00:04:10.034 --> 00:04:12.212
it's pressure sensitive.

00:04:12.212 --> 00:04:14.189
(Video) Voice: Put a yellow circle there.

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.633
NN: Later work, and again this was before TED 1 —

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:20.436
(Video) Voice: Move that west of the diamond.

00:04:20.436 --> 00:04:23.648
Create a large green circle there.

00:04:23.648 --> 00:04:25.977
Man: Aw, shit.

00:04:25.977 --> 00:04:29.407
NN: — was to sort of do interface concurrently,

00:04:29.407 --> 00:04:31.215
so when you talked and you pointed

00:04:31.215 --> 00:04:34.402
and you had, if you will,

00:04:34.402 --> 00:04:35.961
multiple channels.

00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:37.968
Entebbe happened.

00:04:37.968 --> 00:04:41.515
1976, Air France was hijacked,

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:43.013
taken to Entebbe,

00:04:43.013 --> 00:04:48.070
and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue,

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.033
they did it partly because they had practiced

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:52.528
on a physical model of the airport,

00:04:52.528 --> 00:04:53.684
because they had built the airport,

00:04:53.684 --> 00:04:55.417
so they built a model in the desert,

00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:57.133
and when they arrived at Entebbe,

00:04:57.133 --> 00:05:00.053
they knew where to go because
they had actually been there.

00:05:00.053 --> 00:05:03.305
The U.S. government asked some of us, '76,

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:06.080
if we could replicate that computationally,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.269
and of course somebody like myself says yes.

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:10.295
Immediately, you get a contract,

00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:11.780
Department of Defense,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.468
and we built this truck and this rig.

00:05:14.468 --> 00:05:16.988
We did sort of a simulation,

00:05:16.988 --> 00:05:18.814
because you had video discs,

00:05:18.814 --> 00:05:21.142
and again, this is '76.

00:05:21.142 --> 00:05:23.839
And then many years later,

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.308
you get this truck,

00:05:25.308 --> 00:05:28.266
and so you have Google Maps.

00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:29.786
Still people thought,

00:05:29.786 --> 00:05:33.806
no, that was not serious computer science,

00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:35.865
and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner,

00:05:35.865 --> 00:05:38.272
who happened to be the president of MIT,

00:05:38.272 --> 00:05:40.620
who did think it was computer science.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.257
And one of the keys for anybody

00:05:43.257 --> 00:05:46.641
who wants to start something in life:

00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:49.910
Make sure your president is part of it.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.930
So when I was doing the Media Lab,

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.087
it was like having a gorilla in the front seat.

00:05:56.087 --> 00:05:58.272
If you were stopped for speeding

00:05:58.272 --> 00:06:00.512
and the officer looked in the window

00:06:00.512 --> 00:06:02.521
and saw who was in the passenger seat,

00:06:02.521 --> 00:06:04.483
then, "Oh, continue on, sir."

00:06:04.483 --> 00:06:06.168
And so we were able,

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:09.961
and this is a cute, actually, device, parenthetically.

00:06:09.961 --> 00:06:13.010
This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.373
where the only thing that changed in the photograph

00:06:15.373 --> 00:06:16.716
were the lips.

00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:19.692
So when you oscillated that little piece

00:06:19.692 --> 00:06:22.922
of lenticular sheet with his photograph,

00:06:22.922 --> 00:06:24.935
it would be in lip sync

00:06:24.935 --> 00:06:27.174
with zero bandwidth.

00:06:27.174 --> 00:06:29.885
It was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system

00:06:29.885 --> 00:06:31.727
at the time.

00:06:31.727 --> 00:06:35.708
So this was the Media Lab's —

00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:37.401
this is what we said we'd do,

00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:39.976
that the world of computers, publishing,

00:06:39.976 --> 00:06:42.664
and so on would come together.

00:06:42.664 --> 00:06:44.768
Again, not generally accepted,

00:06:44.768 --> 00:06:49.740
but very much part of TED in the early days.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.946
And this is really where we were headed.

00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:54.633
And that created the Media Lab.

00:06:54.633 --> 00:06:58.884
One of the things about age

00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:03.151
is that I can tell you with great confidence,

00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:05.615
I've been to the future.

00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:08.899
I've been there, actually, many times.

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:10.407
And the reason I say that is,

00:07:10.407 --> 00:07:12.848
how many times in my life have I said,

00:07:12.848 --> 00:07:14.625
"Oh, in 10 years, this will happen,"

00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:16.673
and then 10 years comes.

00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:18.431
And then you say, "Oh, in
five years, this will happen."

00:07:18.431 --> 00:07:20.115
And then five years comes.

00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:23.873
So I say this a little bit with having felt

00:07:23.873 --> 00:07:26.210
that I'd been there a number of times,

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.850
and one of the things that is most quoted

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.999
that I've ever said

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:33.382
is that computing is not about computers,

00:07:33.382 --> 00:07:36.938
and that didn't quite get enough traction,

00:07:36.938 --> 00:07:38.457
and then it started to.

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:42.152
It started to because people caught on

00:07:42.152 --> 00:07:45.290
that the medium wasn't the message.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.935
And the reason I show this car

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:50.263
in actually a rather ugly slide

00:07:50.263 --> 00:07:52.767
is just again to tell you the kind of story

00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:55.595
that characterized a little bit of my life.

00:07:55.595 --> 00:07:57.609
This is a student of mine

00:07:57.609 --> 00:08:01.160
who had done a Ph.D. called "Backseat Driver."

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.242
It was in the early days of GPS,

00:08:03.242 --> 00:08:04.808
the car knew where it was,

00:08:04.808 --> 00:08:06.723
and it would give audio instructions

00:08:06.723 --> 00:08:10.150
to the driver, when to turn right, 
when to turn left and so on.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.761
Turns out, there are a lot of things

00:08:11.761 --> 00:08:14.796
in those instructions that back in that period

00:08:14.796 --> 00:08:16.046
were pretty challenging,

00:08:16.046 --> 00:08:19.274
like what does it mean, take the next right?

00:08:19.274 --> 00:08:21.174
Well, if you're coming up on a street,

00:08:21.174 --> 00:08:23.357
the next right's probably the one after,

00:08:23.357 --> 00:08:24.588
and there are lots of issues,

00:08:24.588 --> 00:08:26.833
and the student did a wonderful thesis,

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:31.680
and the MIT patent office said "Don't patent it.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.620
It'll never be accepted.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.930
The liabilities are too large.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.321
There will be insurance issues.

00:08:37.321 --> 00:08:38.965
Don't patent it."

00:08:38.965 --> 00:08:40.058
So we didn't,

00:08:40.058 --> 00:08:43.696
but it shows you how people, again, at times,

00:08:43.696 --> 00:08:47.895
don't really look at what's happening.

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:50.790
Some work, and I'll just go
through these very quickly,

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.395
a lot of sensory stuff.

00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:54.870
You might recognize a young Yo-Yo Ma

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.840
and tracking his body for playing

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.188
the cello or the hypercello.

00:09:01.188 --> 00:09:05.165
These fellows literally walked 
around like that at the time.

00:09:05.165 --> 00:09:07.800
It's now a little bit more discreet

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.841
and more commonplace.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:12.110
And then there are at least three heroes

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.239
I want to quickly mention.

00:09:13.239 --> 00:09:15.717
Marvin Minsky, who taught me a lot

00:09:15.717 --> 00:09:17.104
about common sense,

00:09:17.104 --> 00:09:20.545
and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper,

00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:23.163
who was very important to Ricky Wurman

00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:26.898
and to TED, and in fact, when she got onstage,

00:09:26.898 --> 00:09:28.845
she said, the first thing she said was,

00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:30.999
"I introduced Ricky to Nicky."

00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:32.699
And nobody calls me Nicky

00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:34.458
and nobody calls Richard Ricky,

00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:37.860
so nobody knew who she was talking about.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.257
And then, of course, Seymour Papert,

00:09:40.257 --> 00:09:41.762
who is the person who said,

00:09:41.762 --> 00:09:43.177
"You can't think about thinking

00:09:43.177 --> 00:09:45.592
unless you think about thinking about something."

00:09:45.592 --> 00:09:51.255
And that's actually — you can unpack that later.

00:09:51.255 --> 00:09:55.361
It's a pretty profound statement.

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:57.101
I'm showing some slides

00:09:57.101 --> 00:09:59.187
that were from TED 2,

00:09:59.187 --> 00:10:02.929
a little silly as slides, perhaps.

00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:08.270
Then I felt television really was about displays.

00:10:08.273 --> 00:10:11.336
Again, now we're past TED 1,

00:10:11.336 --> 00:10:14.362
but just around the time of TED 2,

00:10:14.362 --> 00:10:16.511
and what I'd like to mention here is,

00:10:16.511 --> 00:10:18.626
even though you could imagine

00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:20.680
intelligence in the device,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.112
I look today at some of the work

00:10:22.112 --> 00:10:24.550
being done about the Internet of Things,

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.490
and I think it's kind of tragically pathetic,

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.920
because what has happened is people take

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.418
the oven panel and put it on your cell phone,

00:10:33.418 --> 00:10:35.207
or the door key onto your cell phone,

00:10:35.207 --> 00:10:37.380
just taking it and bringing it to you,

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.101
and in fact that's actually what you don't want.

00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:42.159
You want to put a chicken in the oven,

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:44.487
and the oven says, "Aha, it's a chicken,"

00:10:44.487 --> 00:10:45.636
and it cooks the chicken.

00:10:45.636 --> 00:10:47.402
"Oh, it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas,

00:10:47.402 --> 00:10:49.236
and he likes it this way and that way."

00:10:49.236 --> 00:10:52.289
So the intelligence, instead of being in the device,

00:10:52.289 --> 00:10:53.998
we have started today

00:10:53.998 --> 00:10:56.110
to move it back onto the cell phone

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.480
or closer to the user,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.668
not a particularly enlightened view

00:11:00.668 --> 00:11:03.409
of the Internet of Things.

00:11:03.409 --> 00:11:06.873
Television, again, television what I said today,

00:11:06.873 --> 00:11:09.495
that was back in 1990,

00:11:09.495 --> 00:11:10.965
and the television of tomorrow

00:11:10.965 --> 00:11:13.288
would look something like that.

00:11:13.288 --> 00:11:16.832
Again, people, but they laughed cynically,

00:11:16.832 --> 00:11:22.083
they didn't laugh with much appreciation.

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:24.733
Telecommunications in the 1990s,

00:11:24.733 --> 00:11:30.433
George Gilder decided that he would call this diagram

00:11:30.433 --> 00:11:32.862
the Negroponte switch.

00:11:32.862 --> 00:11:34.868
I'm probably much less famous than George,

00:11:34.868 --> 00:11:38.475
so when he called it the Negroponte switch, it stuck,

00:11:38.475 --> 00:11:41.140
but the idea of things that came in the ground

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.855
would go in the air and stuff in the air

00:11:42.855 --> 00:11:44.314
would go into the ground

00:11:44.314 --> 00:11:46.199
has played itself out.

00:11:46.199 --> 00:11:50.944
That is the original slide from that year,

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:54.319
and it has worked in lockstep obedience.

00:11:54.319 --> 00:11:56.486
We started Wired magazine.

00:11:56.486 --> 00:12:00.222
Some people, I remember we shared

00:12:00.222 --> 00:12:02.944
the reception desk periodically,

00:12:02.944 --> 00:12:07.002
and some parent called up irate that his son

00:12:07.002 --> 00:12:09.231
had given up Sports Illustrated

00:12:09.231 --> 00:12:11.110
to subscribe for Wired,

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.307
and he said, "Are you some
porno magazine or something?"

00:12:14.307 --> 00:12:16.891
and couldn't understand why his son

00:12:16.891 --> 00:12:20.790
would be interested in Wired, at any rate.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.394
I will go through this a little quicker.

00:12:23.394 --> 00:12:26.893
This is my favorite, 1995,

00:12:26.893 --> 00:12:29.930
back page of Newsweek magazine.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.899
Okay. Read it. (Laughter)

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:33.800
["Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh, sure."
—Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, 1995]

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.445
You must admit that gives you,

00:12:35.445 --> 00:12:37.672
at least it gives me pleasure

00:12:37.672 --> 00:12:41.430
when somebody says how dead wrong you are.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.576
"Being Digital" came out.

00:12:43.576 --> 00:12:46.217
For me, it gave me an opportunity

00:12:46.217 --> 00:12:48.419
to be more in the trade press

00:12:48.419 --> 00:12:51.690
and get this out to the public,

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.705
and it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab,

00:12:54.705 --> 00:12:56.638
which if you haven't been to, visit,

00:12:56.638 --> 00:12:59.657
because it's a beautiful piece of architecture

00:12:59.657 --> 00:13:02.482
aside from being a wonderful place to work.

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:05.177
So these are the things we were saying in those TEDs.

00:13:05.177 --> 00:13:06.744
[Today, multimedia is a desktop or living room experience, because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small, bright, thin, high-resolution displays. — 1995]

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:08.236
We came to them.

00:13:08.236 --> 00:13:10.228
I looked forward to it every year.

00:13:10.228 --> 00:13:13.280
It was the party that Ricky Wurman never had

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.189
in the sense that he invited many of his old friends,

00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:17.848
including myself.

00:13:17.848 --> 00:13:20.240
And then something for me changed

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.709
pretty profoundly.

00:13:21.709 --> 00:13:25.662
I became more involved with computers and learning

00:13:25.662 --> 00:13:28.124
and influenced by Seymour,

00:13:28.124 --> 00:13:30.739
but particularly looking at learning

00:13:30.739 --> 00:13:34.649
as something that is best approximated

00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:36.403
by computer programming.

00:13:36.403 --> 00:13:38.417
When you write a computer program,

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:41.212
you've got to not just list things out

00:13:41.212 --> 00:13:42.940
and sort of take an algorithm

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.816
and translate it into a set of instructions,

00:13:45.816 --> 00:13:48.499
but when there's a bug, and all programs have bugs,

00:13:48.499 --> 00:13:50.208
you've got to de-bug it.

00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:52.198
You've got to go in, change it,

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:53.820
and then re-execute,

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.624
and you iterate,

00:13:55.624 --> 00:13:58.531
and that iteration is really

00:13:58.531 --> 00:14:01.434
a very, very good approximation of learning.

00:14:01.434 --> 00:14:05.101
So that led to my own work with Seymour

00:14:05.101 --> 00:14:07.459
in places like Cambodia

00:14:07.459 --> 00:14:10.363
and the starting of One Laptop per Child.

00:14:10.363 --> 00:14:13.177
Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child,

00:14:13.177 --> 00:14:14.938
so I'll go through it very fast,

00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:18.863
but it did give us the chance

00:14:18.863 --> 00:14:22.369
to do something at a relatively large scale

00:14:22.369 --> 00:14:26.362
in the area of learning, development and computing.

00:14:26.362 --> 00:14:29.179
Very few people know that One Laptop per Child

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:31.814
was a $1 billion project,

00:14:31.814 --> 00:14:34.461
and it was, at least over the seven years I ran it,

00:14:34.461 --> 00:14:36.607
but even more important, the World Bank

00:14:36.607 --> 00:14:39.722
contributed zero, USAID zero.

00:14:39.722 --> 00:14:43.877
It was mostly the countries
using their own treasuries,

00:14:43.877 --> 00:14:45.480
which is very interesting,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.836
at least to me it was very interesting

00:14:46.836 --> 00:14:49.980
in terms of what I plan to do next.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.005
So these are the various places it happened.

00:14:53.005 --> 00:14:55.907
I then tried an experiment,

00:14:55.907 --> 00:15:00.188
and the experiment happened in Ethiopia.

00:15:00.188 --> 00:15:02.830
And here's the experiment.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.461
The experiment is,

00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:08.241
can learning happen where there are no schools.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.771
And we dropped off tablets

00:15:10.771 --> 00:15:13.014
with no instructions

00:15:13.014 --> 00:15:16.287
and let the children figure it out.

00:15:16.287 --> 00:15:19.934
And in a short period of time,

00:15:19.934 --> 00:15:22.032
they not only

00:15:22.032 --> 00:15:25.104
turned them on and were using 50 apps per child

00:15:25.104 --> 00:15:27.206
within five days,

00:15:27.206 --> 00:15:30.140
they were singing "ABC" songs within two weeks,

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:34.033
but they hacked Android within six months.

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:37.551
And so that seemed sufficiently interesting.

00:15:37.551 --> 00:15:40.110
This is perhaps the best picture I have.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.261
The kid on your right

00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:46.736
has sort of nominated himself as teacher.

00:15:46.736 --> 00:15:49.256
Look at the kid on the left, and so on.

00:15:49.256 --> 00:15:52.406
There are no adults involved in this at all.

00:15:52.406 --> 00:15:53.830
So I said, well can we do this

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.427
at a larger scale?

00:15:55.427 --> 00:15:57.908
And what is it that's missing?

00:15:57.908 --> 00:16:00.177
The kids are giving a press conference at this point,

00:16:00.177 --> 00:16:02.862
and sort of writing in the dirt.

00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:06.307
And the answer is, what is missing?

00:16:06.307 --> 00:16:08.843
And I'm going to skip over my prediction, actually,

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.371
because I'm running out of time,

00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:14.339
and here's the question, is what's going to happen?

00:16:14.339 --> 00:16:15.826
I think the challenge

00:16:15.826 --> 00:16:18.454
is to connect the last billion people,

00:16:18.454 --> 00:16:21.105
and connecting the last billion

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:24.502
is very different than connecting the next billion,

00:16:24.502 --> 00:16:25.896
and the reason it's different

00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:27.760
is that the next billion

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.710
are sort of low-hanging fruit,

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.077
but the last billion are rural.

00:16:33.077 --> 00:16:36.829
Being rural and being poor

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:37.961
are very different.

00:16:37.961 --> 00:16:41.594
Poverty tends to be created by our society,

00:16:41.594 --> 00:16:47.044
and the people in that community are not poor

00:16:47.044 --> 00:16:48.953
in the same way at all.

00:16:48.953 --> 00:16:50.358
They may be primitive,

00:16:50.358 --> 00:16:54.402
but the way to approach it and to connect them,

00:16:54.402 --> 00:16:56.933
the history of One Laptop per Child,

00:16:56.933 --> 00:17:00.589
and the experiment in Ethiopia,

00:17:00.589 --> 00:17:03.864
lead me to believe that we can in fact

00:17:03.864 --> 00:17:06.665
do this in a very short period of time.

00:17:06.665 --> 00:17:08.506
And so my plan,

00:17:08.506 --> 00:17:10.740
and unfortunately I haven't been able

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.608
to get my partners at this point

00:17:13.608 --> 00:17:14.899
to let me announce them,

00:17:14.899 --> 00:17:19.806
but is to do this with a stationary satellite.

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:22.265
There are many reasons

00:17:22.265 --> 00:17:26.780
that stationary satellites aren't the best things,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.717
but there are a lot of reasons why they are,

00:17:29.717 --> 00:17:32.812
and for two billion dollars,

00:17:32.812 --> 00:17:36.496
you can connect a lot more than 100 million people,

00:17:36.496 --> 00:17:39.157
but the reason I picked two,

00:17:39.157 --> 00:17:42.540
and I will leave this as my last slide,

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.324
is two billion dollars

00:17:44.324 --> 00:17:47.243
is what we were spending

00:17:47.243 --> 00:17:49.336
in Afghanistan

00:17:49.336 --> 00:17:51.248
every week.

00:17:51.248 --> 00:17:54.555
So surely if we can connect

00:17:54.555 --> 00:17:57.255
Africa and the last billion people

00:17:57.255 --> 00:17:58.809
for numbers like that,

00:17:58.809 --> 00:18:00.122
we should be doing it.

00:18:00.122 --> 00:18:02.419
Thank you very much.

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:05.948
(Applause)

00:18:05.948 --> 00:18:10.278
Chris Anderson: Stay up there. Stay up there.

00:18:10.278 --> 00:18:12.308
NN: You're going to give me extra time?

00:18:12.308 --> 00:18:14.670
CA: No. That was wickedly clever, wickedly clever.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.535
You gamed it beautifully.

00:18:16.535 --> 00:18:19.165
Nicholas, what is your prediction?

00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:21.191
(Laughter)

00:18:21.191 --> 00:18:23.627
NN: Thank you for asking.

00:18:23.627 --> 00:18:26.400
I'll tell you what my prediction is,

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.100
and my prediction, and this is a prediction,

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.762
because it'll be 30 years. I won't be here.

00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:36.490
But one of the things about learning how to read,

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.339
we have been doing a lot of consuming

00:18:39.339 --> 00:18:41.624
of information going through our eyes,

00:18:41.624 --> 00:18:44.700
and so that may be a very inefficient channel.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.785
So my prediction is that we are 
going to ingest information

00:18:49.785 --> 00:18:52.982
You're going to swallow a pill and know English.

00:18:52.982 --> 00:18:55.674
You're going to swallow a
pill and know Shakespeare.

00:18:55.674 --> 00:18:58.283
And the way to do it is through the bloodstream.

00:18:58.283 --> 00:19:00.140
So once it's in your bloodstream,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.358
it basically goes through it and gets into the brain,

00:19:02.358 --> 00:19:04.540
and when it knows that it's in the brain

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.862
in the different pieces,

00:19:05.862 --> 00:19:08.487
it deposits it in the right places.

00:19:08.487 --> 00:19:09.819
So it's ingesting.

00:19:09.819 --> 00:19:12.339
CA: Have you been hanging out
with Ray Kurzweil by any chance?

00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:15.552
NN: No, but I've been hanging
around with Ed Boyden

00:19:15.552 --> 00:19:17.397
and hanging around with one of the speakers

00:19:17.397 --> 00:19:19.210
who is here, Hugh Herr,

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.107
and there are a number of people.

00:19:21.107 --> 00:19:22.504
This isn't quite as far-fetched,

00:19:22.504 --> 00:19:25.449
so 30 years from now.

00:19:25.449 --> 00:19:27.191
CA: We will check it out.

00:19:27.191 --> 00:19:29.493
We're going to be back and we're going
to play this clip 30 years from now,

00:19:29.493 --> 00:19:32.524
and then all eat the red pill.

00:19:32.524 --> 00:19:34.709
Well thank you for that.

00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:36.153
Nicholas Negroponte.

00:19:36.153 --> 00:19:37.501
NN: Thank you.

00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:38.315
(Applause)
