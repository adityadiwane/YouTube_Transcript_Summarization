00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:14.599
When I was nine years old,

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.447
my mom asked me what I would want
my house to look like,

00:00:18.037 --> 00:00:20.520
and I drew this fairy mushroom.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.794
And then she actually built it.

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:25.791
(Laughter)

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.415
I don't think I realized
this was so unusual at the time,

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:29.947
and maybe I still haven't,

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:32.746
because I'm still designing houses.

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:38.698
This is a six-story bespoke home
on the island of Bali.

00:00:38.698 --> 00:00:41.670
It's built almost entirely from bamboo.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.797
The living room overlooks the valley
from the fourth floor.

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:48.781
You enter the house by a bridge.

00:00:50.548 --> 00:00:52.405
It can get hot in the tropics,

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:56.170
so we make big curving roofs
to catch the breezes.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.498
But some rooms have tall windows
to keep the air conditioning in

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:04.970
and the bugs out.

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:07.233
This room we left open.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.995
We made an air-conditioned, tented bed.

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:14.569
And one client wanted a TV room
in the corner of her living room.

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.332
Boxing off an area with tall walls
just didn't feel right,

00:01:18.332 --> 00:01:22.510
so instead, we made this giant woven pod.

00:01:24.477 --> 00:01:28.630
Now, we do have all the necessary
luxuries, like bathrooms.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.999
This one is a basket
in the corner of the living room,

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:36.513
and I've got tell you, some people
actually hesitate to use it.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.485
We have not quite figured out
our acoustic insulation.

00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:41.923
(Laughter)

00:01:41.923 --> 00:01:44.500
So there are lots of things
that we're still working on,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.700
but one thing I have learned

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.937
is that bamboo will treat you well
if you use it right.

00:01:50.907 --> 00:01:52.952
It's actually a wild grass.

00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:55.924
It grows on otherwise unproductive land --

00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:59.267
deep ravines, mountainsides.

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:03.493
It lives off of rainwater,
spring water, sunlight,

00:02:03.493 --> 00:02:08.253
and of the 1,450 species of bamboo
that grow across the world,

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:10.691
we use just seven of them.

00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:12.119
That's my dad.

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.220
He's the one who got me
building with bamboo,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.310
and he is standing in a clump

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.327
of Dendrocalamus asper niger
that he planted just seven years ago.

00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:23.369
Each year, it sends up
a new generation of shoots.

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:28.143
That shoot, we watched it grow a meter
in three days just last week,

00:02:28.143 --> 00:02:32.756
so we're talking about sustainable
timber in three years.

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:38.638
Now, we harvest from hundreds
of family-owned clumps.

00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:41.290
Betung, as we call it, it's really long,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.956
up to 18 meters of usable length.

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:45.487
Try getting that truck down the mountain.

00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:49.133
And it's strong: it has
the tensile strength of steel,

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:51.849
the compressive strength of concrete.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.775
Slam four tons straight down on a pole,

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:57.492
and it can take it.

00:02:57.492 --> 00:03:00.690
Because it's hollow, it's lightweight,

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.410
light enough to be lifted
by just a few men,

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.130
or, apparently, one woman.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.700
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:18.435
And when my father
built Green School in Bali,

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:21.639
he chose bamboo for all
of the buildings on campus,

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.892
because he saw it as a promise.

00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:25.796
It's a promise to the kids.

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:29.856
It's one sustainable material
that they will not run out of.

00:03:30.547 --> 00:03:34.694
And when I first saw these structures
under construction about six years ago,

00:03:34.694 --> 00:03:38.780
I just thought, this makes perfect sense.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.893
It is growing all around us.

00:03:40.893 --> 00:03:43.283
It's strong. It's elegant.

00:03:43.283 --> 00:03:45.514
It's earthquake-resistant.

00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:49.610
Why hasn't this happened sooner,
and what can we do with it next?

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.637
So along with some of
the original builders of Green School,

00:03:54.637 --> 00:03:56.613
I founded Ibuku.

00:03:56.613 --> 00:04:02.271
Ibu means "mother," and ku means "mine,"
so it represents my Mother Earth,

00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:07.363
and at Ibuku, we are a team
of artisans, architects and designers,

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:11.916
and what we're doing together
is creating a new way of building.

00:04:12.316 --> 00:04:14.677
Over the past five years together,

00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:19.666
we have built over 50 unique structures,
most of them in Bali.

00:04:20.737 --> 00:04:23.779
Nine of them are at Green Village --

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:26.612
you've just seen inside
some of these homes --

00:04:26.612 --> 00:04:30.776
and we fill them with bespoke furniture,

00:04:30.776 --> 00:04:32.834
we surround them with veggie gardens,

00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:35.946
we would love to invite you all
to come visit someday.

00:04:35.946 --> 00:04:38.974
And while you're there,
you can also see Green School --

00:04:38.974 --> 00:04:41.588
we keep building
classrooms there each year --

00:04:41.588 --> 00:04:44.874
as well as an updated
fairy mushroom house.

00:04:46.548 --> 00:04:49.938
We're also working on
a little house for export.

00:04:49.938 --> 00:04:53.119
This is a traditional Sumbanese home
that we replicated,

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:56.346
right down to the details and textiles.

00:04:57.056 --> 00:05:01.310
A restaurant
with an open-air kitchen.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.320
It looks a lot like a kitchen, right?

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.291
And a bridge that spans
22 meters across a river.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.014
Now, what we're doing,
it's not entirely new.

00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:18.220
From little huts to elaborate bridges
like this one in Java,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.330
bamboo has been in use across
the tropical regions of the world

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.232
for literally tens of thousands of years.

00:05:24.232 --> 00:05:30.290
There are islands and even continents
that were first reached by bamboo rafts.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.823
But until recently,

00:05:32.823 --> 00:05:37.444
it was almost impossible to reliably
protect bamboo from insects,

00:05:37.444 --> 00:05:41.705
and so, just about everything
that was ever built out of bamboo is gone.

00:05:42.613 --> 00:05:44.981
Unprotected bamboo weathers.

00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:48.371
Untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust.

00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:51.650
And so that's why most people,
especially in Asia,

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.546
think that you couldn't be poor enough
or rural enough to actually want

00:05:55.546 --> 00:05:58.146
to live in a bamboo house.

00:05:58.146 --> 00:05:59.981
And so we thought,

00:05:59.981 --> 00:06:02.326
what will it take to change their minds,

00:06:02.326 --> 00:06:05.507
to convince people
that bamboo is worth building with,

00:06:05.507 --> 00:06:08.340
much less worth aspiring to?

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.428
First, we needed safe treatment solutions.

00:06:11.428 --> 00:06:13.123
Borax is a natural salt.

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.839
It turns bamboo into
a viable building material.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.602
Treat it properly, design it carefully,

00:06:18.602 --> 00:06:21.290
and a bamboo structure
can last a lifetime.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.148
Second, build something
extraordinary out of it.

00:06:26.148 --> 00:06:28.240
Inspire people.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.294
Fortunately,

00:06:29.294 --> 00:06:31.168
Balinese culture fosters craftsmanship.

00:06:31.168 --> 00:06:33.143
It values the artisan.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.970
So combine those
with the adventurous outliers

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.105
from new generations
of locally trained architects

00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:42.530
and designers and engineers,

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.683
and always remember that you are designing

00:06:45.683 --> 00:06:49.451
for curving, tapering, hollow poles.

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:52.725
No two poles alike, no straight lines,

00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:55.128
no two-by-fours here.

00:06:55.128 --> 00:07:00.109
The tried-and-true, well-crafted formulas
and vocabulary of architecture

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:01.427
do not apply here.

00:07:01.427 --> 00:07:03.731
We have had to invent our own rules.

00:07:03.731 --> 00:07:08.198
We ask the bamboo what it's good at,
what it wants to become,

00:07:08.198 --> 00:07:12.690
and what it says is: respect it,
design for its strengths,

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.435
protect it from water,
and to make the most of its curves.

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:18.336
So we design in real 3D,

00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:20.159
making scale structural models

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:23.258
out of the same material
that we'll later use to build the house.

00:07:23.258 --> 00:07:25.278
And bamboo model-making, it's an art,

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.372
as well as some hardcore engineering.

00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:36.632
So that's the blueprint of the house.

00:07:36.632 --> 00:07:39.042
(Laughter)

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.951
And we bring it to site,

00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:43.691
and with tiny rulers,
we measure each pole,

00:07:43.691 --> 00:07:48.288
and consider each curve, and we choose
a piece of bamboo from the pile

00:07:48.288 --> 00:07:50.813
to replicate that house on site.

00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:55.417
When it comes down to the details,
we consider everything.

00:07:55.417 --> 00:07:57.530
Why are doors so often rectangular?

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.876
Why not round?

00:07:58.876 --> 00:08:00.523
How could you make a door better?

00:08:00.523 --> 00:08:02.498
Well, its hinges battle with gravity,

00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:04.658
and gravity will always win in the end,

00:08:04.658 --> 00:08:07.398
so why not have it pivot on the center

00:08:07.398 --> 00:08:09.650
where it can stay balanced?

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.316
And while you're at it,
why not doors shaped like teardrops?

00:08:14.316 --> 00:08:17.366
To reap the selective benefits
and work within the constraints

00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:19.100
of this material,

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.329
we have really had to push ourselves,

00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:25.916
and within that constraint,
we have found space for something new.

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:29.525
It's a challenge: how
do you make a ceiling

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:32.660
if you don't have any
flat boards to work with?

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:37.210
Let me tell you, sometimes I dream
of sheet rock and plywood.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.010
(Laughter)

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.819
But if what you've got
is skilled craftsmen

00:08:43.819 --> 00:08:46.490
and itsy bitsy little splits,

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.672
weave that ceiling together,

00:08:48.672 --> 00:08:51.635
stretch a canvas over it, lacquer it.

00:08:51.635 --> 00:08:54.352
How do you design durable
kitchen countertops

00:08:54.352 --> 00:08:57.904
that do justice to this curving
structure you've just built?

00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:00.737
Slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread,

00:09:00.737 --> 00:09:03.106
hand-carve each to fit the other,

00:09:03.106 --> 00:09:05.427
leave the crusts on,

00:09:05.427 --> 00:09:09.677
and what we're doing,
it is almost entirely handmade.

00:09:09.677 --> 00:09:11.813
The structural connections
of our buildings

00:09:11.813 --> 00:09:16.695
are reinforced by steel joints, but we use
a lot of hand-whittled bamboo pins.

00:09:16.695 --> 00:09:20.891
There are thousands of pins in each floor.

00:09:20.891 --> 00:09:25.883
This floor is made of glossy
and durable bamboo skin.

00:09:25.883 --> 00:09:28.995
You can feel the texture under bare feet.

00:09:28.995 --> 00:09:31.610
And the floor that you walk on,

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.453
can it affect the way that you walk?

00:09:33.453 --> 00:09:38.329
Can it change the footprint
that you'll ultimately leave on the world?

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:40.279
I remember being nine years old

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:42.183
and feeling wonder,

00:09:42.183 --> 00:09:44.200
and possibility,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.474
and a little bit of idealism.

00:09:46.474 --> 00:09:49.330
And we've got a really long way to go,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.732
there's a lot left to learn,

00:09:51.732 --> 00:09:56.672
but one thing I know is that
with creativity and commitment,

00:09:56.672 --> 00:10:01.223
you can create beauty and comfort

00:10:01.223 --> 00:10:04.450
and safety and even luxury

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.408
out of a material that will grow back.

00:10:07.408 --> 00:10:09.651
Thank you.

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:15.451
(Applause)
