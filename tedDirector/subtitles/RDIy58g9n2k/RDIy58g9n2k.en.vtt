00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
If you had caught me straight out of college

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
in the halls of the Vermont State House

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
where I was a lobbyist in training

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and asked me what I was going to do with my life,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I would have told you

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
the Chinese equivalency exam,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and I was going to go study law in Beijing,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and I was going to improve U.S.-China relations

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
through top-down policy changes

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and judicial system reforms.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
(Laughter)

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
(Applause)

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
I had a plan,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and I never ever thought

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
it would have anything to do

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
with the banjo.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Little did I know

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
what a huge impact it would have on me one night

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
when I was at a party

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and I heard a sound coming out of a record player

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
in the corner of a room.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And it was Doc Watson

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
singing and playing "Shady Grove."

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
♫ Shady Grove, my darlin' ♫

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
♫ Going back to Harlan ♫

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
That sound was just so beautiful,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
the sound of Doc's voice

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.260
and the rippling groove of the banjo.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And after being totally and completely obsessed

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
with the mammoth richness and history

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
of Chinese culture,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.260
it was like this total relief

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
to hear something so truly American

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
and so truly awesome.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
So before going to law school in China

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
I bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and I traveled down through Appalachia

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and I learned a bunch of old American songs,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and I ended up in Kentucky

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
And I was sitting in a hallway one night

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and a couple girls came up to me.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And they said, "Hey, do you want to jam?"

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And I was like, "Sure."

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
So I picked up my banjo

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
And a record executive walked up to me

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
and invited me to Nashville, Tennessee to make a record.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.260
(Laughter)

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.260
It's been eight years,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.260
and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
In fact, I went to Nashville.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And after a few months I was writing songs.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And the first song I wrote was in English,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and the second one was in Chinese.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
(Music)

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:09.260
[Chinese]

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Outside your door the world is waiting.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
Inside your heart a voice is calling.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
The four corners of the world are watching,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
so travel daughter, travel.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Go get it, girl.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:29.260
(Applause)

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.260
It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And I've played thousands of shows.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And I've collaborated

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.260
with so many incredible, inspirational musicians around the world.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And I see the power of music.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
I see the power of music

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
to connect cultures.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
I see it when I stand on a stage

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
in a bluegrass festival in east Virginia

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and I look out at the sea of lawn chairs

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and I bust out into a song in Chinese.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
[Chinese]

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
And everybody's eyes just pop wide open

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
like it's going to fall out of their heads.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And they're like, "What's that girl doing?"

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
And then they come up to me after the show

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and they all have a story.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
They all come up and they're like,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.260
"You know, my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to China

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and adopted a girl."

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And I tell you what, it like everybody's got a story.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
It's just incredible.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And then I go to China

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and I stand on a stage at a university

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
and I bust out into a song in Chinese

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and everybody sings along

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and they roar with delight

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
at this girl

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
with the hair and the instrument,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
and she's singing their music.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And I see, even more importantly,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
the power of music to connect hearts.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Like the time I was in Sichuan Province

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and I was singing for kids in relocation schools

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
in the earthquake disaster zone.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And this little girl comes up to me.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.260
[Chinese]

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
"Big sister Wong,"

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Washburn, Wong, same difference.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
"Big sister Wong, can I sing you a song

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
that my mom sang for me

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.260
before she was swallowed in the earthquake?"

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And I sat down,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
she sat on my lap.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
She started singing her song.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And the warmth of her body

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and I started to cry.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.260
And the light that shone off of her eyes

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.260
was a place I could have stayed forever.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And in that moment, we weren't our American selves,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
we weren't our Chinese selves,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.260
we were just mortals

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.260
sitting together in that light that keeps us here.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.260
I want to dwell in that light

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
with you and with everyone.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
And I know U.S.-China relations

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
doesn't need another lawyer.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
Thank you.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:27.260
(Applause)
