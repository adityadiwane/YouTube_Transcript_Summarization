00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:17.315
This back here was my brain cancer.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:20.845
Isn't it nice?

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.312
(Laughter)

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:25.798
The key phrase is "was,"

00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:27.457
phew.

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:32.523
(Applause)

00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:36.715
Having brain cancer was really,
as you can imagine,

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.591
shocking news for me.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.984
I knew nothing about cancer.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.870
In Western cultures, when you have cancer,

00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:48.102
it's as if you disappear in a way.

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:55.123
Your life as a complex human being
is replaced by medical data:

00:00:55.147 --> 00:01:01.234
Your images, your exams, your lab values,

00:01:01.258 --> 00:01:02.933
a list of medicines.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.734
And everyone changes as well.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.795
You suddenly become a disease on legs.

00:01:09.384 --> 00:01:13.488
Doctors start speaking a language
which you don't understand.

00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:19.313
They start pointing their fingers

00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:23.484
at your body and your images.

00:01:24.187 --> 00:01:27.210
People start changing as well

00:01:27.234 --> 00:01:31.076
because they start dealing
with the disease,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.435
instead of with the human being.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.620
They say, "What did the doctor say?"

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:38.048
before even saying, "Hello."

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:41.899
And in the meanwhile,

00:01:41.923 --> 00:01:47.089
you're left with questions
to which nobody gives an answer.

00:01:47.113 --> 00:01:49.864
These are the "Can I?" questions:

00:01:49.888 --> 00:01:51.883
Can I work while I have cancer?

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:57.054
Can I study? Can I make love?
Can I be creative?

00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:01.318
And you wonder, "What have I done
to deserve this?"

00:02:01.342 --> 00:02:05.476
You wonder, "Can I change something
about my lifestyle?"

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.174
You wonder, "Can I do something?

00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:10.293
Are there any other options?"

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:17.964
And, obviously, doctors are
the good guys in all these scenarios,

00:02:17.988 --> 00:02:23.910
because they are very professional
and dedicated to curing you.

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:29.168
But they also are very used
to having to deal with patients,

00:02:29.192 --> 00:02:36.124
so I'd say that they sometimes
lose the idea that this is torture for you

00:02:36.148 --> 00:02:41.079
and that you become,
literally, a patient --

00:02:41.103 --> 00:02:43.514
"patient" means "the one who waits."

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:44.931
(Laughter)

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:49.144
Things are changing, but classically,

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:54.817
they tend to not engage you in any way
to learn about your condition,

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:58.964
to get your friends and family engaged,

00:02:58.988 --> 00:03:02.728
or showing you ways
in which you can change your lifestyle

00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:05.142
to minimize the risks
of what you're going through.

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:09.947
But instead, you're forced there to wait

00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:14.992
in the hands of a series
of very professional strangers.

00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:18.890
While I was in the hospital,

00:03:18.914 --> 00:03:22.332
I asked for a printed-out
picture of my cancer

00:03:22.356 --> 00:03:24.415
and I spoke with it.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.318
It was really hard to obtain,

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:32.270
because it's not common practice
to ask for a picture of your own cancer.

00:03:32.294 --> 00:03:34.059
I talked to it and I said,

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:38.611
"Okay, cancer,
you're not all there is to me.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.623
There's more to me.

00:03:40.647 --> 00:03:47.062
A cure, whichever it is, will have
to deal with the whole of me."

00:03:47.086 --> 00:03:53.000
And so, the next day, I left the hospital
against medical advice.

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:57.592
I was determined to change
my relationship with the cancer

00:03:57.616 --> 00:04:00.460
and I was determined
to learn more about my cancer

00:04:00.484 --> 00:04:04.053
before doing anything
as drastic as a surgery.

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:12.927
I'm an artist, I use several forms
of open-source technologies

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:15.470
and open information in my practice.

00:04:15.494 --> 00:04:21.581
So my best bet was to get it all
out there, get the information out there,

00:04:21.605 --> 00:04:27.192
and use it so that it could be
accessed by anyone.

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:32.222
So I created a website,
which is called La Cura,

00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:35.374
on which I put my medical data, online.

00:04:35.398 --> 00:04:37.271
I actually had to hack it

00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:41.451
and that's a thing which we
can talk about in another speech.

00:04:41.475 --> 00:04:42.798
(Laughter)

00:04:42.822 --> 00:04:45.379
I chose this word, La Cura --

00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:47.738
La Cura in Italian means "the cure" --

00:04:47.762 --> 00:04:50.490
because in many different cultures,

00:04:50.514 --> 00:04:54.621
the word "cure" can mean
many different things.

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:56.725
In our Western cultures,

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:01.218
it means eradicating
or reversing a disease,

00:05:01.242 --> 00:05:02.746
but in different cultures,

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.326
for example, a culture from Asia,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.462
from the Mediterranean,
from Latin countries, from Africa,

00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:12.209
it can mean many more things.

00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:17.991
Of course, I was interested
in the opinions of doctors

00:05:18.015 --> 00:05:20.240
and healthcare providers,

00:05:20.264 --> 00:05:26.235
but I was also interested in
the cure of the artist, of the poet,

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.412
of the designer,

00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:32.356
of, who knows, the musicians.

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.765
I was interested in the social cure,

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.463
I was interested in
the psychological cure,

00:05:38.487 --> 00:05:40.977
I was interested in the spiritual cure,

00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:44.035
I was interested in the emotional cure,

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:46.857
I was interested in any form of cure.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.592
And, it worked.

00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:55.945
The La Cura website went viral.

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:00.670
I received lots of media attention
from Italy and from abroad

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:06.416
and I quickly received
more than 500,000 contacts --

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.354
emails, social networking --

00:06:08.378 --> 00:06:11.549
most of them were a suggestion
on how to cure my cancer,

00:06:11.573 --> 00:06:14.980
but more of them were about
how to cure myself

00:06:15.004 --> 00:06:17.319
as a full individual.

00:06:18.283 --> 00:06:22.341
For example, many thousands of videos,

00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:26.295
images, pictures, art performances

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.008
were produced for La Cura.

00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:32.030
For example, here we see
Francesca Fini in her performance.

00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:37.498
Or, as artist Patrick Lichty has done:

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:42.076
He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.797
and put it on sale on Thingiverse.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.020
Now you can have my cancer, too!

00:06:47.044 --> 00:06:49.557
(Laughter)

00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:52.974
Which is a nice thing,
if you think about it,

00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:54.782
we can share our cancer.

00:06:56.234 --> 00:06:58.609
And this was going on --

00:06:58.633 --> 00:07:01.994
scientists, the traditional
medicine experts,

00:07:02.018 --> 00:07:03.681
several researchers, doctors --

00:07:03.705 --> 00:07:06.377
all connected with me to give advice.

00:07:06.401 --> 00:07:08.296
With all this information and support,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.985
I was able to form a team
of several neurosurgeons,

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.971
traditional doctors,

00:07:16.995 --> 00:07:23.120
oncologists, and several
hundred volunteers

00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:26.349
with whom I was able to discuss

00:07:26.373 --> 00:07:31.772
the information I was receiving,
which is very important.

00:07:31.796 --> 00:07:38.141
And together, we were able to form
a strategy for my own cure

00:07:38.165 --> 00:07:41.792
in many languages,
according to many cultures.

00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:44.981
And the current strategy
spans the whole world

00:07:45.005 --> 00:07:47.603
and thousands of years of human history,

00:07:47.627 --> 00:07:49.686
which is quite remarkable for me.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.370
[Surgery]

00:07:51.394 --> 00:07:56.323
The follow-up MRIs showed, luckily,
little to no growth of the cancer.

00:07:57.005 --> 00:08:00.402
So I was able to take my time and choose.

00:08:00.426 --> 00:08:04.067
I chose the doctor I wanted to work with,

00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:06.465
I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in,

00:08:06.489 --> 00:08:10.476
and in the meanwhile, I was supported
by thousands of people,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.727
none of whom felt pity for me.

00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:19.405
Everyone felt like they could
take an active role

00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:21.241
in helping me to get well,

00:08:21.265 --> 00:08:24.630
and this was the most important
part of La Cura.

00:08:26.081 --> 00:08:27.283
What are the outcomes?

00:08:28.122 --> 00:08:30.455
I'm fine, as you can see, pretty fine.

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:35.771
(Applause)

00:08:35.795 --> 00:08:38.203
I had excellent news

00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:39.833
after the surgery --

00:08:39.857 --> 00:08:45.352
I have -- I had a very low-grade glioma,

00:08:45.376 --> 00:08:49.798
which is a "good" kind of cancer
which doesn't grow a lot.

00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:53.275
I have completely changed
my life and my lifestyle.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:59.375
Everything I did was thoughtfully
designed to get me engaged.

00:09:00.055 --> 00:09:04.171
Up until the very last few
minutes of the surgery,

00:09:04.195 --> 00:09:06.162
which was very intense,

00:09:06.186 --> 00:09:10.107
a matrix of electrodes
was implanted in my brain

00:09:10.131 --> 00:09:11.997
from this side,

00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:17.254
to be able to build a functional map
of what the brain controls.

00:09:17.278 --> 00:09:20.952
And right before the operation,

00:09:20.976 --> 00:09:27.753
we were able to discuss
the functional map of my brain

00:09:27.777 --> 00:09:32.660
with the doctor, to understand
which risks I was running into

00:09:32.684 --> 00:09:36.288
and if there were any I wanted to avoid.

00:09:36.312 --> 00:09:38.428
Obviously, there were.

00:09:38.452 --> 00:09:39.505
[Open]

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:44.956
And this openness was really
the fundamental part of La Cura.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.775
Thousands of people shared
their stories, their experiences.

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:54.403
Doctors got to talk with people
they don't usually consult

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:59.346
when they think about cancer.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:04.019
I'm a self-founding,
continuous state of translation

00:10:04.043 --> 00:10:06.339
among many different languages,

00:10:06.363 --> 00:10:10.236
in which science meets emotion

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.897
and conventional research
meets traditional research.

00:10:14.921 --> 00:10:16.239
[Society]

00:10:16.263 --> 00:10:21.610
The most important thing of La Cura

00:10:21.635 --> 00:10:28.635
was to feel like a part
of a really engaged and connected society

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:34.780
whose wellness really depends
on the wellness of all of its components.

00:10:36.253 --> 00:10:40.853
This global performance
is my open-source cure for cancer.

00:10:41.873 --> 00:10:43.655
And from what I feel,

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:46.055
it's a cure for me, but for us all.

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:47.232
Thank you.

00:10:47.256 --> 00:10:49.931
(Applause).
