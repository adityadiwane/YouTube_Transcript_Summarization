00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:18.100
Imagine you are a part
of a crew of astronauts

00:00:18.124 --> 00:00:21.276
traveling to Mars or some distant planet.

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:24.886
The travel time could take a year

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.379
or even longer.

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:29.773
The space on board and the resources

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:31.337
would be limited.

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:35.948
So you and the crew would have
to figure out how to produce food

00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:37.431
with minimal inputs.

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:42.046
What if you could bring with you
just a few packets of seeds,

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:46.364
and grow crops in a matter of hours?

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:50.351
And what if those crops
would then make more seeds,

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:53.429
enabling you to feed the entire crew

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:57.215
with just those few packets of seeds
for the duration of the trip?

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:02.751
Well, the scientists at NASA actually
figured out a way to do this.

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:06.189
What they came up with
was actually quite interesting.

00:01:06.213 --> 00:01:08.109
It involved microorganisms,

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.223
which are single-celled organisms.

00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:13.068
And they also used hydrogen from water.

00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:17.599
The types of microbes that they used
were called hydrogenotrophs,

00:01:17.623 --> 00:01:22.913
and with these hydrogenotrophs,
you can create a virtuous carbon cycle

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.755
that would sustain life
onboard a spacecraft.

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:30.217
Astronauts would breathe out
carbon dioxide,

00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:34.042
that carbon dioxide would then
be captured by the microbes

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.621
and converted into a nutritious,
carbon-rich crop.

00:01:38.287 --> 00:01:41.878
The astronauts would then eat
that carbon-rich crop

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:45.892
and exhale the carbon out
in the form of carbon dioxide,

00:01:45.916 --> 00:01:48.140
which would then be captured
by the microbes,

00:01:48.164 --> 00:01:49.799
to create a nutritious crop,

00:01:49.823 --> 00:01:52.718
which then would be exhaled
in the form of carbon dioxide

00:01:52.742 --> 00:01:54.152
by the astronauts.

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:57.178
So in this way, a closed-loop
carbon cycle is created.

00:01:57.821 --> 00:01:59.459
So why is this important?

00:02:00.158 --> 00:02:02.332
We need carbon to survive as humans,

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:04.737
and we get our carbon from food.

00:02:05.237 --> 00:02:06.920
On a long space journey,

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:10.263
you simply wouldn't be able to pick up
any carbon along the way,

00:02:10.287 --> 00:02:13.222
so you'd have to figure out
how to recycle it on board.

00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:16.262
This is a clever solution, right?

00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:20.529
But the thing is, that research
didn't really go anywhere.

00:02:20.553 --> 00:02:24.275
We haven't yet gone to Mars.
We haven't yet gone to another planet.

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.937
And this was actually done
in the '60s and '70s.

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:30.722
So a colleague of mine,
Dr. John Reed, and I,

00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:34.717
were interested, actually,
in carbon recycling here on Earth.

00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:36.972
We wanted to come up
with technical solutions

00:02:36.996 --> 00:02:38.756
to address climate change.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.001
And we discovered this research

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:45.435
by reading some papers published
in the '60s -- 1967 and later --

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.268
articles about this work.

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:50.370
And we thought it was a really good idea.

00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:53.838
So we said, well, Earth
is actually like a spaceship.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.782
We have limited space
and limited resources,

00:02:57.806 --> 00:02:59.989
and on Earth, we really do
need to figure out

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.908
how to recycle our carbon better.

00:03:03.202 --> 00:03:05.349
So we had the idea,

00:03:05.373 --> 00:03:12.123
can we take some of these
NASA-type ideas and apply them

00:03:12.147 --> 00:03:14.912
to our carbon problem here on Earth?

00:03:14.936 --> 00:03:17.568
Could we cultivate
these NASA-type microbes

00:03:17.592 --> 00:03:20.385
in order to make
valuable products here on Earth?

00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:23.693
We started a company to do it.

00:03:23.717 --> 00:03:28.397
And in that company, we discovered
that these hydrogenotrophs --

00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:32.358
which I'll actually call
nature's supercharged carbon recyclers --

00:03:32.382 --> 00:03:35.201
we found that they are a powerful
class of microbes

00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:39.053
that had been largely overlooked
and understudied,

00:03:39.077 --> 00:03:41.782
and that they could make
some really valuable products.

00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:46.631
So we began cultivating these products,
these microbes, in our lab.

00:03:47.115 --> 00:03:50.970
We found that we can make
essential amino acids from carbon dioxide

00:03:50.994 --> 00:03:52.459
using these microbes.

00:03:52.483 --> 00:03:55.528
And we even made a protein-rich meal

00:03:55.552 --> 00:04:00.023
that has an amino acid profile
similar to what you might find

00:04:00.047 --> 00:04:01.563
in some animal proteins.

00:04:02.523 --> 00:04:04.933
We began cultivating them even further,

00:04:04.957 --> 00:04:06.874
and we found that we can make oil.

00:04:06.898 --> 00:04:09.349
Oils are used to manufacture
many products.

00:04:09.738 --> 00:04:13.071
We made an oil that was similar
to a citrus oil,

00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:16.180
which can be used for flavoring
and for fragrances,

00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:18.831
but it also can be used
as a biodegradable cleaner

00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:20.339
or even as a jet fuel.

00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:23.627
And we made an oil
that's similar to palm oil.

00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:26.025
Palm oil is used to manufacture

00:04:26.049 --> 00:04:29.357
a wide range of consumer
and industrial goods.

00:04:30.873 --> 00:04:35.615
We began working with manufacturers
to scale up this technology,

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.446
and we're currently working with them

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.564
to bring some of these products to market.

00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:43.696
We believe this type of technology
can indeed help us

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.070
profitably recycle carbon dioxide
into valuable products --

00:04:47.777 --> 00:04:49.815
something that's beneficial
for the planet

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:51.573
but also beneficial for business.

00:04:52.383 --> 00:04:54.201
That's what we're doing today.

00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:58.455
But tomorrow, this type of technology
and using these types of microbes

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.242
actually could help us
do something even greater

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:03.217
if we take it to the next level.

00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:06.463
We believe that this type of technology

00:05:06.487 --> 00:05:09.726
can actually help us address
an issue with agriculture

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.275
and allow us to create
a type of agriculture that's sustainable,

00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:17.884
that will allow us to scale
to meet the demands of tomorrow.

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:21.630
And why might we need
a sustainable agriculture?

00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:24.513
Well, actually, it is estimated

00:05:24.537 --> 00:05:29.774
that the population will reach
about 10 billion by 2050,

00:05:29.798 --> 00:05:32.979
and we're projecting that we will need
to increase food production

00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:34.575
by 70 percent.

00:05:35.182 --> 00:05:38.420
In addition, we will need many more
resources and raw materials

00:05:38.444 --> 00:05:40.977
to make consumer goods
and industrial goods.

00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:44.234
So how will we scale to meet that demand?

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:50.166
Well, modern agriculture simply cannot
sustainably scale to meet that demand.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.978
There are a number of reasons why.

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:58.145
One of them is that modern agriculture
is one of the largest emitters

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.750
of greenhouse gases.

00:05:59.774 --> 00:06:03.397
In fact, it emits more greenhouse gases

00:06:03.421 --> 00:06:06.525
than our cars, our trucks, our planes

00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:08.985
and our trains combined.

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:14.525
Another reason is that modern ag
simply takes up a whole lot of land.

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:20.748
We have cleared 19.4 million square miles
for crops and livestock.

00:06:21.446 --> 00:06:23.094
What does that look like?

00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:28.009
Well, that's roughly the size
of South America and Africa combined.

00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:31.300
Let me give you a specific example.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:36.280
In Indonesia, an amount
of virgin rainforest was cleared

00:06:36.304 --> 00:06:39.686
totaling the size
of approximately Ireland,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.305
between 2000 and 2012.

00:06:42.717 --> 00:06:45.923
Just think of all
of the species, the diversity,

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:47.837
that was removed in the process,

00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:50.548
whether plant life, insects
or animal life.

00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:53.794
And a natural carbon sink
was also removed.

00:06:54.437 --> 00:06:56.423
So let me make this real for you.

00:06:56.896 --> 00:07:00.741
This clearing happened primarily
to make room for palm plantations.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.774
And as I mentioned before,

00:07:02.798 --> 00:07:06.347
palm oil is used
to manufacture many products.

00:07:06.371 --> 00:07:10.298
In fact, it is estimated
that over 50 percent of consumer products

00:07:10.322 --> 00:07:12.711
are manufactured using palm oil.

00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:16.898
And that includes things
like ice cream, cookies ...

00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:19.373
It includes cooking oils.

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:22.935
It also includes detergents,
lotions, soaps.

00:07:23.594 --> 00:07:27.673
You and I both
probably have numerous items

00:07:28.395 --> 00:07:30.896
in our kitchens and our bathrooms

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.927
that were manufactured using palm oil.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:38.665
So you and I are direct beneficiaries
of removed rainforests.

00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:41.780
Modern ag has some problems,

00:07:41.804 --> 00:07:45.278
and we need solutions
if we want to scale sustainably.

00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:51.677
I believe that microbes
can be a part of the answer --

00:07:51.701 --> 00:07:55.684
specifically, these supercharged
carbon recyclers.

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:58.230
These supercharged carbon recyclers,

00:07:58.254 --> 00:08:02.285
like plants, serve as
the natural recyclers

00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:04.430
in their ecosystems where they thrive.

00:08:04.454 --> 00:08:06.650
And they thrive in exotic places on Earth,

00:08:06.674 --> 00:08:09.125
like hydrothermal vents and hot springs.

00:08:09.543 --> 00:08:12.806
In those ecosystems,
they take carbon and recycle it

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.384
into the nutrients needed
for those ecosystems.

00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:17.375
And they're rich in nutrients,

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:22.604
such as oils and proteins,
minerals and carbohydrates.

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:28.557
And actually, microbes are already
an integral part of our everyday lives.

00:08:29.335 --> 00:08:33.542
If you enjoy a glass of pinot noir
on a Friday night,

00:08:33.566 --> 00:08:35.510
after a long, hard work week,

00:08:35.534 --> 00:08:38.208
then you are enjoying
a product of microbes.

00:08:39.176 --> 00:08:41.858
If you enjoy a beer
from your local microbrewery --

00:08:41.882 --> 00:08:43.502
a product of microbes.

00:08:43.526 --> 00:08:46.475
Or bread, or cheese, or yogurt.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.110
These are all products of microbes.

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:55.014
But the beauty and power associated
with these supercharged carbon recyclers

00:08:55.038 --> 00:09:00.138
lies in the fact that they can
actually produce in a matter of hours

00:09:00.162 --> 00:09:01.488
versus months.

00:09:01.512 --> 00:09:03.455
That means we can make crops

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:06.796
much faster than we're making them today.

00:09:07.685 --> 00:09:09.320
They grow in the dark,

00:09:09.344 --> 00:09:11.891
so they can grow in any season

00:09:11.915 --> 00:09:15.135
and in any geography and any location.

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:18.771
They can grow in containers
that require minimal space.

00:09:19.562 --> 00:09:23.516
And we can get to a type
of vertical agriculture.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.197
Instead of our traditional
horizontal agriculture

00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:27.950
that requires so much land,

00:09:27.974 --> 00:09:29.551
we can scale vertically,

00:09:29.571 --> 00:09:35.207
and as a result
produce much more product per area.

00:09:36.187 --> 00:09:40.651
If we implement this type of approach
and use these carbon recyclers,

00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:43.971
then we wouldn't have to remove
any more rainforests

00:09:43.995 --> 00:09:47.429
to make the food and the goods
that we consume.

00:09:48.524 --> 00:09:50.737
Because, at a large scale,

00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:56.069
you can actually make 10,000 times
more output per land area

00:09:56.093 --> 00:09:59.248
than you could -- for instance,
if you used soybeans --

00:09:59.272 --> 00:10:02.332
if you planted soybeans
on that same area of land

00:10:02.356 --> 00:10:03.800
over a period of a year.

00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:06.800
Ten thousand times
over a period of a year.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.859
So this is what I mean
by a new type of agriculture.

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:15.921
And this is what I mean
by developing a system

00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:20.839
that allows us to sustainably scale
to meet the demands of 10 billion.

00:10:22.704 --> 00:10:26.299
And what would be the products
of this new type of agriculture?

00:10:26.323 --> 00:10:28.506
Well, we've already made a protein meal,

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.793
so you can imagine something
similar to a soybean meal,

00:10:31.817 --> 00:10:33.760
or even cornmeal, or wheat flour.

00:10:34.203 --> 00:10:35.556
We've already made oils,

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.258
so you can imagine something
similar to coconut oil

00:10:39.282 --> 00:10:41.296
or olive oil or soybean oil.

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:46.280
So this type of crop can
actually produce the nutrients

00:10:46.304 --> 00:10:48.599
that would give us pasta and bread,

00:10:48.623 --> 00:10:51.749
cakes, nutritional items of many sorts.

00:10:52.226 --> 00:10:59.138
Furthermore, since oil is used
to manufacture multiple other goods,

00:10:59.162 --> 00:11:01.218
industrial products and consumer products,

00:11:01.242 --> 00:11:06.045
you can imagine being able to make
detergents, soaps, lotions, etc.,

00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:07.716
using these types of crops.

00:11:09.382 --> 00:11:12.262
Not only are we running out of space,

00:11:12.286 --> 00:11:15.454
but if we continue to operate
under the status quo

00:11:15.478 --> 00:11:16.951
with modern agriculture,

00:11:16.975 --> 00:11:21.625
we run the risk of robbing our progeny
of a beautiful planet.

00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:24.180
But it doesn't have to be this way.

00:11:24.627 --> 00:11:27.405
We can imagine a future of abundance.

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:34.030
Let us create systems that keep
planet Earth, our spaceship,

00:11:34.054 --> 00:11:35.934
not only from not crashing,

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.540
but let us also develop systems
and ways of living

00:11:40.564 --> 00:11:44.722
that will be beneficial
to the lives of ourselves

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:48.388
and the 10 billion that will
be on this planet by 2050.

00:11:48.817 --> 00:11:50.032
Thank you very much.

00:11:50.056 --> 00:11:54.079
