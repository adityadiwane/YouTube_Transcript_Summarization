00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.256
Our lives depend

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.040
on a world we can't see.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.936
Think about your week so far.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.176
Have you watched TV, used GPS,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.160
checked the weather or even ate a meal?

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.416
These many things
that enable our daily lives

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.296
rely either directly or indirectly

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.016
on satellites.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.976
And while we often take for granted

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.536
the services that satellites provide us,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.376
the satellites themselves
deserve our attention

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.376
as they are leaving a lasting mark

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.119
on the space they occupy.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.336
People around the world
rely on satellite infrastructure every day

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.416
for information, entertainment
and to communicate.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.296
There's agricultural
and environmental monitoring,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.376
Internet connectivity, navigation.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.096
Satellites even play a role

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.600
in the operation of our financial
and energy markets.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.016
But these satellites that we rely on

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.696
day in and day out

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.376
have a finite life.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.296
They might run out of propellant,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.856
they could malfunction,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.575
or they may just naturally
reach the end of their mission life.

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.736
At this point, these satellites
effectively become space junk,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.080
cluttering the orbital environment.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.456
So imagine you're driving down the highway
on a beautiful, sunny day

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.896
out running errands.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.576
You've got your music cranked,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.056
your windows rolled down,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.776
with the cool breeze
blowing through your hair.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.000
Feels nice, right?

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.016
Everything is going smoothly

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.696
until suddenly
your car stutters and stalls

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.560
right in the middle of the highway.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.456
So now you have no choice
but to abandon your car

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.920
where it is on the highway.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.536
Maybe you were lucky enough

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.456
to be able to move it out of the way
and into a shoulder lane

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.616
so that it's out of the way
of other traffic.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.896
A couple of hours ago,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.400
your car was a useful machine
that you relied on in your everyday life.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.536
Now, it's a useless hunk of metal

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.240
taking up space in a valuable
transportation network.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.096
And imagine international roadways
all cluttered with broken down vehicles

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.976
that are just getting in the way
of other traffic.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.896
And imagine the debris
that would be strewn everywhere

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.376
if a collision actually happened,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.776
thousands of smaller pieces of debris

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.720
becoming new obstacles.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.256
This is the paradigm
of the satellite industry.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.416
Satellites that are no longer working

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.256
are often left to deorbit
over many, many years,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.816
or only moved out of the way
as a temporary solution.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.096
And there are no
international laws in space

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.760
to enforce us to clean up after ourselves.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.936
So the world's first satellite, Sputnik I,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.216
was launched in 1957,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.880
and in that year, there were
only a total of three launch attempts.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.056
Decades later and dozens of countries
from all around the world

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.456
have launched thousands
of more satellites into orbit,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.216
and the frequency of launches
is only going to increase in the future,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.816
especially if you consider
things like the possibility

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.440
of 900-plus satellite
constellations being launched.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.616
Now, we send satellites
to different orbits

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.696
depending on what they're needed for.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.056
One of the most common places
we send satellites

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.656
is the low Earth orbit,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.656
possibly to image the surface of Earth

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.080
at up to about 2,000 kilometers altitude.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.176
Satellites there are naturally buffeted
by Earth's atmosphere,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.136
so their orbits naturally decay,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.696
and they'll eventually burn up,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.680
probably within a couple of decades.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.536
Another common place we send satellites

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.216
is the geostationary orbit

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.840
at about 35,000 kilometers altitude.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.496
Satellites there remain in the same place
above Earth as the Earth rotates,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.800
which enables things like communications
or television broadcast, for example.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.760
Satellites in high orbits like these
could remain there for centuries.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.136
And then there's the orbit
coined "the graveyard,"

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.776
the ominous junk or disposal orbits,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.656
where some satellites
are intentionally placed

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.896
at the end of their life

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.680
so that they're out of the way
of common operational orbits.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.376
Of the nearly 7,000 satellites
launched since the late 1950s,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.760
only about one in seven
is currently operational,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.256
and in addition to the satellites
that are no longer working,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.776
there's also hundreds of thousands
of marble-sized debris

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.216
and millions of paint chip-sized debris

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.240
that are also orbiting around the Earth.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.656
Space debris is a major risk
to space missions,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.680
but also to the satellites
that we rely on each and every day.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.936
Now, because space debris and junk
has become increasingly worrisome,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.576
there have been some national
and international efforts

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.096
to develop technical standards

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.040
to help us limit the generation
of additional debris.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.736
So for example, there are recommendations

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.856
for those low-Earth orbiting spacecraft

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.296
to be made to deorbit in under 25 years,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.416
but that's still a really long time,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.760
especially if a satellite
hasn't been working for years.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.376
There's also mandates
for those dead geostationary spacecraft

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.640
to be moved into a graveyard orbit.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.176
But neither of these guidelines
is binding under international law,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.976
and the understanding is that they will be
implemented through national mechanisms.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.456
These guidelines are also not long-term,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.896
they're not proactive,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.256
nor do they address
the debris that's already up there.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.120
They're only in place
to limit the future creation of debris.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.840
Space junk is no one's responsibility.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.536
Now, Mount Everest is actually
an interesting comparison

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.776
of a new approach to how
we interact with our environments,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.096
as it's often given the dubious honor

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.120
of being the world's highest garbage dump.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.296
Decades after the first conquest
of the world's highest peak,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.576
tons of rubbish left behind by climbers

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.536
has started to raise concern,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.296
and you may have read in the news
that there's speculation

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.376
that Nepal will crack down on mountaineers

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.960
with stricter enforcement
of penalties and legal obligations.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.016
The goal, of course,
is to persuade climbers

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.216
to clean up after themselves,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.136
so maybe local not-for-profits will pay
climbers who bring down extra waste,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.640
or expeditions might organize
voluntary cleanup trips.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.376
And yet still many climbers feel

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.640
that independent groups
should police themselves.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.936
There's no simple or easy answer,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.016
and even well-intentioned
efforts at conservation

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.880
often run into problems.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.416
But that doesn't mean
we shouldn't do everything in our power

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.760
to protect the environments
that we rely and depend on,

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.456
and like Everest, the remote location
and inadequate infrastructure

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.896
of the orbital environment

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.280
make waste disposal a challenging problem.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.456
But we simply cannot reach new heights

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.536
and create an even higher garbage dump,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.720
one that's out of this world.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.496
The reality of space

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.096
is that if a component
on a satellite breaks down,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.016
there really are limited
opportunities for repairs,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.080
and only at great cost.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.256
But what if we were smarter
about how we designed satellites?

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.576
What if all satellites,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.896
regardless of what country
they were built in,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.816
had to be standardized in some way

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.376
for recycling, servicing

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.880
or active deorbiting?

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.096
What if there actually were
international laws with teeth

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.896
that enforced end-of-life
disposal of satellites

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.056
instead of moving them out of the way

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.680
as a temporary solution?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.496
Or maybe satellite manufacturers
need to be charged a deposit

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.816
to even launch a satellite into orbit,

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.296
and that deposit would only be returned

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.856
if the satellite was disposed of properly

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.600
or if they cleaned up
some quota of debris.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.016
Or maybe a satellite
needs to have technology on board

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.800
to help accelerate deorbit.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.976
There are some encouraging signs.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.696
The UK's TechDemoSat-1,
launched in 2014, for example,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.656
was designed for end-of-life disposal

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.616
via a small drag sail.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.216
This works for the satellite
because it's small,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.936
but satellites that are higher
or in larger orbits

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.816
or are larger altogether,
like the size of school buses,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.256
will require other disposal options.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.256
So maybe you get into things
like high-powered lasers

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.096
or tugging using nets or tethers,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.440
as crazy as those sound in the short term.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.056
And then one really cool possibility

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.400
is the idea of orbital tow trucks
or space mechanics.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.456
Imagine if a robotic arm

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.336
on some sort of space tow truck

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.656
could fix the broken components
on a satellite,

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.520
making them usable again.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.176
Or what if that very same robotic arm

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.536
could refuel the propellant tank
on a spacecraft

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.536
that relies on chemical propulsion

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.039
just like you or I would refuel
the fuel tanks on our cars?

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:47.216
Robotic repair and maintenance

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.960
could extend the lives of hundreds
of satellites orbiting around the Earth.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.176
Whatever the disposal
or cleanup options we come up with,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.176
it's clearly not just a technical problem.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.256
There's also complex space laws
and politics that we have to sort out.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.440
Simply put, we haven't found a way
to use space sustainably yet.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.616
Exploring, innovating
to change the way we live and work

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.616
are what we as humans do,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.136
and in space exploration,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.416
we're literally moving
beyond the boundaries of Earth.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.096
But as we push thresholds
in the name of learning and innovation,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.600
we must remember that accountability
for our environments never goes away.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.696
There is without doubt congestion
in the low Earth and geostationary orbits,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.056
and we cannot keep
launching new satellites

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.376
to replace the ones that have broken down

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.456
without doing something about them first,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.936
just like we would never
leave a broken down car

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.360
in the middle of the highway.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.336
Next time you use your phone,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.856
check the weather or use your GPS,

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.136
think about the satellite technologies
that make those activities possible.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.016
But also think about the very impact

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.336
that the satellites have
on the environment surrounding Earth,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.056
and help spread the message
that together we must reduce our impact.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.616
Earth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.216
and our gateway to exploration.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.760
It's up to us to keep it that way.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.376
Thank you.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.480
(Applause)
