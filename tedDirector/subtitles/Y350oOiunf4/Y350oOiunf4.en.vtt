00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
The universe

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
is really big.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
We live in a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And if you take a camera

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and you point it at a random part of the sky,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and you just keep the shutter open,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
it will see something like this.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Every one of these little blobs

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way --

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
in the observable universe.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
100 billion is the only number you need to know.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
The age of the universe, between now and the Big Bang,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
is a hundred billion in dog years.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
(Laughter)

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Which tells you something about our place in the universe.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
It's extremely beautiful.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I've often wondered, what is the evolutionary pressure

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
to really enjoy pictures of galaxies

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
when they didn't have any.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
But we would also like to understand it.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.260
As a cosmologist, I want to ask, why is the universe like this?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
it would be moving away from you.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And if you look at a galaxy even farther away,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
it would be moving away faster.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
So we say the universe is expanding.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
What that means, of course, is that, in the past,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
things were closer together.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
In the past, the universe was more dense,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
and it was also hotter.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
That kind of makes sense to us.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
is that the universe, at early times, near the Big Bang,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
was also very, very smooth.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
You might think that that's not a surprise.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
The air in this room is very smooth.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
You might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out."

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
But the conditions near the Big Bang are very, very different

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
than the conditions of the air in this room.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
In particular, things were a lot denser.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
The gravitational pull of things

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
was a lot stronger near the Big Bang.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
What you have to think about

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
a hundred billion stars each.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
At early times, those hundred billion galaxies

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
were squeezed into a region about this big --

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
literally -- at early times.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And you have to imagine doing that squeezing

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
without any imperfections,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
without any little spots

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Because if there had been, they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
into a huge black hole.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Keeping the universe very, very smooth at early times

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
is not easy; it's a delicate arrangement.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
It's a clue

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
that the early universe is not chosen randomly.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
There is something that made it that way.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
We would like to know what.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
an Austrian physicist in the 19th century.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
You've heard of entropy.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
It's the randomness, the disorder, the chaoticness of some systems.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Boltzmann gave us a formula --

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
engraved on his tombstone now --

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
that really quantifies what entropy is.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
And it's basically just saying

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
that entropy is the number of ways

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
so that macroscopically it looks the same.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
If you have the air in this room,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
you don't notice each individual atom.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
A low entropy configuration

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
is one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
A high entropy arrangement

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
is one that there are many arrangements that look that way.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
This is a crucially important insight

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
because it helps us explain

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
the second law of thermodynamics --

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
the law that says that entropy increases in the universe,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
or in some isolated bit of the universe.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
The reason why entropy increases

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
is simply because there are many more ways

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
to be high entropy than to be low entropy.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
That's a wonderful insight,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
but it leaves something out.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
This insight that entropy increases, by the way,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
is what's behind what we call the arrow of time,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
the difference between the past and the future.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Every difference that there is

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
between the past and the future

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
is because entropy is increasing --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
the fact that you can remember the past, but not the future.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
The fact that you are born, and then you live, and then you die,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
always in that order,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
that's because entropy is increasing.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
it's very natural for it to increase

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
because there's more ways to be high entropy.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
What he didn't explain

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
was why the entropy was ever low in the first place.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
The fact that the entropy of the universe was low

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
was a reflection of the fact

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
that the early universe was very, very smooth.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
We'd like to understand that.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
That's our job as cosmologists.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Unfortunately, it's actually not a problem

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
that we've been giving enough attention to.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
It's not one of the first things people would say,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
if you asked a modern cosmologist,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
"What are the problems we're trying to address?"

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
was Richard Feynman.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
50 years ago, he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
He gave the popular lectures

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
that became "The Character of Physical Law."

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
that became "The Feynman Lectures on Physics."

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
that became "The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation."

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
In every one of these books, every one of these sets of lectures,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
he emphasized this puzzle:

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Why did the early universe have such a small entropy?

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
So he says -- I'm not going to do the accent --

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
he says, "For some reason, the universe, at one time,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
had a very low entropy for its energy content,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and since then the entropy has increased.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
are reduced still further

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
from speculation to understanding."

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
So that's our job.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
We want to know -- this is 50 years ago, "Surely," you're thinking,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
"we've figured it out by now."

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
It's not true that we've figured it out by now.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
The reason the problem has gotten worse,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
rather than better,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
is because in 1998

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
We learned that it's accelerating.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
The universe is not only expanding.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
If you come back a billion years later and look at it again,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
it will be moving away faster.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
so we say the universe is accelerating.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
Unlike the low entropy of the early universe,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
even though we don't know the answer for this,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
we at least have a good theory that can explain it,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
if that theory is right,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and that's the theory of dark energy.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
It's just the idea that empty space itself has energy.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
In every little cubic centimeter of space,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
whether or not there's stuff,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
whether or not there's particles, matter, radiation or whatever,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
there's still energy, even in the space itself.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
And this energy, according to Einstein,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
exerts a push on the universe.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
It is a perpetual impulse

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
that pushes galaxies apart from each other.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Because dark energy, unlike matter or radiation,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
does not dilute away as the universe expands.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
remains the same,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
even as the universe gets bigger and bigger.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
This has crucial implications

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
for what the universe is going to do in the future.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
For one thing, the universe will expand forever.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Back when I was your age,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
we didn't know what the universe was going to do.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Einstein was fond of this idea.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
But if there's dark energy, and the dark energy does not go away,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
14 billion years in the past,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
100 billion dog years,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
but an infinite number of years into the future.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
space looks finite to us.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
Space may be finite or infinite,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
but because the universe is accelerating,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
there are parts of it we cannot see

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and never will see.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
There's a finite region of space that we have access to,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
surrounded by a horizon.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
So even though time goes on forever,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
space is limited to us.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Finally, empty space has a temperature.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
that a black hole, even though you think it's black,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
it actually emits radiation

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
when you take into account quantum mechanics.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
The curvature of space-time around the black hole

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
and the black hole radiates.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
showed that if you have dark energy in empty space,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
then the whole universe radiates.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
The energy of empty space

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
brings to life quantum fluctuations.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
And so even though the universe will last forever,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
there will always be some radiation,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
some thermal fluctuations,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
even in empty space.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
So what this means

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
is that the universe is like a box of gas

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
that lasts forever.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Well what is the implication of that?

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
He said, well, entropy increases

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
because there are many, many more ways

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
for the universe to be high entropy, rather than low entropy.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
But that's a probabilistic statement.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
It will probably increase,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and the probability is enormously huge.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
It's not something you have to worry about --

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.260
the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
It's very, very unlikely.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Except if they locked the doors

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and kept us here literally forever,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
that would happen.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
Everything that is allowed,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
would eventually be obtained.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
So Boltzmann says, look, you could start with a universe

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
that was in thermal equilibrium.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
He didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton --

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
they were absolute; they just stuck there forever.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
So his idea of a natural universe

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere --

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
the everything molecules.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
But if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
the random fluctuations of those molecules

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
will occasionally bring them

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
into lower entropy configurations.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
And then, of course, in the natural course of things,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
they will expand back.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
So it's not that entropy must always increase --

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
you can get fluctuations into lower entropy,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
more organized situations.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
Well if that's true,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Boltzmann then goes onto invent

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
two very modern-sounding ideas --

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
the multiverse and the anthropic principle.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
He says, the problem with thermal equilibrium

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
is that we can't live there.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Remember, life itself depends on the arrow of time.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
We would not be able to process information,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
metabolize, walk and talk,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
if we lived in thermal equilibrium.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
So if you imagine a very, very big universe,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
an infinitely big universe,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
with randomly bumping into each other particles,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and then they relax back.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
But there will also be large fluctuations.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Occasionally, you will make a planet

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
or a star or a galaxy

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
or a hundred billion galaxies.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
So Boltzmann says,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
we will only live in the part of the multiverse,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
where life is possible.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
That's the region where entropy is low.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Maybe our universe is just one of those things

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
that happens from time to time.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
Now your homework assignment

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
is to really think about this, to contemplate what it means.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
Carl Sagan once famously said

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
that "in order to make an apple pie,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
you must first invent the universe."

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
But he was not right.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
In Boltzmann's scenario, if you want to make an apple pie,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
you just wait for the random motion of atoms

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
to make you an apple pie.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
That will happen much more frequently

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
than the random motions of atoms

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
making you an apple orchard

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
and some sugar and an oven,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
and then making you an apple pie.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
So this scenario makes predictions.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And the predictions are

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
that the fluctuations that make us are minimal.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
Even if you imagine that this room we are in now

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
exists and is real and here we are,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and we have, not only our memories,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
but our impression that outside there's something

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.260
called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
than for them actually to randomly fluctuate

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
into Caltech, the United States and the galaxy.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
The good news is that,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
therefore, this scenario does not work; it is not right.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
Even if you left our galaxy out,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
And Feynman also understood this.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.260
Feynman says, "From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
all the predictions are that

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
we will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we've just looked at --

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
high entropy.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
If our order were due to a fluctuation,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.260
We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation."

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
So that's good. The question is then what is the right answer?

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
If the universe is not a fluctuation,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
why did the early universe have a low entropy?

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
And I would love to tell you the answer, but I'm running out of time.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
(Laughter)

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
Here is the universe that we tell you about,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
versus the universe that really exists.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
I just showed you this picture.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
It's cooling off.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
But we now know enough about the future of the universe

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
to say a lot more.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
If the dark energy remains around,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel, they will stop burning.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
They will fall into black holes.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
We will live in a universe

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
with nothing in it but black holes.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.260
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years --

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
a lot longer than our little universe has lived.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
The future is much longer than the past.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
But even black holes don't last forever.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
They will evaporate,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
and we will be left with nothing but empty space.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.260
That empty space lasts essentially forever.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
However, you notice, since empty space gives off radiation,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
there's actually thermal fluctuations,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
and it cycles around

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
all the different possible combinations

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
So even though the universe lasts forever,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
there's only a finite number of things

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
that can possibly happen in the universe.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
They all happen over a period of time

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
So here's two questions for you.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Number one: If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
why are we born

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
in the first 14 billion years of it,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
in the warm, comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang?

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
Why aren't we in empty space?

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
You might say, "Well there's nothing there to be living,"

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
but that's not right.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Why aren't you?

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
More homework assignment for you.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
So like I said, I don't actually know the answer.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
I'm going to give you my favorite scenario.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
Either it's just like that. There is no explanation.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
This is a brute fact about the universe

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
Or maybe the Big Bang

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
is not the beginning of the universe.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
An egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
and yet, when we open our refrigerator,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
we do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator."

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
That's because an egg is not a closed system;

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
it comes out of a chicken.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.260
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Maybe there is something that naturally,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
through the growth of the laws of physics,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
gives rise to universe like ours

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
in low entropy configurations.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
If that's true, it would happen more than once;

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
we would be part of a much bigger multiverse.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
That's my favorite scenario.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
My bold speculation

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
And 50 years from now,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
by the scientific and external communities.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
We will all believe that our little universe

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
is just a small part of a much larger multiverse.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
And even better, we will understand what happened at the Big Bang

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
in terms of a theory

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
that we will be able to compare to observations.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
This is a prediction. I might be wrong.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
But we've been thinking as a human race

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
about what the universe was like,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
why it came to be in the way it did for many, many years.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
It's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Thank you.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
(Applause)
