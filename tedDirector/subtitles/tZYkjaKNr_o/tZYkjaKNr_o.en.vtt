00:00:12.577 --> 00:00:14.432
Almost two years ago,

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:16.823
I was driving in my car in Germany,

00:00:16.823 --> 00:00:19.339
and I turned on the radio.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.546
Europe at the time was in the middle

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:22.989
of the Euro crisis,

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.235
and all the headlines were about European countries

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:30.076
getting downgraded by rating agencies

00:00:30.076 --> 00:00:31.930
in the United States.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.039
I listened and thought to myself,

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.111
"What are these rating agencies,

00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:39.564
and why is everybody so upset about their work?"

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:41.616
Well, if you were sitting

00:00:41.616 --> 00:00:43.377
next to me in the car that day

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:45.939
and would have told me that I would devote

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:49.183
the next years to trying to reform them,

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:53.131
obviously I would have called you crazy.

00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:55.033
But guess what's really crazy:

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:58.062
the way these rating agencies are run.

00:00:58.062 --> 00:00:59.705
And I would like to explain to you

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:01.806
not only why it's time to change this,

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:04.984
but also how we can do it.

00:01:04.984 --> 00:01:06.638
So let me tell you a little bit

00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:10.216
about what rating agencies really do.

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.600
As you would read a car magazine

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.402
before purchasing a new car

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:16.494
or taking a look at a product review

00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:20.371
before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get,

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.571
investors are reading ratings

00:01:22.571 --> 00:01:25.884
before they decide in which kind of product

00:01:25.884 --> 00:01:27.972
they are investing their money.

00:01:27.972 --> 00:01:30.783
A rating can range from a so-called AAA,

00:01:30.783 --> 00:01:33.726
which means it's a top-performing product,

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.253
and it can go down to the level

00:01:36.253 --> 00:01:39.267
of the so-called BBB-,

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:42.692
which means it's a fairly risky investment.

00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:45.253
Rating agencies are rating companies.

00:01:45.253 --> 00:01:46.503
They are rating banks.

00:01:46.503 --> 00:01:48.867
They are rating even financial products

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:51.942
like the infamous mortgage-backed securities.

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:54.019
But they can also rate countries,

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:56.767
and these ratings are called sovereign ratings,

00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:59.124
and I would like to focus in particular

00:01:59.124 --> 00:02:01.750
on these sovereign ratings.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.156
And I can tell, as you're listening to me right now,

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:05.615
you're thinking,

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:08.223
so why should I really care about this, right?

00:02:08.223 --> 00:02:09.808
Be honest.

00:02:09.808 --> 00:02:12.097
Well, ratings affect you.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:14.259
They affect all of us.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.564
If a rating agency rates a country,

00:02:17.564 --> 00:02:20.839
it basically assesses and evaluates

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.240
a country's debt

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.589
and the ability and willingness of a country

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:26.930
to repay its debt.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.863
So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency,

00:02:29.863 --> 00:02:31.940
the country has to pay more

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.547
in order to borrow money

00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:35.108
on the international markets.

00:02:35.108 --> 00:02:37.909
So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer,

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.272
because you and your fellow countrymen

00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:44.062
have to pony up more in order to borrow.

00:02:44.062 --> 00:02:46.878
But what if a country can't afford to pay more

00:02:46.878 --> 00:02:49.715
because it's maybe too expensive?

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:52.650
Well, then the country has less available

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.312
for other services, like roads, schools, healthcare.

00:02:56.312 --> 00:02:58.751
And this is the reason why you should care,

00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:01.797
because sovereign ratings affect everyone.

00:03:01.797 --> 00:03:03.458
And that is the reason why I believe

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:06.414
they should be defined as public goods.

00:03:06.414 --> 00:03:09.225
They should be transparent, accessible,

00:03:09.226 --> 00:03:13.807
and available to everyone at no cost.

00:03:13.807 --> 00:03:15.853
But here's the situation:

00:03:15.853 --> 00:03:17.997
the rating agency market is dominated

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.970
by three players and three players only --

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.749
Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch --

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.706
and we know whenever there
is a market concentration,

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.505
there is really no competition.

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:30.782
There is no incentive to improve

00:03:30.782 --> 00:03:33.099
the quality of your product.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.348
And let's face it, the credit rating 
agencies have contributed,

00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:40.193
putting the global economy on the brink,

00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:43.978
and yet they have to change the way they operate.

00:03:43.978 --> 00:03:45.851
The second point,

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.873
would you really buy a car

00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:51.359
just based on the advice of the dealer?

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.372
Obviously not, right? That would be irresponsible.

00:03:54.372 --> 00:03:56.965
But that's actually what's going on

00:03:56.965 --> 00:04:00.843
in the rating agency sector every single day.

00:04:00.843 --> 00:04:03.592
The customers of these rating agencies,

00:04:03.592 --> 00:04:06.079
like countries or companies,

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.505
they are paying for their own ratings,

00:04:08.505 --> 00:04:10.503
and obviously this is creating

00:04:10.503 --> 00:04:13.374
a conflict of interest.

00:04:13.374 --> 00:04:15.890
The third point is,

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.805
the rating agencies are not really telling us

00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:21.443
how they are coming up with their ratings,

00:04:21.443 --> 00:04:23.283
but in this day and age,

00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:25.159
you can't even sell a candy bar

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.207
without listing everything that's inside.

00:04:28.207 --> 00:04:31.891
But for ratings, a crucial element of our economy,

00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:33.560
we really do not know

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.042
what all the different ingredients are.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:37.988
We are allowing the rating agencies

00:04:37.988 --> 00:04:40.690
to be intransparent about their work,

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.752
and we need to change this.

00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:45.232
I think there is no doubt that the sector

00:04:45.232 --> 00:04:46.949
needs a complete overhaul,

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.459
not just a trimming at the margins.

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:51.682
I think it's time for a bold move.

00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:54.798
I think it's time to upgrade the system.

00:04:54.798 --> 00:04:57.360
And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.182
have invested a lot of time and effort

00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:03.913
thinking about an alternative for the sector.

00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:06.512
And we have developed the first model

00:05:06.512 --> 00:05:11.670
for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.126
and we call it by its acronym, INCRA.

00:05:16.126 --> 00:05:17.524
INCRA would make a difference

00:05:17.524 --> 00:05:19.951
to the current system

00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:24.153
by adding another nonprofit player to the mix.

00:05:24.153 --> 00:05:27.602
It would be based on a nonprofit model

00:05:27.602 --> 00:05:31.246
that would be based on a sustainable endowment.

00:05:31.246 --> 00:05:33.370
The endowment would create income

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.787
that would allow us to run the operation,

00:05:35.787 --> 00:05:37.489
to run the rating agency,

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:39.539
and it would also allow us

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.224
to make our ratings publicly available.

00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:45.927
But this is not enough to make a difference, right?

00:05:45.927 --> 00:05:47.800
INCRA would also be based on

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.378
a very, very clear governance structure

00:05:50.378 --> 00:05:53.300
that would avoid any conflict of interest,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.169
and it would include many stakeholders from society.

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.718
INCRA would not only be a European

00:06:00.718 --> 00:06:02.849
or an American rating agency,

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.213
it would be a truly international one,

00:06:05.213 --> 00:06:08.330
in which, in particular, the emerging economies

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.454
would have an equal interest, 
voice and representation.

00:06:13.454 --> 00:06:16.884
The second big difference that INCRA would make is

00:06:16.884 --> 00:06:19.862
that would it base its sovereign risk assessment

00:06:19.862 --> 00:06:22.558
on a broader set of indicators.

00:06:22.558 --> 00:06:24.459
Think about it that way.

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:26.303
If we conduct a sovereign rating,

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:27.920
we basically take a look at

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.587
the economic soil of a country,

00:06:30.587 --> 00:06:33.172
its macroeconomic fundamentals.

00:06:33.172 --> 00:06:35.350
But we also have to ask the question,

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.251
who is cultivating the economic soil

00:06:38.266 --> 00:06:40.186
of a country, right?

00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:42.346
Well, a country has many gardeners,

00:06:42.346 --> 00:06:44.164
and one of them is the government,

00:06:44.164 --> 00:06:46.209
so we have to ask the question,

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:47.523
how is a country governed?

00:06:47.523 --> 00:06:49.109
How is it managed?

00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:51.279
And this is the reason why we have developed

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.370
what we call forward-looking indicators.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.037
These are indicators that give you

00:06:56.037 --> 00:06:57.544
a much better read about

00:06:57.544 --> 00:07:01.095
the socioeconomic development of a country.

00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:03.853
I hope you would agree it's important for you to know

00:07:03.853 --> 00:07:11.021
if your government is willing to invest 
in renewable energy and education.

00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:12.759
It's important for you to know

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.762
if the government of your country

00:07:14.762 --> 00:07:16.724
is able to manage a crisis,

00:07:16.724 --> 00:07:19.705
if the government is finally able to implement

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:23.433
the reforms that it's promised.

00:07:23.433 --> 00:07:25.300
For example, if INCRA would rate

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.254
South Africa right now,

00:07:27.254 --> 00:07:30.711
of course we would take a very, very close look

00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:33.011
at the youth unemployment of the country,

00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:35.549
the highest in the world.

00:07:35.549 --> 00:07:38.993
If over 70 percent of a country's population

00:07:38.993 --> 00:07:42.584
under the age of 35 is unemployed,

00:07:42.584 --> 00:07:45.680
of course this has a huge impact on the economy

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.974
today and even more so in the future.

00:07:49.974 --> 00:07:52.249
Well, our friends at Moody's,

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:54.572
Standard &amp; Poor's, and Fitch will tell us

00:07:54.572 --> 00:07:57.605
we would take this into account as well.

00:07:57.605 --> 00:07:59.554
But guess what? We do not know

00:07:59.554 --> 00:08:02.571
exactly how they will take this into account.

00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:04.922
And this leads me to the third big difference

00:08:04.922 --> 00:08:06.626
that INCRA would make.

00:08:06.626 --> 00:08:09.420
INCRA would not only release its ratings

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.391
but it would also release its indicators

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.053
and methodology.

00:08:14.053 --> 00:08:16.616
So in contrast to the current system,

00:08:16.616 --> 00:08:20.131
INCRA would be fully transparent.

00:08:20.131 --> 00:08:21.970
So in a nutshell,

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.172
INCRA would offer an alternative

00:08:24.172 --> 00:08:27.598
to the current system of
the big three rating agencies

00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:31.563
by adding a new, nonprofit player to the mix

00:08:31.563 --> 00:08:33.967
that would increase the competition,

00:08:33.967 --> 00:08:36.530
it would increase the transparency of the sector,

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.335
and it would also increase the quality.

00:08:39.335 --> 00:08:41.303
I can tell that sovereign ratings

00:08:41.303 --> 00:08:44.527
may still look to you like this very small piece

00:08:44.527 --> 00:08:48.802
of this very complex global financial world,

00:08:48.802 --> 00:08:51.242
but I tell you it's a very important one,

00:08:51.242 --> 00:08:53.684
and a very important one to fix,

00:08:53.684 --> 00:08:56.827
because sovereign ratings affect all of us,

00:08:56.827 --> 00:09:00.365
and they should be addressed and should be defined

00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:01.825
as public goods.

00:09:01.825 --> 00:09:04.709
And this is why we are testing our model right now,

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:07.636
and why we are trying to find out if it can

00:09:07.636 --> 00:09:10.839
bring together a group of able and willing actors

00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:13.489
to bring INCRA to life.

00:09:13.489 --> 00:09:16.100
I truly believe building up INCRA

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.491
is in everyone's interest,

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:22.061
and that we have the unique opportunity right now

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:24.630
to turn INCRA into a cornerstone

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.025
of a new, more inclusive financial system.

00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:31.593
Because for way too long,

00:09:31.593 --> 00:09:35.285
we have left the big financial players on their own.

00:09:35.285 --> 00:09:38.081
It's time to give them some company.

00:09:38.081 --> 00:09:40.115
Thank you.

00:09:40.115 --> 00:09:44.115
(Applause)
