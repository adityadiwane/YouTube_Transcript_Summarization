00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Thank you. I have two missions here today.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.260
The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And, secondly, to convince you

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
(Laughter)

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
It carries male sex cells

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
from one flower to another.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
This gives us genetic diversity,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.260
That's probably true of humans as well, mostly.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Each anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
so, it's quite prolific stuff.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And it isn't just bright flowers

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.260
that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
The little hole in the middle, we'll come to a bit later,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
but that's for the pollen tube

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
to come out later on. A very tiny tube.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
So, that's 20 micrometers across,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
that pollen grain there.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
That's about a 50th of a millimeter.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
But not all pollen is quite so simple looking.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
This is Morina. This is a plant --

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
which I've always thought to be rather tedious --

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
named after Morin,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
who was an enterprising French gardener,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
who issued the first seed catalog

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
in 1621.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
But anyway, take a look at its pollen.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
This is amazing, I think.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and when the pollen finds its special female spot

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
in another Morina flower,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
just on the right species, what happens?

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Like I said, pollen carries the male sex cells.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
they have rampant, promiscuous

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and really quite interesting and curious sex. Really.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.260
(Laughter) A lot.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
My story is actually not about plant propagation,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
but about pollen itself.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
"So, what are pollen's properties?" I hear you ask.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
First of all, pollen is tiny. Yes we know that.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
It's also very biologically active,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
as anyone with hay fever will understand.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Now, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed --

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
like trees and grasses and so on --

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
tend to cause the most hay fever.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
masses and masses of pollen to have any chance

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.260
of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Here are some examples --

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
they're very smooth if you look at them --

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Again -- this time, sycamore -- wind-dispersed.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So, trees: very boring flowers,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
not really trying to attract insects.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Cool pollen, though.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
This one I particularly like.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
This is the Monterey Pine, which has little air sacks

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
to make the pollen carry even further.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Remember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Now, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
This is a bee's leg

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.260
with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And this is the outrageous and beautiful

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
flower of the mangrove palm.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Very showy, to attract lots of insects to do its bidding.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
The pollen has little barbs on it,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
if we look.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Now, those little barbs

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
obviously stick to the insects well,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
across what would be the equator of this, if it was the Earth.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
That tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
And I'm rather proud to say

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
that this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
London was full of mangroves.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Isn't that cool?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
(Laughter)

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Okay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
You can tell that from the little barbs on there.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
No coincidence that these were taken

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
by Rob Kesseler, who is an artist,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.260
like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
(Laughter)

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Now, all this diversity

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
means that you can look at a pollen grain

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
and tell what species it came from,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and that's actually quite handy if you

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
So, different species of plants

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
grow in different places,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and some pollen carries further than others.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
So, if you have a pollen sample,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
then in principle, you should be able to tell

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
where that sample came from.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And this is where it gets interesting for forensics.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Pollen is tiny. It gets on to things, and it sticks to them.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
So, not only does each type of pollen look different,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.260
but each habitat has a different combination of plants.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
A different pollen signature, if you like,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
or a different pollen fingerprint.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
By looking at the proportions and combinations

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
of different kinds of pollen in a sample,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
you can tell very precisely where it came from.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
similar to the one that I'm wearing now.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Now, much of the pollen will still be there

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
after repeated washings.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Where has it been?

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Four very different habitats might look similar,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
but they've got very different pollen signatures.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Actually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
in different countries.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
But pollen forensics can be very subtle.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
It's being used now to track

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
where counterfeit drugs have been made,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
where banknotes have come from,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
to look at the provenance of antiques

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and see that they really did come from the place

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
the seller said they did.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And murder suspects have been tracked

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
using their clothing,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
certainly in the U.K., to within an area

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
to find the murder victim.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
So, you can tell from a piece of clothing

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.260
to within about a kilometer or so,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
where that piece of clothing has been recently

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
and then send in dogs.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And finally, in a rather grizzly way,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
the Bosnia war crimes;

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
because of the evidence from pollen,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
which showed that bodies had been buried,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.260
exhumed and then reburied somewhere else.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
I hope I've opened your eyes,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
if you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter)

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
to some of pollen's secrets.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
This is a horse chestnut.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
There is an invisible beauty all around us,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
each grain with a story to tell ...

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
each of us, in fact, with a story to tell

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Thank you to the colleagues at Kew,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and thank you to palynologists everywhere.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.260
(Applause)
