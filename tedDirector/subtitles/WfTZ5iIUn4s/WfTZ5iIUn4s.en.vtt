00:00:12.624 --> 00:00:16.672
It is said that the grass is always greener

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:19.726
on the other side of the fence,

00:00:19.726 --> 00:00:22.872
and I believe this is true,

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:25.456
especially when I hear President Obama

00:00:25.456 --> 00:00:27.954
often talk about the Korean education system

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:31.465
as a benchmark of success.

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:33.862
Well, I can tell you that,

00:00:33.862 --> 00:00:37.409
in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.600
of the Korean school system,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.934
also known as pressure cooker,

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:47.593
not everyone can do well in that environment.

00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:50.218
While many people responded in different ways

00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:53.218
about our education system,

00:00:53.218 --> 00:00:56.594
my response to the high-pressure environment

00:00:56.594 --> 00:00:59.524
was making bows with pieces of wood

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:02.268
found near my apartment building.

00:01:02.268 --> 00:01:04.788
Why bows?

00:01:04.788 --> 00:01:07.539
I'm not quite sure.

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.484
Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure,

00:01:11.484 --> 00:01:13.731
my caveman instinct of survival

00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:18.053
has connected with the bows.

00:01:18.053 --> 00:01:19.787
If you think about it,

00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:23.200
the bow has really helped drive human survival

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.925
since prehistoric times.

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:29.192
The area within three kilometers of my home

00:01:29.192 --> 00:01:31.375
used to be a mulberry forest

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:33.665
during the Joseon dynasty,

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:38.122
where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves.

00:01:38.122 --> 00:01:42.828
In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact,

00:01:42.828 --> 00:01:47.163
the government has planted mulberry trees.

00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:48.941
The seeds from these trees

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.740
also have spread by birds here and there

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.218
nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway

00:01:55.218 --> 00:01:59.584
that has been built around the 1988 Olympics.

00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:02.085
The area near these walls,

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:05.065
which nobody bothers to pay attention to,

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:08.259
had been left free from major intervention,

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.159
and this is where I first found my treasures.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.360
As I fell deeper into bow making,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.571
I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood.

00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:23.689
When I went on school field trips,

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.913
family vacations, or simply on my way home

00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:29.763
from extracurricular classes,

00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:31.862
I wandered around wooded areas

00:02:31.862 --> 00:02:33.601
and gathered tree branches

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:37.572
with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag.

00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:41.273
And they would be somethings like saws, knives,

00:02:41.273 --> 00:02:43.519
sickles and axes

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.207
that I covered up with a piece of towel.

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:50.088
I would bring the branches home,

00:02:50.088 --> 00:02:52.077
riding buses and subways,

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:55.466
barely holding them in my hands.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:59.342
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach.

00:02:59.342 --> 00:03:00.898
Airport security.

00:03:00.898 --> 00:03:02.978
(Laughter)

00:03:02.978 --> 00:03:06.697
In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust,

00:03:06.697 --> 00:03:10.751
I would saw, trim and polish wood all night long

00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.218
until a bow took shape.

00:03:13.218 --> 00:03:17.713
One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece

00:03:17.713 --> 00:03:22.468
and ended up setting the place on fire.

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:27.257
Where? The rooftop of my apartment building,

00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:30.897
a place where 96 families call home.

00:03:30.897 --> 00:03:33.488
A customer from a department store across from my building

00:03:33.488 --> 00:03:34.978
called 911,

00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:37.025
and I ran downstairs to tell my mom

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:42.242
with half of my hair burned.

00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:44.370
I want to take this opportunity

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.074
to tell my mom, in the audience today:

00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:50.415
Mom, I was really sorry,

00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:54.061
and I will be more careful with open fire from now on.

00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:56.695
My mother had to do a lot of explaining,

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:59.024
telling people that her son did not commit

00:03:59.024 --> 00:04:02.483
a premeditated arson.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.405
I also researched extensively on bows around the world.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.466
In that process, I tried to combine

00:04:11.466 --> 00:04:13.907
the different bows from across time and places

00:04:13.907 --> 00:04:17.690
to create the most effective bow.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.043
I also worked with many different types of wood,

00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:23.231
such as maple, yew and mulberry,

00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.171
and did many shooting experiments

00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:27.670
in the wooded area near the urban expressway

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.505
that I mentioned before.

00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:32.530
The most effective bow for me

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.297
would be like this.

00:04:35.297 --> 00:04:39.510
One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.041
when you draw and shoot the arrow.

00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:47.938
Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight,

00:04:47.938 --> 00:04:51.599
which means more power.

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.911
Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb

00:04:55.911 --> 00:04:58.816
for maximum tension storage.

00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:07.055
And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.

00:05:07.055 --> 00:05:10.053
After fixing, breaking, redesigning,

00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:12.984
mending, bending and amending,

00:05:12.984 --> 00:05:16.291
my ideal bow began to take shape,

00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:20.146
and when it was finally done,

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:23.600
it looked like this.

00:05:24.673 --> 00:05:26.910
I was so proud of myself

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.984
for inventing a perfect bow on my own.

00:05:32.984 --> 00:05:36.416
This is a picture of Korean traditional bows

00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:38.312
taken from a museum,

00:05:38.312 --> 00:05:43.796
and see how my bow resembles them.

00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:45.362
Thanks to my ancestors

00:05:45.362 --> 00:05:50.653
for robbing me of my invention. (Laughter)

00:05:51.542 --> 00:05:53.394
Through bowmaking,

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:56.455
I came in contact with part of my heritage.

00:05:56.455 --> 00:06:00.018
Learning the information that has accumulated over time

00:06:00.018 --> 00:06:02.856
and reading the message left by my ancestors

00:06:02.856 --> 00:06:05.455
were better than any consolation therapy

00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:10.404
or piece of advice any living adults could give me.

00:06:10.404 --> 00:06:13.322
You see, I searched far and wide,

00:06:13.322 --> 00:06:16.798
but never bothered to look close and near.

00:06:16.798 --> 00:06:19.043
From this realization,

00:06:19.043 --> 00:06:21.864
I began to take interest in Korean history,

00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:25.261
which had never inspired me before.

00:06:25.261 --> 00:06:28.637
In the end, the grass is often greener

00:06:28.637 --> 00:06:30.427
on my side of the fence,

00:06:30.427 --> 00:06:33.604
although we don't realize it.

00:06:33.604 --> 00:06:38.355
Now, I am going to show you how my bow works.

00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:41.476
And let's see how this one works.

00:06:43.568 --> 00:06:45.705
This is a bamboo bow,

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:49.637
with 45-pound draw weights.

00:06:49.637 --> 00:06:51.821
(Noise of shooting arrow)

00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:56.779
(Applause)

00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:04.694
A bow may function in a simple mechanism,

00:07:04.694 --> 00:07:07.245
but in order to make a good bow,

00:07:07.245 --> 00:07:11.257
a great amount of sensitivity is required.

00:07:11.257 --> 00:07:13.787
You need to console and communicate

00:07:13.787 --> 00:07:16.533
with the wood material.

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:18.225
Each fiber in the wood

00:07:18.225 --> 00:07:21.051
has its own reason and function for being,

00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:24.446
and only through cooperation and harmony among them

00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:28.043
comes a great bow.

00:07:28.043 --> 00:07:29.833
I may be an [odd] student

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:32.024
with unconventional interests,

00:07:32.024 --> 00:07:34.966
but I hope I am making a contribution

00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:38.855
by sharing my story with all of you.

00:07:38.855 --> 00:07:41.108
My ideal world is a place

00:07:41.108 --> 00:07:43.321
where no one is left behind,

00:07:43.321 --> 00:07:46.614
where everyone is needed exactly where they are,

00:07:46.614 --> 00:07:50.210
like the fibers and the tendons in a bow,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.479
a place where the strong is flexible

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:57.272
and the vulnerable is resilient.

00:07:57.272 --> 00:07:58.923
The bow resembles me,

00:07:58.923 --> 00:08:01.971
and I resemble the bow.

00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:06.835
Now, I am shooting a part of myself to you.

00:08:06.835 --> 00:08:09.585
No, better yet, a part of my mind

00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:12.424
has just been shot over to your mind.

00:08:12.424 --> 00:08:14.668
Did it strike you?

00:08:14.668 --> 00:08:16.208
Thank you.

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:21.870
(Applause)
