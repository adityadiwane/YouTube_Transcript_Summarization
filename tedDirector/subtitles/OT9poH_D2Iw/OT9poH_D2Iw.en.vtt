00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
We are here today

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
because [the] United Nations

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
have defined goals

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
for the progress of countries.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
They're called Millennium Development Goals.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And the reason I really like these goals

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
is that there are eight of them.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
And by specifying eight different goals,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
the United Nations has said

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
that there are so many things needed

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
to change in a country

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
in order to get the good life for people.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Look here -- you have to end poverty,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
education, gender,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
child and maternal health,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
control infections, protect the environment

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and get the good global links between nations

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
in every aspect

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
from aid to trade.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
There's a second reason I like these development goals,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and that is because each and every one is measured.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Take child mortality;

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
the aim here is to reduce child mortality

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
by two-thirds,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
from 1990 to 2015.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
That's a four percent reduction per year --

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and this, with measuring.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
That's what makes the difference

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
between political talking like this

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and really going for the important thing,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
a better life for people.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And what I'm so happy about with this

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
is that we have already documented

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
that there are many countries

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
in Asia, in the Middle East,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
in Latin America and East Europe

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
that [are] reducing with this rate.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and Turkey with seven percent per year.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
So there's good news.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
But then I hear people saying, "There is no progress in Africa.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
And there's not even statistics on Africa

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
to know what is happening."

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
I'll prove them wrong on both points.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
I bring you to the webpage, ChildMortality.org,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
where you can take deaths in children

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
below five years of age for all countries --

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
it's done by U.N. specialists.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
And I will take Kenya as an example.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Here you see the data.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Don't panic -- don't panic now, I'll help you through this.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
It looks nasty, like in college

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
when you didn't like statistics.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
But first thing, when you see dots like this,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
you have to ask yourself:

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
from where do the data come?

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
What is the origin of the data?

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Is it so that in Kenya,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
there are doctors and other specialists

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
who write the death certificate at the death of the child

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and it's sent to the statistical office?

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
No -- low-income countries like Kenya

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
still don't have that level of organization.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
It exists, but it's not complete

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
because so many deaths occur in the home

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
with the family,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and it's not registered.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
What we rely on is not an incomplete system.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
We have interviews, we have surveys.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And this is highly professional

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
female interviewers

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
who sit down for one hour with a woman

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
and ask her about [her] birth history.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
How many children did you have?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Are they alive?

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
If they died, at what age and what year?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And then this is done in a representative sample

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
of thousands of women in the country

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and put together in what used to be called

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
a demographic health survey report.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
But these surveys are costly,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
so they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
But they have good quality.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
So this is a limitation.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And all these colored lines here are results;

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
each color is one survey.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
But that's too complicated for today, so I'll simplify it for you,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and I give you one average point for each survey.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
This was 1977, 1988,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
1992, '97

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and 2002.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And when the experts in the U.N.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
have got these surveys in place in their database,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
then they use advanced mathematical formulas

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
to produce a trend line, and the trend line looks like this.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
See here -- it's the best fit they can get of this point.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
But watch out --

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
they continue the line

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
beyond the last point

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
out into nothing.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And they estimated that in 2008,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Kenya had per child mortality of 128.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And I was sad,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
because we could see

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
this reversal in Kenya

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
with an increased child mortality in the 90s.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
It was so tragic.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
But in June, I got a mail in my inbox

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
from Demographic Health Surveys,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
and it showed good news from Kenya.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
I was so happy.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
This was the estimate of the new survey.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Then it just took another three months

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
for [the] U.N. to get it into their server,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and on Friday we got the new trend line --

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
it was down here.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Isn't it nice -- isn't it nice, yeah?

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
I was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
and I saw the death rate fall

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
from 128 to 84 just that morning.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
So we celebrated.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
But now, when you have this trend line,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
how do we measure progress?

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
I'm going into some details here,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
because [the] U.N. do it like this.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
They start [in] 1990 -- they measure to 2009.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
They say, "0.9 percent, no progress."

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
That's unfair.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
As a professor, I think I have the right to propose something differently.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
I would say, at least do this --

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
10 years is enough to follow the trend.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
It's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
They have 2.4 percent.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
I may have joined these two points.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
So what I'm telling you

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
is that we know the child mortality.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
We have a decent trend.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
It's coming into some tricky things then

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
when we are measuring MDGs.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And the reason here for Africa is especially important,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
because '90s was a bad decade,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
not only in Kenya, but across Africa.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
The HIV epidemic peaked.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
There was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
We got, later, the mosquito netting.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And there was socio-economic problems,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
which are now being solved at a much better scale.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
So look at the average here --

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
And [the] U.N. says

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
it's a reduction with 1.8 percent.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Now this sounds a little theoretical,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
but it's not so theoretical.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
You know, these economists,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
they love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
We in public health, we hate child death,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
so we want less and less and less of child deaths.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
So we calculate the percent reduction per year,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
but it's sort of the same percentage.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
If your economy grows with four percent,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
you ought to reduce child mortality four percent;

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
if it's used well and people are really involved

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years?

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
An economist would never do that.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
I have just divided it into two periods.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
In the 90s, only 1.2 percent,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
only 1.2 percent.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Whereas now, second gear --

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
it's like Africa had first gear,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
now they go into second gear.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
But even this

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
is not a fair representation of Africa,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
because it's an average,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
it's an average speed of reduction in Africa.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
Still here,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
child death per 1,000 on that axis.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
Here we have [the] year.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
I start 50 years ago

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
when Africa celebrated independence in most countries.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
I give you Congo, which was high,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
Ghana -- lower. And Kenya -- even lower.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And what has happened over the years since then? Here we go.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
You can see, with independence, literacy improved

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
and vaccinations started, smallpox was eradicated,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
hygiene was improved, and things got better.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
But then, in the '80s, watch out here.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Congo got into civil war,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and they leveled off here.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Ghana got very ahead, fast.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
This was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
but then Kenya and Ghana go down together --

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
still a standstill in Congo.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
That's where we are today.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
You can see it doesn't make sense

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
to make an average of this zero improvement

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
and this very fast improvement.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Time has come

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.260
to stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
Their countries are so different,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and they merit to be recognized in the same way,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
as we don't talk about Europe as one place.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
everyone knows that.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And they are judged, each country, on how they are doing.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
So let me show the wider picture.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
My country, Sweden:

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
1800, we were up there.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
What a strange personality disorder we must have,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
But we had that habit in Sweden, you know,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
that we counted all the child deaths,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
even if we didn't do anything about it.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
And then, you see, these were famine years.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
These were bad years, and people got fed up with Sweden.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
My ancestors moved to the United States.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
And eventually, soon they started to get better and better here.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
And here we got better education, and we got health service,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
and child mortality came down.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
We never had a war; Sweden was in peace all this time.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
But look, the rate of lowering

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
in Sweden

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
was not fast.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Sweden achieved a low child mortality

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
because we started early.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
We had primary school actually

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
started in 1842.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
And then you get that wonderful effect

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
when we got female literacy

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
one generation later.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
You have to realize that the investments we do in progress

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
are long-term investments.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
It's not about just five years --

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
it's long-term investments.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And Sweden never reached [the] Millennium Development Goal rate,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
3.1 percent when I calculated.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
So we are off track -- that's what Sweden is.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
But you don't talk about it so much.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
We want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Let me show you Thailand,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
see what a success story, Thailand from the 1960s --

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
how they went down here

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
And I'll give you another story -- Egypt,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
the most hidden, glorious success in public health.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
Egypt was up here in 1960,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
higher than Congo.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
The Nile Delta was a misery for children

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
with diarrheal disease

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and malaria and a lot of problems.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
they increased education

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
and they got primary health care.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And down they went, you know.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And they got safer water, they eradicated malaria.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
And isn't it a success story.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
is fully possible.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
And the good thing is

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
that Ghana today is going with the same rate

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
as Egypt did at its fastest.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Kenya is now speeding up.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Here we have a problem.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Now, let me now bring you to a wider picture,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
a wider picture of child mortality.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
I'm going to show you the relationship

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
between child mortality on this axis here --

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
this axis here is child mortality --

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and here I have the family size.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
The relationship between child mortality and family size.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
One, two, three, four children per woman:

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
six, seven, eight children per woman.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
This is, once again, 1960 --

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
50 years ago.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
Each bubble is a country --

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
the color, you can see, a continent.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
And the size of the bubble is the population.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
And these are

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
the so-called "developing" countries.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
They had high, or very high, child mortality

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and family size, six to eight.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
And the ones over there,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
they were so-called Western countries.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
They had low child mortality

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
and small families.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
What has happened?

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
What I want you [to do] now is to see with your own eyes

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
the relation between fall in child mortality

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and decrease in family size.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
I just want not to have any room for doubt --

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
you have to see that for yourself.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
This is what happened. Now I start the world.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Here we come down with the eradication of

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
smallpox, better education,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
health service.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
It got down there -- China comes into the Western box here.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
And here Brazil is in the Western Box.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
and we get a lot a new neighbors.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Welcome to a decent life.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
Come on. We want everyone down there.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
This is the vision we have, isn't it.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
And look now, the first African countries here are coming in.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
There we are today.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
There is no such thing

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
as a "Western world" and "developing world."

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
This is the report from [the] U.N.,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
which came out on Friday.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
It's very good -- "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality" --

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
except this page.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
This page is very bad;

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
it's a categorization of countries.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
It labels "developing countries," -- I can read from the list here --

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
developing countries: Republic of Korea -- South Korea.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Huh?

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
They get Samsung, how can they be [a] developing country?

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
They have here Singapore.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
They have the lowest child mortality in the world, Singapore.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
They bypassed Sweden five years ago,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
and they are labeled a developing country.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
They have here Qatar.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
How the heck could they be [a] developing country?

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
This is crap.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
(Applause)

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
The rest here is good -- the rest is good.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
We have to have a modern concept,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
which fits to the data.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
And we have to realize

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
that we are all going to into this, down to here.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
What is the importance now with the relations here.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
Look -- even if we look in Africa --

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
these are the African countries.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
and decreasing family size,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
even within Africa.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
It's very clear that this is what happens.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
And a very important piece of research came out on Friday

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.260
from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
showing that almost 50 percent

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
of the fall in child mortality

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
can be attributed to female education.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
That is, when we get girls in school,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
which is a secular trend which is very strong.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
That's why we must have that long-term perspective,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
but we must measure the impact

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
over 10-year periods.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
It's fully possible

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
to get child mortality down in all of these countries

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
and to get them down in the corner

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
where we all would like to live together.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
And of course, lowering child mortality

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
is a matter of utmost importance

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
from humanitarian aspects.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
It's a decent life for children,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
we are talking about.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
But it is also a strategic investment

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
in the future of all mankind,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
because it's about the environment.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
We will not be able to manage the environment

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
and avoid the terrible climate crisis

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
if we don't stabilize the world population.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
Let's be clear about that.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
And the way to do that,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
that is to get child mortality down, get access to family planning

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and behind that drive female education.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
And that is fully possible. Let's do it.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
Thank you very much.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:27.260
(Applause)
