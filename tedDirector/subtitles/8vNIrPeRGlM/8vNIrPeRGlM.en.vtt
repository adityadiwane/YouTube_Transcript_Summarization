00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.153
Oliver was an extremely dashing,

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:21.974
handsome, charming and largely unstable male

00:00:21.974 --> 00:00:25.159
that I completely lost my heart to.

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.080
(Laughter)

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.746
He was a Bernese mountain dog,

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:32.929
and my ex-husband and I adopted him,

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:34.618
and about six months in,

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:37.182
we realized that he was a mess.

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:39.962
He had such paralyzing separation anxiety

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:41.498
that we couldn't leave him alone.

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:44.626
Once, he jumped out of our third floor apartment.

00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:49.047
He ate fabric. He ate things, recyclables.

00:00:49.047 --> 00:00:50.952
He hunted flies that didn't exist.

00:00:50.952 --> 00:00:52.681
He suffered from hallucinations.

00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:55.985
He was diagnosed with a canine compulsive disorder

00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:59.331
and that's really just the tip of the iceberg.

00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:03.432
But like with humans,

00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:06.543
sometimes it's six months in

00:01:06.543 --> 00:01:08.580
before you realize that

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.527
the person that you love has some issues.

00:01:11.527 --> 00:01:12.938
(Laughter)

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:16.872
And most of us do not take the person we're dating

00:01:16.872 --> 00:01:19.008
back to the bar where we met them

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:23.344
or give them back to the friend that introduced us,

00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:26.098
or sign them back up on Match.com.

00:01:26.098 --> 00:01:28.928
(Laughter)

00:01:28.928 --> 00:01:30.727
We love them anyway,

00:01:30.727 --> 00:01:32.723
and we stick to it,

00:01:32.723 --> 00:01:36.955
and that is what I did with my dog.

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:40.757
And I was a — I'd studied biology.

00:01:40.757 --> 00:01:43.377
I have a Ph.D. in history of science

00:01:43.377 --> 00:01:44.882
from MIT,

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:46.580
and had you asked me 10 years ago

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.989
if a dog I loved, or just dogs generally,

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:50.825
had emotions, I would have said yes,

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:52.289
but I'm not sure that I would have told you

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.587
that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder,

00:01:54.587 --> 00:01:58.678
a Prozac prescription and a therapist.

00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:02.624
But then, I fell in love, and I realized that they can,

00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:05.250
and actually trying to help my own dog

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.864
overcome his panic and his anxiety,

00:02:07.864 --> 00:02:10.227
it just changed my life.

00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:12.764
It cracked open my world.

00:02:12.764 --> 00:02:15.131
And I spent the last seven years, actually,

00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:17.730
looking into this topic of
mental illness in other animals.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.075
Can they be mentally ill like people,

00:02:19.075 --> 00:02:22.080
and if so, what does it mean about us?

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.879
And what I discovered is that I do believe

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.819
they can suffer from mental illness,

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.295
and actually looking and trying
to identify mental illness in them

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:33.377
often helps us be better friends to them

00:02:33.377 --> 00:02:37.431
and also can help us better understand ourselves.

00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:40.877
So let's talk about diagnosis for a minute.

00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:43.558
Many of us think that we can't know

00:02:43.558 --> 00:02:46.021
what another animal is thinking,

00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:47.299
and that is true,

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.891
but any of you in relationships —

00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:51.747
at least this is my case —

00:02:51.747 --> 00:02:53.547
just because you ask someone that you're with

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:55.741
or your parent or your child how they feel

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:57.551
doesn't mean that they can tell you.

00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:59.869
They may not have words to explain

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:00.932
what it is that they're feeling,

00:03:00.932 --> 00:03:02.775
and they may not know.

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:04.640
It's actually a pretty recent phenomenon

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.386
that we feel that we have to talk to someone

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.790
to understand their emotional distress.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.217
Before the early 20th century,

00:03:11.217 --> 00:03:13.737
physicians often diagnosed emotional distress

00:03:13.737 --> 00:03:17.235
in their patients just by observation.

00:03:17.235 --> 00:03:18.918
It also turns out that thinking about

00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:20.513
mental illness in other animals

00:03:20.513 --> 00:03:22.706
isn't actually that much of a stretch.

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:24.619
Most mental disorders in the United States

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.339
are fear and anxiety disorders,

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:29.308
and when you think about it, fear and anxiety

00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:33.500
are actually really extremely
helpful animal emotions.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.600
Usually we feel fear and anxiety
in situations that are dangerous,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.897
and once we feel them,

00:03:37.897 --> 00:03:39.526
we then are motivated to move away

00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:41.357
from whatever is dangerous.

00:03:41.357 --> 00:03:46.326
The problem is when we begin to feel fear
and anxiety in situations that don't call for it.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:49.536
Mood disorders, too, may actually just be

00:03:49.536 --> 00:03:53.042
the unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal,

00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:56.207
and obsessive compulsive disorders also

00:03:56.207 --> 00:03:59.616
are often manifestations of
a really healthy animal thing

00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:02.396
which is keeping yourself clean and groomed.

00:04:02.396 --> 00:04:04.544
This tips into the territory of mental illness

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:05.690
when you do things like

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.293
compulsively over-wash your hands or paws,

00:04:08.293 --> 00:04:10.359
or you develop a ritual that's so extreme

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.451
that you can't sit down to a bowl of food

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:15.443
unless you engage in that ritual.

00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:19.774
So for humans, we have the
"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,"

00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:21.901
which is basically an atlas

00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:24.634
of the currently agreed-upon mental disorders.

00:04:24.634 --> 00:04:27.885
In other animals, we have YouTube.

00:04:27.885 --> 00:04:29.491
(Laughter)

00:04:29.491 --> 00:04:32.138
This is just one search I did for "OCD dog"

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:33.926
but I encourage all of you

00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:36.877
to look at "OCD cat."

00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:40.271
You will be shocked by what you see.

00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:44.770
I'm going to show you just a couple examples.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.492
This is an example of shadow-chasing.

00:04:47.492 --> 00:04:50.568
I know, and it's funny and in some ways it's cute.

00:04:50.568 --> 00:04:54.063
The issue, though, is that dogs
can develop compulsions like this

00:04:54.063 --> 00:04:56.965
that they then engage in all day.

00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:58.237
So they won't go for a walk,

00:04:58.237 --> 00:04:59.891
they won't hang out with their friends,

00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:01.477
they won't eat.

00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:03.010
They'll develop fixations

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.127
like chasing their tails compulsively.

00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:09.528
Here's an example of a cat named Gizmo.

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:12.740
He looks like he's on a stakeout

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.054
but he does this for many, many, many hours a day.

00:05:16.054 --> 00:05:19.558
He just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw

00:05:19.558 --> 00:05:21.092
at the screen.

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:23.569
This is another example of what's considered

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.353
a stereotypic behavior.

00:05:25.353 --> 00:05:28.060
This is a sun bear at the
Oakland Zoo named Ting Ting.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.825
And if you just sort of happened upon this scene,

00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:30.776
you might think that Ting Ting

00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:32.490
is just playing with a stick,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.536
but Ting Ting does this all day,

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:36.132
and if you pay close attention

00:05:36.132 --> 00:05:39.803
and if I showed you guys
the full half-hour of this clip,

00:05:39.803 --> 00:05:41.829
you'd see that he does the exact same thing

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:43.978
in the exact same order, and he spins the stick

00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:46.328
in the exact same way every time.

00:05:46.328 --> 00:05:48.820
Other super common behaviors that you may see,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.644
particularly in captive animals,

00:05:50.644 --> 00:05:55.204
are pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies,

00:05:55.204 --> 00:05:56.880
and actually, humans do this too,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.624
and in us, we'll sway,

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:00.211
we'll move from side to side.

00:06:00.211 --> 00:06:02.482
Many of us do this, and sometimes

00:06:02.482 --> 00:06:04.028
it's an effort to soothe ourselves,

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:06.678
and I think in other animals
that is often the case too.

00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:08.364
But it's not just stereotypic behaviors

00:06:08.364 --> 00:06:10.130
that other animals engage in.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.258
This is Gigi. She's a gorilla that lives

00:06:12.258 --> 00:06:13.919
at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston.

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.127
She actually has a Harvard psychiatrist,

00:06:16.127 --> 00:06:17.849
and she's been treated for a mood disorder

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.432
among other things.

00:06:19.432 --> 00:06:22.427
Many animals develop mood disorders.

00:06:22.427 --> 00:06:23.855
Lots of creatures —

00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:25.390
this horse is just one example —

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.072
develop self-destructive behaviors.

00:06:27.072 --> 00:06:28.357
They'll gnaw on things

00:06:28.357 --> 00:06:30.503
or do other things that may also soothe them,

00:06:30.503 --> 00:06:32.201
even if they're self-destructive,

00:06:32.201 --> 00:06:33.508
which could be considered similar

00:06:33.508 --> 00:06:37.249
to the ways that some humans cut themselves.

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:38.562
Plucking.

00:06:38.562 --> 00:06:42.319
Turns out, if you have fur or feathers or skin,

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.294
you can pluck yourself compulsively,

00:06:44.294 --> 00:06:46.616
and some parrots actually have been studied

00:06:46.616 --> 00:06:49.714
to better understand trichotillomania,
or compulsive plucking in humans,

00:06:49.714 --> 00:06:51.161
something that affects

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.441
20 million Americans right now.

00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:55.509
Lab rats pluck themselves too.

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:57.742
In them, it's called barbering.

00:06:57.742 --> 00:07:00.819
Canine veterans of conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.800
are coming back with what's
considered canine PTSD,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.512
and they're having a hard time reentering civilian life

00:07:06.512 --> 00:07:07.797
when they come back from deployments.

00:07:07.797 --> 00:07:10.403
They can be too scared to
approach men with beards

00:07:10.403 --> 00:07:13.116
or to hop into cars.

00:07:13.116 --> 00:07:15.882
I want to be careful and be clear, though.

00:07:15.882 --> 00:07:18.559
I do not think that canine PTSD

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:21.360
is the same as human PTSD.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.835
But I also do not think that my PTSD

00:07:23.835 --> 00:07:24.930
is like your PTSD,

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.632
or that my anxiety or that my sadness is like yours.

00:07:28.632 --> 00:07:30.337
We are all different.

00:07:30.337 --> 00:07:33.172
We also all have very different susceptibilities.

00:07:33.172 --> 00:07:36.913
So two dogs, raised in the same household,

00:07:36.913 --> 00:07:39.260
exposed to the very same things,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.159
one may develop, say, a
debilitating fear of motorcycles,

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:45.907
or a phobia of the beep of the microwave,

00:07:45.907 --> 00:07:47.762
and another one is going to be just fine.

00:07:47.762 --> 00:07:50.595
So one thing that people ask me pretty frequently:

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.538
Is this just an instance of humans

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.167
driving other animals crazy?

00:07:54.167 --> 00:07:58.090
Or, is animal mental illness just
a result of mistreatment or abuse?

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.619
And it turns out we're actually

00:07:59.619 --> 00:08:03.174
so much more complicated than that.

00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:06.161
So one great thing that has happened to me

00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:09.410
is recently I published a book on this,

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.355
and every day now that I open my email

00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:14.809
or when I go to a reading

00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:16.921
or even when I go to a cocktail party,

00:08:16.921 --> 00:08:18.822
people tell me their stories

00:08:18.822 --> 00:08:20.576
of the animals that they have met.

00:08:20.576 --> 00:08:23.020
And recently, I did a reading in California,

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.450
and a woman raised her hand
after the talk and she said,

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.126
"Dr. Braitman, I think my cat has PTSD."

00:08:29.126 --> 00:08:32.490
And I said, "Well, why? Tell me a little bit about it."

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.909
So, Ping is her cat. She was a rescue,

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.631
and she used to live with an elderly man,

00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:40.902
and one day the man was vacuuming

00:08:40.902 --> 00:08:43.727
and he suffered a heart attack, and he died.

00:08:43.727 --> 00:08:46.661
A week later, Ping was discovered in the apartment

00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:48.655
alongside the body of her owner,

00:08:48.655 --> 00:08:52.042
and the vacuum had been running the entire time.

00:08:52.042 --> 00:08:57.350
For many months, up to I think
two years after that incident,

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.960
she was so scared she couldn't be in
the house when anyone was cleaning.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.750
She was quite literally a scaredy cat.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.190
She would hide in the closet.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.992
She was un-self-confident and shaky,

00:09:05.992 --> 00:09:08.330
but with the loving support of her family,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.726
a lot of a time, and their patience,

00:09:10.726 --> 00:09:11.980
now, three years later,

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.225
she's actually a happy, confident cat.

00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:18.180
Another story of trauma and
recovery that I came across

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.676
was actually a few years ago.

00:09:19.676 --> 00:09:21.916
I was in Thailand to do some research.

00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:25.010
I met a monkey named Boonlua,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.282
and when Boonlua was a baby,

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:29.296
he was attacked by a pack of dogs,

00:09:29.296 --> 00:09:34.140
and they ripped off both of his legs and one arm,

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.283
and Boonlua dragged himself to a monastery,

00:09:37.283 --> 00:09:38.834
where the monks took him in.

00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:41.445
They called in a veterinarian,
who treated his wounds.

00:09:41.445 --> 00:09:43.660
Eventually, Boonlua wound up

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.453
at an elephant facility,

00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:48.422
and the keepers really decided
to take him under their wing,

00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:49.785
and they figured out what he liked,

00:09:49.785 --> 00:09:51.804
which, it turned out, was mint Mentos

00:09:51.804 --> 00:09:55.281
and Rhinoceros beetles and eggs.

00:09:55.281 --> 00:09:58.453
But they worried, because he
was social, that he was lonely,

00:09:58.453 --> 00:10:00.220
and they didn't want to put
him in with another monkey,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.423
because they thought with just one arm,

00:10:01.423 --> 00:10:04.218
he wouldn't be able to defend himself or even play.

00:10:04.218 --> 00:10:06.704
And so they gave him a rabbit,

00:10:06.704 --> 00:10:09.517
and Boonlua was immediately a different monkey.

00:10:09.517 --> 00:10:11.499
He was extremely happy to be with this rabbit.

00:10:11.499 --> 00:10:13.779
They groomed each other,
they become close friends,

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:16.482
and then the rabbit had bunnies,

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:19.339
and Boonlua was even happier than he was before,

00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:21.589
and it had in a way given him

00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:23.434
a reason to wake up in the morning,

00:10:23.434 --> 00:10:25.188
and in fact it gave him such a reason to wake up

00:10:25.188 --> 00:10:27.191
that he decided not to sleep.

00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:30.810
He became extremely protective of these bunnies,

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.058
and he stopped sleeping,

00:10:32.058 --> 00:10:33.499
and he would sort of nod off

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:35.390
while trying to take care of them.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.833
In fact, he was so protective and so affectionate

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:39.588
with these babies that the sanctuary

00:10:39.588 --> 00:10:41.950
eventually had to take them away from him

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.885
because he was so protective, he was worried

00:10:43.885 --> 00:10:45.764
that their mother might hurt them.

00:10:45.764 --> 00:10:47.608
So after they were taken away, the sanctuary staff

00:10:47.608 --> 00:10:49.217
worried that he would fall into a depression,

00:10:49.217 --> 00:10:50.449
and so to avoid that,

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:53.447
they gave him another rabbit friend.

00:10:53.447 --> 00:10:56.804
(Laughter)

00:10:56.804 --> 00:10:59.509
My official opinion is that
he does not look depressed.

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:01.459
(Laughter)

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:05.821
So one thing that I would really like people to feel

00:11:05.821 --> 00:11:08.900
is that you really should feel empowered

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.373
to make some assumptions

00:11:11.373 --> 00:11:13.196
about the creatures that you know well.

00:11:13.196 --> 00:11:14.996
So when it comes to your dog

00:11:14.996 --> 00:11:17.314
or your cat or maybe your one-armed monkey

00:11:17.314 --> 00:11:18.742
that you happen to know,

00:11:18.742 --> 00:11:22.537
if you think that they are traumatized or depressed,

00:11:22.537 --> 00:11:24.663
you're probably right.

00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:27.471
This is extremely anthropomorphic,

00:11:27.471 --> 00:11:30.464
or the assignation of human characteristics

00:11:30.464 --> 00:11:34.116
onto non-human animals or things.

00:11:34.116 --> 00:11:36.257
I don't think, though, that that's a problem.

00:11:36.257 --> 00:11:38.349
I don't think that we can not anthropomorphize.

00:11:38.349 --> 00:11:41.251
It's not as if you can take your
human brain out of your head

00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:43.355
and put it in a jar and then use it

00:11:43.355 --> 00:11:45.560
to think about another animal thinking.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.158
We will always be one animal wondering

00:11:48.158 --> 00:11:50.678
about the emotional experience of another animal.

00:11:50.678 --> 00:11:53.671
So then the choice becomes, how
do you anthropomorphize well?

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:55.931
Or do you anthropomorphize poorly?

00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:58.215
And anthropomorphizing poorly

00:11:58.215 --> 00:12:00.380
is all too common.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.012
(Laughter)

00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:04.616
It may include dressing your corgis
up and throwing them a wedding,

00:12:04.616 --> 00:12:07.272
or getting too close to exotic wildlife because

00:12:07.272 --> 00:12:09.228
you believe that you had a spiritual connection.

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:11.206
There's all manner of things.

00:12:11.206 --> 00:12:15.112
Anthropomorphizing well, however, I believe is based

00:12:15.112 --> 00:12:17.830
on accepting our animal
similarities with other species

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.637
and using them to make assumptions

00:12:20.637 --> 00:12:24.276
that are informed about other 
animals' minds and experiences,

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:26.822
and there's actually an entire industry

00:12:26.822 --> 00:12:29.792
that is in some ways based
on anthropomorphizing well,

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:32.953
and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry.

00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:37.473
One in five Americans is currently
taking a psychopharmaceutical drug,

00:12:37.473 --> 00:12:40.128
from the antidepressants
and antianxiety medications

00:12:40.128 --> 00:12:41.950
to the antipsychotics.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.784
It turns out that we owe this

00:12:43.784 --> 00:12:46.157
entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal

00:12:46.157 --> 00:12:47.889
to other animals.

00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:50.399
These drugs were tested in non-human animals first,

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:54.335
and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects.

00:12:54.335 --> 00:12:57.519
The very popular antipsychotic Thorazine

00:12:57.519 --> 00:13:01.265
first relaxed rats before it relaxed people.

00:13:01.265 --> 00:13:03.426
The antianxiety medication Librium

00:13:03.426 --> 00:13:07.249
was given to cats selected for
their meanness in the 1950s

00:13:07.249 --> 00:13:09.640
and made them into peaceable felines.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.200
And even antidepressants
were first tested in rabbits.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.104
Today, however, we are not just giving these drugs

00:13:17.104 --> 00:13:19.455
to other animals as test subjects,

00:13:19.455 --> 00:13:21.946
but they're giving them these drugs as patients,

00:13:21.946 --> 00:13:26.429
both in ethical and much less ethical ways.

00:13:26.429 --> 00:13:30.299
SeaWorld gives mother orcas
antianxiety medications

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:32.943
when their calves are taken away.

00:13:32.943 --> 00:13:35.226
Many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics

00:13:35.226 --> 00:13:37.292
and antianxiety medications.

00:13:37.292 --> 00:13:40.165
But dogs like my own Oliver

00:13:40.165 --> 00:13:43.404
are given antidepressants and
some antianxiety medications

00:13:43.404 --> 00:13:45.140
to keep them from jumping out of buildings

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.203
or jumping into traffic.

00:13:47.203 --> 00:13:50.402
Just recently, actually, a study came out in "Science"

00:13:50.402 --> 00:13:52.231
that showed that even crawdads

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:54.455
responded to antianxiety medication.

00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:56.730
It made them braver, less skittish,

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:01.780
and more likely to explore their environment.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.138
It's hard to know how many
animals are on these drugs,

00:14:04.138 --> 00:14:07.602
but I can tell you that the
animal pharmaceutical industry

00:14:07.602 --> 00:14:09.390
is immense and growing,

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.113
from seven billion dollars in 2011

00:14:12.113 --> 00:14:17.692
to a projected 9.25 billion by the year 2015.

00:14:17.692 --> 00:14:21.539
Some animals are on these drugs indefinitely.

00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:25.774
Others, like one bonobo who lives in Milwaukee

00:14:25.774 --> 00:14:27.360
at the zoo there was on them

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.511
until he started to save his Paxil prescription

00:14:29.511 --> 00:14:31.907
and then distribute it among the other bonobos.

00:14:31.907 --> 00:14:36.916
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:14:36.916 --> 00:14:39.805
More than psychopharmaceuticals, though,

00:14:39.805 --> 00:14:42.320
there are many, many, many other

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.968
therapeutic interventions that help other creatures.

00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:47.330
And here is a place where I think actually

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.772
that veterinary medicine can teach something

00:14:49.772 --> 00:14:51.458
to human medicine,

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:53.348
which is, if you take your dog, who is, say,

00:14:53.348 --> 00:14:55.148
compulsively chasing his tail,

00:14:55.148 --> 00:14:56.926
into the veterinary behaviorist,

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:59.730
their first action isn't to reach
for the prescription pad;

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.686
it's to ask you about your dog's life.

00:15:02.686 --> 00:15:05.622
They want to know how often your dog gets outside.

00:15:05.622 --> 00:15:08.276
They want to know how much
exercise your dog is getting.

00:15:08.276 --> 00:15:09.761
They want to know how much social time

00:15:09.761 --> 00:15:12.180
with other dogs and other humans.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.390
They want to talk to you
about what sorts of therapies,

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.905
largely behavior therapies,

00:15:16.905 --> 00:15:19.165
you've tried with that animal.

00:15:19.165 --> 00:15:21.562
Those are the things that
often tend to help the most,

00:15:21.562 --> 00:15:24.891
especially when combined with
psychopharmaceuticals.

00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:27.344
The thing, though, I believe, that helps the most,

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:29.301
particularly with social animals,

00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:32.439
is time with other social animals.

00:15:32.439 --> 00:15:36.347
In many ways, I feel like I became a service animal

00:15:36.347 --> 00:15:38.851
to my own dog,

00:15:38.851 --> 00:15:42.878
and I have seen parrots do it for people

00:15:42.878 --> 00:15:44.588
and people do it for parrots

00:15:44.588 --> 00:15:46.126
and dogs do it for elephants

00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:49.304
and elephants do it for other elephants.

00:15:49.304 --> 00:15:50.637
I don't know about you;

00:15:50.637 --> 00:15:53.217
I get a lot of Internet forwards

00:15:53.217 --> 00:15:55.433
of unlikely animal friendships.

00:15:55.433 --> 00:15:58.720
I also think it's a huge part of Facebook,

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.597
the monkey that adopts the cat

00:16:01.597 --> 00:16:06.233
or the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn,

00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:09.237
or the cow that makes friends with the pig,

00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:13.173
and had you asked me eight,
nine years ago, about these,

00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:15.663
I would have told you that they
were hopelessly sentimental

00:16:15.663 --> 00:16:18.786
and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way

00:16:18.786 --> 00:16:21.565
and maybe even staged, and what I can tell you now

00:16:21.565 --> 00:16:24.517
is that there is actually something to this.

00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:28.112
This is legit. In fact, some interesting studies

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:30.038
have pointed to oxytocin levels,

00:16:30.038 --> 00:16:32.634
which are a kind of bonding hormone

00:16:32.634 --> 00:16:35.040
that we release when we're having sex or nursing

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.629
or around someone that we care for extremely,

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:40.121
oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs

00:16:40.121 --> 00:16:41.515
who care about each other

00:16:41.515 --> 00:16:43.175
or who enjoy each other's company,

00:16:43.175 --> 00:16:45.484
and beyond that, other studies show that oxytocin

00:16:45.484 --> 00:16:47.620
raised even in other pairs of animals,

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.225
so, say, in goats and dogs who were
friends and played with each other,

00:16:51.225 --> 00:16:55.684
their levels spiked afterwards.

00:16:55.684 --> 00:16:58.451
I have a friend who really showed me that

00:16:58.451 --> 00:17:00.875
mental health is in fact a two-way street.

00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:04.874
His name is Lonnie Hodge,
and he's a veteran of Vietnam.

00:17:04.874 --> 00:17:07.496
When he returned, he started working

00:17:07.496 --> 00:17:10.139
with survivors of genocide and a lot of people

00:17:10.139 --> 00:17:11.667
who had gone through war trauma.

00:17:11.667 --> 00:17:14.151
And he had PTSD and also a fear of heights,

00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:16.050
because in Vietnam, he had been

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.295
rappelling backwards out of helicopters

00:17:18.295 --> 00:17:19.730
over the skids,

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.799
and he was givena service dog
named Gander, a labradoodle,

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:26.250
to help him with PTSD and his fear of heights.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.910
This is them actually on the first day that they met,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.502
which is amazing, and since then,

00:17:31.502 --> 00:17:33.267
they've spent a lot of time together

00:17:33.267 --> 00:17:37.517
visiting with other veterans
suffering from similar issues.

00:17:37.517 --> 00:17:40.579
But what's so interesting to me about
Lonnie and Gander's relationship

00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:42.357
is about a few months in,

00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:45.684
Gander actually developed a fear of heights,

00:17:45.684 --> 00:17:49.981
probably because he was
watching Lonnie so closely.

00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:53.450
What's pretty great about this, though,
is that he's still a fantastic service dog,

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.985
because now, when they're both at a great height,

00:17:55.985 --> 00:17:59.343
Lonnie is so concerned with Gander's well-being

00:17:59.343 --> 00:18:05.317
that he forgets to be scared of the heights himself.

00:18:05.317 --> 00:18:08.598
Since I've spent so much time with these stories,

00:18:08.598 --> 00:18:10.002
digging into archives,

00:18:10.002 --> 00:18:12.456
I literally spent years doing this research,

00:18:12.456 --> 00:18:14.756
and it's changed me.

00:18:14.756 --> 00:18:18.692
I no longer look at animals at the species level.

00:18:18.692 --> 00:18:20.920
I look at them as individuals,

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.492
and I think about them as creatures

00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:25.251
with their own individual weather systems

00:18:25.251 --> 00:18:26.963
guiding their behavior and informing

00:18:26.963 --> 00:18:29.272
how they respond to the world.

00:18:29.272 --> 00:18:32.160
And I really believe that this has made me

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.524
a more curious and a more empathetic person,

00:18:34.524 --> 00:18:37.967
both to the animals that share my bed

00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:40.093
and occasionally wind up on my plate,

00:18:40.093 --> 00:18:42.943
but also to the people that I know

00:18:42.943 --> 00:18:45.894
who are suffering from anxiety

00:18:45.894 --> 00:18:48.521
and from phobias and all manner of other things,

00:18:48.521 --> 00:18:50.496
and I really do believe that

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:52.744
even though you can't know exactly

00:18:52.744 --> 00:18:56.131
what's going on in the mind of a pig

00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:58.238
or your pug or your partner,

00:18:58.248 --> 00:19:02.055
that that shouldn't stop you
from empathizing with them.

00:19:02.055 --> 00:19:04.544
The best thing that we could do for our loved ones

00:19:04.544 --> 00:19:08.840
is, perhaps, to anthropomorphize them.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.341
Charles Darwin's father once told him

00:19:12.341 --> 00:19:17.560
that everybody could lose their mind at some point.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.391
Thankfully, we can often find them again,

00:19:20.391 --> 00:19:22.562
but only with each other's help.

00:19:22.562 --> 00:19:24.618
Thank you.

00:19:24.618 --> 00:19:28.191
