00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:14.231
"Why?"

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:15.689
"Why?" is a question

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.325
that parents ask me all the time.

00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:21.172
"Why did my child develop autism?"

00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:25.626
As a pediatrician, as a geneticist, as a researcher,

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:28.069
we try and address that question.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.018
But autism is not a single condition.

00:00:30.018 --> 00:00:32.733
It's actually a spectrum of disorders,

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.267
a spectrum that ranges, for instance,

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:37.940
from Justin, a 13-year-old boy

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.163
who's not verbal, who can't speak,

00:00:41.163 --> 00:00:43.125
who communicates by using an iPad

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.023
to touch pictures to communicate

00:00:45.023 --> 00:00:47.174
his thoughts and his concerns,

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:49.585
a little boy who, when he gets upset,

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:51.233
will start rocking,

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:52.830
and eventually, when he's disturbed enough,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.433
will bang his head to the point

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:58.275
that he can actually cut it open and require stitches.

00:00:58.275 --> 00:01:00.890
That same diagnosis of autism, though,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.812
also applies to Gabriel,

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.779
another 13-year-old boy

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:07.474
who has quite a different set of challenges.

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:10.588
He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics.

00:01:10.588 --> 00:01:12.609
He can multiple three numbers by three numbers

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.396
in his head with ease,

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:18.154
yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation,

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:20.215
he has great difficulty.

00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:22.274
He doesn't make eye contact.

00:01:22.274 --> 00:01:24.397
He has difficulty starting a conversation,

00:01:24.397 --> 00:01:26.132
feels awkward,

00:01:26.132 --> 00:01:27.950
and when he gets nervous,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.675
he actually shuts down.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:31.157
Yet both of these boys

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:35.341
have the same diagnosis of
autism spectrum disorder.

00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:37.769
One of the things that concerns us

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:39.366
is whether or not there really is

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.339
an epidemic of autism.

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:43.819
These days, one in 88 children

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.861
will be diagnosed with autism,

00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:47.334
and the question is,

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:49.337
why does this graph look this way?

00:01:49.337 --> 00:01:51.304
Has that number been increasing

00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:53.238
dramatically over time?

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:57.769
Or is it because we have now started labeling

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.331
individuals with autism,

00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:01.579
simply giving them a diagnosis

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.132
when they were still present there before

00:02:04.132 --> 00:02:06.525
yet simply didn't have that label?

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:10.516
And in fact, in the late 1980s, the early 1990s,

00:02:10.516 --> 00:02:11.926
legislation was passed

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:14.565
that actually provided individuals with autism

00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:18.291
with resources, with access to educational materials

00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:20.063
that would help them.

00:02:20.063 --> 00:02:23.551
With that increased awareness, more parents,

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:26.297
more pediatricians, more educators

00:02:26.297 --> 00:02:29.552
learned to recognize the features of autism.

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:33.562
As a result of that, more individuals were diagnosed

00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:36.750
and got access to the resources they needed.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.182
In addition, we've changed our definition over time,

00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:43.320
so in fact we've widened the definition of autism,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.440
and that accounts for some of

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.455
the increased prevalence that we see.

00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:50.115
The next question everyone wonders is,

00:02:50.115 --> 00:02:51.891
what caused autism?

00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:54.786
And a common misconception

00:02:54.786 --> 00:02:57.570
is that vaccines cause autism.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.621
But let me be very clear:

00:03:00.621 --> 00:03:05.108
Vaccines do not cause autism.

00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:11.812
(Applause)

00:03:11.812 --> 00:03:13.935
In fact, the original research study

00:03:13.935 --> 00:03:15.934
that suggested that was the case

00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:18.809
was completely fraudulent.

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.985
It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet,

00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:23.577
in which it was published,

00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:25.467
and that author, a physician,

00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:28.721
had his medical license taken away from him.

00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:32.675
(Applause)

00:03:32.675 --> 00:03:34.257
The Institute of Medicine,

00:03:34.257 --> 00:03:35.820
The Centers for Disease Control,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.164
have repeatedly investigated this

00:03:38.164 --> 00:03:41.771
and there is no credible evidence

00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:44.456
that vaccines cause autism.

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:46.093
Furthermore,

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:48.562
one of the ingredients in vaccines,

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.614
something called thimerosal,

00:03:50.614 --> 00:03:53.930
was thought to be what the cause of autism was.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.193
That was actually removed from vaccines

00:03:56.193 --> 00:03:57.918
in the year 1992,

00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:00.962
and you can see that it really did not have an effect

00:04:00.962 --> 00:04:03.601
in what happened with the prevalence of autism.

00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:05.334
So again, there is no evidence

00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:07.416
that this is the answer.

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:11.559
So the question remains, what does cause autism?

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.390
In fact, there's probably not one single answer.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.147
Just as autism is a spectrum,

00:04:16.147 --> 00:04:18.337
there's a spectrum of etiologies,

00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:19.989
a spectrum of causes.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.980
Based on epidemiological data,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.773
we know that one of the causes,

00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:25.930
or one of the associations, I should say,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.214
is advanced paternal age,

00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:30.151
that is, increasing age of the father

00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:32.330
at the time of conception.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.474
In addition, another vulnerable

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:37.104
and critical period in terms of development

00:04:37.104 --> 00:04:39.010
is when the mother is pregnant.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.000
During that period, while
the fetal brain is developing,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.942
we know that exposure to certain agents

00:04:43.942 --> 00:04:47.027
can actually increase the risk of autism.

00:04:47.027 --> 00:04:49.962
In particular, there's a medication, valproic acid,

00:04:49.962 --> 00:04:52.548
which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take,

00:04:52.548 --> 00:04:56.220
we know can increase that risk of autism.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.519
In addition, there can be some infectious agents

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:01.419
that can also cause autism.

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:02.999
And one of the things I'm going to spend

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.060
a lot of time focusing on

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.621
are the genes that can cause autism.

00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:10.077
I'm focusing on this not because genes

00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:12.221
are the only cause of autism,

00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:13.790
but it's a cause of autism

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.667
that we can readily define

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:18.460
and be able to better understand the biology

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.729
and understand better how the brain works

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.714
so that we can come up with strategies

00:05:22.714 --> 00:05:25.044
to be able to intervene.

00:05:25.044 --> 00:05:27.990
One of the genetic factors that we don't understand,

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.138
however, is the difference that we see

00:05:31.138 --> 00:05:33.044
in terms of males and females.

00:05:33.044 --> 00:05:36.049
Males are affected four to one compared to females

00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:37.151
with autism,

00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:41.142
and we really don't understand what that cause is.

00:05:41.142 --> 00:05:42.860
One of the ways that we can understand

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.723
that genetics is a factor

00:05:44.723 --> 00:05:46.060
is by looking at something called

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.950
the concordance rate.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.138
In other words, if one sibling has autism,

00:05:51.138 --> 00:05:52.625
what's the probability

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:55.629
that another sibling in that family will have autism?

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:57.194
And we can look in particular

00:05:57.194 --> 00:05:59.362
at three types of siblings:

00:05:59.362 --> 00:06:01.233
identical twins,

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:03.452
twins that actually share 100 percent

00:06:03.452 --> 00:06:05.054
of their genetic information

00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:08.230
and shared the same intrauterine environment,

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.475
versus fraternal twins,

00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:12.464
twins that actually share 50 percent

00:06:12.464 --> 00:06:14.491
of their genetic information,

00:06:14.491 --> 00:06:15.707
versus regular siblings,

00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:17.576
brother-sister, sister-sister,

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:20.444
also sharing 50 percent of their genetic information,

00:06:20.444 --> 00:06:23.523
yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment.

00:06:23.523 --> 00:06:25.823
And when you look at those concordance ratios,

00:06:25.823 --> 00:06:27.880
one of the striking things that you will see

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.000
is that in identical twins,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.353
that concordance rate is 77 percent.

00:06:33.353 --> 00:06:34.457
Remarkably, though,

00:06:34.457 --> 00:06:36.605
it's not 100 percent.

00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:40.608
It is not that genes account
for all of the risk for autism,

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.849
but yet they account for a lot of that risk,

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.162
because when you look at fraternal twins,

00:06:45.162 --> 00:06:48.238
that concordance rate is only 31 percent.

00:06:48.238 --> 00:06:50.149
On the other hand, there is a difference

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:53.092
between those fraternal twins and the siblings,

00:06:53.092 --> 00:06:55.756
suggesting that there are common exposures

00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:57.179
for those fraternal twins

00:06:57.179 --> 00:06:59.296
that may not be shared as commonly

00:06:59.296 --> 00:07:01.470
with siblings alone.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.156
So this provides some of the data

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.778
that autism is genetic.

00:07:04.778 --> 00:07:06.742
Well, how genetic is it?

00:07:06.742 --> 00:07:08.585
When we compare it to other conditions

00:07:08.585 --> 00:07:10.197
that we're familiar with,

00:07:10.197 --> 00:07:14.077
things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes,

00:07:14.077 --> 00:07:18.030
in fact, genetics plays a much larger role in autism

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.470
than it does in any of these other conditions.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.812
But with this, that doesn't
tell us what the genes are.

00:07:23.812 --> 00:07:26.479
It doesn't even tell us in any one child,

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.140
is it one gene

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.396
or potentially a combination of genes?

00:07:30.396 --> 00:07:33.950
And so in fact, in some individuals with autism,

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.464
it is genetic!

00:07:36.464 --> 00:07:38.694
That is, that it is one single,

00:07:38.694 --> 00:07:40.866
powerful, deterministic gene

00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:42.713
that causes the autism.

00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:44.507
However, in other individuals,

00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:46.213
it's genetic, that is,

00:07:46.213 --> 00:07:49.333
that it's actually a combination of genes

00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:52.128
in part with the developmental process

00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:55.508
that ultimately determines that risk for autism.

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:58.378
We don't know in any one person, necessarily,

00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:00.471
which of those two answers it is

00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:02.512
until we start digging deeper.

00:08:02.512 --> 00:08:03.799
So the question becomes,

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:06.040
how can we start to identify

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.912
what exactly those genes are.

00:08:07.912 --> 00:08:09.021
And let me pose something

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:11.211
that might not be intuitive.

00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:13.570
In certain individuals,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.294
they can have autism

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:17.747
for a reason that is genetic

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:21.311
but yet not because of autism running in the family.

00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:23.690
And the reason is because in certain individuals,

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.751
they can actually have genetic changes or mutations

00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:29.794
that are not passed down from the mother

00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:31.281
or from the father,

00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:34.014
but actually start brand new in them,

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:35.601
mutations that are present

00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:37.004
in the egg or the sperm

00:08:37.004 --> 00:08:38.617
at the time of conception

00:08:38.617 --> 00:08:40.359
but have not been passed down

00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:43.365
generation through generation within the family.

00:08:43.365 --> 00:08:45.546
And we can actually use that strategy

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:47.880
to now understand and to identify

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.980
those genes causing autism in those individuals.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.990
So in fact, at the Simons Foundation,

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.716
we took 2,600 individuals

00:08:55.716 --> 00:08:58.427
that had no family history of autism,

00:08:58.427 --> 00:09:01.597
and we took that child and their mother and father

00:09:01.597 --> 00:09:04.068
and used them to try and understand

00:09:04.068 --> 00:09:05.687
what were those genes

00:09:05.687 --> 00:09:08.005
causing autism in those cases?

00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:11.072
To do that, we actually had to comprehensively

00:09:11.072 --> 00:09:13.802
be able to look at all that genetic information

00:09:13.802 --> 00:09:15.984
and determine what those differences were

00:09:15.984 --> 00:09:19.685
between the mother, the father and the child.

00:09:19.685 --> 00:09:21.639
In doing so, I apologize,

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:23.523
I'm going to use an outdated analogy

00:09:23.523 --> 00:09:26.181
of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia,

00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:29.180
but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.538
that as we did this inventory,

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:33.131
we needed to be able to look at

00:09:33.131 --> 00:09:35.304
massive amounts of information.

00:09:35.304 --> 00:09:37.591
Our genetic information is organized

00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:40.478
into a set of 46 volumes,

00:09:40.478 --> 00:09:42.387
and when we did that, we had to be able to account

00:09:42.387 --> 00:09:44.371
for each of those 46 volumes,

00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:46.224
because in some cases with autism,

00:09:46.224 --> 00:09:48.680
there's actually a single volume that's missing.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.990
We had to get more granular than that, though,

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.310
and so we had to start opening those books,

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.190
and in some cases, the genetic change

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.578
was more subtle.

00:09:56.578 --> 00:09:59.764
It might have been a single
paragraph that was missing,

00:09:59.764 --> 00:10:03.042
or yet, even more subtle than that,

00:10:03.042 --> 00:10:04.734
a single letter,

00:10:04.734 --> 00:10:07.536
one out of three billion letters

00:10:07.536 --> 00:10:09.810
that was changed, that was altered,

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.407
yet had profound effects

00:10:11.407 --> 00:10:13.320
in terms of how the brain functions

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.137
and affects behavior.

00:10:15.137 --> 00:10:17.514
In doing this within these families,

00:10:17.514 --> 00:10:19.832
we were able to account for approximately

00:10:19.832 --> 00:10:22.157
25 percent of the individuals

00:10:22.157 --> 00:10:24.704
and determine that there was a single

00:10:24.704 --> 00:10:26.900
powerful genetic factor

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.024
that caused autism within those families.

00:10:30.024 --> 00:10:32.276
On the other hand, there's 75 percent

00:10:32.276 --> 00:10:34.727
that we still haven't figured out.

00:10:34.727 --> 00:10:36.197
As we did this, though,

00:10:36.197 --> 00:10:38.291
it was really quite humbling,

00:10:38.291 --> 00:10:40.656
because we realized that there was not simply

00:10:40.656 --> 00:10:42.597
one gene for autism.

00:10:42.597 --> 00:10:44.346
In fact, the current estimates are

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:47.098
that there are 200 to 400 different genes

00:10:47.098 --> 00:10:48.990
that can cause autism.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.359
And that explains, in part,

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:52.476
why we see such a broad spectrum

00:10:52.476 --> 00:10:54.519
in terms of its effects.

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:56.744
Although there are that many genes,

00:10:56.744 --> 00:10:59.092
there is some method to the madness.

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:01.040
It's not simply random

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.270
200, 400 different genes,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.064
but in fact they fit together.

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.930
They fit together in a pathway.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.402
They fit together in a network

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:10.234
that's starting to make sense now

00:11:10.234 --> 00:11:12.932
in terms of how the brain functions.

00:11:12.932 --> 00:11:15.078
We're starting to have a bottom-up approach

00:11:15.078 --> 00:11:16.787
where we're identifying those genes,

00:11:16.787 --> 00:11:19.265
those proteins, those molecules,

00:11:19.265 --> 00:11:21.175
understanding how they interact together

00:11:21.175 --> 00:11:22.572
to make that neuron work,

00:11:22.572 --> 00:11:25.309
understanding how those neurons interact together

00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:26.528
to make circuits work,

00:11:26.528 --> 00:11:28.544
and understand how those circuits work

00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:30.370
to now control behavior,

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.170
and understand that both in individuals with autism

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:37.071
as well as individuals who have normal cognition.

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:39.529
But early diagnosis is a key for us.

00:11:39.529 --> 00:11:41.488
Being able to make that diagnosis

00:11:41.488 --> 00:11:42.995
of someone who's susceptible

00:11:42.995 --> 00:11:45.050
at a time in a window

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.397
where we have the ability to transform,

00:11:47.397 --> 00:11:49.000
to be able to impact

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.740
that growing, developing brain is critical.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.549
And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods

00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:58.117
to be able to take infants, small babies,

00:11:58.117 --> 00:12:00.650
and be able to use biomarkers,

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.988
in this case eye contact and eye tracking,

00:12:03.988 --> 00:12:06.074
to identify an infant at risk.

00:12:06.074 --> 00:12:08.239
This particular infant, you can see,

00:12:08.239 --> 00:12:10.440
making very good eye contact with this woman

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.800
as she's singing "Itsy, Bitsy Spider,"

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.840
in fact is not going to develop autism.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.720
This baby we know is going to be in the clear.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.080
On the other hand, this other baby

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.415
is going to go on to develop autism.

00:12:23.415 --> 00:12:25.642
In this particular child, you can see,

00:12:25.642 --> 00:12:27.843
it's not making good eye contact.

00:12:27.843 --> 00:12:29.810
Instead of the eyes focusing in

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.088
and having that social connection,

00:12:32.088 --> 00:12:34.726
looking at the mouth, looking at the nose,

00:12:34.726 --> 00:12:36.509
looking off in another direction,

00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:39.422
but not again socially connecting,

00:12:39.422 --> 00:12:42.135
and being able to do this on a very large scale,

00:12:42.135 --> 00:12:45.135
screen infants, screen children for autism,

00:12:45.135 --> 00:12:48.059
through something very robust, very reliable,

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:50.775
is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being

00:12:50.775 --> 00:12:52.869
able to intervene at an early stage

00:12:52.869 --> 00:12:56.301
when we can have the greatest impact.

00:12:56.301 --> 00:12:58.547
How are we going to intervene?

00:12:58.547 --> 00:13:01.377
It's probably going to be a combination of factors.

00:13:01.377 --> 00:13:03.416
In part, in some individuals,

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:05.295
we're going to try and use medications.

00:13:05.295 --> 00:13:08.017
And so in fact, identifying the genes for autism

00:13:08.017 --> 00:13:09.543
is important for us

00:13:09.543 --> 00:13:11.409
to identify drug targets,

00:13:11.409 --> 00:13:14.032
to identify things that we might be able to impact

00:13:14.032 --> 00:13:15.730
and can be certain that that's really

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.425
what we need to do in autism.

00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:20.166
But that's not going to be the only answer.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:23.676
Beyond just drugs, we're going
to use educational strategies.

00:13:23.676 --> 00:13:24.951
Individuals with autism,

00:13:24.951 --> 00:13:27.248
some of them are wired a little bit differently.

00:13:27.248 --> 00:13:29.107
They learn in a different way.

00:13:29.107 --> 00:13:31.441
They absorb their surroundings in a different way,

00:13:31.441 --> 00:13:33.660
and we need to be able to educate them

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.753
in a way that serves them best.

00:13:36.753 --> 00:13:38.671
Beyond that, there are a lot of individuals

00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:40.817
in this room who have great ideas

00:13:40.817 --> 00:13:43.361
in terms of new technologies we can use,

00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:46.480
everything from devices we can use to train the brain

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.029
to be able to make it more efficient

00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:49.702
and to compensate for areas in which

00:13:49.702 --> 00:13:51.296
it has a little bit of trouble,

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:53.575
to even things like Google Glass.

00:13:53.575 --> 00:13:55.359
You could imagine, for instance, Gabriel,

00:13:55.359 --> 00:13:57.180
with his social awkwardness,

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.638
might be able to wear Google Glass

00:13:58.638 --> 00:14:00.169
with an earpiece in his ear,

00:14:00.169 --> 00:14:02.096
and have a coach be able to help him,

00:14:02.096 --> 00:14:04.754
be able to help think about conversations,

00:14:04.754 --> 00:14:06.070
conversation-starters,

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.181
being able to even perhaps one day

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.549
invite a girl out on a date.

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:12.761
All of these new technologies

00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:14.767
just offer tremendous opportunities

00:14:14.767 --> 00:14:16.672
for us to be able to impact

00:14:16.672 --> 00:14:19.357
the individuals with autism,

00:14:19.357 --> 00:14:21.893
but yet we have a long way to go.

00:14:21.893 --> 00:14:23.203
As much as we know,

00:14:23.203 --> 00:14:26.160
there is so much more that we don't know,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.293
and so I invite all of you

00:14:28.293 --> 00:14:30.535
to be able to help us think about

00:14:30.535 --> 00:14:31.946
how to do this better,

00:14:31.946 --> 00:14:34.825
to use as a community our collective wisdom

00:14:34.825 --> 00:14:36.631
to be able to make a difference,

00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:37.888
and in particular,

00:14:37.888 --> 00:14:40.592
for the individuals in families with autism,

00:14:40.592 --> 00:14:43.847
I invite you to join the interactive autism network,

00:14:43.847 --> 00:14:46.041
to be part of the solution to this,

00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:48.920
because it's going to take really a lot of us

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.190
to think about what's important,

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.115
what's going to be a meaningful difference.

00:14:53.115 --> 00:14:54.620
As we think about something

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.452
that's potentially a solution,

00:14:56.452 --> 00:14:58.111
how well does it work?

00:14:58.111 --> 00:15:00.059
Is it something that's really
going to make a difference

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:02.428
in your lives, as an individual,

00:15:02.428 --> 00:15:04.081
as a family with autism?

00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:06.501
We're going to need individuals of all ages,

00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:08.228
from the young to the old,

00:15:08.228 --> 00:15:10.387
and with all different shapes and sizes

00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:12.224
of the autism spectrum disorder

00:15:12.224 --> 00:15:14.400
to make sure that we can have an impact.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.605
So I invite all of you to join the mission

00:15:16.605 --> 00:15:19.579
and to help to be able to make the lives

00:15:19.579 --> 00:15:21.265
of individuals with autism

00:15:21.265 --> 00:15:23.196
so much better and so much richer.

00:15:23.196 --> 00:15:25.921
Thank you.

00:15:25.921 --> 00:15:29.921
(Applause)
