00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Sustainability represents

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
the what, the where and the how

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
of what is caught.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
The who and the why are what's important to me.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
I want to know how I impact them.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I want to know how they impact me.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I want to know why they fish.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
for their living.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Understanding all of this enables us

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
to shift our perception of seafood

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
away from a commodity

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
to an opportunity

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
to restore our ecosystem.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
that we're also so fortunate to eat.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
So what do we call this?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
I think we call it restorative seafood.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Where sustainability is the capacity

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
to endure and maintain,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
restorative is the ability to replenish and progress.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
as a resource,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and to encourage its resiliency.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
It is a more hopeful, it is a more human,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and is a more useful way of understanding our environment.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Wallet guides -- standard issue

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
by lots in the marine conservation world --

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
are very handy; they're a wonderful tool.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
think twice about yellow.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
But in my mind, it's really not enough

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
to just eat green list.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
We can't sustain this without the measure of our success

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
really changing the fate of the species

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
in the yellow and the red.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
But what if we eat only in the green list?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here --

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
comes from sustainable stocks.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Pole caught -- no bycatch.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
What's the context of this meal?

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Do I do this three times a week?

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
I might still be in the green list,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
but I'm not doing myself, or you,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
or the oceans any favors.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
The point is that we have to have a context,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
a gauge for our actions in all this.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health --

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
That's great! I love red wine!

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Well, how many bottles is it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
before you tell me that I have a problem?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Well folks, we have a protein problem.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
We have lost this sensibility

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
when it regards our food,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
and we are paying a cost.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
We are hiding that cost

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
is that it really takes into account our needs.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Restorative seafood might best be represented

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Vegetables:

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
they might yet save the oceans.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Well I'd like to respectfully submit

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
that broccoli green might then be the new blue.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
We must continue to eat

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
the best seafood possible, if at all.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
The best part about restorative seafood though

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
is that it comes on the half-shell

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
with crunchy, grilled broccoli

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
with just a hint of chili flake.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Whooo!

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
This is an easy sell.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
to every family at the neighborhood Walmart.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
Jamie Oliver is campaigning

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
to save America from the way we eat.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
from the way we eat.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
There's a pattern here.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
Forget nuclear holocaust;

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
it's the fork that we have to worry about.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
We have ravaged our Earth

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and then used the food that we've sourced

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
to handicap ourselves in more ways than one.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
And so I think it's time

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
we change what we expect from our food.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Sustainability is complicated

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
So let's start there.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Dan Barber and Alice Waters

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
But green foods often represent

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
a way for us to disregard

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
the responsibility as eaters.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Just because it comes from a green source

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
We have eco-friendly shrimp.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
We can make them; we have that technology.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.260
But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
It doesn't work.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
of restorative seafood.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
While we try to manage declining marine populations,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Studies say that tens of thousands

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
might be around for another birthday

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
if we included more seafood.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
But it's not all about the seafood.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
It's about the way that we look at our plates.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
A couple things happened.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
I made more money.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
People started buying appetizers and salads,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
People spent more time engaging in their meals,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
engaging with each other over their meals.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
People got, in short, more of what they came there for

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
even though they got less protein.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
They got healthier. I made more money.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
This is great.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Environmental consideration was served with every plate,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
but it was served with a heaping mound

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
of consideration for human interests at the same time.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
One of the other things we did

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
was begin to diversify the species that we served --

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Shellfish, mussels, oysters,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
We were directing tastes

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
towards more resilience, more restorative options.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
This is what we need to favor.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
This is what the green list says.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
But what of those big predators,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
those fashionable species,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
so here we go.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Get a knife. Cut it into four portions.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Put it on four plates.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Mound up those four plates with vegetables

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
light the candles and celebrate it.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Invite your friends and neighbors over

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and repeat once a year,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
maybe.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
I expect a lot from food.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
I expect health

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
and joy and family and community.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
I expect that producing ingredients,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
preparing dishes and eating meals

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
is all part of the communion of human interests.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
And he taught me very early on

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
about the privilege that eating represents.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
I remember well the meals of my childhood.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
They were reasonable portions of protein

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
served with copious quantities of vegetables

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
and small amounts of starch, usually rice.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
This is still how I largely eat today.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
I get sick when I go to steakhouses.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
I get the meat sweats.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
It's like a hangover from protein.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
It's disgusting.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
But of all the dire news that you'll hear

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
and that you have heard about the state of our oceans,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
possibly the very worst of it

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and that is this whole time

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
your mother was right.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
Eat your vegetables.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
It's pretty straightforward.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
So what are we looking for in a meal?

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
that are good for my body.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and sexy things that make things taste less like penance.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
For family, I'm looking for recipes

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
that genuflect to my own personal histories.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
For community though, we start at the very beginning.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
There's no escaping the fact

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
that everything we eat has a global impact.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and then take the first step to minimize it.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
We've seen an image of our blue planet,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
our world bank.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
But it is more than just a repository of our resources;

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
it's also the global geography

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
of the communion we call dinner.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
So if we all take only what we need,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
then we can begin to share the rest,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
we can begin to celebrate,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
we can begin to restore.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
We need to savor vegetables.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
And we need to save dinner.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
Thank you.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
(Applause)
