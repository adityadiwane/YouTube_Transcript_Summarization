00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:17.051
As a kid, I was fascinated with all things air and space.

00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:19.592
I would watch Nova on PBS.

00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:22.545
Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:26.670
When I was in elementary school, my next door neighbor,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.520
he gave me a book for my birthday.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.689
It was an astronomy book,

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.641
and I poured over that thing for hours on end,

00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:35.241
and it was a combination of all these things

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:38.909
that inspired me to pursue space exploration

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.377
as my own personal dream, and part of that dream was,

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:45.986
I always wanted to just fly around the solar system

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:49.383
and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:54.077
Well, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA

00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:56.259
and I found myself at NASA,

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:58.363
working for the jet propulsion laboratory,

00:00:58.363 --> 00:01:01.058
and there our team was challenged

00:01:01.058 --> 00:01:05.447
to create a 3D visualization of the solar system,

00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:09.321
and today I want to show you what we've done so far.

00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:12.707
Now, the kicker is, everything I'm about to do here

00:01:12.707 --> 00:01:16.513
you can do at home, because we built this

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:19.323
for the public for you guys to use.

00:01:19.323 --> 00:01:21.244
So what you're looking at right now is the Earth.

00:01:21.244 --> 00:01:23.215
You can see the United States and California

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:25.994
and San Diego, and you can use the mouse

00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:28.049
or the keyboard to spin things around.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.488
Now, this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth

00:01:31.488 --> 00:01:34.499
has seen this before, but one thing we like to say

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:38.312
in our group is, we do the opposite of Google Earth.

00:01:38.312 --> 00:01:42.361
Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard.

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:45.894
We go from this view out to the stars.

00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:48.821
So the Earth is cool, but what we really want to show

00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:50.687
are the spacecraft,

00:01:50.687 --> 00:01:53.432
so I'm going to bring the interface back up,

00:01:53.432 --> 00:01:56.154
and now you're looking at a number of satellites

00:01:56.154 --> 00:01:57.091
orbiting the Earth.

00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:00.373
These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters.

00:02:00.373 --> 00:02:02.691
We haven't included military satellites and weather satellites

00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:04.704
and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites.

00:02:04.704 --> 00:02:07.203
If we did, it would be a complete mess,

00:02:07.203 --> 00:02:09.259
because there's a lot of stuff out there.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.064
And the cool thing is, we actually created 3D models

00:02:13.064 --> 00:02:16.329
for a number of these spacecraft, so if you want to visit

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.355
any of these, all you need to do is double-click on them.

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:22.591
So I'm going to find the International Space Station,

00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:27.598
double-click, and it will take us all the way down to the ISS.

00:02:27.598 --> 00:02:30.207
And now you're riding along with the ISS

00:02:30.207 --> 00:02:33.402
where it is right now.

00:02:33.402 --> 00:02:35.194
And the other cool thing is, not only can we

00:02:35.194 --> 00:02:38.469
move the camera around, we can also control time,

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.582
so I can slide this jog dial here

00:02:40.582 --> 00:02:42.877
to shuttle time forward, and now

00:02:42.877 --> 00:02:47.310
we can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.763
and they get one every 90 minutes. (Laughter)

00:02:52.763 --> 00:02:55.346
All right, so what about the rest of it?

00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:57.987
Well, I can click on this home button over here,

00:02:57.987 --> 00:03:00.954
and that will take us up to the inner solar system,

00:03:00.954 --> 00:03:03.081
and now we're looking at the rest of the solar system.

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:05.624
You can see, there's Saturn, there's Jupiter,

00:03:05.624 --> 00:03:08.740
and while we're here, I want to point out something.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.297
It's actually pretty busy.

00:03:11.297 --> 00:03:13.386
Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:15.929
on its way to Mars, just launched last weekend.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:19.911
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there.

00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:21.873
We have Dawn orbiting Vesta,

00:03:21.873 --> 00:03:23.883
and we have over here New Horizons

00:03:23.883 --> 00:03:26.341
on a straight shot to Pluto.

00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:28.296
And I mention this because

00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:31.101
there's this strange public perception that

00:03:31.101 --> 00:03:33.894
NASA's dead, that the space shuttles stopped flying

00:03:33.894 --> 00:03:36.478
and all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there.

00:03:36.478 --> 00:03:41.057
Well, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration,

00:03:41.057 --> 00:03:43.656
and we have a lot of spacecraft out there.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.929
Granted, we're not sending humans up at the moment,

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:48.736
well at least with our own launch vehicles,

00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:50.980
but NASA is far from dead,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.310
and one of the reasons why we write a program like this

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.797
is so that people realize that there's so many other things

00:03:56.797 --> 00:03:58.488
that we're doing.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.210
Anyway, while we're here, again,

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.140
if you want to visit anything,

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.057
all you need to do is double-click.

00:04:04.057 --> 00:04:06.627
So I'm just going to double-click on Vesta,

00:04:06.627 --> 00:04:10.721
and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta,

00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:12.911
and this is happening right now.

00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:17.118
I'm going to double-click on Uranus, and we can see

00:04:17.118 --> 00:04:20.426
Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:24.218
You can see how it's tilted at about 89 degrees.

00:04:24.218 --> 00:04:28.178
And just being able to visit different places

00:04:28.178 --> 00:04:29.464
and go through different times,

00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:32.559
we have data from 1950 to 2050.

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:34.776
Granted, we don't have everything in between,

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:36.542
because some of the data is hard to get.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:40.457
Just being able to visit places in different times,

00:04:40.457 --> 00:04:44.125
you can explore this for hours,

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:46.081
literally hours on end,

00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:48.959
but I want to show you one thing in particular,

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:51.344
so I'm going to open up the destination tab,

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:54.731
spacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1,

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.731
and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby.

00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:00.521
So now we've gone back in time.

00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:03.458
We're now riding along with Voyager 1.

00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:06.855
The date here is November 11, 1980.

00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:09.184
Now, there's a funny thing going on here.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.377
It doesn't look like anything's going on.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.477
It looks like I've paused the program.

00:05:13.477 --> 00:05:15.503
It's actually running at real rate right now,

00:05:15.503 --> 00:05:17.503
one second per second, and in fact,

00:05:17.503 --> 00:05:21.061
Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at

00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:25.171
I think it's 38,000 miles per hour.

00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:27.874
It only looks like nothing's moving because, well,

00:05:27.874 --> 00:05:30.680
Saturn here is 700,000 miles away,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.522
and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away.

00:05:33.522 --> 00:05:37.607
It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening.

00:05:37.607 --> 00:05:39.485
But to make it more interesting,

00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:42.331
I'm going to speed up time, and we can watch

00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:44.986
as Voyager 1 flies by Titan,

00:05:44.986 --> 00:05:47.201
which is a hazy moon of Saturn.

00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:49.505
It actually has a very thick atmosphere.

00:05:49.505 --> 00:05:52.766
And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, here.

00:05:52.766 --> 00:05:56.655
I'm going to pull out, and I want to show you

00:05:56.655 --> 00:05:59.885
Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn.

00:05:59.885 --> 00:06:02.135
There's a point to be made here.

00:06:02.135 --> 00:06:04.777
With a 3D visualization like this,

00:06:04.777 --> 00:06:08.558
we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn.

00:06:08.558 --> 00:06:10.180
There's a whole story to tell here.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.036
And even better, because it's an interactive application,

00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:15.016
you can tell the story for yourself.

00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:17.221
If you want to pause it, you can pause it.

00:06:17.221 --> 00:06:18.708
If you want to keep going, if you want to change

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:21.032
the camera angle, you can do that,

00:06:21.032 --> 00:06:23.555
and because of that, I can show you

00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:26.376
that Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn.

00:06:26.376 --> 00:06:30.355
It actually flies underneath Saturn.

00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:33.725
Now, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn,

00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:36.636
Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up

00:06:36.636 --> 00:06:38.926
and out of the solar system,

00:06:38.926 --> 00:06:41.964
so if I just keep letting this go,

00:06:41.964 --> 00:06:46.621
you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that.

00:06:46.621 --> 00:06:48.753
And, in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system.

00:06:48.753 --> 00:06:51.661
I'm going to go back to today, now,

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:55.307
and I want to show you where Voyager 1 is.

00:06:55.307 --> 00:06:59.910
Right there, above, way above the solar system,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.450
way beyond our solar system.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.037
And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there.

00:07:05.037 --> 00:07:06.665
Now you know why, and to me,

00:07:06.665 --> 00:07:08.453
that's the point of this program.

00:07:08.453 --> 00:07:11.726
You can manipulate it yourself.

00:07:11.726 --> 00:07:15.022
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself.

00:07:15.022 --> 00:07:18.513
You know, the theme today is "The World In Your Grasp."

00:07:18.513 --> 00:07:19.935
Well, we're trying to give you

00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:21.532
the solar system in your grasp — (Laughter) —

00:07:21.532 --> 00:07:23.081
and we hope once it's there,

00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:25.334
you'll be able to learn for yourself

00:07:25.334 --> 00:07:27.528
what we've done out there, and what we're about to do.

00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:31.027
And my personal dream is for kids to take this

00:07:31.027 --> 00:07:33.712
and explore and see the wonders out there

00:07:33.712 --> 00:07:36.721
and be inspired, as I was as a kid,

00:07:36.721 --> 00:07:38.279
to pursue STEM education

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:41.029
and to pursue a dream in space exploration.

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:44.251
Thank you. (Applause)
