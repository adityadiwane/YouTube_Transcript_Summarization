00:00:12.757 --> 00:00:16.244
Five hundred seventy-one million

00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:22.551
two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:24.438
are used by Americans

00:00:24.438 --> 00:00:28.109
every year.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.164
If we could -- correction, wrong figure --

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:33.515
13 billion used every year.

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:36.618
If we could reduce the usage of paper towels,

00:00:36.618 --> 00:00:39.800
one paper towel per person per day,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.681
571,230,000 pounds of paper not used.

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:48.816
We can do that.

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:52.746
Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers.

00:00:52.746 --> 00:00:56.977
There's the tri-fold. People typically take two or three.

00:00:56.977 --> 00:01:01.140
There's the one that cuts it, that you have to tear off.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.404
People go one, two, three, four, tear.

00:01:03.404 --> 00:01:04.842
This much, right?

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:07.307
There's the one that cuts itself.

00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:11.447
People go, one, two, three, four.

00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:15.522
Or there's the same thing, but recycled paper,

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:20.035
you have to get five of those because they're not as absorbent, of course.

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:26.556
The fact is, you can do it all with one towel.

00:01:26.556 --> 00:01:28.596
The key, two words:

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:33.044
This half of the room, your word is "shake."

00:01:33.044 --> 00:01:35.226
Let's hear it. Shake. Louder.

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:36.771
Audience: Shake.

00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:38.947
Joe Smith: Your word is "fold."

00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:40.063
Audience: Fold.

00:01:40.063 --> 00:01:40.990
JS: Again.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.059
Audience: Fold. JS: Really loud.

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:44.607
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:48.767
JS: OK. Wet hands.

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:53.567
Shake -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:56.505
Why 12? Twelve apostles, twelve tribes,

00:01:56.505 --> 00:02:00.612
twelve zodiac signs, twelve months. The one I like the best:

00:02:00.612 --> 00:02:02.809
It's the biggest number with one syllable.

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:07.071
(Laughter)

00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:14.431
Tri-fold. Fold ...

00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:15.983
Dry.

00:02:15.983 --> 00:02:20.215
(Applause)

00:02:20.215 --> 00:02:25.429
Audience: Shake.

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:28.361
Fold.

00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:30.939
JS: Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.821
because it allows interstitial suspension.

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:38.299
You don't have to remember that part, but trust me.

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.352
(Laughter)

00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:50.069
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.731
JS: Cuts itself.

00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:56.888
You know the funny thing is,

00:02:56.888 --> 00:02:59.063
I get my hands drier than people do with three or four,

00:02:59.063 --> 00:03:01.511
because they can't get in between the cracks.

00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:04.655
If you think this isn't as good...

00:03:04.655 --> 00:03:13.124
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:03:13.124 --> 00:03:16.692
JS: Now, there's now a real fancy invention,

00:03:16.692 --> 00:03:19.099
it's the one where you wave your hand

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.890
and it kicks it out.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.976
It's way too big a towel.

00:03:22.976 --> 00:03:24.003
Let me tell you a secret.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.090
If you're really quick, if you're really quick --

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.670
and I can prove this --

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.519
this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building.

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.886
How? As soon as it starts, you just tear it off.

00:03:35.886 --> 00:03:37.558
It's smart enough to stop.

00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:41.550
And you get half a towel.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:54.827
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:03:54.827 --> 00:04:01.661
JS: Now, let's all say it together. Shake. Fold.

00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:05.804
You will for the rest of your life remember those words

00:04:05.804 --> 00:04:08.787
every time you pick up a paper towel.

00:04:08.787 --> 00:04:13.875
And remember, one towel per person for one year --

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:18.595
571,230,000 pounds of paper. No small thing.

00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:20.843
And next year, toilet paper.

00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:22.219
(Laughter)
