00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.980
Just over a year ago,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.036
for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.340
I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.676
I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.900
and a coldness.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.116
And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.580
but definitely there.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.916
Now, when you wake from a deep sleep,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.196
you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.956
but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.196
of a continuity between then and now.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.436
Coming round from
anesthesia is very different.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.956
I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.396
five years or even 50 years.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.876
I simply wasn't there.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.140
It was total oblivion.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.116
Anesthesia --
it's a modern kind of magic.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.316
It turns people into objects,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.340
and then, we hope, back again into people.

00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:00.596
And in this process

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.860
is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.836
How does consciousness happen?

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.076
Somehow, within each of our brains,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.996
the combined activity
of many billions of neurons,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.036
each one a tiny biological machine,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.876
is generating a conscious experience.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.836
And not just any conscious experience --

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.241
your conscious experience
right here and right now.

00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:21.465
How does this happen?

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.436
Answering this question is so important

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.316
because consciousness
for each of us is all there is.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.340
Without it there's no world,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.596
there's no self,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.156
there's nothing at all.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.133
And when we suffer, we suffer consciously

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:37.237
whether it's through
mental illness or pain.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.156
And if we can experience
joy and suffering,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.620
what about other animals?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.556
Might they be conscious, too?

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.236
Do they also have a sense of self?

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.396
And as computers get faster and smarter,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.996
maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.756
when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.260
I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.156
And I think this because
my research is telling me

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.836
that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.436
and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.156
Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.740
You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.716
In the story I'm going to tell you,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.076
our conscious experiences
of the world around us,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.436
and of ourselves within it,

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.996
are kinds of controlled hallucinations

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.860
that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.996
Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.756
about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.916
Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.156
But in fact,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.316
the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.116
If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.300
you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.940
and sometimes even philosophers.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.596
All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.340
and what happens when it goes wrong.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.836
And the strategy is very simple.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.836
I'd like you to think about consciousness

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.076
in the way that we've
come to think about life.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.716
At one time, people thought
the property of being alive

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.356
could not be explained
by physics and chemistry --

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.540
that life had to be
more than just mechanism.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.196
But people no longer think that.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.836
As biologists got on with the job

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.436
of explaining the properties
of living systems

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.276
in terms of physics and chemistry --

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.356
things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis --

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.196
the basic mystery of what life is
started to fade away,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.276
and people didn't propose
any more magical solutions,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.300
like a force of life or an Ã©lan vital.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.556
So as with life, so with consciousness.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.876
Once we start explaining its properties

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.596
in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.036
the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.796
should start to fade away.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.540
At least that's the plan.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.356
So let's get started.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.356
What are the properties of consciousness?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.904
What should a science
of consciousness try to explain?

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.476
Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.876
There are experiences
of the world around us,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.116
full of sights, sounds and smells,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.060
there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.380
And then there's conscious self.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.356
The specific experience
of being you or being me.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.396
The lead character in this inner movie,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.780
and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.116
Let's start with experiences
of the world around us,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.875
and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine.

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:29.659
Imagine being a brain.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.075
You're locked inside a bony skull,

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.316
trying to figure
what's out there in the world.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.356
There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.156
All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.356
which are only indirectly related
to things in the world,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.580
whatever they may be.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.476
So perception --
figuring out what's there --

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.356
has to be a process of informed guesswork

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.516
in which the brain combines
these sensory signals

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.596
with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.756
to form its best guess
of what caused those signals.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.476
The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.860
What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.780
Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.196
You might have seen this illusion before,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.476
but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.556
If you look at those two patches, A and B,

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.900
they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right?

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.836
But they are in fact
exactly the same shade.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.196
And I can illustrate this.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.436
If I put up a second version
of the image here

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.476
and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.156
you can see there's no difference.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.956
It's exactly the same shade of gray.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.636
And if you still don't believe me,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.900
I'll bring the bar across
and join them up.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.860
It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.276
This isn't any kind of magic trick.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.716
It's the same shade of gray,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.940
but take it away again,
and it looks different.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.316
So what's happening here

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.156
is that the brain
is using its prior expectations

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.276
built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.996
that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.660
so that we see B as lighter
than it really is.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.996
Here's one more example,

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.196
which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.516
to change what we consciously experience.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.740
Have a listen to this.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.300
(Distorted voice)

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.716
Sounded strange, right?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.169
Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.540
(Distorted voice)

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.956
Still strange.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.180
Now listen to this.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.796
(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.156
(Laughter)

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.396
Which I do.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.236
So you heard some words there, right?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.356
Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.436
(Distorted voice)

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.956
Yeah? So you can now hear words there.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.180
Once more for luck.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.860
(Distorted voice)

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.076
OK, so what's going on here?

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.676
The remarkable thing is the sensory
information coming into the brain

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.900
hasn't changed at all.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.036
All that's changed
is your brain's best guess

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.116
of the causes of that sensory information.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.500
And that changes
what you consciously hear.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.516
All this puts the brain
basis of perception

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.996
in a bit of a different light.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.036
Instead of perception depending largely
on signals coming into the brain

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.596
from the outside world,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.116
it depends as much, if not more,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.060
on perceptual predictions
flowing in the opposite direction.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.036
We don't just passively
perceive the world,

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.756
we actively generate it.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.396
The world we experience
comes as much, if not more,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.756
from the inside out

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.100
as from the outside in.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.636
Let me give you
one more example of perception

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.540
as this active, constructive process.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.356
Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.356
to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.716
on experience.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.636
In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world --

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.556
which is in this case Sussex campus --

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.140
into a psychedelic playground.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.436
We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.556
to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.196
In this case, to see dogs.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.356
And you can see
this is a very strange thing.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.476
When perceptual
predictions are too strong,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.876
as they are here,

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.796
the result looks very much
like the kinds of hallucinations

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.836
people might report in altered states,

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.940
or perhaps even in psychosis.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.607
Now, think about this for a minute.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:28.076
If hallucination is a kind
of uncontrolled perception,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.556
then perception right here and right now
is also a kind of hallucination,

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.596
but a controlled hallucination

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.516
in which the brain's predictions
are being reigned in

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.420
by sensory information from the world.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.996
In fact, we're all
hallucinating all the time,

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.396
including right now.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.236
It's just that when we agree
about our hallucinations,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.460
we call that reality.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.036
(Laughter)

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.396
Now I'm going to tell you
that your experience of being a self,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.236
the specific experience of being you,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.756
is also a controlled hallucination
generated by the brain.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.796
This seems a very strange idea, right?

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.956
Yes, visual illusions
might deceive my eyes,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.500
but how could I be deceived
about what it means to be me?

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.236
For most of us,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.836
the experience of being a person

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.956
is so familiar, so unified
and so continuous

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.196
that it's difficult
not to take it for granted.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.036
But we shouldn't take it for granted.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.276
There are in fact many different ways
we experience being a self.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.396
There's the experience of having a body

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.876
and of being a body.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.036
There are experiences
of perceiving the world

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.700
from a first person point of view.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.276
There are experiences
of intending to do things

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.020
and of being the cause of things
that happen in the world.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.716
And there are experiences

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.636
of being a continuous
and distinctive person over time,

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.500
built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.316
Many experiments show,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.676
and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well,

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.596
that these different ways
in which we experience being a self

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.316
can all come apart.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.236
What this means is
the basic background experience

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.836
of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.516
Another experience,
which just like all others,

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.740
requires explanation.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.316
So let's return to the bodily self.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.076
How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.356
and of having a body?

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.236
Well, just the same principles apply.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.716
The brain makes its best guess

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.940
about what is and what is not
part of its body.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.436
And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.436
And unlike most neuroscience experiments,

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.956
this is one you can do at home.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.876
All you need is one of these.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.156
(Laughter)

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.620
And a couple of paintbrushes.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.076
In the rubber hand illusion,

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.076
a person's real hand is hidden from view,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.716
and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.996
Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.700
while the person stares at the fake hand.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.116
Now, for most people, after a while,

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.236
this leads to the very uncanny sensation

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.860
that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.636
And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.036
on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be,

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.836
is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.076
that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.700
(Laughter)

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.316
So you can measure
all kinds of clever things.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.636
You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses,

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.916
but there's no need.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.876
It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.316
This means that even experiences
of what our body is

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.876
is a kind of best guessing --

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.380
a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.500
There's one more thing.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.596
We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside,

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.356
we also experience them from within.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.620
We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.396
And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.476
are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs,

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.156
how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.396
lots of things.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.900
This kind of perception,
which we call interoception,

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.916
is rather overlooked.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.356
But it's critically important

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.716
because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body --

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.340
well, that's what keeps us alive.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.636
Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.156
This is from our lab at Sussex.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.596
And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand,

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.996
which flashes red and back

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.276
either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.756
And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat,

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.900
people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.036
So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.460
in perceiving our bodies from within.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.156
There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to,

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.836
which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.916
from experiences of the world around us.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.636
When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects --

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.836
tables, chairs, rubber hands,

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.596
people, you lot --

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.596
even my own body in the world,

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.876
I can perceive it
as an object from the outside.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.956
But my experiences
of the body from within,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.396
they're not like that at all.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.476
I don't perceive my kidneys here,

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.076
my liver here,

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.356
my spleen ...

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.276
I don't know where my spleen is,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.676
but it's somewhere.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.596
I don't perceive my insides as objects.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.260
In fact, I don't experience them
much at all unless they go wrong.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.700
And this is important, I think.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.516
Perception of the internal
state of the body

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.396
isn't about figuring out what's there,

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.556
it's about control and regulation --

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.476
keeping the physiological variables
within the tight bounds

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.340
that are compatible with survival.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.316
When the brain uses predictions
to figure out what's there,

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.436
we perceive objects
as the causes of sensations.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.076
When the brain uses predictions
to control and regulate things,

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.260
we experience how well
or how badly that control is going.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.516
So our most basic experiences
of being a self,

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.596
of being an embodied organism,

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.580
are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.916
And when we follow this idea
all the way through,

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.636
we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:03.396
since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception,

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.836
all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.476
We experience the world and ourselves

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.580
with, through and because of
our living bodies.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.780
Let me bring things together step-by-step.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.956
What we consciously see depends

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.276
on the brain's best guess
of what's out there.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.676
Our experienced world
comes from the inside out,

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.940
not just the outside in.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.676
The rubber hand illusion shows
that this applies to our experiences

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.540
of what is and what is not our body.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.956
And these self-related predictions
depend critically on sensory signals

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.740
coming from deep inside the body.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.436
And finally,

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.836
experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.540
than figuring out what's there.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.876
So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it --

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.156
well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.076
that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.860
to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.980
We predict ourselves into existence.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.820
Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.676
First, just as we can
misperceive the world,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.476
we can misperceive ourselves

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.636
when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.876
Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology,

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.516
because we can finally
get at the mechanisms

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.436
rather than just treating the symptoms

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.980
in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.756
Second:

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.596
what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.996
a software program running on a robot,

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.236
however smart or sophisticated.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.876
We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.156
whose conscious experiences
are shaped at all levels

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.156
by the biological mechanisms
that keep us alive.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.820
Just making computers smarter
is not going to make them sentient.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.116
Finally,

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.116
our own individual inner universe,

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.796
our way of being conscious,

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.580
is just one possible
way of being conscious.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.636
And even human consciousness generally --

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.636
it's just a tiny region in a vast space
of possible consciousnesses.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.316
Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us,

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.556
but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.180
shared with many other living creatures.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.700
Now, these are fundamental changes

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.836
in how we understand ourselves,

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.716
but I think they should be celebrated,

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.116
because as so often in science,
from Copernicus --

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.140
we're not at the center of the universe --

00:16:22.164 --> 00:16:23.396
to Darwin --

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.636
we're related to all other creatures --

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.860
to the present day.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.876
With a greater sense of understanding

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.316
comes a greater sense of wonder,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.196
and a greater realization

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.820
that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.940
And ...

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.916
when the end of consciousness comes,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.740
there's nothing to be afraid of.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.580
Nothing at all.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.516
Thank you.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:59.566
(Applause)
