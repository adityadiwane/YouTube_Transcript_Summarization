00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
and actually all the way down into the sewer

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
because I want to talk about diarrhea.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.330
And in particular, I want to talk about

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
the design of diarrhea.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
And when evolutionary biologists talk about design,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.330
they really mean design by natural selection.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
And that brings me to the title of the talk,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.330
"Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently."

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.330
And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
But I'm not just doing this to be cute.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
I really think that this subtitle explains

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
what somebody like me, who's sort of a Darwin wannabe,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
how they actually look at one's role in

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
It's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
You actually see a great potential,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.330
and may actually be very resistant, when one tries

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
to introduce ideas.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.330
So, all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
One is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful?

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
And a very closely related question, which is,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.330
how can we take control of this situation once we understand

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.330
the answer to the first question?

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
How can we make the harmful organisms more mild?

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
And I'm going to be talking, to begin with, as I said,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
about diarrheal disease organisms.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
that cause acute infectious disease,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
germ's-eye view.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.330
And in particular, to think about a fundamental idea

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
in the harmfulness of disease organisms.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.330
And that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
disease organisms have to get from one host to another,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.330
and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
to move them to another host.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
But not always.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
Sometimes, you get disease organisms

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
And when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.330
that natural selection will favor the more exploitative,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
more predator-like organisms.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
So, natural selection will favor organisms

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
that are more likely to cause damage.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.330
If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
then we expect that the winners of the competition

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
will be the milder organisms.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
So, if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
and actual selection favors pathogens

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
that take advantage of those hosts,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
for their own reproductive success.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.330
But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.330
So, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
They can be transmitted from person-to-person contact,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
person-to-food-then-to-person contact,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
when somebody eats contaminated food,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
or they can be transmitted through the water.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
And when they're transmitted through the water,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
unlike the first two modes of transmission,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.330
these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens, even hundreds

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.330
of other individuals.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
To sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
if you've got a sick person in bed,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.330
They're going to wash those contaminated materials,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.330
and then the water may move into sources of drinking water.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
People will come in to those places where you've got

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.330
contaminated drinking water,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.330
bring things back to the family,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.330
may drink right at that point.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
The whole point is that a person who can't move

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
can still infect many other individuals.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
And so, the theory tells us that

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.330
when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
we expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
And you can test these ideas.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
So, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
and see whether or not the ones that tend to be

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
more transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
And the answer is -- yep, they are.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
but the main point here is that --

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.330
(Laughter)

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.330
there's a lot of them here, I can tell --

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.330
the main point here is that those data points

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
all show a very strong, positive association between

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.330
the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.330
and how harmful they are,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
how much death they cause per untreated infection.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
So this suggests we're on the right track.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.330
But this, to me, suggests that we really need

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.330
to ask some additional questions.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
how can we use this knowledge

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
to make disease organisms evolve to be mild?

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
Now, this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
you could cause disease organisms to shift from

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
But it doesn't tell you how long.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
I mean, if this would require thousands of years,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
But if it could occur in just a few years,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.330
then it might be a very important way to control

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
In other words, this suggests that we could

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
domesticate these organisms.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
We could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
And so, as I was thinking about this, I focused on this organism,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.330
which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.330
And that is the species of organism that is responsible

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
for causing cholera.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.330
is that we understand why it's so harmful.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
It's harmful because it produces a toxin,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
and that toxin is released when the organism

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.330
gets into our intestinal tract.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.330
It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
into the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
and then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
So what happens, if you've got an organism,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.330
it produces a lot of toxin.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
After a few days of infection you end up having --

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
It's sort of cloudy water.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
And if you took a drop of that water,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
you might find a million diarrheal organisms.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
If the organism produced a lot of toxin,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
you might find 10 million, or 100 million.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin,

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
then you might find a smaller number.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.330
So the task is to try to figure out

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.330
how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
by person-to-person contact,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.330
or person-food-person contact --

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
both of which would really require that people be

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
mobile and fairly healthy for transmission.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
Now, I can think of some possible experiments.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.330
One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism --

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
some that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little --

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.330
and take those strains and spew them out in different countries.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
Some countries that might have clean water supplies,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.330
so that you can't get waterborne transmission:

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.330
you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.330
Other countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
there you expect these organisms to evolve

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.330
towards a high level of harmfulness, right?

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
There's a little ethical problem in this experiment.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.330
I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
That makes me worry a little bit.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.330
(Laughter)

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
But anyhow, the laughter makes me feel a little bit better.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
And this ethical problem's a big problem.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
Just to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
Here's a girl who's almost dead.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
She got rehydration therapy, she perked up,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.330
within a few days she was looking like a completely different person.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
So, we don't want to run an experiment like that.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.330
But interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.330
In 1991, this cholera organism got into Lima, Peru,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
Now, I don't know how that happened,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.330
and I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
I don't think anybody knows,

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.330
but I'm not averse to, once that's happened,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
to see whether or not the prediction that we would make,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.330
that I did make before, actually holds up.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
which has some of the most well protected water supplies

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.330
in Latin America?

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.330
And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
which has some of the least well protected?

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
And Peru's got something sort of in between.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.330
And so, with funding from the Bosack-Kruger Foundation,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
I got a lot of strains from these different countries

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
and we measured their toxin production in the lab.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.330
And we found that in Chile -- within two months of the invasion of Peru

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
you had strains entering Chile --

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
and when you look at those strains,

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
in the very far left-hand side of this graph,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
you see a lot of variation in the toxin production.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
Each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person --

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
a lot of variation on which natural selection can act.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
But the interesting point is, if you look over the 1990s,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.330
within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.330
They evolved to produce less toxin.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
And to just give you a sense of how important this might be,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:07.330
if we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera,

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
on average, reported from Chile every two years.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
So, it's controlled.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
That's how much we have in America,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
cholera that's acquired endemically,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
and we don't think we've got a problem here.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
They didn't -- they solved the problem in Chile.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.330
But, before we get too confident, we'd better look at some of those other countries,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
Well, in Peru it didn't.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
And in Ecuador -- remember, this is the place where it has

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
the highest potential waterborne transmission --

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.330
it looked like it got more harmful.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.330
In every case there's a lot of variation,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
but something about the environment the people are living in,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
and I think the only realistic explanation is that it's

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
the degree of waterborne transmission,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.330
favored the harmful strains in one place, and mild strains in another.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
So, this is very encouraging,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
if we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
It would make these organisms evolve to mildness,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
so that even though people might be getting infected,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
they'd be infected with mild strains.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
It wouldn't be causing severe disease.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
But there's another really interesting aspect of this,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
evolution of harmfulness,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.330
And the idea is very simple.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
If you've got a harmful organism,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
so you get increased virulence leading to

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
And once you get increased antibiotic resistance,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
So, you've got a higher level of virulence.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
So, you get this vicious cycle.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
The goal is to turn this around.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
by cleaning up the water supply,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.330
in antibiotic resistance.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
So, we can go to the same countries and look and see.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem?

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
If we look in the beginning of the 1990s,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
we see, again, a lot of variation.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.330
In this case, on the Y-axis, we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity --

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
and I won't go into that.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
But we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
Peru and Ecuador, and no trend across the years.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.330
But if we look at the end of the 1990s, just half a decade later,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
Antibiotic sensitivity was going down.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.330
And in Chile, you still had antibiotic sensitivity.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
So, it looks like Chile dodged two bullets.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
They got the organism to evolve to mildness,

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330
and they got no development of antibiotic resistance.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
Now, these ideas should apply across the board,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.330
as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.330
And I want to give you just one more example,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
because we've talked a little bit about malaria.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
And the example I want to deal with is,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.330
or the idea I want to deal with, the question is,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness?

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
Now, malaria's transmitted by a mosquito,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.330
and normally if you're infected with malaria, and you're feeling sick,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.330
And you can show, just by looking at data from literature,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
that vector-borne diseases are more harmful

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
than non-vector-borne diseases.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.330
But I think there's a really fascinating example

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.330
of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
In the case of waterborne transmission,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
we'd like to clean up the water supplies,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.330
In the case of malaria, what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
And the logic's a little more subtle here.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
If you mosquito-proof houses,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
when people get sick, they're sitting in bed --

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
or in mosquito-proof hospitals, they're sitting in a hospital bed --

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
and the mosquitoes can't get to them.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
So, if you're a harmful variant

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.330
in a place where you've got mosquito-proof housing, then you're a loser.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.330
The only pathogens that get transmitted

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
to walk outside and get mosquito bites.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
So, if you were to mosquito proof houses,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
And there's a really wonderful experiment that was done

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.330
that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.330
And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
Just to give you a little perspective on this,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.330
I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
which is right there in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
And this really cool experiment was done

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330
about 200 miles south of there, in Northern Alabama,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.330
by the Tennessee Valley Authority.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
They had dammed up the Tennessee River.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
They'd caused the water to back up,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
they needed electric, hydroelectric power.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
And when you get stagnant water, you get mosquitoes.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.330
They found in the late '30s -- 10 years after they'd made these dams --

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:33.330
that the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
about a third to half of them were infected with malaria.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
This shows you the positions of some of these dams.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.330
OK, so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.330
There wasn't DDT, there wasn't chloroquines: what do they do?

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
Well, they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
So they did. They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.330
and within three years, about 100 dollars per house,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
they mosquito proofed every house.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
And these are the data.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.330
Every row across here represents one of those 11 zones.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.330
And the asterisks represent the time at which

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.330
the mosquito proofing was complete.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
And so what you can see is that

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
just the mosquito-proofed housing, and nothing else,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
caused the eradication of malaria.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
And this was, incidentally, published in 1949,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
in the leading textbook of malaria, called "Boyd's Malariology."

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
But almost no malaria experts even know it exists.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
This is important,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.330
Now, I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.330
Like, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
sub-Saharan Africa.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.330
But as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria,

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
you're certainly not going to eradicate.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.330
But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.330
So to me, it's an experiment that's waiting to happen,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.330
and if it confirms the prediction, then

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
we should have a very powerful tool.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.330
In a way, much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
because most of what's being done today is

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
to rely on things like anti-malarial drugs.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.330
And we know that, although it's great to make those

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:08.330
anti-malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.330
we know that when you make them highly available

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.330
you're going to get resistance to those drugs.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.330
And so it's a short-term solution.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.330
This is a long-term solution.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
What I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
working in the direction we want it to go,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.330
that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
for example with anti-malarial drugs.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.330
So, this table I've given just to emphasize

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.330
that I've only talked about two examples.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.330
But as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
for infectious diseases, and it ought to.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.330
Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.330
We're dealing with living systems;

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.330
we're dealing with systems that evolve.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
And so if you do something with those systems,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
they're going to evolve one way or another.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.330
And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.330
so that -- we need to adjust our interventions

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.330
to get the most bang for the intervention buck,

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.330
so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
So, I don't really have time to talk about those things,

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.330
but I did want to put them up there,

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.330
just to give you a sense that there really are solutions

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.330
to controlling the evolution of harmfulness

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.330
of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.330
And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.330
So, for example, earlier today there was discussion of,

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:34.330
how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV?

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.330
What this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.330
Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area?

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.330
It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:46.330
encourage people to stay more faithful to partners, and so on.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.330
But the key thing is to figure out how to lower it,

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.330
because if we lower it, we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.330
And the data really do support this:

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.330
that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:01.330
And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.330
So the other thing I really like about this,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.330
besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.330
into the study of control of disease,

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.330
is that often the kinds of interventions that you want,

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.330
that it indicates should be done,

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.330
are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:19.330
But people just haven't been able to justify the cost.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.330
So, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about.

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.330
If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water,

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.330
then I think that we can say,

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:31.330
let's push the effort into that aspect of the control,

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.330
so that we can actually solve the problem,

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.330
even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection,

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.330
you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.330
just by cleaning up water supply.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.330
Anyhow, I'll end that there, and thank you very much.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.330
(Applause)
