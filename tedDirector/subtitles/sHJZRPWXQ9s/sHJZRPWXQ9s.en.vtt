00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Lauren Hodge: If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
which would you choose, grilled or fried chicken?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Now most people would answer grilled,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
However, grilled chicken poses a hidden danger.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines --

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
or PhIP --

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
(laughter)

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
A carcinogen is any substance or agent

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
that causes abnormal growth of cells,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
which can also cause them to metastasize or spread.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
They are also organic compounds

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
is replaced with a more complex group.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Studies show that antioxidants

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
However, no studies exist yet

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that show how or why.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And I was led to it through a series of events.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office --

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
(Laughter)

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and seven different fast food restaurants.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
They weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.260
but they were sued because of California's Proposition 65,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
which stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
then the companies had to give a clear warning.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
So I was very surprised about this.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
And I was wondering why nobody knew more

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
about this dangerous grilled chicken,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
which doesn't seem very harmful.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
But then one night, my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and I noticed that the edges of the chicken,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
which had been marinated in lemon juice, turned white.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And later in biology class, I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
which is where the proteins will change shape

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and lose their ability to chemically function.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
saying that, could possibly

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and could it be due to the differences in PH?

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
So my idea was born,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
and I had the project set up and a hypothesis,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
so what was my next step?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
because I didn't have the equipment in my school.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
I thought this would be easy,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
but I emailed about 200 different people

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
within a five-hour radius of where I lived,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Most of the others either never responded back,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
said they didn't have the time

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So it was a big commitment

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
to drive to the lab to work multiple times.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
However, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab --

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
so I could finally start my project.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
The first stage was completed at home,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
which consisted of marinating the chicken,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
grilling the chicken, amassing it

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and preparing it to be transported to the lab.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
The second stage was completed

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
at the Penn State University main campus lab,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
which is where I extracted the chemicals,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and separated the compounds I needed

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
from the rest of the chicken.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
The final stages, when I ran the samples

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
through a high-pressure

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
liquid chromatography mass spectrometer,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
in my chicken.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
So when I went through the data, I had very surprising results,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
actually inhibited the carcinogen formation.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
When compared with the unmarinated chicken,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
which is what I used as my control,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
I found that lemon juice worked by far the best,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
which decreased the carcinogens

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
by about 98 percent.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
also worked very well,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
decreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
but it was nearly negligible.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And the soy sauce results were inconclusive

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
because of the large data range,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
but it seems like soy sauce

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
actually increased the potential carcinogens.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Another important factor that I didn't take into account initially

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
was the time cooked.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And I found that if you increase the time cooked,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
So the best way to marinate chicken, based on this,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
is to, not under-cook,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
but definitely don't over-cook and char the chicken,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and marinate in either lemon juice, brown sugar or saltwater.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.260
(Applause)

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Based on these findings, I have a question for you.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
that could potentially save your life?

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
you're definitely going to catch cancer and die.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
However, anything you can do

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Is it worth it to you?

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
How will you cook your chicken now?

00:04:49.260 --> 00:05:05.260
(Applause)

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Shree Bose: Hi everyone. I'm Shree Bose.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
I was the 17-18 year-old age category winner

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
and then the grand prize winner.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And I want all of you

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
to imagine a little girl

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
holding a dead blue spinach plant.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
that little kids will eat their vegetables

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
if they're different colors.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Sounds ridiculous, right.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
But that was me years ago.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
And that was my first science fair project.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
It got a bit more complicated from there.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
My older brother Panaki Bose

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
when I barely understood basic algebra.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
including a remote controlled garbage can.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
(Laughter)

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And then came the summer after my freshman year,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
when my grandfather passed away due to cancer.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And I remember watching my family go through that

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and thinking that I never wanted another family

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
to feel that kind of loss.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
So, armed with all the wisdom

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
of freshman year biology,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
I decided I wanted to do cancer research

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
at 15.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Good plan.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
So I started emailing all of these professors in my area

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.260
asking to work under their supervision in a lab.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Got rejected by all except one.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And then went on, my next summer,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
to work under Dr. Basu

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth, Texas.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
And that is where the research began.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
So ovarian cancer

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
is one of those cancers that most people don't know about,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
or at least don't pay that much attention to.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
But yet, it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
among women in the United States.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
In fact, one in 70 women

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
One in 100

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
will die from it.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Chemotherapy, one of the most effective ways

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
used to treat cancer today,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
to try and kill off cancer cells.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
Cisplatin is a relatively common

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug --

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
a relatively simple molecule made in the lab

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
that messes with the DNA of cancer cells

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
and causes them to kill themselves.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
Sounds great, right?

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
But here's the problem:

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
sometimes patients become resistant to the drug,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
they come back.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And this time, they no longer respond to the drug.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
It's a huge problem.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
In fact, it's one of the biggest problems

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
with chemotherapy today.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
So we wanted to figure out

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
to this drug called Cisplatin.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
And we wanted to figure this out,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
because if we could figure that out,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
So that's what we set out to do.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
an energy protein.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
and we saw this huge shift.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
I mean, on the slide, you can see

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
that on our sensitive side,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
these cells that are responding to the drug,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
when we start blocking the protein,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
the number of dying cells -- those colored dots --

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
they're going down.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
But then on this side, with the same treatment,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
they're going up -- interesting.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
But those are dots on a screen for you;

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
what exactly does that mean?

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Well basically that means

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
that this protein is changing

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.260
And in fact, it might be changing the cells themselves

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
to make the cells resistant.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And that's huge.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
In fact, it means that if a patient comes in

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
and they're resistant to this drug,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
then if we give them a chemical to block this protein,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
then we can treat them again

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
with the same drug.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness --

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.260
possibly for many different types of cancer.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
So that was my work,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
and it was my way of reimagining the future

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.260
for future research, with figuring out exactly what this protein does,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness --

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
so maybe all grandfathers with cancer

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.260
But my work wasn't just about the research.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
It was about finding my passion.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
That's why being the grand prize winner

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
of the Google Global Science Fair --

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
cute picture, right --

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And ever since then,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff --

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
from getting to meet the president

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
to getting to be on this stage

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
to talk to all of you guys.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
But like I said, my journey wasn't just about the research,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
it was about finding my passion,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and it was about making my own opportunities

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
when I didn't even know what I was doing.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
It was about inspiration

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
and determination

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
and never giving up on my interest

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
for science and learning and growing.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
After all, my story begins

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
with a dried, withered spinach plant

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
and it's only getting better from there.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Thank you.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:21.260
(Applause)

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
Naomi Shah: Hi everyone. I'm Naomi Shah,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and today I'll be talking to you about my research

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
involving indoor air quality

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and asthmatic patients.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
1.6 million deaths worldwide.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
One death every 20 seconds.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.260
People spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
And the economic burden of asthma

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
Now these statistics had a huge impact on me,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
but what really sparked my interest in my research

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
was watching both my dad and my brother

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
suffer from chronic allergies year-round.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
It confused me;

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
why did these allergy symptoms persist

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
well past the pollen season?

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
With this question in mind, I started researching,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
As soon as I realized this,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
I investigated the underlying relationship

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
between four prevalent air pollutants

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
At first, I just wanted to figure out

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
on the lung health of asthmatic patients.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
But soon after, I developed a novel mathematical model

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
that essentially quantifies the effect

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
of these environmental pollutants

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
on the lung health of asthmatic patients.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
And it surprises me

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
that no model currently exists

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
that quantifies the effect of environmental factors

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
on human lung health,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
because that relationship seems so important.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
So with that in mind,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
I started researching more, I started investigating more,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
and I became very passionate.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Because I realized

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
that if we could find a way to target remediation,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
we could also find a way

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.260
to treat asthmatic patients more effectively.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
For example, volatile organic compounds

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
are chemical pollutants

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
that are found in our schools, homes and workplaces.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
They're everywhere.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
These chemical pollutants

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
are currently not a criteria air pollutant,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Which is surprising to me,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
because these chemical pollutants, through my research,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
I show that they had a very large negative impact

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
on the lung health of asthmatic patients

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
and thus should be regulated.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
So today I want to show you

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
my interactive software model that I created.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
I'm going to show it to you on my laptop.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
Julie.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And all of Julie's data has been pre-entered

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
into my interactive software model.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
And this can be used by anyone.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
So I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
or someone who's really close to you

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
So Julie's going to her doctor's office

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
to get treated for her asthma.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
And the doctor has her sit down,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate --

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
which is essentially her exhalation rate,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
So that peak expiratory flow rate,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
I've entered it up into the interactive software model.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
I've also entered in her age, her gender and her height.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
I've assumed that she lives in an average household

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
with average air pollutant levels.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
So any user can come in here

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
and click on "lung function report"

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
and it'll take them to this report that I created.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.260
And this report really drives home the crux of my research.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.260
So what it shows -- if you want to focus on that top graph in the right-hand corner --

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
in the yellow bar.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
This is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
what her exhalation rate or lung health, should be

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
based on her age, gender and height.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and he says, "Wow, we need to give her steroids,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
medication and inhalers."

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
But I want everyone here to reimagine a world

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
where instead of prescribing steroids,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
inhalers and medication,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
the doctor turns to Julie and says,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
"Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Clean out the air ducts in your home,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
in your workplace, in your school.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
Stop the use of incense and candles.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And if you're remodeling your house,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring."

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
Because these solutions are natural,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
these solutions are sustainable,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
and these solutions are long-term investments --

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
long-term investments that we're making

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
for our generation and for future generations.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Because these environmental solutions

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
that Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
are impacting everyone that lives around her.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
So I'm very passionate about this research

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and I really want to continue it

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
and expand it to more disorders besides asthma,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
more respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
But before I end my talk today,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
I want to leave you with one saying.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
And that saying is that genetics loads the gun,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
but the environment pulls the trigger.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
And that made a huge impact on me

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
when I was doing this research.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
Because what I feel, is a lot of us think

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
that the environment is at a macro level,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
that we can't do anything to change our air quality

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
or to change the climate or anything.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
in our own school and in our own workplace,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
we can make a huge difference in air quality.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.260
Because remember, we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
And air quality and air pollutants

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
anyone with a respiratory disorder

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
and really all of us in general.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
So I want you to reimagine a world

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
with better air quality,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
better quality of life

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
and better quality of living for everyone

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
including our future generations.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Thank you.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:56.260
(Applause)

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
Lisa Ling: Right.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly?

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
Your Google Science Fair champions.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
Your winners.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
(Applause)
