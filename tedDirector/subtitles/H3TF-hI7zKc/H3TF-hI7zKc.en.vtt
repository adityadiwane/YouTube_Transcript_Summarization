00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:14.177
I'm assuming everyone here has watched

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:18.541
a TED Talk online at one time or another, right?

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.643
So what I'm going to do is play this.

00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:23.494
This is the song from the TED Talks online.

00:00:23.494 --> 00:00:27.775
(Music)

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:31.540
And I'm going to slow it down

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.321
because things sound cooler when they're slower.

00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:43.683
(Music)

00:01:18.683 --> 00:01:22.348
Ken Robinson: Good morning. How are you?

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:25.688
Mark Applebaum: I'm going to --
Kate Stone: -- mix some music.

00:01:25.688 --> 00:01:27.794
MA: I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story.

00:01:27.794 --> 00:01:30.905
Tod Machover: Something nobody's ever heard before.

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:32.399
KS: I have a crossfader.

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.048
Julian Treasure: I call this the mixer.

00:01:34.048 --> 00:01:35.348
KS: Two D.J. decks.

00:01:35.348 --> 00:01:39.081
Chris Anderson: You turn up the 
dials, the wheel starts to turn.

00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:44.953
Dan Ellsey: I have always loved music.

00:01:44.953 --> 00:01:47.468
Michael Tilson Thomas: Is it a melody 
or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude?

00:01:47.468 --> 00:01:50.124
Daniel Wolpert: Feeling everything 
that's going on inside my body.

00:01:50.124 --> 00:01:56.002
Adam Ockelford: In your brain is 
this amazing musical computer.

00:01:56.002 --> 00:02:04.147
MTT: Using computers and synthesizers to create 
works. It's a language that's still evolving.

00:02:07.647 --> 00:02:10.074
And the 21st century.

00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:12.712
KR: Turn on the radio. Pop into the discotheque.

00:02:12.712 --> 00:02:18.180
You will know what this person 
is doing: moving to the music.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.982
Mark Ronson: This is my favorite part.

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:34.197
MA: You gotta have doorstops. That's important.

00:02:34.197 --> 00:02:35.884
TM: We all love music a great deal.

00:02:35.884 --> 00:02:39.044
MTT: Anthems, dance crazes, ballads and marches.

00:02:39.044 --> 00:02:42.767
Kirby Ferguson and JT: The remix: It 
is new music created from old music.

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:45.028
Ryan Holladay: Blend seamlessly.

00:02:45.028 --> 00:02:46.483
Kathryn Schulz: And that's how it goes.

00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:53.918
MTT: What happens when the music stops?

00:02:53.918 --> 00:02:57.684
KS: Yay!

00:02:57.684 --> 00:03:03.594
(Applause)

00:03:03.594 --> 00:03:08.124
MR: Obviously, I've been watching a lot of TED Talks.

00:03:08.124 --> 00:03:11.503
When I was first asked to speak at TED,

00:03:11.503 --> 00:03:13.516
I wasn't quite sure what my angle was, at first,

00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:16.468
so yeah, I immediately started
watching tons of TED Talks,

00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:18.484
which is pretty much absolutely

00:03:18.484 --> 00:03:20.323
the worst thing that you can do

00:03:20.323 --> 00:03:23.151
because you start to go into panic mode, thinking,

00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:26.652
I haven't mounted a successful
expedition to the North Pole yet.

00:03:26.652 --> 00:03:30.552
Neither have I provided electricity

00:03:30.552 --> 00:03:33.149
to my village through sheer ingenuity.

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:35.969
In fact, I've pretty much wasted most of my life

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:37.266
DJing in night clubs

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:39.245
and producing pop records.

00:03:39.245 --> 00:03:41.920
But I still kept watching the videos,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.551
because I'm a masochist,

00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:46.623
and eventually, things like Michael Tilson Thomas

00:03:46.623 --> 00:03:49.439
and Tod Machover, and seeing

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.606
their visceral passion talking about music,

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.433
it definitely stirred something in me,

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.778
and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly

00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:57.169
about the power of music.

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.829
And I started to write down on these little note cards

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.172
every time I heard something

00:04:01.172 --> 00:04:03.387
that struck a chord in me, pardon the pun,

00:04:03.387 --> 00:04:05.143
or something that I thought I could use,

00:04:05.143 --> 00:04:09.810
and pretty soon, my studio looked like this,

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.573
kind of like a John Nash, "Beautiful Mind" vibe.

00:04:13.573 --> 00:04:16.368
The other good thing about watching TED Talks,

00:04:16.368 --> 00:04:18.255
when you see a really good one,

00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:20.188
you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker

00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:23.032
was your best friend, don't you? Like, just for a day.

00:04:23.032 --> 00:04:25.027
They seem like a nice person.

00:04:25.027 --> 00:04:28.009
You'd take a bike ride, maybe share an ice cream.

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.760
You'd certainly learn a lot.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.214
And every now and then they'd chide you,

00:04:32.214 --> 00:04:33.950
when they got frustrated that you couldn't really

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.879
keep up with half of the technical things
they're banging on about all the time.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.348
But then they'd remember that
you're but a mere human

00:04:39.348 --> 00:04:40.830
of ordinary, mortal intelligence

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.229
that didn't finish university,

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.795
and they'd kind of forgive you,

00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:47.390
and pet you like the dog.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.515
(Laughter)

00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:52.253
Man, yeah, back to the real world,

00:04:52.253 --> 00:04:53.780
probably Sir Ken Robinson and I

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.484
are not going to end up being best of friends.

00:04:55.484 --> 00:04:58.917
He lives all the way in L.A.
and I imagine is quite busy,

00:04:58.917 --> 00:05:01.654
but through the tools available to me -- technology

00:05:01.654 --> 00:05:03.922
and the innate way that I approach making music --

00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:06.660
I can sort of bully our existences

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.971
into a shared event,

00:05:07.971 --> 00:05:10.537
which is sort of what you saw.

00:05:10.537 --> 00:05:13.546
I can hear something that I love in a piece of media

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:14.930
and I can co-opt it

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.266
and insert myself in that narrative,

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:20.238
or alter it, even.

00:05:20.238 --> 00:05:21.968
In a nutshell, that's what I was trying to do

00:05:21.968 --> 00:05:24.174
with these things, but more importantly,

00:05:24.174 --> 00:05:26.564
that's what the past 30 years of music has been.

00:05:26.564 --> 00:05:28.252
That's the major thread.

00:05:28.252 --> 00:05:30.975
See, 30 years ago, you had the first digital samplers,

00:05:30.975 --> 00:05:32.460
and they changed everything overnight.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.125
All of a sudden, artists could sample

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.930
from anything and everything that came before them,

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.125
from a snare drum from the Funky Meters,

00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:40.939
to a Ron Carter bassline,

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.010
the theme to "The Price Is Right."

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.143
Albums like De La Soul's "3 Feet High and Rising"

00:05:45.143 --> 00:05:47.297
and the Beastie Boys' "Paul's Boutique"

00:05:47.297 --> 00:05:49.555
looted from decades of recorded music

00:05:49.555 --> 00:05:52.604
to create these sonic, layered masterpieces

00:05:52.604 --> 00:05:54.856
that were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day.

00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:57.503
And they weren't sampling these records

00:05:57.503 --> 00:06:00.312
because they were too lazy to write their own music.

00:06:00.312 --> 00:06:02.277
They weren't sampling these records to cash in on

00:06:02.277 --> 00:06:03.946
the familiarity of the original stuff.

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:05.503
To be honest, it was all about sampling

00:06:05.503 --> 00:06:07.044
really obscure things,

00:06:07.044 --> 00:06:08.532
except for a few obvious exceptions

00:06:08.532 --> 00:06:11.361
like Vanilla Ice and "doo doo doo da da doo doo"

00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:12.770
that we know about.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.205
But the thing is,

00:06:14.205 --> 00:06:15.680
they were sampling those records

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.478
because they heard something in that music

00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:19.643
that spoke to them

00:06:19.643 --> 00:06:21.641
that they instantly wanted to inject themselves

00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:23.137
into the narrative of that music.

00:06:23.137 --> 00:06:24.907
They heard it, they wanted to be a part of it,

00:06:24.907 --> 00:06:26.501
and all of a sudden they found themselves

00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:29.160
in possession of the technology to do so,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.351
not much unlike the way the Delta blues

00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:34.020
struck a chord with the Stones
and the Beatles and Clapton,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.310
and they felt the need to co-opt that music

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.070
for the tools of their day.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.702
You know, in music we take something that we love

00:06:40.702 --> 00:06:42.120
and we build on it.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.740
I'd like to play a song for you.

00:06:52.068 --> 00:06:58.279
(Music: "La Di Da Di" by Doug E. Fresh &amp; Slick Rick)

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.728
That's "La Di Da Di" and it's the fifth-most sampled

00:07:13.728 --> 00:07:15.032
song of all time.

00:07:15.032 --> 00:07:18.202
It's been sampled 547 times.

00:07:18.202 --> 00:07:21.638
It was made in 1984 by these two legends of hip-hop,

00:07:21.638 --> 00:07:24.817
Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh,

00:07:24.817 --> 00:07:28.227
and the Ray-Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong.

00:07:28.227 --> 00:07:30.255
I do hope that comes back soon.

00:07:30.255 --> 00:07:34.348
Anyway, this predated the sampling era.

00:07:34.348 --> 00:07:35.850
There were no samples in this record,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.206
although I did look up on the Internet last night,

00:07:38.206 --> 00:07:40.254
I mean several months ago,

00:07:40.254 --> 00:07:42.779
that "La Di Da Di" means, it's an old

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:45.819
Cockney expression from the late 1800s in England,

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:47.935
so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:49.861
from "Downton Abbey" coming soon,

00:07:49.861 --> 00:07:53.445
or that's for another day.

00:07:53.445 --> 00:07:55.171
Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box.

00:07:55.171 --> 00:07:56.955
Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record,

00:07:56.955 --> 00:08:00.015
and because of Slick Rick's sing-songy,

00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:02.804
super-catchy vocals, it provides endless sound bites

00:08:02.804 --> 00:08:05.546
and samples for future pop records.

00:08:05.546 --> 00:08:06.876
That was 1984.

00:08:06.876 --> 00:08:09.779
This is me in 1984, in case you were wondering

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:12.310
how I was doing, thank you for asking.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.411
It's Throwback Thursday already.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.764
I was involved in a heavy love affair

00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:18.093
with the music of Duran Duran,

00:08:18.093 --> 00:08:20.164
as you can probably tell from my outfit.

00:08:20.164 --> 00:08:21.818
I was in the middle.

00:08:21.818 --> 00:08:23.949
And the simplest way that I knew

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:26.530
how to co-opt myself into that experience

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.463
of wanting to be in that song somehow

00:08:28.463 --> 00:08:30.884
was to just get a band together
of fellow nine-year-olds

00:08:30.884 --> 00:08:33.391
and play "Wild Boys" at the school talent show.

00:08:33.391 --> 00:08:35.880
So that's what we did, and long story short,

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.622
we were booed off the stage,

00:08:37.622 --> 00:08:40.435
and if you ever have a chance to live your life

00:08:40.435 --> 00:08:42.976
escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium

00:08:42.976 --> 00:08:44.529
full of second- and third-graders booing,

00:08:44.529 --> 00:08:47.137
I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun.

00:08:47.137 --> 00:08:48.437
But it didn't really matter,

00:08:48.437 --> 00:08:50.205
because what I wanted somehow

00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:52.932
was to just be in the history
of that song for a minute.

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:54.123
I didn't care who liked it.

00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:57.442
I just loved it, and I thought
I could put myself in there.

00:08:57.442 --> 00:08:59.210
Over the next 10 years, "La Di Da Di"

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.155
continues to be sampled by countless records,

00:09:01.155 --> 00:09:04.879
ending up on massive hits like
"Here Comes the Hotstepper"

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:06.360
and "I Wanna Sex You Up."

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.241
Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this song

00:09:08.241 --> 00:09:12.304
on his debut album "Doggystyle"
and calls it "Lodi Dodi."

00:09:12.304 --> 00:09:14.712
Copyright lawyers are having
a field day at this point.

00:09:14.712 --> 00:09:17.480
And then you fast forward to 1997,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.334
and the Notorious B.I.G., or Biggie,

00:09:20.334 --> 00:09:23.296
reinterprets "La Di Da Di"

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:26.104
on his number one hit called "Hypnotize,"

00:09:26.104 --> 00:09:27.626
which I will play a little bit of

00:09:27.626 --> 00:09:29.208
and I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rick

00:09:29.208 --> 00:09:32.277
to show you where they got it from.

00:09:32.277 --> 00:09:39.218
(Music: "Hypnotize" by The Notorious B.I.G.)

00:09:59.385 --> 00:10:03.372
So Biggie was killed

00:10:03.372 --> 00:10:05.376
weeks before that song made it to number one,

00:10:05.376 --> 00:10:07.578
in one of the great tragedies of the hip-hop era,

00:10:07.578 --> 00:10:09.294
but he would have been 13 years old

00:10:09.294 --> 00:10:11.603
and very much alive when
"La Di Da Di" first came out,

00:10:11.603 --> 00:10:12.865
and as a young boy

00:10:12.865 --> 00:10:14.516
growing up in Brooklyn,

00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:16.658
it's hard not to think that that song probably held

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.089
some fond memories for him.

00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:19.875
But the way he interpreted it, as you hear,

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:21.290
is completely his own.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.365
He flips it, makes it,

00:10:23.365 --> 00:10:25.721
there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it.

00:10:25.721 --> 00:10:28.529
It's thoroughly modern Biggie.

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:30.257
I had to make that joke in this room,

00:10:30.257 --> 00:10:33.083
because you would be the only people
that I'd ever have a chance of getting it.

00:10:33.083 --> 00:10:36.323
And so, it's a groaner. (Laughter)

00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:39.876
Elsewhere in the pop and rap world,

00:10:39.876 --> 00:10:41.792
we're going a little bit sample-crazy.

00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:44.290
We're getting away from the obscure
samples that we were doing,

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.626
and all of a sudden everyone's taking

00:10:45.626 --> 00:10:48.437
these massive '80s tunes like Bowie, "Let's Dance,"

00:10:48.437 --> 00:10:50.816
and all these disco records,
and just rapping on them.

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.660
These records don't really age that well.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.715
You don't hear them now, because they borrowed

00:10:54.715 --> 00:10:56.309
from an era that was too steeped

00:10:56.309 --> 00:10:58.257
in its own connotation.

00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:02.969
You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale.

00:11:02.969 --> 00:11:05.093
It leaves the listener feeling sickly.

00:11:05.093 --> 00:11:07.356
You have to take an element of those things

00:11:07.356 --> 00:11:10.235
and then bring something fresh and new to it,

00:11:10.235 --> 00:11:11.425
which was something that I learned

00:11:11.425 --> 00:11:13.143
when I was working with the late,

00:11:13.143 --> 00:11:14.455
amazing Amy Winehouse

00:11:14.455 --> 00:11:16.696
on her album "Back to Black."

00:11:16.696 --> 00:11:19.752
A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album

00:11:19.752 --> 00:11:21.781
that myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer,

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:23.669
achieved, how we captured this long-lost sound,

00:11:23.669 --> 00:11:27.444
but without the very, very 21st-century personality

00:11:27.444 --> 00:11:29.397
and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:32.550
and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.476
and even a mention of Slick Rick,

00:11:34.476 --> 00:11:35.761
the whole thing would have run the risk

00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:39.222
of being very pastiche, to be honest.

00:11:39.222 --> 00:11:41.510
Imagine any other singer from that era over it

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.201
singing the same old lyrics.

00:11:44.201 --> 00:11:46.338
It runs a risk of being completely bland.

00:11:46.338 --> 00:11:48.851
I mean, there was no doubt that Amy

00:11:48.851 --> 00:11:50.809
and I and Salaam all had this love

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:52.599
for this gospel, soul and blues and jazz

00:11:52.599 --> 00:11:55.818
that was evident listening to
the musical arrangements.

00:11:55.818 --> 00:11:57.862
She brought the ingredients that made it urgent

00:11:57.862 --> 00:11:59.521
and of the time.

00:11:59.521 --> 00:12:02.558
So if we come all the way up to the present day now,

00:12:02.558 --> 00:12:06.070
the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus,

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.292
she reinterprets "La Di Da Di"

00:12:08.292 --> 00:12:10.454
completely for her generation,

00:12:10.454 --> 00:12:13.398
and we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part

00:12:13.398 --> 00:12:17.129
and then see how she sort of flipped it.

00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:23.228
(Music: "La Di Da Di" by Slick Rick &amp; Doug E. Fresh)

00:12:31.953 --> 00:12:37.936
(Music: "We Can't Stop" by Miley Cyrus)

00:12:37.936 --> 00:12:39.777
So Miley Cyrus,

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:43.315
who wasn't even born yet
when "La Di Da Di" was made,

00:12:43.315 --> 00:12:46.849
and neither were any of the co-writers on the song,

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:48.959
has found this song that somehow

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:52.004
etched its way into the collective
consciousness of pop music,

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:55.957
and now, with its timeless playfulness of the original,

00:12:55.957 --> 00:12:58.380
has kind of translated to a whole new generation

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.048
who will probably co-opt it as their own.

00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:05.250
Since the dawn of the sampling era,

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.771
there's been endless debate

00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:09.369
about the validity of music that contains samples.

00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:10.995
You know, the Grammy committee says that

00:13:10.995 --> 00:13:13.653
if your song contains some kind of pre-written

00:13:13.653 --> 00:13:14.898
or pre-existing music,

00:13:14.898 --> 00:13:16.893
you're ineligible for song of the year.

00:13:16.893 --> 00:13:19.170
Rockists, who are racist

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.920
but only about rock music,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.151
constantly use the argument to —

00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:27.173
That's a real word. That is a real word.

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:29.789
They constantly use the argument to devalue rap

00:13:29.789 --> 00:13:31.699
and modern pop,

00:13:31.699 --> 00:13:35.861
and these arguments completely miss the point,

00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:37.820
because the dam has burst.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.853
We live in the post-sampling era.

00:13:39.853 --> 00:13:41.480
We take the things that we love

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.858
and we build on them.

00:13:42.858 --> 00:13:44.498
That's just how it goes.

00:13:44.498 --> 00:13:47.590
And when we really add
something significant and original

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.087
and we merge our musical journey with this,

00:13:50.087 --> 00:13:51.925
then we have a chance to be

00:13:51.925 --> 00:13:54.558
a part of the evolution of that music that we love

00:13:54.558 --> 00:13:57.799
and be linked with it once it
becomes something new again.

00:13:57.799 --> 00:14:03.163
So I would like to do one more piece

00:14:03.163 --> 00:14:04.881
that I put together for you tonight,

00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:07.236
and it takes place with two

00:14:07.236 --> 00:14:10.272
pretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen.

00:14:10.272 --> 00:14:13.907
One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini,

00:14:13.907 --> 00:14:15.989
who happens to be a blind,

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:17.527
autistic genius at the piano,

00:14:17.527 --> 00:14:19.940
and Emmanuel Jal, who is an ex-child soldier

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.260
from the South Sudan,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.122
who is a spoken word poet and rapper.

00:14:24.122 --> 00:14:26.460
And once again I found a way to annoyingly

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.721
me-me-me myself into the musical history

00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:31.235
of these songs,

00:14:31.235 --> 00:14:32.343
but I can't help it,

00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:34.048
because they're these things that I love,

00:14:34.048 --> 00:14:35.975
and I want to mess around with them.

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:39.712
So I hope you enjoy this. Here we go.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.793
Let's hear that TED sound again, right?

00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:49.465
(Music)

00:16:43.423 --> 00:16:46.448
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:16:46.448 --> 00:16:49.111
(Applause)
