00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:17.207
My job is to design, build and study
robots that communicate with people.

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:20.850
But this story doesn't start with robotics
at all, it starts with animation.

00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:23.243
When I first saw Pixar's "Luxo Jr.,"

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:25.973
I was amazed by how much
emotion they could put

00:00:25.997 --> 00:00:28.825
into something as trivial as a desk lamp.

00:00:29.477 --> 00:00:31.822
I mean, look at them --
at the end of this movie,

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:34.625
you actually feel something
for two pieces of furniture.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.930
(Laughter)

00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:37.982
And I said, I have
to learn how to do this.

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.233
So I made a really bad career decision.

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:41.451
(Laughter)

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.668
And that's what my mom
was like when I did it.

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:45.833
(Laughter)

00:00:45.857 --> 00:00:49.278
I left a very cozy tech job in Israel
at a nice software company

00:00:49.302 --> 00:00:51.594
and I moved to New York
to study animation.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:52.769
And there I lived

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:55.611
in a collapsing apartment building
in Harlem with roommates.

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.659
I'm not using this phrase
metaphorically --

00:00:57.683 --> 00:01:00.412
the ceiling actually collapsed
one day in our living room.

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:03.678
Whenever they did news stories
about building violations in New York,

00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:06.118
they would put the report
in front of our building,

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:08.879
as kind of, like, a backdrop
to show how bad things are.

00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:10.840
Anyway, during the day, I went to school

00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:14.291
and at night I would sit and draw
frame by frame of pencil animation.

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:16.500
And I learned two surprising lessons.

00:01:16.524 --> 00:01:21.014
One of them was that
when you want to arouse emotions,

00:01:21.038 --> 00:01:23.213
it doesn't matter so much
how something looks;

00:01:23.237 --> 00:01:26.435
it's all in the motion, in the timing
of how the thing moves.

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:30.006
And the second was something
one of our teachers told us.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.323
He actually did the weasel in "Ice Age."

00:01:32.662 --> 00:01:36.519
And he said, "As an animator,
you're not a director -- you're an actor."

00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:39.918
So, if you want to find
the right motion for a character,

00:01:39.942 --> 00:01:42.387
don't think about it --
go use your body to find it.

00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:45.344
Stand in front of a mirror,
act it out in front of a camera --

00:01:45.368 --> 00:01:48.306
whatever you need -- and then
put it back in your character.

00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:51.908
A year later I found myself at MIT
in the Robotic Life Group.

00:01:51.932 --> 00:01:54.790
It was one of the first groups
researching the relationships

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:56.128
between humans and robots.

00:01:56.152 --> 00:02:00.108
And I still had this dream
to make an actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp.

00:02:00.132 --> 00:02:03.124
But I found that robots didn't move
at all in this engaging way

00:02:03.148 --> 00:02:05.323
that I was used to
from my animation studies.

00:02:05.347 --> 00:02:07.811
Instead, they were all --
how should I put it --

00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:09.289
they were all kind of robotic.

00:02:09.313 --> 00:02:11.187
(Laughter)

00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:14.947
And I thought, what if I took
whatever I learned in animation school,

00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:17.574
and used that to design
my robotic desk lamp.

00:02:17.598 --> 00:02:19.643
So I went and designed frame by frame

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:23.627
to try to make this robot as graceful
and engaging as possible.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.908
And here when you see the robot
interacting with me on a desktop --

00:02:27.932 --> 00:02:29.968
and I'm actually redesigning the robot,

00:02:29.992 --> 00:02:31.796
so, unbeknownst to itself,

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.395
it's kind of digging its own
grave by helping me.

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:36.425
(Laughter)

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.688
I wanted it to be less of a mechanical
structure giving me light,

00:02:39.712 --> 00:02:42.730
and more of a helpful,
kind of quiet apprentice

00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:45.923
that's always there when you need it
and doesn't really interfere.

00:02:45.947 --> 00:02:49.282
And when, for example, I'm looking
for a battery that I can't find,

00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:52.253
in a subtle way, it'll show me
where the battery is.

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:55.705
So you can see my confusion here.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:57.654
I'm not an actor.

00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:03.618
And I want you to notice
how the same mechanical structure

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:05.729
can, at one point,
just by the way it moves,

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:07.897
seem gentle and caring
and in the other case,

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.292
seem violent and confrontational.

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:13.163
And it's the same structure,
just the motion is different.

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.991
Actor: "You want to know something?
Well, you want to know something?

00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:25.904
He was already dead!

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:29.830
Just laying there, eyes glazed over!"

00:03:29.854 --> 00:03:30.875
(Laughter)

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:33.955
But, moving in a graceful way
is just one building block

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.574
of this whole structure
called human-robot interaction.

00:03:36.598 --> 00:03:40.051
I was, at the time, doing my PhD,
I was working on human-robot teamwork,

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:42.137
teams of humans and robots
working together.

00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:43.796
I was studying the engineering,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.352
the psychology,
the philosophy of teamwork,

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:47.527
and at the same time,

00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:50.045
I found myself in my own kind
of teamwork situation,

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.321
with a good friend of mine,
who's actually here.

00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:54.749
And in that situation,
we can easily imagine robots

00:03:54.773 --> 00:03:56.673
in the near future being there with us.

00:03:56.697 --> 00:03:58.387
It was after a Passover Seder.

00:03:58.411 --> 00:04:00.466
We were folding up
a lot of folding chairs,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.148
and I was amazed at how quickly
we found our own rhythm.

00:04:03.172 --> 00:04:06.282
Everybody did their own part,
we didn't have to divide our tasks.

00:04:06.306 --> 00:04:08.752
We didn't have to communicate
verbally about this --

00:04:08.776 --> 00:04:09.965
it all just happened.

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.869
And I thought, humans and robots
don't look at all like this.

00:04:12.893 --> 00:04:16.024
When humans and robots interact,
it's much more like a chess game:

00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:19.169
the human does a thing, the robot
analyzes whatever the human did,

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:21.836
the robot decides what to do next,
plans it and does it.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.215
Then the human waits,
until it's their turn again.

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:26.970
So it's much more like a chess game,
and that makes sense,

00:04:26.994 --> 00:04:30.105
because chess is great for mathematicians
and computer scientists.

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.557
It's all about information, analysis,
decision-making and planning.

00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:37.311
But I wanted my robot
to be less of a chess player,

00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:39.128
and more like a doer

00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:41.153
that just clicks and works together.

00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:44.546
So I made my second
horrible career choice:

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.123
I decided to study acting for a semester.

00:04:47.147 --> 00:04:50.066
I took off from the PhD,
I went to acting classes.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.128
I actually participated in a play --

00:04:52.152 --> 00:04:54.454
I hope thereâ€™s no video
of that around still.

00:04:54.478 --> 00:04:55.516
(Laughter)

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.834
And I got every book
I could find about acting,

00:04:57.858 --> 00:05:00.987
including one from the 19th century
that I got from the library.

00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:04.624
And I was really amazed, because my name
was the second name on the list --

00:05:04.648 --> 00:05:06.648
the previous name was in 1889.

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:07.687
(Laughter)

00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:09.960
And this book was
kind of waiting for 100 years

00:05:09.984 --> 00:05:12.316
to be rediscovered for robotics.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.916
And this book shows actors

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.178
how to move every muscle in the body

00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:18.918
to match every kind of emotion
that they want to express.

00:05:18.942 --> 00:05:21.968
But the real revelation was
when I learned about method acting.

00:05:21.992 --> 00:05:24.245
It became very popular
in the 20th century.

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:25.420
And method acting said

00:05:25.444 --> 00:05:27.744
you don't have to plan
every muscle in your body;

00:05:27.768 --> 00:05:30.713
instead, you have to use your body
to find the right movement.

00:05:30.737 --> 00:05:33.617
You have to use your sense memory
to reconstruct the emotions

00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:36.679
and kind of think with your body
to find the right expression --

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:38.578
improvise, play off your scene partner.

00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:40.047
And this came at the same time

00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:43.177
as I was reading about this trend
in cognitive psychology,

00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:46.453
called embodied cognition,
which also talks about the same ideas.

00:05:46.477 --> 00:05:47.992
We use our bodies to think;

00:05:48.016 --> 00:05:50.973
we don't just think with our brains
and use our bodies to move,

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:52.915
but our bodies feed back into our brain

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:55.104
to generate the way that we behave.

00:05:55.128 --> 00:05:56.724
And it was like a lightning bolt.

00:05:56.748 --> 00:05:57.962
I went back to my office,

00:05:57.986 --> 00:06:00.391
I wrote this paper,
which I never really published,

00:06:00.415 --> 00:06:02.947
called "Acting Lessons
for Artificial Intelligence."

00:06:02.971 --> 00:06:04.352
And I even took another month

00:06:04.376 --> 00:06:06.820
to do what was then the first theater play

00:06:06.844 --> 00:06:08.797
with a human and a robot acting together.

00:06:08.821 --> 00:06:11.214
That's what you saw
before with the actors.

00:06:12.564 --> 00:06:13.715
And I thought:

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:16.676
How can we make an artificial
intelligence model --

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.683
a computer, computational model --

00:06:18.707 --> 00:06:21.214
that will model some of these
ideas of improvisation,

00:06:21.238 --> 00:06:23.068
of taking risks, of taking chances,

00:06:23.092 --> 00:06:24.619
even of making mistakes?

00:06:24.643 --> 00:06:27.256
Maybe it can make for better
robotic teammates.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.884
So I worked for quite
a long time on these models

00:06:29.908 --> 00:06:32.303
and I implemented them
on a number of robots.

00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:34.628
Here you can see a very early example

00:06:34.652 --> 00:06:38.231
with the robots trying to use
this embodied artificial intelligence

00:06:38.255 --> 00:06:40.718
to try to match my movements
as closely as possible.

00:06:40.742 --> 00:06:42.205
It's sort of like a game.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.739
Let's look at it.

00:06:47.652 --> 00:06:51.191
You can see when I psych
it out, it gets fooled.

00:06:51.698 --> 00:06:54.293
And it's a little bit
like what you might see actors do

00:06:54.317 --> 00:06:55.951
when they try to mirror each other

00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:58.340
to find the right synchrony between them.

00:06:58.364 --> 00:07:00.196
And then, I did another experiment,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.279
and I got people off the street
to use the robotic desk lamp,

00:07:04.303 --> 00:07:07.405
and try out this idea
of embodied artificial intelligence.

00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:12.519
So, I actually used two kinds
of brains for the same robot.

00:07:12.543 --> 00:07:14.495
The robot is the same lamp that you saw,

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:15.858
and I put two brains in it.

00:07:15.882 --> 00:07:17.609
For one half of the people,

00:07:17.633 --> 00:07:20.569
I put in a brain
that's kind of the traditional,

00:07:20.593 --> 00:07:21.822
calculated robotic brain.

00:07:21.846 --> 00:07:24.486
It waits for its turn,
it analyzes everything, it plans.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.192
Let's call it the calculated brain.

00:07:26.216 --> 00:07:29.463
The other got more the stage
actor, risk-taker brain.

00:07:29.487 --> 00:07:31.609
Let's call it the adventurous brain.

00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:34.570
It sometimes acts without knowing
everything it has to know.

00:07:34.594 --> 00:07:36.886
It sometimes makes mistakes
and corrects them.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.828
And I had them do this very tedious task
that took almost 20 minutes,

00:07:40.852 --> 00:07:42.328
and they had to work together,

00:07:42.352 --> 00:07:44.905
somehow simulating, like, a factory job

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:47.016
of repetitively doing the same thing.

00:07:47.445 --> 00:07:50.776
What I found is that people
actually loved the adventurous robot.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.577
They thought it was more intelligent,

00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:54.707
more committed,
a better member of the team,

00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:56.796
contributed to the success
of the team more.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.528
They even called it "he" and "she,"

00:07:58.552 --> 00:08:00.673
whereas people with the calculated brain

00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:03.499
called it "it," and nobody
ever called it "he" or "she."

00:08:03.876 --> 00:08:07.169
When they talked about it after the task,
with the adventurous brain,

00:08:07.193 --> 00:08:10.976
they said, "By the end, we were good
friends and high-fived mentally."

00:08:11.397 --> 00:08:12.690
Whatever that means.

00:08:12.714 --> 00:08:14.620
(Laughter)

00:08:14.644 --> 00:08:15.997
Sounds painful.

00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:18.759
Whereas the people
with the calculated brain

00:08:18.783 --> 00:08:21.141
said it was just like a lazy apprentice.

00:08:21.165 --> 00:08:23.910
It only did what it was supposed
to do and nothing more,

00:08:23.934 --> 00:08:26.283
which is almost what people
expect robots to do,

00:08:26.307 --> 00:08:29.862
so I was surprised that people
had higher expectations of robots

00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:33.392
than what anybody in robotics
thought robots should be doing.

00:08:34.027 --> 00:08:36.042
And in a way, I thought,
maybe it's time --

00:08:36.066 --> 00:08:39.028
just like method acting
changed the way people thought

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:40.648
about acting in the 19th century,

00:08:40.672 --> 00:08:43.749
from going from the very calculated,
planned way of behaving,

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:47.271
to a more intuitive, risk-taking,
embodied way of behaving --

00:08:47.295 --> 00:08:50.491
maybe it's time for robots
to have the same kind of revolution.

00:08:51.994 --> 00:08:55.593
A few years later, I was at my next
research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta,

00:08:55.617 --> 00:08:58.441
and I was working in a group
dealing with robotic musicians.

00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:00.825
And I thought, music:
that's the perfect place

00:09:00.849 --> 00:09:04.992
to look at teamwork, coordination,
timing, improvisation --

00:09:05.016 --> 00:09:07.459
and we just got this robot
playing marimba.

00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:09.739
And the marimba, for everybody like me,

00:09:09.763 --> 00:09:12.502
it was this huge, wooden xylophone.

00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:14.589
And when I was looking at this,

00:09:14.613 --> 00:09:17.611
I looked at other works
in human-robot improvisation --

00:09:17.635 --> 00:09:20.382
yes, there are other works
in human-robot improvisation --

00:09:20.406 --> 00:09:22.755
and they were also a little bit
like a chess game.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:23.930
The human would play,

00:09:23.954 --> 00:09:26.127
the robot analyzed what was played,

00:09:26.151 --> 00:09:28.230
and would improvise their own part.

00:09:28.254 --> 00:09:31.392
So, this is what musicians called
a call-and-response interaction,

00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:35.163
and it also fits very well
robots and artificial intelligence.

00:09:35.187 --> 00:09:38.440
But I thought, if I use the same ideas
I used in the theater play

00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:40.208
and in the teamwork studies,

00:09:40.232 --> 00:09:43.882
maybe I can make the robots
jam together like a band.

00:09:43.906 --> 00:09:48.174
Everybody's riffing off each other,
nobody is stopping for a moment.

00:09:48.198 --> 00:09:51.072
And so I tried to do the same
things, this time with music,

00:09:51.096 --> 00:09:53.930
where the robot doesn't really know
what it's about to play,

00:09:53.954 --> 00:09:56.971
it just sort of moves its body
and uses opportunities to play,

00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:59.534
and does what my jazz teacher
when I was 17 taught me.

00:09:59.558 --> 00:10:00.955
She said, when you improvise,

00:10:00.979 --> 00:10:03.995
sometimes you don't know
what you're doing, and you still do it.

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:07.345
So I tried to make a robot that doesn't
actually know what it's doing,

00:10:07.369 --> 00:10:08.590
but is still doing it.

00:10:08.614 --> 00:10:11.125
So let's look at a few seconds
from this performance,

00:10:11.149 --> 00:10:13.276
where the robot listens
to the human musician

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.465
and improvises.

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:17.464
And then, look how the human
musician also responds

00:10:17.488 --> 00:10:18.761
to what the robot is doing

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.429
and picking up from its behavior,

00:10:21.453 --> 00:10:25.409
and at some point can even be surprised
by what the robot came up with.

00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:27.627
(Music)

00:11:07.618 --> 00:11:09.618
(Music ends)

00:11:11.134 --> 00:11:16.868
(Applause)

00:11:16.892 --> 00:11:19.142
Being a musician
is not just about making notes,

00:11:19.166 --> 00:11:21.514
otherwise nobody
would ever go see a live show.

00:11:21.538 --> 00:11:23.660
Musicians also communicate
with their bodies,

00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:25.701
with other band members,
with the audience,

00:11:25.725 --> 00:11:27.739
they use their bodies
to express the music.

00:11:27.763 --> 00:11:30.460
And I thought, we already have
a robot musician on stage,

00:11:30.484 --> 00:11:32.796
why not make it be
a full-fledged musician?

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.494
And I started designing
a socially expressive head

00:11:35.518 --> 00:11:36.861
for the robot.

00:11:36.885 --> 00:11:38.955
The head doesnâ€™t actually
touch the marimba,

00:11:38.979 --> 00:11:40.938
it just expresses what the music is like.

00:11:40.962 --> 00:11:43.458
These are some napkin sketches
from a bar in Atlanta

00:11:43.482 --> 00:11:46.025
that was dangerously
located exactly halfway

00:11:46.049 --> 00:11:47.860
between my lab and my home.

00:11:47.884 --> 00:11:51.822
So I spent, I would say, on average,
three to four hours a day there.

00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:53.033
I think.

00:11:53.057 --> 00:11:54.584
(Laughter)

00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:57.799
And I went back to my animation
tools and tried to figure out

00:11:57.823 --> 00:12:00.193
not just what a robotic
musician would look like,

00:12:00.217 --> 00:12:02.842
but especially what a robotic
musician would move like,

00:12:02.866 --> 00:12:06.268
to sort of show that it doesn't like
what the other person is playing --

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:10.117
and maybe show whatever beat
it's feeling at the moment.

00:12:10.141 --> 00:12:14.644
So we ended up actually getting the money
to build this robot, which was nice.

00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:17.272
I'm going to show you now
the same kind of performance,

00:12:17.296 --> 00:12:19.336
this time with a socially expressive head.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.160
And notice one thing --

00:12:21.184 --> 00:12:22.855
how the robot is really showing us

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:24.785
the beat it's picking up from the human,

00:12:24.809 --> 00:12:28.736
while also giving the human a sense
that the robot knows what it's doing.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.680
And also how it changes the way it moves

00:12:30.704 --> 00:12:32.656
as soon as it starts its own solo.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.576
(Music)

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.620
Now it's looking at me,
showing that it's listening.

00:12:39.644 --> 00:12:42.367
(Music)

00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:04.102
Now look at the final chord
of the piece again.

00:13:04.126 --> 00:13:07.043
And this time the robot
communicates with its body

00:13:07.067 --> 00:13:09.180
when it's busy doing its own thing,

00:13:09.204 --> 00:13:14.055
and when it's ready to coordinate
the final chord with me.

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:16.816
(Music)

00:13:21.783 --> 00:13:23.783
(Music ending)

00:13:26.103 --> 00:13:27.104
(Final chord)

00:13:27.128 --> 00:13:32.882
(Applause)

00:13:32.906 --> 00:13:34.061
Thanks.

00:13:34.085 --> 00:13:35.666
I hope you see

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:40.086
how much this part of the body
that doesn't touch the instrument

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.702
actually helps
with the musical performance.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.169
And at some point -- we are in Atlanta,

00:13:45.193 --> 00:13:48.443
so obviously some rapper
will come into our lab at some point --

00:13:48.467 --> 00:13:53.260
and we had this rapper come in and do
a little jam with the robot.

00:13:53.284 --> 00:13:57.332
Here you can see the robot
basically responding to the beat.

00:13:57.356 --> 00:13:58.507
Notice two things:

00:13:58.531 --> 00:14:02.140
one, how irresistible it is to join
the robot while it's moving its head.

00:14:02.164 --> 00:14:04.767
You kind of want to move
your own head when it does it.

00:14:04.791 --> 00:14:08.377
And second, even though the rapper
is really focused on his iPhone,

00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:11.511
as soon as the robot turns
to him, he turns back.

00:14:11.535 --> 00:14:14.171
So even though it's just
in the periphery of his vision,

00:14:14.195 --> 00:14:16.315
in the corner of his eye,
it's very powerful.

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:18.173
And the reason is that we can't ignore

00:14:18.197 --> 00:14:20.221
physical things moving in our environment.

00:14:20.245 --> 00:14:21.415
We are wired for that.

00:14:21.439 --> 00:14:23.083
So if you have a problem --

00:14:23.107 --> 00:14:27.782
maybe your partner is looking
at their iPhone or smartphone too much --

00:14:27.806 --> 00:14:30.640
you might want to have a robot
there to get their attention.

00:14:30.664 --> 00:14:31.665
(Laughter)

00:14:31.689 --> 00:14:33.758
(Music)

00:14:46.113 --> 00:14:48.113
(Music ends)

00:14:50.138 --> 00:14:57.086
(Applause)

00:14:57.633 --> 00:15:01.467
Just to introduce the last robot
that we've worked on,

00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:03.841
it came out of something
surprising that we found:

00:15:03.865 --> 00:15:07.023
Some point people didn't care
about the robot being intelligent,

00:15:07.047 --> 00:15:08.449
able to improvise and listen,

00:15:08.473 --> 00:15:12.879
and do all these embodied intelligence
things that I spent years developing.

00:15:12.903 --> 00:15:15.584
They really liked that the robot
was enjoying the music.

00:15:15.608 --> 00:15:16.609
(Laughter)

00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:19.178
And they didn't say the robot
was moving to the music,

00:15:19.202 --> 00:15:20.690
they said "enjoying" the music.

00:15:20.714 --> 00:15:22.840
And we thought,
why don't we take this idea,

00:15:22.864 --> 00:15:25.605
and I designed a new piece of furniture.

00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:28.201
This time it wasn't a desk lamp,
it was a speaker dock,

00:15:28.225 --> 00:15:30.865
one of those things
you plug your smartphone in.

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:32.039
And I thought,

00:15:32.063 --> 00:15:35.563
what would happen if your speaker dock
didn't just play the music for you,

00:15:35.587 --> 00:15:37.633
but would actually enjoy it, too?

00:15:37.657 --> 00:15:41.818
And so again, here are some
animation tests from an early stage.

00:15:41.842 --> 00:15:43.226
(Laughter)

00:15:43.835 --> 00:15:46.706
And this is what the final
product looked like.

00:15:58.247 --> 00:16:00.428
(Music)

00:16:18.848 --> 00:16:20.848
(Music ends)

00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:24.081
So, a lot of bobbing heads.

00:16:24.105 --> 00:16:27.716
(Applause)

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.630
A lot of bobbing heads in the audience,

00:16:29.654 --> 00:16:32.362
so we can still see
robots influence people.

00:16:32.386 --> 00:16:35.171
And it's not just fun and games.

00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:37.396
I think one of the reasons I care so much

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.653
about robots that use
their body to communicate

00:16:39.677 --> 00:16:41.383
and use their body to move is --

00:16:41.407 --> 00:16:44.797
I'm going to let you in on a little
secret we roboticists are hiding --

00:16:44.821 --> 00:16:47.614
is that every one of you
is going to be living with a robot

00:16:47.638 --> 00:16:49.230
at some point in your life.

00:16:49.254 --> 00:16:52.187
Somewhere in your future,
there will be a robot in your life.

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:54.079
If not in yours, your children's lives.

00:16:54.103 --> 00:16:59.093
And I want these robots to be more fluent,
more engaging, more graceful

00:16:59.117 --> 00:17:00.846
than currently they seem to be.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.157
And for that I think maybe robots
need to be less like chess players

00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:06.822
and more like stage actors
and more like musicians.

00:17:06.846 --> 00:17:09.659
Maybe they should be able
to take chances and improvise.

00:17:09.683 --> 00:17:12.707
Maybe they should be able
to anticipate what you're about to do.

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:16.079
Maybe they even need to be able
to make mistakes and correct them,

00:17:16.103 --> 00:17:17.991
because in the end, we are human.

00:17:18.015 --> 00:17:21.569
And maybe as humans,
robots that are a little less than perfect

00:17:21.593 --> 00:17:23.324
are just perfect for us.

00:17:23.348 --> 00:17:24.507
Thank you.

00:17:24.531 --> 00:17:31.367
(Applause)
