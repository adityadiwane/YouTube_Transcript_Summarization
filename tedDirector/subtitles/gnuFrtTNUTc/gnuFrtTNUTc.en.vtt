00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:24.619
When I was 14 years old,

00:00:24.643 --> 00:00:26.606
I had low self-esteem.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.219
I felt I was not talented at anything.

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:34.303
One day, I bought a yo-yo.

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.868
When I tried my first trick,
it looked like this:

00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:45.529
(Laughter)

00:00:45.553 --> 00:00:48.331
I couldn't even do the simplest trick,

00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:50.672
but it was very natural for me,

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:54.664
because I was not dextrous,
and hated all sports.

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:58.298
But after one week of practicing,

00:00:58.322 --> 00:01:00.715
my throws became more like this:

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:07.735
A bit better.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:12.744
I thought, the yo-yo
is something for me to be good at.

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:15.475
For the first time in my life,

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.324
I found my passion.

00:01:18.856 --> 00:01:21.825
I was spending all my time practicing.

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:26.174
It took me hours and hours a day
to build my skills up to the next level.

00:01:27.348 --> 00:01:31.378
And then, four years later,
when I was 18 years old,

00:01:32.068 --> 00:01:35.325
I was standing onstage
at the World YoYo Contest.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:36.499
And I won.

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:38.049
I was so excited.

00:01:38.073 --> 00:01:40.652
"Yes, I did it! I became a hero.

00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:43.020
I may get many sponsors, a lot of money,

00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:45.830
tons of interviews,
and be on TV!" I thought.

00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:47.576
(Laughter)

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.820
But after coming back to Japan,

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.848
totally nothing changed in my life.

00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:55.474
(Laughter)

00:01:55.607 --> 00:01:58.843
I realized society
didn't value my passion.

00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:02.712
So I went back to my college

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:05.843
and became a typical Japanese worker
as a systems engineer.

00:02:07.244 --> 00:02:12.851
I felt my passion,
heart and soul, had left my body.

00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:15.878
I felt I was not alive anymore.

00:02:16.394 --> 00:02:20.296
So I started to consider what I should do,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.769
and I thought, I wanted to make
my performance better,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.350
and to show onstage
how spectacular the yo-yo could be

00:02:29.374 --> 00:02:31.994
to change the public's image of the yo-yo.

00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:35.472
So I quit my company

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.089
and started a career
as a professional performer.

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:45.054
I started to learn classic ballet,
jazz dance, acrobatics and other things

00:02:45.078 --> 00:02:46.875
to make my performance better.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.672
As a result of these efforts,
and the help of many others,

00:02:50.696 --> 00:02:51.846
it happened.

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:56.766
I won the World YoYo Contest again
in the artistic performance division.

00:02:57.458 --> 00:03:00.140
I passed an audition for Cirque Du Soleil.

00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:04.583
Today, I am standing on the TED stage

00:03:04.607 --> 00:03:07.166
with the yo-yo in front of you.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.372
(Applause)

00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:14.809
What I learned from the yo-yo is,

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:18.888
if I make enough effort with huge passion,

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:20.928
there is no impossible.

00:03:22.096 --> 00:03:24.968
Could you let me share my passion with you

00:03:24.992 --> 00:03:26.623
through my performance?

00:03:26.647 --> 00:03:31.390
(Applause)

00:03:57.997 --> 00:04:00.668
(Water sound)

00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:10.461
(Music)

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.371
(Music ends)

00:07:49.395 --> 00:07:56.322
(Applause)

00:07:56.602 --> 00:08:03.602
(Music)

00:09:15.405 --> 00:09:20.153
(Music ends)

00:09:20.177 --> 00:09:27.177
(Applause)

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.509
(Applause ends)

00:09:45.533 --> 00:09:52.533
(Music)

00:10:15.738 --> 00:10:22.738
(Applause)
