00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm a believer.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I'm a believer in global warming,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and my record is good

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
on the subject.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
But my subject

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
is national security.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
We have to get off of oil purchased

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
from the enemy.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
I'm talking about OPEC oil.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
And let me take you back

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
100 years

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
to 1912.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
You're probably thinking that was my birth year.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
(Laughter)

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
It wasn't. It was 1928.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
But go back to 1912,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
100 years ago,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and look at that point

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
what we, our country, was faced with.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
It's the same energy question

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
that you're looking at today,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
but it's different sources of fuel.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
A hundred years ago

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
we were looking at coal, of course,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and we were looking at whale oil

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and we were looking at crude oil.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
At that point,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
we were looking for a fuel

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
that was cleaner,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
it was cheaper,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and it wasn't ours though,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
it was theirs.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
So at that point, 1912,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
we selected crude oil over whale oil

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and some more coal.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
But as we moved on

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
to the period now, 100 years later,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
we're back really

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
at another decision point.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
What is the decision point?

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
It's what we're going to use

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
in the future.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
So from here,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
it's pretty clear to me,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
we would prefer to have

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
cleaner, cheaper,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
domestic, ours --

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and we have that, we have that --

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
which is natural gas.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
So here you are,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.260
that the cost of all this to the world

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
is 89 million barrels of oil,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
give or take a few barrels, every day.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And the cost annually

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
is three trillion dollars.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And one trillion of that

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
goes to OPEC.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
That has got to be stopped.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Now if you look at the cost of OPEC,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
it cost seven trillion dollars --

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
on the Milken Institute study last year --

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
seven trillion dollars

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
since 1976,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
is what we paid for oil from OPEC.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Now that includes the cost of military

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and the cost of the fuel both.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.260
But it's the greatest transfer of wealth,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
from one group to another

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
in the history of mankind.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And it continues.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Now when you look

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
at where is the transfer of wealth,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
you can see here

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
that we have the arrows

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
going into the Mid-East

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and away from us.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And with that,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
we have found ourselves

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
to be the world's policemen.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
We are policing the world,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
and how are we doing that?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.260
I know the response to this.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.260
I would bet there aren't 10 percent of you in the room

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.260
that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Raise your hand if you think you know.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
There are 12.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
One is under construction by the Chinese

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and the other 11 belong to us.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Why do we have 11 aircraft carriers?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Do we have a corner on the market?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Are we smarter than anybody else? I'm not sure.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
If you look at where they're located --

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
and on this slide it's the red blobs on there --

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.260
there are five that are operating in the Mid-East,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and the rest of them are in the United States.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
They just move back to the Mid-East and those come back.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
So actually most of the 11 we have

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
are tied up in the Mid-East.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Why? Why are they in the Mid-East?

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
They're there to control,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
keep the shipping lanes open

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and make oil available.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And the United States uses about 20 million barrels a day,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.260
which is about 25 percent of all the oil used

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
everyday in the world.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And we're doing it with four percent of the population.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Somehow that doesn't seem right.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
That's not sustainable.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
So where do we go from here?

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Does that continue?

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Yes, it's going to continue.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
The slide you're looking at here

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
is 1990 to 2040.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Over that period

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
you are going to double your demand.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And when you look at what we're using the oil for,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
70 percent of it

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
is used for transportation fuel.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
So when somebody says,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
"Let's go more nuclear,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
let's go wind, let's go solar,"

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
fine; I'm for anything American,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
anything American.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
But if you're going to do anything

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
about the dependency on foreign oil,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
you have to address transportation.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
So here we are

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
using 20 million barrels a day --

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
producing eight, importing 12,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and from the 12,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.260
five comes from OPEC.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
When you look at the biggest user and the second largest user,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
we use 20 million barrels

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
and the Chinese use 10.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
The Chinese have a little bit better plan --

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
or they have a plan;

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
we have no plan.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
In the history of America,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
we've never had an energy plan.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
We don't even realize the resources

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
that we have available to us.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
If you take the last 10 years

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
and bring forward,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.260
you've transferred to OPEC a trillion dollars.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
If you go forward the next 10 years

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and cap the price of oil at 100 dollars a barrel,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
you will pay 2.2 trillion.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
That's not sustainable either.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
But the days of cheap oil are over.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
They're over.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
They make it very clear to you,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
the Saudis do,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
they have to have 94 dollars a barrel

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
to make their social commitments.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Now I had people in Washington last week told me,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
he said, "The Saudis can produce the oil

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
for five dollars a barrel.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
That has nothing to do with it.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
It's what they have to pay for

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
is what we are going to pay for oil."

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
There is no free market for oil.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
The oil is priced off the margin.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
And the OPEC nations

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
are the ones that price the oil.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
So where are we headed from here?

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
We're headed to natural gas.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
Natural gas will do everything

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
we want it to do.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
It's 130 octane fuel.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
It's 25 percent cleaner than oil.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
It's ours, we have an abundance of it.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
And it does not require a refinery.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
It comes out of the ground at 130 octane.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
It's going to be very simple for us to use.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
It's going to be simple to accomplish this.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
You're going to find, and I'll tell you in just a minute,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
what you're looking for to make it happen.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
But here you can look at the list.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Natural gas will fit all of those.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.260
It will replace or be able to be used for that.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
It's for power generation, transportation,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
it's peaking fuel, it's all those.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Do we have enough natural gas?

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
Look at the bar on the left. It's 24 trillion.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
It's what we use a year.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
Go forward

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and the estimates that you have

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.260
from the EIA and onto the industry estimates --

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
the industry knows what they're talking about --

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
we've got 4,000 trillion cubic feet

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
of natural gas that's available to us.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
How does that translate

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
to barrels of oil equivalent?

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
It would be three times

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
what the Saudis claim they have.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
And they claim they have 250 billion barrels of oil,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
which I do not believe.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.260
I think it's probably 175 billion barrels.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
But anyway, whether they say they're right or whatever,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
we have plenty of natural gas.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
So I have tried to target

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
on where we use the natural gas.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
And where I've targeted

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
is on the heavy-duty trucks.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
There are eight million of them.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
You take eight million trucks --

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
these are 18-wheelers --

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
and take them to natural gas,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
reduce carbon by 30 percent,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
it is cheaper

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
and it will cut our imports

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
three million barrels.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
So you will cut 60 percent off of OPEC

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
with eight million trucks.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
There are 250 million vehicles in America.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
So what you have

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
is natural gas is the bridge fuel,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
is the way I see it.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
I don't have to worry

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
about the bridge to where at my age.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
(Laughter)

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
That's your concern.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
But when you look at the natural gas we have

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
it could very well be

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
the bridge to natural gas,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
because you have plenty of natural gas.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
But as I said, I'm for anything American.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
Now let me take you -- I've been a realist --

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
I went from theorist early to realist.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
I'm back to theorist again.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
If you look at the world,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
you have methane hydrates in the ocean

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
around every continent.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
And here you can see methane,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
if that's the way you're going to go,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
that there's plenty of methane --

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
natural gas is methane,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
methane and natural gas are interchangeable --

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
but if you decide

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
that you're going to use some methane --

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
and I'm gone, so it's up to you --

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
but we do have

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
plenty of methane hydrates.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
So I think I've made my point

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.260
that we have to get on our own resources in America.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
If we do --

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
it's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And yet, we have no energy plan.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
So there's nothing going on

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
that impresses me

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
in Washington on that plan,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
other than I'm trying to focus

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
on that eight million 18-wheelers.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
If we could do that,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
I think we would take our first step

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
to an energy plan.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
If we did, we could see

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
that our own resources are easier to use

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
than anybody can imagine.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
Thank you.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:17.260
(Applause)

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
Chris Anderson: Thanks for that.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So from your point of view,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
you had this great Pickens Plan

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
that was based on wind energy,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
and you abandoned it basically

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
because the economics changed.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
What happened?

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
TBP: I lost 150 million dollars.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
(Laughter)

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
That'll make you abandon something.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
No, what happened to us, Chris,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:48.260
is that power, it's priced off the margin.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
And so the margin is natural gas.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
And at the time I went into the wind business,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
natural gas was nine dollars.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Today it's two dollars and forty cents.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
You cannot do a wind deal

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
under six dollars an MCF.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
CA: So what happened was

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.260
that, through increased ability

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
to use fracking technology,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
and the price plummeted,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
which made wind uncompetitive.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
In a nutshell that's what happened?

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
TBP: That's what happened.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
We found out that we could go to the source rock,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
which were the carboniferous shales in the basins.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
The first one was Barnett Shale in Texas

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
and then the Marcellus up in the Northeast

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
across New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia;

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
and Haynesville in Louisiana.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
This stuff is everywhere.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
We are overwhelmed with natural gas.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.260
CA: And now you're a big investor in that and bringing that to market?

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
TBP: Well you say a big investor.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
It's my life.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
I'm a geologist, got out of school in '51,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
and I've been in the industry my entire life.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
Now I do own stocks.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
I'm not a big natural gas producer.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
Somebody the other day said

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
I was the second largest natural gas producer in the United States.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
Don't I wish.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
But no, I'm not. I own stocks.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
But I also am in the fueling business.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
CA: But natural gas is a fossil fuel.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
You burn it,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
you release CO2.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.260
So you believe in the threat of climate change.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
Why doesn't that prospect

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
concern you?

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
TBP: Well you're going to have to use something.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
What do you have to replace it?

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:39.260
(Laughter)

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
CA: No, no. The argument that it's a bridge fuel makes sense,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.260
because the amount of CO2 per unit of energy

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
is lower than oil and coal, correct?

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
And so everyone can be at least happy

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
But if that's it

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
and that becomes the reason

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
that renewables don't get invested in,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
then, long-term, we're screwed anyway, right?

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
TBP: Well I'm not ready to give up,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
but Jim and I talked

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
there as he left,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
and I said, "How do you feel about natural gas?"

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
And he said, "Well it's a bridge fuel, is what it is."

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
And I said, "Bridge to what?

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
Where are we headed?"

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
See but again, I told you, I don't have to worry with that.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
You all do.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
CA: But I don't think that's right, Boone.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
I think you're a person who believes in your legacy.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
You've made the money you need.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
You're one of the few people in a position

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
to really swing the debate.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon?

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
Does that make sense?

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
TBP: I don't like that

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
because it ends up the government is going to run the program.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
I can tell you it will be a failure.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
The government is not successful

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
on these things.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
They just aren't, it's a bad deal.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
Look at Solyndra, or whatever it was.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
I mean, that was told to be a bad idea 10 times,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
they went ahead and did it anyway.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
But that only blew out 500 million.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
I think it's closer to a billion.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
But Chris, I think where we're headed,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
the long-term,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
I don't mind going back to nuclear.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
And I can tell you what the last page

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
of the report that will take them five years to write

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
will be.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
One, don't build a reformer on a fault.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
(Laughter)

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And number two,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
do not build a reformer on the ocean.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
And now I think reformers are safe.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
Move them inland

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.260
and on very stable ground

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
and build the reformers.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
There isn't anything wrong with nuke.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
You're going to have to have energy. There is no question.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
You can't -- okay.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
CA: One of the questions from the audience

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
is, with fracking and the natural gas process,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
what about the problem of methane leaking from that,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
methane being a worse global warming gas

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
than CO2?

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Is that a concern?

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
TBP: Fracking? What is fracking?

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
CA: Fracking.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
TBP: I'm teasing.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
(Laughter)

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.260
CA: We've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here, you know.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
TBP: No, let me tell you,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
I've told you what my age was.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
I got out of school in '51.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
I witnessed my first frack job

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
at border Texas in 1953.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
Fracking came out in '47,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
and don't believe for a minute

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
when our president gets up there

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
and says the Department of Energy 30 years ago

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
developed fracking.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
I don't know what in the hell he's talking about.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
I mean seriously, the Department of Energy

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
did not have anything to do with fracking.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
The first frack job was in '47.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
I saw my first one in '53.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
I've fracked over 3,000 wells in my life.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
Never had a problem

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
with messing up an aquifer or anything else.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
Now the largest aquifer in North America

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
is from Midland, Texas to the South Dakota border,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
across eight states --

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
big aquifer:

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
Ogallala, Triassic age.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
There had to have been 800,000 wells fracked

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
in that aquifer.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
There's no problems.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
I don't understand why

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.260
the media is focused on Eastern Pennsylvania.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
CA: All right, so you don't support a carbon tax of any kind

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
or a price on carbon.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
Your picture then I guess

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
is through innovation ultimately,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:47.260
that we'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive?

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.260
TBP: Solar and wind, Jim and I agreed on that in 13 seconds.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
That is, it's going to be a small part,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
because you can't rely on it.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
CA: So how does the world get off fossil fuels?

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
TBP: How do we get there?

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
We have so much natural gas,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
a day will not come

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
where you say, "Well let's don't use that anymore."

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
You'll keep using it. It is the cleanest of all.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
And if you look at California,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
they use 2,500 buses.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:16.260
LAMTA have been on natural gas

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
for 25 years.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
The Ft. Worth T

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
has been on it for 25 years.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
Why? Air quality was the reason they used natural gas

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
and got away from diesel.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
Why are all the trash trucks today in Southern California

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
on natural gas?

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.260
It's because of air quality.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.260
I know what you're telling me, and I'm not disagreeing with you.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.260
How in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point?

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.260
And I say, that is your problem.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
(Laughter)

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
CA: All right,

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
so it's the bridge fuel.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
What is at the other end of that bridge

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
is for this audience to figure out.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
If someone comes to you with a plan

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
that really looks like it might be part of this solution,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.260
are you ready to invest in those technologies,

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
even if they aren't maximized for profits,

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
they might be maximized for the future health of the planet?

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.260
TBP: I lost 150 million on the wind, okay.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.260
Yeah, sure, I'm game for it.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.260
Because, again,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.260
I'm trying to get energy solved for America.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.260
And anything American

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
will work for me.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
CA: Boone, I really, really appreciate you coming here,

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
engaging in this conversation.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.260
I think there's a lot of people who will want to engage with you.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
And that was a real gift you gave this audience.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.260
Thank you so much. (TBP: You bet, Chris. Thank you.)

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.260
(Applause)
