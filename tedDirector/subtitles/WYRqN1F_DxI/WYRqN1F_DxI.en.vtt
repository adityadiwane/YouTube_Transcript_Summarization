00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
The north coast of California has rainforests --

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.330
temperate rainforests -- where it can rain more than 100 inches a year.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.330
This is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.330
Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.330
The range of the species goes up to as much as 380 feet tall.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
That's 38 stories tall.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.330
Nobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
because nobody has ever drilled into any of them

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
to count their annual growth rings, and, in any case,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.330
the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
But it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.330
are perhaps 2,500 years old -- roughly the age of the Parthenon --

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
although it's also suspected that there may be individual trees

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
that are older than that.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.330
You can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. It's here, in red.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
The largest individuals of this species,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.330
the dreadnoughts of their kind, live just on the north coast of California,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
where the rain is really intense.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.330
In recent historic times, about 96 percent of the Coast Redwood forest

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.330
was cut down, especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.330
clear-cutting that took place in the 1970s through the early 1990s.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:58.330
Even so, about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.330
wild and now protected -- entirely protected --

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.330
along the north coast of California, including Redwood National Park.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.330
But curiously, Redwood rainforests, the fragments that we have left,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
to this day remain under-explored.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.330
Redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
and even today, individual trees are being discovered

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.330
that have never been seen before, including, in the summer of 2006,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
Hyperion, the world's tallest tree.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
I'm going to do a little Gedanken experiment.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.330
I'm going to ask you to imagine what a Redwood really is as a living organism.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.330
And, Chris, if I could have you up here? I have a tape measure.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
It's a kind loaner from TED.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.330
And Chris, if you could take the end of that tape measure?

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
We're going to show you what the diameter

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
at breast height of a big Redwood is.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:07.330
Unfortunately, this tape isn't long enough -- it's only a 25-foot tape.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.330
Chris, could you extend your arm out that way? There we go. OK.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:20.330
And maybe about here, about 30 feet, is the diameter of a big Redwood.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
Now, let your imagination go upward into space.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:33.330
Think about this tree, rising upward into Redwood space, 325 feet,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.330
32 stories, an individual living organism articulating its forms

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.330
upward into space over long periods of time.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.330
The Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time:

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.330
not human time, but what we might call Redwood time.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.330
Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.330
To us, when we look at a Redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.330
moving upward into space, articulating themselves

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.330
and filling Redwood space over Redwood time, over thousands of years.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.330
Plant this small seed, wait 2,000 years, and you get this:

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
the Lost Monarch.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
and was discovered in 1998.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
And yet, when you look at the base of a Redwood tree,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
you're not seeing the organism.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
You're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
and most of the organism is overhead, unseen.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.330
I became very interested, and I wrote about a couple.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
of the Redwood forest canopy. They're world-class athletes,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.330
and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
Steve Sillett, when he was a 19-year-old college student

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.330
at Reed College, had heard that the Redwood forest canopy

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
is considered to be a so-called Redwood desert.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
That is to say, at that time it was believed

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.330
that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
And with a friend of his, he took it upon himself to free-climb a Redwood

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.330
and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
and ended up hanging, like catching a bar of a trapeze.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
And then, from there, he climbed directly up the bark

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
until he got to the top of the tree.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.330
His friend, a guy named Marwood Harris, was following behind.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
Neither one of them had noticed that there was

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.330
a Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
hanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.330
And when Marwood made the jump, he was covered with wasps

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.330
stinging him in the face and eyes. He nearly let go.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
He would have fallen to his death, being 75 feet above the ground.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
But they made it to the top, and what they found

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
was not a Redwood desert, but a lost world --

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.330
a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air, filled with unknown life.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.330
Now, I had been working on other topics:

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
the emergence of infectious diseases,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
which come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
make a trans-species jump, and get into humans.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.330
After three books on this, it got to be a bit much, in a way.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
My wife and I adore our children.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.330
And I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.330
using the so-called arborist climbing technique,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.330
with ropes. You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
That's my son, Oliver.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.330
They don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.330
(Laughter)

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.330
If ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, then children

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.330
are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.330
Humans appear to be the only primates that I know of

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
that are afraid of heights.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
All other primates, when they're scared,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
they run up a tree, where they feel safe.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.330
We camped overnight in the trees, in tree boats.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
This is my daughter Laura, then 15, looking out of a tree boat.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.330
She's, by the way, tied in with a rope so she can't fall.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
Looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
coming in three dimensions around us.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
We had been visited in the night by flying squirrels,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
because they've never seen them in the canopy before.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
And we practiced advanced techniques like sky-walking,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.330
where you can move from tree to tree through space,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
rather like Spiderman.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
It became a writing project.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.330
When Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood, he fires an arrow,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
which trails a fishing line, which gets over a branch in the tree,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.330
and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
You ascend 30 stories.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
There are two people climbing this tree, Gaya,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
which is thought to be one of the oldest Redwoods. There they are.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
They are only one-seventh of the way up that tree.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
You do feel a sense of exposure.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
There is a small person right down there on the ground.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
You feel like you're climbing a wall of wood.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
But then you enter the Redwood canopy,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330
and it's like coming through a layer of clouds.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
And all of a sudden, you lose sight of the ground,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
and you also lose sight of the sky,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
and you're in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.330
which is populated with all kinds of small organisms.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
There are epiphytes, plants that grow on trees.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
These are huckleberry bushes.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.330
Many species of mosses, and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
When you get near the top of the tree, you feel like you can't fall --

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
in fact, it's difficult to move.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
You're worming your way through branches which are crowded

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
with living things that don't occur near the ground.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
It's like scuba diving into a coral reef,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
except you're going upward instead of downward.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.330
And then the trees tend to flare out into platform-like areas at the top.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
Maria's sitting on one of them.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
These limbs could be five to six hundred years old.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
Redwoods grow very slowly in their tops.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
They also have a feature: thickets of huckleberry bushes

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
that grow out of the tops of Redwood trees

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
that are technically known as huckleberry afros,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.330
and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.330
Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.330
because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.330
A Redwood is a fractal. And as they put out limbs,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:39.330
the limbs burst into small trees, copies of the Redwood.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.330
Now, here we see a reiteration in Chronos, one of the older Redwoods.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.330
This reiteration is a huge flying buttress

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
that comes out the tree itself.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
This buttress is less than halfway up the tree.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:00.330
This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
and extends upward for 150 feet.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.330
It's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.330
and yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:15.330
This three-dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.330
made by Steve Sillett, Marie Antoine and their colleagues, gives you an idea.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.330
What you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:29.330
of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:34.330
of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.330
I asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:44.330
There's the person, right there. The person is waving to us.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:50.330
I've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.330
a synthetic chromosome into a human

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.330
so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
And if we were able to reiterate, then the fingers of our hand

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.330
would be people who looked like us,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.330
and they would have people on their hands and so on.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
And if we had Redwood-like biology,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.330
we would have six layers of people on our hands, as it were.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
And it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.330
and have all our reiterations wave at the same time.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
(Laughter)

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:26.330
To reiterate the point, let's go closer into Iluvatar.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
We're looking at that yellow box.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
And this hallucinatory drawing shows you --

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.330
everything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.330
These are millennial structures -- portions of the tree

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:48.330
There are four humans in this shot -- one, two, three, four.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.330
And there's also something that I want to show you.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.330
This is a flying buttress.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.330
Redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space,

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.330
and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.330
going back into the main trunk and fusing with it.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.330
Flying buttresses, just as in a cathedral, help strengthen the crown of the tree

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.330
and help the tree exist longer through time.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.330
The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
They've wired them like patients in an ICU.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
They're finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
and down into their trunks,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
possibly all the way into their root systems.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.330
They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
If a portion of a Redwood is rotting,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
the Redwood will send roots into its own form

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.330
and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.330
If we had Redwood-like biology, if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
then we could just, you know,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.330
extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
hundreds of feet above the ground, and there are organisms in this soil

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
that have, as yet, no names.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:04.330
This is an unnamed species of copepod. A copepod is a crustacean.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:09.330
These copepods are a major constituent of the oceans,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.330
and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.330
What they're doing in the Redwood forest canopy soil

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
hundreds of feet above the ocean, or how they got there,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.330
is completely unknown.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
There are some interesting theories

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
that, if I had time, I would tell you about.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
But as you go and you look closer at a tree,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
what you see is, you see increasing complexity.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.330
We're looking at the very top of Gaya, which is thought to be the oldest Redwood.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.330
Gaya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
no one really knows, but its top has broken off

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
and it's been rotting back now.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:51.330
This little Japanese garden-like creation probably took 700 years

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.330
to form in its complexity that we see right now.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.330
As you look at a tree, it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.330
I have to show you something unfortunately very sad

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.330
at the conclusion of this talk.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.330
The Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
And we're moving in a full circle now.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:16.330
In the 1950s, a small organism appeared in Richmond, Virginia,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.330
called the Hemlock woolly adelgid.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.330
It made a trans-species jump out of some other organism in Asia,

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.330
where it was living on Hemlock trees in Asia.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.330
When it moved into its new host, the Eastern Hemlock tree,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.330
it escaped its predators, and the new tree had no resistance to it.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.330
The Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:42.330
the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
I hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east,

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.330
it can rain up to 100 inches of rain a year.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:15:00.330
And in the last two to three summers, these invasive organisms,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.330
this kind of Ebola of the trees, as it were,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.330
has swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east,

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:12.330
and has absolutely wiped it out. I climbed there this past summer.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.330
This is Great Smoky Mountains National Park,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.330
and the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
And what we're seeing is not just the potential death

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.330
of the Eastern Hemlock species --

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:29.330
that is to say, its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite --

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:34.330
but we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.330
for which these trees are merely the substrate

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:43.330
for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.330
It's absolutely heartbreaking to see.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.330
One of the things that is just -- I almost can't conceive it --

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.330
is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all,

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:59.330
and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.330
What can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves?

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.330
Well, I think they can tell us something about human time.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:13.330
The flickering, transitory quality of human time

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:18.330
and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.330
But we're different from trees, and they can also teach us

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
something about ourselves in the differences that we have.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.330
We are human, and we have the capacity to love,

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.330
we have the capacity to wonder, and we have a sort of

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:35.330
boundless curiosity, a restless inquisitiveness

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.330
that so suits us as primates, I think.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:42.330
And at least for me, personally, the trees have taught me

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.330
an entirely new way of loving my children.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.330
Exploring with them the forest canopy

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.330
has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:56.330
And I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.330
with my children I've been able to introduce them

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.330
into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.330
or possibly stupid enough, to still climb trees.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.330
Thank you very much.

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:20.330
(Applause)

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.330
Chris Anderson: I think at a previous TED,

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:27.330
I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.330
because these trees are like, 2,000 years and older,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.330
on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.330
that are not found anywhere on the Earth

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.330
except on that one tree. Is that correct?

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:43.330
Richard Preston: Yes, that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion, the world's tallest tree.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:48.330
And I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it, in 2006.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.330
And while we were climbing Hyperion, Marie Antoine spotted

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:58.330
an unknown species of golden-brown ant about halfway up the trunk.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.330
Ants are not known to occur in Redwood trees, curiously enough,

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.330
and we wondered whether this ant, this species of ant,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.330
was only endemic to that one tree, or possibly to that grove.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.330
And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again,

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.330
and so no specimens have ever been collected.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.330
We don't know what it is -- we just know it's there.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.330
CA: So, you have to wonder when, you know,

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:25.330
if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth,

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:31.330
you know, our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.330
You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.330
and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.330
It's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me,

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.330
and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.330
RP: It is fragile, and you know, I think about emerging human diseases --

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.330
parasites that move into the human species.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.330
But that's just a very small facet

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.330
of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide,

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.330
all through the ecosystems, and you know, the Earth itself --

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.330
CA: Partly caused by us, inadvertently.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.330
RP: Caused by humans. Caused by the movement of humans.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:10.330
You can think of the Earth's biosphere as a palace,

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.330
and the continents are rooms in the palace,

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.330
and the islands are small rooms.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.330
But lately, the doors of the palace have been flung open,

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.330
and the walls are coming down.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.330
CA: Richard Preston, thank you very much, I think.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.330
RP: Thank you.
