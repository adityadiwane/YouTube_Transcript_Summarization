00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
A few years ago, my eyes were opened

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
to the dark side of the construction industry.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
In 2006, young Qatari students

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
took me to go and see the migrant worker camps.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.330
And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.330
is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
1.1 million of them.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
to make money for their families back home.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.330
no air conditioning, and their passports taken away.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.330
While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.330
99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
and so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
but the numbers are simply overwhelming.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
In August 2008,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
UAE public officials noted

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.330
that 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor camps

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
And last summer, more than 10,000 workers

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
protested for the non-payment of wages,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
And then the financial collapse happened.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
When the contractors have gone bust,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
as they've been overleveraged like everyone else,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
the difference is everything goes missing,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
documentation, passports,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
and tickets home for these workers.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.330
Currently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
There is no way back home.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
And there is no way, and no proof of arrival.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
These are the boom-and-bust refugees.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
The question is, as a building professional,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
as an architect, an engineer, as a developer,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
if you know this is going on,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
as we go to the sights every single week,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
are you complacent or complicit

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
in the human rights violations?

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
So let's forget your environmental footprint.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
Let's think about your ethical footprint.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
What good is it

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
to build a zero-carbon, energy efficient complex,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
when the labor producing this architectural gem

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
is unethical at best?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
Now, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
But, quite frankly, on this issue,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
there is no other road.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.330
So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
And that as we worry about our next job in the office,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.330
the next design that we can get, to keep our workers.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
Thank you.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
(Applause)
