00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What is bioenergy? Bioenergy is not ethanol.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Bioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
something which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that bridge to the future, to the point where we

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
can actually see the oceans in a rational way, or

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
do microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on how

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that, you really have to look first at agriculture.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So we've been planting stuff for 11,000 years. And

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
you've got to deal with all types of awful things,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
you've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that you learn how to use water to cultivate, then

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
makes a difference.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
stuff where you want it, as opposed to where the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
rivers flood. You start getting this organic

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
agriculture; you start putting machinery onto this

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
stuff. Machinery, with a whole bunch of water,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
leads to very large-scale agriculture.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You put together machines and water, and you get

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
landscapes that look like this. And then you get

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
sales that look like this. It's brute force. So

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
what you've been doing in agriculture is you start

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
out with something that's a reasonably natural

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
system. You start taming that natural system. You

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
put a lot of force behind that natural system. You

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
(Laughter) -- behind that natural system, and you

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
end up with systems that look like this.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And it's all brute force. And that's the way we've

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
been approaching energy. So the lesson in

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
agriculture is that you can actually change the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
system that's based on brute force as you start

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
merging that system and learning that system and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
actually applying biology. And you move from a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
discipline of engineering, you move from a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
discipline of chemistry, into a discipline of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
biology. And probably one of the most important

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
human beings on the planet is this guy behind me.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
deserves this stuff because he probably has fed

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
more people than any other human being alive

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
because he researched how to put biology behind

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
seeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and China no longer have these massive famines is

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
grains in a more efficient way and launched the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Green Revolution. That is something that a lot of

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
people have criticized. But of course, those are

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
people who don't realize that China and India,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
instead of having huge amounts of starving people,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
are exporting grains.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And the irony of this particular system is the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
place where he did the research, which was Mexico,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
didn't adopt this technology, ignored this

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
technology, talked about why this technology

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
should be thought about, but not really applied.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And Mexico remains one of the largest grain

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
importers on the planet because it doesn't apply

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
fact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
where there aren't statues of this man all over

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Mexico. There are in China and India. And the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Institute that this guy ran has now moved to

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
India. That is the difference between adopting

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
technologies and discussing technologies.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Now, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
of people in the world. It's that this is the net

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
effect in terms of what technology does, if you

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
understand biology.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
What happened in agriculture? Well, if you take

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
agriculture over a century, agriculture in about

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
1900 would have been recognizable to somebody

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows look

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
different. The machines were tractors or stuff

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
instead of mules, but the farmer would have

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
understood: this is what the guy's doing, this is

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
why he's doing it, this is where he's going. What

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
really started to change in agriculture is when

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
you started moving from this brute force

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
engineering and chemistry into biology, and that's

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
where you get your productivity increases. And as

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
you do that stuff, here's what happens to

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
productivity.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Basically, you go from 250 hours to produce 100

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
bushels, to 40, to 15, to five. Agricultural labor

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
productivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
whereas the rest of the economy increased about

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
2.5 times. This is an absolutely massive increase

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
in how much is produced per person.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
The effect of this, of course, is it's not just

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
agriculture from mountains of stuff that people

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
have overproduced.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
This would be a good outcome for energy. And of

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
course, by now, you're probably saying to

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
yourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk about

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
energy and here's this guy talking about biology."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So where's the link between these two things?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
One of the ironies of this whole system is we're

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
discussing what to do about a system that we don't

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
understand. We don't even know what oil is. We

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
don't know where oil comes from. I mean,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
literally, it's still a source of debate what

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
this black river of stuff is and where it comes

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
from. The best assumption, and one of the best

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
out of this stuff, that these things absorb

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
sunlight, rot under pressure for millions of

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
years, and you get these black rivers.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Now, the interesting thing about that thesis -- if

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and all hydrocarbons, turned out to be

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
concentrated sunlight. And if you think of

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
bioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
taking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
concentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
you get these rainbows.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And as you're looking at this system, if

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
bioenergy works in a different way. And we've got

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
part of these solar panels.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
over west Texas, the types of wells that you're

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
of Kansas and those irrigated plots.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
This is how you farm oil. And as you think of

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
with this brute force approach. And then what did

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
we learn? Then we learned we had to go bigger. And

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
then what'd we learn? Then we have to go even

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
bigger. And we are getting really destructive as

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
we're going out and farming this bioenergy.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
trucks in the world are working here, and then

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
separate it, which only works at today's oil

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
prices.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
stuff. It is probably plants, except that these

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
have been burned and crushed under pressure.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So you take something like this, you burn it, you

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
put it under pressure, and likely as not, you get

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
this. Although, again, I stress: we don't know.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
as you think of coal, this is what burned wheat

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And of course, coalmines are very dangerous

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
places because in some of these coalmines, you

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000
get gas. When that gas blows up, people die. So

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
you're producing a biogas out of coal in some

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
mines, but not in others.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Any place you see a differential, there're some

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
interesting questions. There's some questions as

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
to what you should be doing with this stuff. But

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
exactly the same technology.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Here's your brute force approach. Once you get

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
through your brute force approach, then you just

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
the single largest source of carbon emissions,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
which are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
not the best use of bioenergy.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
As you think of what are the alternatives to this

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
system -- it's important to find alternatives

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
its petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling in

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
its coal reserves, nor is China. There are huge

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
coal reserves that are sitting out there, and

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
we've got to start thinking of them as biological

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
energy, because if we keep treating them as

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
chemical energy, or engineering energy, we're

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
going to be in deep doo-doo.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
product. And as you think of gas, well, you're

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
familiar with gas. And here's a different way of

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
mining coal.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
This is called coal bed methane. Why is this

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
picture interesting? Because if coal turns out to

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
be concentrated plant life, the reason why you may

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
get a differential in gas output between one mine

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and another one may not blow up -- may be because

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
This is a well-known phenomenon. (Laughter) You

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
may turn out that biological processes in coalmines

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
have the same process. If that is true, then

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
process that coal in a biological fashion as you

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
did in agriculture.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
importing corn into Iowa because you've built so

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
understand the transition that occurred in

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
agriculture, from brute force into biological

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
force. And in the measure that you can do that,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
you can clean some stuff, and you can clean it

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
pretty quickly.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We already have some indicators of productivity on

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
this stuff. OK, if you put steam into coal fields

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
or petroleum fields that have been running for

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
decades, you can get a really substantial

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
increase, like an eight-fold increase, in your

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
output. This is just the beginning stages of this

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
stuff.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And as you think of biomaterials, this guy -- who

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
did part of the sequencing of the human genome,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
who just doubled the databases of genes and

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
proteins known on earth by sailing around the

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
world -- has been thinking about how you structure

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
this. And there's a series of smart people

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
thinking about this. And they've been putting

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
together companies like Synthetic Genomics, like,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
trying to do is to think of, how do you apply

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
biological principles to avoid brute force?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Think of it in the following terms. Think of it as

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
beginning to program stuff for specific purposes.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
genes as a software. And in the measure that you

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
begin to think of life as code that is

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
interchangeable, that can become energy, that can

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
become food, that can become fiber, that can

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
become human beings, that can become a whole

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
series of things, then you've got to shift your

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
approach as to how you're going to structure and

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
deal and think about energy in a very different

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
way.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
What are the first principles of this stuff and

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
where are we heading? This is one of the gentle

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
giants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
beings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Smith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
He was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's such

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
a modest guy that the day he won, his mother

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
called him and said, "I didn't realize there was

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
another Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000
won the Nobel?" (Laughter) I mean, that was Mom,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
but anyway, this guy is just a class act. You find

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
him at the bench every single day, working on a

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
pipette and building stuff. And one of the things

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
this guy just built are these things.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
What is this? This is the first transplant of

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
naked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
system out of one cell, insert it into a different

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
cell, and have that cell boot up as a separate

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
species. That's one month old. You will see stuff

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
in the next month that will be just as important

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
as this stuff.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And as you think about this stuff and what the

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
implications of this are, we're going to start not

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
just converting ethanol from corn with very high

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
subsidies. We're going to start thinking about

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
biology entering energy. It is very expensive to

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
process this stuff, both in economic terms and in

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
energy terms.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
This is what accumulates in the tar sands of

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
separate that petroleum from the sand, and use an

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
enormous amount of energy inside that vapor --

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
separate out the sulfur. The difference between

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
light crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, the

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
scale on these things is pretty large.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Now, if you can take part of the energy content

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
out of doing this, you reduce the system, and you

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
really do start applying biological principles to

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
you can get to wind, to the point where you can

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
get to solar, to the point where you can get to

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
nuclear -- and hopefully you won't build the next

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
earthquake fault. (Laughter) Just a thought.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
But in the meantime, for the next decade at least,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
the name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
oil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
dealing with. And before I make this talk too

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
long, here's what's happening in the current

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
energy system.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
86 percent of the energy we consume are

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
hydrocarbons. That means 86 percent of the stuff we're

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
consuming are probably processed plants and

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
role in here for conservation. There's a role in

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
here for alternative stuff, but we've also got to

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
get that other portion right.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
How we deal with that other portion is our bridge

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
to the future. And as we think of this bridge to

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
the future, one of the things you should ponder

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
is: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
amount of money and leaving most of the energy

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
down there. Which, of course, requires more energy

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
to go out and get energy. The ratios become

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
idiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
even be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
the energy output. That is a stupid way of

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
managing this system.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Last point, last graph. One of the things that

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
is what oil prices look like, OK?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
This is a very bad system because what happens is

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
with really smart ideas for solar panels, or for

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
wind, or for something else, and then guess what?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
The oil price goes through the floor. That company

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
goes out of business, and then you can bring the

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
oil price back up.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
So if I had one closing and modest suggestion,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
United States. How do you do that? Well, let's put

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
basically says for the next 20 years, the price of

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
oil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
it. If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
goes away.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
What does that do for entrepreneurs? What does it

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
do for companies? It tells people, if you can

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
produce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, or

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
less than 40 bucks a barrel, or less than 50 bucks

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
a barrel -- let's debate it -- you will have a

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
business. But let's not put people through this

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
cycle where it doesn't pay to research because

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
your company will go out of business as OPEC

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
happening. Thank you.
