00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.716
I was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.756
and through a combination
of accidents and cosmic justice,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.676
became a chef in the US.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.476
(Laughter)

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.100
When I first arrived in New York,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.396
I began working in these restaurants --
different types of restaurants --

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.116
from French bistro to Italian,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.060
global ethnic to modern American.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.356
At the time,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.100
New York was already well-established
as a food capital of the world.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.100
However ...

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.356
with the exception of a few West African
and Ethiopian mom-and-pop eateries,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.260
there was no such thing
as African cuisine in the entire city.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.076
Early in my life,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.076
I was influenced
by Senegal's first president,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.700
Léopold Sédar Senghor,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.036
nicknamed, "the poet president,"

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.396
who talked about a new humanism,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.796
a universal civilization,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.836
in which all cultures would come together
around a communal table as equals,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.260
each bringing its own beautiful
contribution to share.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.860
He called it "the rendezvous
of giving and receiving."

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.316
That concept resonated with me,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.260
and it has guided my career path.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.396
After years of working in restaurants,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.556
I yearned for my work
to have a deeper impact

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.980
that would go beyond
the last meal I had served.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.356
I wanted to give back, both to New York --

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.436
the city that allowed me
the opportunity to follow my calling --

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.140
but also to my origins
and ancestors in Senegal.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.396
I wanted to contribute
to that universal civilization

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.940
Senghor had described.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.276
But I didn't know how to make
a measurable impact

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.660
as a cook and writer.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.796
While I was writing my first cookbook,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.340
I often traveled to different regions
of Senegal for research.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.516
During one of those trips,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.380
in the remote, southeast
region of Kédougou

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.620
I rediscovered
an ancient grain called fonio

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.940
that had all but disappeared
from the urban Senegalese diet.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.356
It turns out that fonio
had been cultivated

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.956
for more than five thousand years

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.740
and is probably the oldest
cultivated cereal in Africa.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.980
Once a popular grain
on much of the continent,

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.700
fonio was grown
all the way to ancient Egypt,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.740
where archaeologists found grains
inside pyramids' burial grounds.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.436
Today it is mostly cultivated
in the western part of the Sahel region,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.756
from Senegal to Mali,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.076
Burkina Faso,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.540
Togo, Nigeria.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.756
The Sahel region is that semiarid area
south of the Sahara desert

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.100
that extends from the Atlantic
in the west to the Red Sea in the east.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.076
I became more interested in this grain

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.180
that was deemed worth taking
to the afterlife by early Egyptians.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.076
As I continued my research,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.956
I found out that fonio was actually --

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.956
wherever it was cultivated --

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.620
there was always some myth,
or some superstition connected to it.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.036
The Dogon,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.916
another great culture in Mali,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.596
called it "po,"

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.260
or, "the seed of the universe."

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.636
In that ancient culture's mythology,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.420
the entire universe
sprouted from a seed of fonio.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.276
Aside from its purported
mystical properties,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.820
fonio is a miracle grain in many aspects.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.876
It is nutritious,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.676
particularly rich
in methionine and cysteine,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.076
two amino acids that are deficient
in most other major grains:

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.140
barley, rice or wheat to name a few.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.636
In addition,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.860
fonio cultivation
is great for the environment.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.596
It tolerates poor soil

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.356
and needs very little water,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.580
surviving where nothing else will grow.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.956
As a chef,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.900
what first struck me was
its delicate taste and its versatility.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.300
Similar to couscous,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.780
fonio has a delicious,
nutty and earthy flavor.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.196
It can be turned into salad,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.316
served as noodles,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.956
used in baking

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.676
or simply as a substitute for any
other grains in your favorite recipes.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.076
I am happy to share some of my
fonio sushi and sweet potato sushi

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.460
with some of you right now.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.116
(Audience) Oh!

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.636
(Applause)

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.860
And okra.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.420
(Audience murmurs)

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.116
In Kédougou

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.300
it is also nicknamed "ñamu buur,"

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.956
which means "food for royalty,"

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.220
and it's served for guests of honor.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.660
Located at the border
with Guinea and Mali,

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.876
Kédougou first strikes visitors
with its stunning vistas

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.180
and views of the Fouta Djallon Mountains.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.180
Sadly, it is also one of the poorest
regions of Senegal.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.956
Because of desertification
and lack of job prospects,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.020
much of Kédougou's
young population has left.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.996
They chose the deadly path of migration

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.460
in search of "better" opportunities.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.940
Often,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.780
they risk their lives
trying to reach Europe.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.420
Some leave by crossing the Sahara desert.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.756
Others end up on inadequate wooden canoes

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.300
in desperate attempts to reach Spain.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.716
According to a recent "Guardian" article,

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.556
by 2020 more that 60 million people
from sub-Saharan Africa

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.916
are expected to migrate

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.876
due to desertification.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.756
This is the biggest global wave
of migration since the Second World War,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.540
and it's only set to grow.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.260
So far this year,

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.076
more that 2,100 migrants
have lost their lives

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.700
on their way to Europe.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.876
This is the reality of Kédougou

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.860
and of much of the Sahel today.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.196
Scary future,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.996
scarce food

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.140
and no opportunities
to change their situation.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.900
If life in your village
weren't so precarious,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.636
if there was a way
to having enough food to get by,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.140
or having a paying job --

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.956
if you and your sisters

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:27.316
didn't have to spend
30 percent of their waking hours

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.660
fetching water,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.700
if conditions were just
a little more hospitable ...

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.620
could the solution
be right here in our soil?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.996
Could bringing fonio
to the rest of the world

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.220
be the answer?

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.476
Ancient grains are getting more popular,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.276
and sales of gluten-free items
are growing in the US --

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.516
16.4 percent since 2013,

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.700
making it a 23.3-billion-dollar industry.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.260
How could fonio
partake in this market share?

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.340
There are many challenges
in turning fonio into food.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.636
Traditional processing
is laborious and time-consuming,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.900
especially when compared to other grains.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.540
Well, thankfully, technology has evolved.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.956
And there are now machines

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.596
that can process fonio
in a more efficient way.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.996
And as a matter of fact,

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.636
a few years ago,

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.116
Sanoussi Diakité,

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.396
a Senegalese engineer,

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.636
won a Rolex prize

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.260
for his invention of the first
mechanized fonio processor.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.475
Today, such machines are making life
much easier for producers

00:08:50.499 --> 00:08:52.180
around the whole Sahel region.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.916
Another challenge
is the colonial mentality

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.660
that what comes from the west is best.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.196
This tendency to look down
on our own products

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.556
and to see crops like fonio
as simply "country peoples' food,"

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.436
therefore substandard,

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.596
explains why even though we don't
produce wheat in Senegal traditionally,

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.076
it is far easier to find baguettes
or croissants in the streets of Dakar

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.260
than it is to find any fonio products.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:33.196
This same mindset popularized
the overprocessed, leftover rice debris

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.140
known as "broken rice,"

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.476
which was imported to Senegal
from Indochina

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.860
and introduced by the colonial French.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.156
Soon, broken rice became
a key ingredient in our national dish,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.436
thiéboudienne,

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.916
replacing our own traditional,
more nutritious African rice,

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.180
Oryza glaberrima.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.796
Ironically, the same African rice
despised at home

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.236
was hailed abroad.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.276
Indeed, during the Atlantic slave trade,

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.860
this rice became
a major crop in the Americas ...

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.916
particularly in the Carolinas

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.460
where it was nicknamed, "Carolina gold."

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.940
But let's return to fonio.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.156
How can we turn its current status
of "country-people food"

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.180
into a world-class crop?

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.956
Last year,

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.396
a business partner and I secured
a commitment from Whole Foods Market,

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.796
the US's largest natural food store chain,

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.020
to carry fonio.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.716
And we got a large
American ingredient importer

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.756
interested enough
to send a team of executives

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.596
to West Africa with us

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.100
to explore the supply chain's viability.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:03.156
We found ourselves
observing manual operations

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.516
in remote locations

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.500
with few controls over quality.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.580
So we started focusing
on processing issues.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.476
We drew up a vision

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.276
with a beneficial and commercially
sustainable supply chain for fonio,

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.156
and we connected ourselves
with organizations

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.780
that can help us achieve it.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.085
Walking backwards from the market,
here is what it looks like.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:35.716
Imagine that fonio
is consumed all across the globe

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.380
as other popular ancient grains.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.196
Fonio touted on the levels of cereals,

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.836
breads,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.060
nutrition bars,

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.916
cookies, pastas,

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.580
snacks -- why not?

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.396
It's easier to say than quinoa.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.740
(Laughter)

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.660
(Applause)

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.396
To get there,

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.836
fonio needs to be readily available

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.596
at a consistent quality
for commercial users,

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.436
such as food manufacturers
and restaurant chains.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.940
That's the part we're missing.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.916
To make fonio available
at a consistent quality

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.676
for commercial use,

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.116
you need a commercial-scale fonio mill

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.460
that adheres to international
quality standards.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.036
Currently, there is no such mill
in the whole world,

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.716
so in our vision,

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.276
there is an African-owned
and operated fonio mill

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.796
that processes efficiently

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:47.180
and in compliance with the requirements
of multinational food companies.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:53.476
It is very difficult
for the fonio producers today

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.036
to sell and use fonio

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.916
unless they devote
a huge amount of time and energy

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.236
in threshing, winnowing and husking it.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.556
In our vision,

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.276
the mill will take on those tasks,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:13.180
allowing the producers to focus
on farming rather than processing.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.660
There is untapped
agricultural capacity in the Sahel,

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.860
and all it takes
is changing market conditions

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.700
to activate that capacity.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.676
By relieving fonio producers
of manual operations,

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.996
the mill will free up their time

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.180
and remove the production bottleneck
that limits their output.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.316
And there are other benefits as well

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.740
in using Sahel land for agriculture.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.860
More benefits,

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.980
higher employment,

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.900
climate change mitigation
by reversing desertification

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.740
and greater food security.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.860
Nice vision, right?

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.100
Well, we are working
towards getting it done.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.316
Last month we introduced fonio
to shoppers in New York City

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.556
and online,

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:16.236
in a package that makes it attractive
and desirable and accessible.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.460
(Applause)

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.516
We are talking with operators
and investors in West Africa

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.420
about building a fonio mill.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.876
And most importantly,

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.076
we have teamed with an NGO
called SOS SAHEL

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.996
to recruit, train and equip
smallholders in the Sahel

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.900
to increase their fonio production.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.556
Hunger levels are higher
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.020
than any other place in the world.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.756
The Sahel population is set to grow

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.340
from 135 million to 340 million people.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.756
However, in that drought-
and famine-prone region,

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.420
fonio grows freely.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.980
This tiny grain may provide big answers,

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.236
reasserting its Dogon name,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.036
"po," the seed of the universe,

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.236
and taking us one step closer

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.020
to the universal civilization.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.916
Thank you.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.020
(Applause)
