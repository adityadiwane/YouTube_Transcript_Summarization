00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:15.039
What do you think when you look at me?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.500
A woman of faith? An expert?

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:20.674
Maybe even a sister.

00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:23.678
Or oppressed,

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:25.213
brainwashed,

00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:26.625
a terrorist.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:31.607
Or just an airport security line delay.

00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:34.080
That one's actually true.

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:35.660
(Laughter)

00:00:35.684 --> 00:00:38.907
If some of your perceptions were negative,
I don't really blame you.

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.051
That's just how the media
has been portraying

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:42.605
people who look like me.

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.035
One study found

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.804
that 80 percent of news coverage
about Islam and Muslims is negative.

00:00:48.828 --> 00:00:53.064
And studies show that Americans
say that most don't know a Muslim.

00:00:53.088 --> 00:00:55.944
I guess people don't talk
to their Uber drivers.

00:00:55.968 --> 00:00:57.886
(Laughter)

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:02.964
Well, for those of you
who have never met a Muslim,

00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:04.833
it's great to meet you.

00:01:05.738 --> 00:01:07.688
Let me tell you who I am.

00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:11.834
I'm a mom, a coffee lover --

00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:13.686
double espresso, cream on the side.

00:01:14.103 --> 00:01:15.442
I'm an introvert.

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:18.096
I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.462
And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.

00:01:23.788 --> 00:01:28.137
But not like Lady Gaga says,
because baby, I wasn't born this way.

00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:30.487
It was a choice.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.985
When I was 17, I decided to come out.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.840
No, not as a gay person
like some of my friends,

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:40.364
but as a Muslim,

00:01:40.388 --> 00:01:43.459
and decided to start wearing
the hijab, my head covering.

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:47.236
My feminist friends were aghast:

00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:50.492
"Why are you oppressing yourself?"

00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:52.968
The funny thing was,

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:57.960
it was actually at that time
a feminist declaration of independence

00:01:58.898 --> 00:02:02.856
from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.526
to conform to a perfect
and unattainable standard of beauty.

00:02:07.582 --> 00:02:12.104
I didn't just passively accept
the faith of my parents.

00:02:12.658 --> 00:02:14.864
I wrestled with the Quran.

00:02:14.888 --> 00:02:19.816
I read and reflected
and questioned and doubted

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:22.049
and, ultimately, believed.

00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:27.868
My relationship with God --
it was not love at first sight.

00:02:29.614 --> 00:02:32.488
It was a trust and a slow surrender

00:02:32.512 --> 00:02:35.525
that deepened with every
reading of the Quran.

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:39.935
Its rhythmic beauty
sometimes moves me to tears.

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.104
I see myself in it.
I feel that God knows me.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.661
Have you ever felt like someone sees you,
completely understands you

00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:52.336
and yet loves you anyway?

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.553
That's how it feels.

00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:58.453
And so later, I got married,

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:00.341
and like all good Egyptians,

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:02.824
started my career as an engineer.

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:04.848
(Laughter)

00:03:06.602 --> 00:03:10.444
I later had a child,
after getting married,

00:03:11.603 --> 00:03:15.181
and I was living essentially
the Egyptian-American dream.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:22.881
And then that terrible morning
of September, 2001.

00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:29.363
I think a lot of you probably remember
exactly where you were that morning.

00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.888
I was sitting in my kitchen
finishing breakfast,

00:03:34.912 --> 00:03:38.541
and I look up on the screen
and see the words "Breaking News."

00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:42.466
There was smoke,
airplanes flying into buildings,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.253
people jumping out of buildings.

00:03:45.277 --> 00:03:46.940
What was this?

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:48.810
An accident?

00:03:49.786 --> 00:03:51.647
A malfunction?

00:03:53.084 --> 00:03:56.171
My shock quickly turned to outrage.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.795
Who would do this?

00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:01.831
And I switch the channel and I hear,

00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:03.782
"... Muslim terrorist ...,"

00:04:04.191 --> 00:04:06.188
"... in the name of Islam ...,"

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:08.561
"... Middle-Eastern descent ...,"

00:04:08.585 --> 00:04:10.396
"... jihad ...,"

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.871
"... we should bomb Mecca."

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:13.450
Oh my God.

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:19.056
Not only had my country been attacked,

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.422
but in a flash,

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:24.352
somebody else's actions
had turned me from a citizen

00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:25.798
to a suspect.

00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:31.958
That same day, we had to drive
across Middle America

00:04:31.982 --> 00:04:35.389
to move to a new city
to start grad school.

00:04:36.908 --> 00:04:38.991
And I remember sitting
in the passenger seat

00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:40.990
as we drove in silence,

00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:44.457
crouched as low as I could go in my seat,

00:04:44.481 --> 00:04:49.999
for the first time in my life,
afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.

00:04:50.943 --> 00:04:54.086
We moved into our apartment
that night in a new town

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.879
in what felt like
a completely different world.

00:04:57.928 --> 00:05:01.882
And then I was hearing
and seeing and reading

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:04.603
warnings from national
Muslim organizations

00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:07.558
saying things like,
"Be alert," "Be aware,"

00:05:08.312 --> 00:05:11.428
"Stay in well-lit areas,"
"Don't congregate."

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.071
I stayed inside all week.

00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:17.732
And then it was Friday that same week,

00:05:17.756 --> 00:05:21.152
the day that Muslims
congregate for worship.

00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:26.601
And again the warnings were,
"Don't go that first Friday,

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.347
it could be a target."

00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:32.163
And I was watching the news,
wall-to-wall coverage.

00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:35.052
Emotions were so raw, understandably,

00:05:35.076 --> 00:05:38.194
and I was also hearing
about attacks on Muslims,

00:05:38.778 --> 00:05:41.596
or people who were perceived
to be Muslim, being pulled out

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.842
and beaten in the street.

00:05:42.866 --> 00:05:44.980
Mosques were actually firebombed.

00:05:45.004 --> 00:05:46.992
And I thought, we should just stay home.

00:05:47.777 --> 00:05:50.525
And yet, something didn't feel right.

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:53.768
Because those people
who attacked our country

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:56.109
attacked our country.

00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:01.417
I get it that people were angry
at the terrorists.

00:06:01.441 --> 00:06:03.562
Guess what? So was I.

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:08.034
And so to have to explain yourself
all the time isn't easy.

00:06:10.193 --> 00:06:13.073
I don't mind questions. I love questions.

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:15.771
It's the accusations that are tough.

00:06:16.583 --> 00:06:19.230
Today we hear people actually
saying things like,

00:06:20.278 --> 00:06:23.084
"There's a problem in this country,
and it's called Muslims.

00:06:23.108 --> 00:06:24.946
When are we going to get rid of them?"

00:06:25.504 --> 00:06:28.716
So, some people want to ban Muslims
and close down mosques.

00:06:29.197 --> 00:06:32.255
They talk about my community
kind of like we're a tumor

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.920
in the body of America.

00:06:33.944 --> 00:06:37.205
And the only question is,
are we malignant or benign?

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:40.847
You know, a malignant tumor
you extract altogether,

00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:46.048
and a benign tumor
you just keep under surveillance.

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:51.332
The choices don't make sense,
because it's the wrong question.

00:06:51.893 --> 00:06:55.794
Muslims, like all other Americans,
aren't a tumor in the body of America,

00:06:55.818 --> 00:06:57.293
we're a vital organ.

00:06:58.109 --> 00:06:59.110
(Applause)

00:06:59.134 --> 00:07:00.293
Thank you.

00:07:00.317 --> 00:07:03.537
(Applause)

00:07:05.937 --> 00:07:08.503
Muslims are inventors and teachers,

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:11.565
first responders and Olympic athletes.

00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:15.741
Now, is closing down mosques
going to make America safer?

00:07:16.194 --> 00:07:19.270
It might free up some parking spots,

00:07:19.294 --> 00:07:20.937
but it will not end terrorism.

00:07:22.134 --> 00:07:24.587
Going to a mosque regularly
is actually linked

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:28.517
to having more tolerant views
of people of other faiths

00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:30.563
and greater civic engagement.

00:07:31.561 --> 00:07:34.842
And as one police chief
in the Washington, DC area

00:07:34.866 --> 00:07:36.017
recently told me,

00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:38.901
people don't actually
get radicalized at mosques.

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:43.017
They get radicalized in their basement
or bedroom, in front of a computer.

00:07:44.526 --> 00:07:47.356
And what you find
about the radicalization process

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.003
is it starts online,

00:07:49.027 --> 00:07:50.598
but the first thing that happens

00:07:50.622 --> 00:07:53.616
is the person gets cut off
from their community,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.282
from even their family,

00:07:55.306 --> 00:07:58.074
so that the extremist group
can brainwash them

00:07:58.098 --> 00:08:02.396
into believing that they,
the terrorists, are the true Muslims,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.436
and everyone else who abhors
their behavior and ideology

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.131
are sellouts or apostates.

00:08:09.607 --> 00:08:11.862
So if we want to prevent radicalization,

00:08:11.886 --> 00:08:15.284
we have to keep people
going to the mosque.

00:08:16.765 --> 00:08:20.493
Now, some will still argue
Islam is a violent religion.

00:08:20.517 --> 00:08:25.466
After all, a group like ISIS
bases its brutality on the Quran.

00:08:26.318 --> 00:08:29.652
Now, as a Muslim, as a mother,
as a human being,

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:34.397
I think we need to do everything we can
to stop a group like ISIS.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.600
But we would be giving in
to their narrative

00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:45.756
if we cast them as representatives
of a faith of 1.6 billion people.

00:08:46.373 --> 00:08:49.866
(Applause)

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.326
Thank you.

00:08:53.809 --> 00:08:57.093
ISIS has as much to do with Islam

00:08:57.117 --> 00:09:00.168
as the Ku Klux Klan has to do
with Christianity.

00:09:00.491 --> 00:09:05.158
(Applause)

00:09:06.795 --> 00:09:11.831
Both groups claim to base
their ideology on their holy book.

00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:15.373
But when you look at them,
they're not motivated

00:09:15.397 --> 00:09:17.681
by what they read in their holy book.

00:09:17.705 --> 00:09:22.852
It's their brutality that makes them
read these things into the scripture.

00:09:24.098 --> 00:09:27.748
Recently, a prominent imam
told me a story that really took me aback.

00:09:27.772 --> 00:09:29.511
He said that a girl came to him

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:31.924
because she was thinking
of going to join ISIS.

00:09:32.556 --> 00:09:34.604
And I was really surprised and asked him,

00:09:34.628 --> 00:09:37.874
had she been in contact
with a radical religious leader?

00:09:37.898 --> 00:09:40.193
And he said the problem
was quite the opposite,

00:09:40.217 --> 00:09:43.944
that every cleric that she had
talked to had shut her down

00:09:43.968 --> 00:09:47.565
and said that her rage,
her sense of injustice in the world,

00:09:47.589 --> 00:09:49.674
was just going to get her in trouble.

00:09:49.698 --> 00:09:53.379
And so with nowhere to channel
and make sense of this anger,

00:09:53.403 --> 00:09:55.418
she was a prime target to be exploited

00:09:55.442 --> 00:09:58.091
by extremists promising her a solution.

00:09:58.605 --> 00:10:02.871
What this imam did was to connect her
back to God and to her community.

00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:08.166
He didn't shame her for her rage --
instead, he gave her constructive ways

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.727
to make real change in the world.

00:10:10.751 --> 00:10:15.443
What she learned at that mosque
prevented her from going to join ISIS.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.238
I've told you a little bit

00:10:18.262 --> 00:10:21.052
about how Islamophobia
affects me and my family.

00:10:21.076 --> 00:10:23.616
But how does it impact ordinary Americans?

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.545
How does it impact everyone else?

00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:31.335
How does consuming fear 24 hours a day
affect the health of our democracy,

00:10:31.359 --> 00:10:33.007
the health of our free thought?

00:10:33.527 --> 00:10:37.398
Well, one study -- actually,
several studies in neuroscience --

00:10:37.422 --> 00:10:41.283
show that when we're afraid,
at least three things happen.

00:10:41.857 --> 00:10:45.978
We become more accepting
of authoritarianism,

00:10:46.002 --> 00:10:48.450
conformity and prejudice.

00:10:49.194 --> 00:10:54.981
One study showed that when subjects
were exposed to news stories

00:10:55.005 --> 00:10:57.989
that were negative about Muslims,

00:10:58.013 --> 00:11:02.128
they became more accepting
of military attacks on Muslim countries

00:11:02.152 --> 00:11:06.168
and policies that curtail the rights
of American Muslims.

00:11:06.192 --> 00:11:08.349
Now, this isn't just academic.

00:11:08.373 --> 00:11:12.765
When you look at when
anti-Muslim sentiment spiked

00:11:13.555 --> 00:11:17.103
between 2001 and 2013,

00:11:17.127 --> 00:11:18.694
it happened three times,

00:11:18.718 --> 00:11:20.943
but it wasn't around terrorist attacks.

00:11:21.294 --> 00:11:25.687
It was in the run up to the Iraq War
and during two election cycles.

00:11:26.155 --> 00:11:30.699
So Islamophobia isn't just
the natural response to Muslim terrorism

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:32.722
as I would have expected.

00:11:33.218 --> 00:11:37.696
It can actually be a tool
of public manipulation,

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.703
eroding the very foundation
of a free society,

00:11:41.727 --> 00:11:45.851
which is rational
and well-informed citizens.

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:49.136
Muslims are like canaries
in the coal mine.

00:11:49.655 --> 00:11:51.346
We might be the first to feel it,

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.407
but the toxic air of fear
is harming us all.

00:11:56.251 --> 00:12:01.804
(Applause)

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.979
And assigning collective guilt

00:12:06.003 --> 00:12:08.841
isn't just about having
to explain yourself all the time.

00:12:09.777 --> 00:12:13.425
Deah and his wife Yusor
were a young married couple

00:12:13.449 --> 00:12:15.448
living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina,

00:12:15.472 --> 00:12:17.071
where they both went to school.

00:12:17.686 --> 00:12:20.101
Deah was an athlete.

00:12:20.125 --> 00:12:23.657
He was in dental school,
talented, promising ...

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.478
And his sister would tell me
that he was the sweetest,

00:12:28.502 --> 00:12:30.537
most generous human being she knew.

00:12:30.561 --> 00:12:34.415
She was visiting him there
and he showed her his resume,

00:12:34.439 --> 00:12:35.701
and she was amazed.

00:12:35.725 --> 00:12:39.955
She said, "When did my baby brother
become such an accomplished young man?"

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:45.684
Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit
to her brother and his new wife,

00:12:46.237 --> 00:12:47.514
their neighbor,

00:12:48.732 --> 00:12:50.873
Craig Stephen Hicks,

00:12:50.897 --> 00:12:52.642
murdered them,

00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:57.447
as well as Yusor's sister, Razan,
who was visiting for the afternoon,

00:12:57.471 --> 00:12:59.230
in their apartment,

00:12:59.754 --> 00:13:01.509
execution style,

00:13:01.533 --> 00:13:05.489
after posting anti-Muslim statements
on his Facebook page.

00:13:06.058 --> 00:13:07.802
He shot Deah eight times.

00:13:09.254 --> 00:13:13.289
So bigotry isn't just immoral,
it can even be lethal.

00:13:14.355 --> 00:13:15.676
So, back to my story.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.400
What happened after 9/11?

00:13:17.424 --> 00:13:20.552
Did we go to the mosque
or did we play it safe and stay home?

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.272
Well, we talked it over,

00:13:23.296 --> 00:13:25.985
and it might seem like
a small decision, but to us,

00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:29.865
it was about what kind of America
we wanted to leave for our kids:

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:33.269
one that would control us by fear

00:13:33.293 --> 00:13:36.787
or one where we were practicing
our religion freely.

00:13:36.811 --> 00:13:38.659
So we decided to go to the mosque.

00:13:39.823 --> 00:13:41.566
And we put my son in his car seat,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.281
buckled him in, and we drove silently,
intensely, to the mosque.

00:13:45.305 --> 00:13:49.182
I took him out, I took off my shoes,
I walked into the prayer hall

00:13:50.609 --> 00:13:52.179
and what I saw made me stop.

00:13:53.271 --> 00:13:54.899
The place was completely full.

00:13:55.492 --> 00:13:57.680
And then the imam made an announcement,

00:13:57.704 --> 00:14:01.970
thanking and welcoming our guests,

00:14:02.564 --> 00:14:04.778
because half the congregation

00:14:05.833 --> 00:14:08.561
were Christians, Jews,
Buddhists, atheists,

00:14:08.585 --> 00:14:11.005
people of faith and no faith,

00:14:11.029 --> 00:14:15.930
who had come not to attack us,
but to stand in solidarity with us.

00:14:16.419 --> 00:14:23.390
(Applause)

00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:27.722
I just break down at this time.

00:14:28.674 --> 00:14:33.218
These people were there because they chose
courage and compassion

00:14:33.242 --> 00:14:35.340
over panic and prejudice.

00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:38.398
What will you choose?

00:14:39.122 --> 00:14:44.143
What will you choose
at this time of fear and bigotry?

00:14:45.397 --> 00:14:47.108
Will you play it safe?

00:14:47.914 --> 00:14:50.213
Or will you join those who say

00:14:50.237 --> 00:14:52.225
we are better than that?

00:14:52.249 --> 00:14:53.400
Thank you.

00:14:53.424 --> 00:14:57.748
(Applause)

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.274
Thank you so much.

00:15:12.497 --> 00:15:16.841
Helen Walters: So Dalia,
you seem to have struck a chord.

00:15:16.865 --> 00:15:18.402
But I wonder,

00:15:18.426 --> 00:15:20.885
what would you say to those
who might argue

00:15:20.909 --> 00:15:22.666
that you're giving a TED Talk,

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.245
you're clearly a deep thinker,

00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:26.276
you work at a fancy think tank,

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.413
you're an exception, you're not the rule.

00:15:28.437 --> 00:15:30.209
What would you say to those people?

00:15:30.841 --> 00:15:33.763
Dalia Mogahed: I would say,
don't let this stage distract you,

00:15:33.787 --> 00:15:34.992
I'm completely ordinary.

00:15:35.821 --> 00:15:37.066
I'm not an exception.

00:15:37.447 --> 00:15:39.467
My story is not unusual.

00:15:39.491 --> 00:15:42.474
I am as ordinary as they come.

00:15:42.498 --> 00:15:46.696
When you look at Muslims
around the world --

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.551
and I've done this, I've done
the largest study ever done

00:15:49.575 --> 00:15:51.117
on Muslims around the world --

00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:52.591
people want ordinary things.

00:15:52.615 --> 00:15:54.440
They want prosperity for their family,

00:15:54.464 --> 00:15:55.615
they want jobs

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:57.245
and they want to live in peace.

00:15:57.269 --> 00:16:00.315
So I am not in any way an exception.

00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:03.190
When you meet people who seem
like an exception to the rule,

00:16:03.214 --> 00:16:05.540
oftentimes it's that the rule is broken,

00:16:06.292 --> 00:16:08.512
not that they're an exception to it.

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:10.996
HW: Thank you so much.
Dalia Mogahed.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.694
(Applause)
