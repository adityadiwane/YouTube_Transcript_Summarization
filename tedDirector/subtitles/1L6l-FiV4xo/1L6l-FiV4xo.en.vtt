00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:19.257
So, last month, the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced

00:00:19.257 --> 00:00:21.006
that it is going out of print

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.831
after 244 years, which made me nostalgic,

00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:30.478
because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:31.727
back when I was a kid,

00:00:31.727 --> 00:00:33.070
maybe 12 years old.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.710
And I wondered if I could update that game,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.726
not just for modern methods,

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:39.430
but for the modern me.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.566
So I tried.

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.873
I went to an online encyclopedia,

00:00:41.873 --> 00:00:44.631
Wikipedia, and I entered the term "Earth."

00:00:44.631 --> 00:00:47.297
You can start anywhere, this time I chose Earth.

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.775
And the first rule of the game is pretty simple.

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:51.266
You just have to read the article

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.854
until you find something you don't know,

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:56.959
and preferably something your dad doesn't even know.

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.838
And in this case, I quickly found this:

00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:02.134
The furthest point from the center of the Earth

00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:04.607
is not the tip of Mount Everest, like I might have thought,

00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:07.903
it's the tip of this mountain: Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.

00:01:07.903 --> 00:01:11.423
The Earth spins, of course, as it travels around the sun,

00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:13.407
so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle,

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:14.534
like some Earthlings.

00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:19.424
And even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes,

00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:21.095
it's one degree away from the equator,

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:24.095
it's riding that bulge, and so the summit of Chimborazo

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:27.495
is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth.

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:30.447
And it is really fun to say.

00:01:30.447 --> 00:01:31.390
So I immediately decided,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.287
this is going to be the name of the game,

00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:34.774
or my new exclamation.

00:01:34.774 --> 00:01:35.744
You can use it at TED.

00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:37.073
Chimborazo, right?

00:01:37.073 --> 00:01:38.775
It's like "eureka" and "bingo" had a baby.

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:40.504
I didn't know that;

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:42.134
that's pretty cool.

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:43.799
Chimborazo!

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.424
So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple.

00:01:47.424 --> 00:01:50.311
You just have to find another term and look that up.

00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.476
Now in the old days, that meant getting out a volume

00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:54.111
and browsing through it alphabetically,

00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:55.150
maybe getting sidetracked,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.855
that was fun.

00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:58.486
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from.

00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:00.438
I can go literally anywhere in the world,

00:02:00.438 --> 00:02:02.167
I think since I was already in Ecuador,

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:04.878
I just decided to click on the word "tropical."

00:02:04.878 --> 00:02:10.119
That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.304
that encircles the Earth.

00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:13.765
Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:15.278
and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south,

00:02:15.278 --> 00:02:16.086
that much I knew,

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:18.287
but I was surprised to learn this little fact:

00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:20.553
Those are not cartographers' lines,

00:02:20.553 --> 00:02:24.158
like latitude or the borders between nations,

00:02:24.158 --> 00:02:26.889
they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt,

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.494
and they change.

00:02:28.494 --> 00:02:31.144
They move; they go up, they go down.

00:02:31.144 --> 00:02:34.343
In fact, for years, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn

00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:36.983
have been steadily drifting towards the equator

00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:39.480
at the rate of about 15 meters per year,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.646
and nobody told me that.

00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:41.470
I didn't know it.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.888
Chimborazo!

00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:48.664
So to keep the game going, I just have to find another term and look that one up.

00:02:48.664 --> 00:02:52.463
Since I'm already in the tropics, I chose "Tropical rainforest."

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:54.746
Famous for its diversity, human diversity.

00:02:54.746 --> 00:03:00.272
There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet.

00:03:00.272 --> 00:03:04.750
They're all over the globe, but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.727
This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get "friended."

00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:18.592
The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end.

00:03:18.592 --> 00:03:25.352
It mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:27.287
coleoptera,

00:03:27.287 --> 00:03:30.526
which turn out to be beetles.

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:32.750
Now I clicked on this on purpose,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.304
but if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake,

00:03:34.304 --> 00:03:36.401
it does remind me, for the band, see "The Beatles,"

00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:38.007
for the car see "Volkswagon Beetle,"

00:03:38.007 --> 00:03:40.744
but I am here for beetle beetles.

00:03:40.744 --> 00:03:44.614
This is the most successful order on the planet by far.

00:03:44.614 --> 00:03:48.864
Something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet,

00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:50.670
including plants, are beetles.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.853
That means the next time you are in the grocery store,

00:03:52.853 --> 00:03:55.055
take a look at the four people ahead of you in line.

00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:58.072
Statistically, one of you is a beetle.

00:03:58.072 --> 00:04:03.670
And if it is you, you are astonishingly well adapted.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.703
There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums.

00:04:08.703 --> 00:04:11.784
There are predator beetles, that attack other insects

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.567
and still look pretty cute to us.

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:17.071
There are beetles that roll little balls of dung

00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:20.366
great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings.

00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:24.150
This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.464
who renews the ball of the sun every morning,

00:04:27.464 --> 00:04:29.487
which is how that dung-rolling scarab

00:04:29.487 --> 00:04:34.855
became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun.

00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:40.783
Beetles, I was reminded, have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom.

00:04:40.783 --> 00:04:43.366
Fireflies are not flies, fireflies are beetles.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:48.678
Fireflies are coleoptera, and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well.

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:50.054
Like my next link:

00:04:50.054 --> 00:04:52.993
The chemical language of pheromones.

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:59.046
Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex.

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:02.726
Yeah.

00:05:02.726 --> 00:05:05.814
(Laughter)

00:05:05.814 --> 00:05:07.886
And the link to aphrodisiac.

00:05:07.886 --> 00:05:09.550
Now that's something that increases sexual desire,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.751
possibly chocolate.

00:05:11.751 --> 00:05:15.254
There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine

00:05:15.254 --> 00:05:16.624
that might be an aphrodisiac.

00:05:16.624 --> 00:05:18.879
But as the article mentions,

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.094
because of enzyme breakdown,

00:05:20.094 --> 00:05:24.264
it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally.

00:05:24.264 --> 00:05:27.374
So those of you who only eat your chocolate, you might have to experiment.

00:05:27.374 --> 00:05:31.184
The link I clicked on here,

00:05:31.184 --> 00:05:36.383
"sympathetic magic," mostly because I understand what both of those words mean.

00:05:36.383 --> 00:05:38.535
But not when they're together like that.

00:05:38.535 --> 00:05:41.526
I do like sympathy. I do like magic.

00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:42.871
So when I click on "sympathetic magic,"

00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:47.676
I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls.

00:05:47.676 --> 00:05:49.824
This is the boy in me getting lucky again.

00:05:49.824 --> 00:05:52.343
Sympathetic magic is imitation.

00:05:52.343 --> 00:05:54.750
If you imitate something, maybe you can have an effect on it.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.184
That's the idea behind voodoo dolls, and possibly also cave paintings.

00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:04.264
The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind.

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:06.271
I would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves.

00:06:06.271 --> 00:06:09.767
We've got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork.

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:14.766
Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands,

00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:17.087
usually the left hand.

00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:21.550
We have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia,

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.886
so even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.872
or blow pigment on it from a tube,

00:06:28.872 --> 00:06:31.464
I can easily picture how he did it.

00:06:31.464 --> 00:06:35.966
And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar

00:06:35.966 --> 00:06:39.298
right there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for "hand,"

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:45.590
go to the page for "hand," where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.624
I've found in a long time. It's simply this:

00:06:47.624 --> 00:06:51.806
The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar.

00:06:51.806 --> 00:06:55.479
Now that's embarrassing, because up until now,

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.679
every time I've said, "I know it like the back of my hand,"

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:01.038
I've really been saying, "I'm totally familiar with that,

00:07:01.038 --> 00:07:03.624
I just don't know it's freaking name, right?"

00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:07.278
And the link I clicked on here,

00:07:07.278 --> 00:07:11.430
well, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.680
I click on chimpanzee, and I get our closest genetic relative.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.671
Pan troglodytes, the name we give him, means "cave dweller."

00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:21.175
He doesn't.

00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:22.999
He lives in rainforests and savannas.

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:26.206
It's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us,

00:07:26.206 --> 00:07:29.270
evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.944
and in some cases, he gets places before us.

00:07:32.944 --> 00:07:38.166
Like my next link, the almost irresistible link, Ham the Astrochimp.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:42.344
I click on him, and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice, in fact.

00:07:42.344 --> 00:07:43.544
He's born in Cameroon,

00:07:43.544 --> 00:07:47.304
which is smack in the middle of my tropics map,

00:07:47.304 --> 00:07:53.526
and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles.

00:07:53.526 --> 00:07:56.479
In between those two landmarks in Ham's life,

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:59.015
he flew into space.

00:07:59.015 --> 00:08:02.252
He experienced weightlessness and re-entry

00:08:02.252 --> 00:08:04.823
months before the first human being to do it,

00:08:04.823 --> 00:08:07.687
Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:09.839
When I click on Yuri Gagarin's page,

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:12.758
I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature,

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.295
huge in heroism.

00:08:14.295 --> 00:08:18.638
Top estimates, Soviet estimates, put this guy at 1.65 meters,

00:08:18.638 --> 00:08:21.639
that is less than five and a half feet tall max,

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:24.445
possibly because he was malnourished as a child.

00:08:24.445 --> 00:08:26.990
Germans occupied Russia.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.087
A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household,

00:08:30.087 --> 00:08:32.891
and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut.

00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:36.438
Years later, the boy from that cramped mud hut

00:08:36.438 --> 00:08:39.944
would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule

00:08:39.944 --> 00:08:41.558
on the tip of a rocket

00:08:41.558 --> 00:08:45.046
who volunteered to be launched into outer space,

00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:49.398
the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet.

00:08:49.398 --> 00:08:50.746
And he didn't just leave it,

00:08:50.746 --> 00:08:53.271
he circled it once.

00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:55.497
Fifty years later, as a tribute,

00:08:55.497 --> 00:08:59.424
the International Space Station, which is still up there tonight,

00:08:59.424 --> 00:09:03.504
synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit,

00:09:03.504 --> 00:09:04.670
at the exact same time of day,

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.230
and filmed it,

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.814
so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes

00:09:09.814 --> 00:09:13.323
of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride,

00:09:13.323 --> 00:09:14.464
possibly a lonely one,

00:09:14.464 --> 00:09:16.744
the first person to ever see such a thing.

00:09:16.744 --> 00:09:18.167
And then when you've had your fill of that,

00:09:18.167 --> 00:09:20.784
you can click on one more link.

00:09:20.784 --> 00:09:22.126
You can come back to Earth.

00:09:22.126 --> 00:09:24.287
You return to where you started.

00:09:24.287 --> 00:09:26.504
You can finish your game.

00:09:26.504 --> 00:09:30.094
You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know.

00:09:30.094 --> 00:09:32.574
And for me, I quickly landed on this one:

00:09:32.574 --> 00:09:37.590
The Earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.559
which is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls.

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:43.991
This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy.

00:09:43.991 --> 00:09:45.238
I found it myself.

00:09:45.238 --> 00:09:47.513
It's got some math that I can do.

00:09:47.513 --> 00:09:49.638
I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it.

00:09:49.638 --> 00:09:55.127
What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball,

00:09:55.127 --> 00:10:01.144
if you could take planet Earth, with all its mountain tops and caves

00:10:01.144 --> 00:10:05.820
and rainforests, astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees, voodoo dolls,

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:11.344
fireflies, chocolate, sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea,

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:14.545
you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball,

00:10:14.545 --> 00:10:18.438
it would be as smooth as a billiard ball,

00:10:18.438 --> 00:10:23.055
presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle.

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:25.846
That's pretty cool.

00:10:25.846 --> 00:10:27.790
I didn't know that.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.015
Chimborazo!

00:10:30.015 --> 00:10:30.904
Thank you.

00:10:30.904 --> 00:10:31.553
(Applause)
