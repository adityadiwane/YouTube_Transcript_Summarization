00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:15.646
I would like to show you how

00:00:15.646 --> 00:00:18.523
architecture has helped

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:21.618
to change the life of my community

00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:26.433
and has opened opportunities to hope.

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:29.392
I am a native of Burkina Faso.

00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:32.610
According to the World Bank, Burkina Faso

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.659
is one of the poorest countries in the world,

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.506
but what does it look like

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:41.925
to grow up in a place like that?

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:44.485
I am an example of that.

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:48.393
I was born in a little village called Gando.

00:00:48.393 --> 00:00:52.885
In Gando, there was no electricity,

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:57.099
no access to clean drinking water, and no school.

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:59.923
But my father wanted me

00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:01.972
to learn how to read and write.

00:01:01.972 --> 00:01:06.020
For this reason, I had to leave my family

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.914
when I was seven and to stay in a city

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:11.902
far away from my village

00:01:11.902 --> 00:01:15.579
with no contact with my family.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.000
In this place I sat

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.226
in a class like that

00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:24.978
with more than 150 other kids,

00:01:24.978 --> 00:01:27.470
and for six years.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.550
In this time, it just happened to me to come to school

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.245
to realize that my classmate died.

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:41.758
Today, not so much has changed.

00:01:41.758 --> 00:01:46.211
There is still no electricity in my village.

00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:48.673
People still are dying in Burkina Faso,

00:01:48.673 --> 00:01:52.276
and access to clean drinking water

00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:56.499
is still a big problem.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:04.051
I had luck. I was lucky, because this is a fact of life

00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:06.803
when you grow up in a place like that.

00:02:06.803 --> 00:02:09.172
But I was lucky.

00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:11.256
I had a scholarship.

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:15.466
I could go to Germany to study.

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:19.371
So now, I suppose,

00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:24.045
I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege

00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:28.502
it is for me to be standing before you today.

00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:32.874
From Gando, my home village in Burkina Faso,

00:02:32.874 --> 00:02:37.180
to Berlin in Germany to become an architect

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.345
is a big, big step.

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:47.997
But what to do with this privilege?

00:02:47.997 --> 00:02:51.952
Since I was a student, I wanted to open up

00:02:51.952 --> 00:02:54.595
better opportunities to other kids in Gando.

00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:57.510
I just wanted to use my skills and build a school.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.494
But how do you do it when you're still a student

00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:02.576
and you don't have money?

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:05.078
Oh yes, I started to make drawings

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:07.060
and asked for money.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.039
Fundraising was not an easy task.

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.838
I even asked my classmates

00:03:13.838 --> 00:03:17.016
to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes,

00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:20.984
but to sponsor my school project.

00:03:20.984 --> 00:03:24.000
In real wonder, two years later,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.534
I was able to collect 50,000 U.S. dollars.

00:03:30.534 --> 00:03:33.497
When I came home to Gando

00:03:33.497 --> 00:03:35.022
to bring the good news,

00:03:35.022 --> 00:03:39.171
my people were over the moon,

00:03:39.171 --> 00:03:41.792
but when they realized

00:03:41.792 --> 00:03:44.636
that I was planning to use clay,

00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:46.719
they were shocked.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.262
"A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season,

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:55.371
and Francis wants us to use it and build a school.

00:03:55.371 --> 00:03:58.135
Is this the reason why he spent so much time

00:03:58.135 --> 00:04:00.148
in Europe studying

00:04:00.148 --> 00:04:04.247
instead of working in the field with us?"

00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:08.540
My people build all the time with clay,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.461
but they don't see any innovation with mud.

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:15.650
So I had to convince everybody.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.033
I started to speak with the community,

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:21.496
and I could convince everybody,

00:04:21.496 --> 00:04:24.506
and we could start to work.

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:26.270
And the women, the men,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.315
everybody from the village,

00:04:28.315 --> 00:04:30.332
was part of this building process.

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:34.041
I was allowed to use even traditional techniques.

00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:36.204
So clay floor for example,

00:04:36.204 --> 00:04:40.600
the young men come and stand like that, beating,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.196
hours for hours,

00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:43.908
and then their mothers came,

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:47.642
and they are beating in this position,

00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:52.258
for hours, giving water and beating.

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:53.886
And then the polishers come.

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:58.944
They start polishing it with a stone for hours.

00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:03.901
And then you have this result,

00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:07.210
very fine, like a baby bottom.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.983
(Laughter)

00:05:08.983 --> 00:05:14.248
It's not photoshopped. (Laughter)

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:17.232
This is the school, built with the community.

00:05:17.232 --> 00:05:19.022
The walls are totally made out

00:05:19.022 --> 00:05:23.122
of compressed clay blocks from Gando.

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:26.276
The roof structure is made

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:29.098
with cheap steel bars

00:05:29.098 --> 00:05:32.994
normally hiding inside concrete.

00:05:32.994 --> 00:05:36.062
And the classroom, the ceiling is made

00:05:36.062 --> 00:05:38.817
out of both of them used together.

00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:41.727
In this school, there was a simple idea:

00:05:41.727 --> 00:05:45.437
to create comfort in a classroom.

00:05:45.437 --> 00:05:50.608
Don't forget, it can be 45 degrees in Burkina Faso,

00:05:50.608 --> 00:05:52.542
so with simple ventilation,

00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:54.592
I wanted to make the classroom

00:05:54.592 --> 00:05:57.201
good for teaching and learning.

00:05:57.201 --> 00:06:00.046
And this is the project today,

00:06:00.046 --> 00:06:03.680
12 years old, still in best condition.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.252
And the kids, they love it.

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:12.791
And for me and my community,

00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:16.446
this project was a huge success.

00:06:16.446 --> 00:06:19.348
It has opened up opportunities

00:06:19.348 --> 00:06:21.939
to do more projects in Gando.

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.877
So I could do a lot of projects,

00:06:24.877 --> 00:06:27.201
and here I am going to share with you

00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:29.381
only three of them.

00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:33.177
The first one is the school extension, of course.

00:06:33.177 --> 00:06:36.492
How do you explain drawings and engineering

00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:40.144
to people who are neither able to read nor write?

00:06:40.144 --> 00:06:43.091
I started to build a prototype like that.

00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:46.077
The innovation was to build a clay vault.

00:06:46.077 --> 00:06:49.408
So then, I jumped on the top like that,

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:51.720
with my team, and it works.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.947
The community is looking. It still works.

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:56.805
So we can build. (Laughter)

00:06:56.805 --> 00:07:00.688
And we kept building, and that is the result.

00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:04.322
The kids are happy, and they love it.

00:07:04.322 --> 00:07:08.483
The community is very proud. We made it.

00:07:08.483 --> 00:07:12.624
And even animals, like these donkeys,

00:07:12.624 --> 00:07:14.384
love our buildings.

00:07:14.384 --> 00:07:18.031
(Laughter)

00:07:18.031 --> 00:07:22.698
The next project is the library in Gando.

00:07:22.698 --> 00:07:26.361
And see now, we tried to introduce

00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:28.876
different ideas in our buildings,

00:07:28.876 --> 00:07:32.707
but we often don't have so much material.

00:07:32.707 --> 00:07:36.110
Something we have in Gando are clay pots.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.431
We wanted to use them to create openings.

00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:41.541
So we just bring them like you can see

00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:43.967
to the building site.

00:07:43.967 --> 00:07:46.133
we start cutting them,

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:49.064
and then we place them on top of the roof

00:07:49.064 --> 00:07:51.643
before we pour the concrete,

00:07:51.643 --> 00:07:53.654
and you have this result.

00:07:53.654 --> 00:07:56.564
The openings are letting the hot air out

00:07:56.564 --> 00:07:58.403
and light in.

00:07:58.403 --> 00:08:00.476
Very simple.

00:08:00.476 --> 00:08:03.314
My most recent project in Gando

00:08:03.314 --> 00:08:05.332
is a high school project.

00:08:05.332 --> 00:08:07.265
I would like to share with you this.

00:08:07.265 --> 00:08:09.510
The innovation in this project

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:14.253
is to cast mud like you cast concrete.

00:08:14.253 --> 00:08:16.378
How do you cast mud?

00:08:16.378 --> 00:08:19.644
We start making a lot of mortars, like you can see,

00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:21.767
and when everything is ready,

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:23.904
when you know what is the best recipe

00:08:23.904 --> 00:08:25.098
and the best form,

00:08:25.098 --> 00:08:27.749
you start working with the community.

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:29.895
And sometimes I can leave.

00:08:29.895 --> 00:08:31.654
They will do it themselves.

00:08:31.654 --> 00:08:35.206
I came to speak to you like that.

00:08:35.206 --> 00:08:37.897
Another factor in Gando is rain.

00:08:37.897 --> 00:08:39.721
When the rains come,

00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:42.009
we hurry up to protect our fragile walls

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:45.061
against the rain.

00:08:45.061 --> 00:08:48.573
Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude.

00:08:48.573 --> 00:08:51.138
It is simply how we protect our walls.

00:08:51.138 --> 00:08:52.607
(Laughter)

00:08:52.607 --> 00:08:55.485
The rain in Burkina comes very fast,

00:08:55.485 --> 00:08:58.050
and after that, you have floods

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.995
everywhere in the country.

00:09:00.995 --> 00:09:04.045
But for us, the rain is good.

00:09:04.045 --> 00:09:07.950
It brings sand and gravel to the river

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.221
we need to use to build.

00:09:10.221 --> 00:09:12.122
We just wait for the rain to go.

00:09:12.122 --> 00:09:15.716
We take the sand, we mix it with clay,

00:09:15.716 --> 00:09:18.502
and we keep building.

00:09:18.502 --> 00:09:20.307
That is it.

00:09:20.307 --> 00:09:23.401
The Gando project was always
connected to training the people,

00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:26.893
because I just wanted, one day

00:09:26.893 --> 00:09:29.796
when I fall down and die,

00:09:29.796 --> 00:09:32.480
that at least one person from Gando

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.222
keeps doing this work.

00:09:36.222 --> 00:09:39.065
But you will be surprised. I'm still alive.

00:09:39.065 --> 00:09:40.615
(Laughter)

00:09:40.615 --> 00:09:43.792
And my people now can use their skills

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.969
to earn money themselves.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.793
Usually, for a young man from Gando to earn money,

00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:54.889
you have to leave the country

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:58.132
to the city, sometimes leave the country

00:09:58.132 --> 00:10:00.124
and some never come back,

00:10:00.124 --> 00:10:03.568
making the community weaker.

00:10:03.568 --> 00:10:07.245
But now they can stay in the country

00:10:07.245 --> 00:10:09.437
and work on different building sites

00:10:09.437 --> 00:10:11.324
and earn money to feed their family.

00:10:11.324 --> 00:10:14.480
There's a new quality in this work.

00:10:16.278 --> 00:10:18.474
Yes, you know it.

00:10:18.474 --> 00:10:23.128
I have won a lot of awards through this work.

00:10:23.128 --> 00:10:26.809
For sure, it has opened opportunities.

00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:29.201
I have become myself known.

00:10:29.201 --> 00:10:34.091
But the reason why I do what I do

00:10:34.091 --> 00:10:37.566
is my community.

00:10:37.566 --> 00:10:39.680
When I was a kid,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.463
I was going to school,

00:10:41.463 --> 00:10:45.494
I was coming back every holiday to Gando.

00:10:45.494 --> 00:10:47.637
By the end of every holidays,

00:10:47.637 --> 00:10:50.681
I had to say goodbye to the community,

00:10:50.681 --> 00:10:54.427
going from one compound to another one.

00:10:54.427 --> 00:10:59.658
All women in Gando will open their clothes like that

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:03.593
and give me the last penny.

00:11:03.593 --> 00:11:08.714
In my culture, this is a symbol of deep affection.

00:11:08.714 --> 00:11:11.897
As a seven-year-old guy, I was impressed.

00:11:11.897 --> 00:11:14.487
I just asked my mother one day,

00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:17.230
"Why do all these women love me so much?"

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.979
(Laughter)

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:21.314
She just answered,

00:11:21.314 --> 00:11:25.095
"They are contributing to pay for your education

00:11:25.095 --> 00:11:28.440
hoping that you will be successful

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.538
and one day come back and help

00:11:31.538 --> 00:11:35.570
improve the quality of life of the community."

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.448
I hope now that I was able
to make my community proud

00:11:40.448 --> 00:11:42.321
through this work,

00:11:42.321 --> 00:11:46.133
and I hope I was able to prove you the power

00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:47.772
of community,

00:11:47.772 --> 00:11:51.499
and to show you that architecture

00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:56.188
can be inspiring for communities

00:11:56.188 --> 00:11:58.441
to shape their own future.

00:11:58.441 --> 00:12:00.828
Merci beaucoup. (Applause)

00:12:00.828 --> 00:12:05.169
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:12:05.169 --> 00:12:06.849
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
