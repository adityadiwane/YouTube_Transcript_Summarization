00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I want to say that really and truly,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
after these incredible speeches

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and ideas that are being spread,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I am in the awkward position

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
of being here to talk to you today

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
about television.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
So most everyone watches TV.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
We like it. We like some parts of it.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Here in America, people actually love TV.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
The average American watches TV

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
for almost 5 hours a day.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Okay?

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Now I happen to make my living these days in television,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
so for me, that's a good thing.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
But a lot of people don't love it so much.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
They, in fact, berate it.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
They call it stupid,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and worse, believe me.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
My mother, growing up,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
she called it the "idiot box."

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
But my idea today is not to debate

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV;

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
my idea today

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
is to tell you that I believe

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
television has a conscience.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
So why I believe that television has a conscience

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
is that I actually believe

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
that television directly reflects

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
the moral, political,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
social and emotional need states of our nation --

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
that television is how we actually disseminate

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
our entire value system.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
So all these things are uniquely human,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and they all add up

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
to our idea of conscience.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
We're talking about popular TV.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
We're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
over the course of 50 years.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
How do these Nielsen ratings

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
reflect not just what you've heard about,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
over 50 years

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
reflect the idea

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
of our social conscience?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
How does television evolve over time,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and what does this say about our society?

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Now speaking of evolution,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
from basic biology, you probably remember

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
that the animal kingdom, including humans,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
have four basic primal instincts.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
You have hunger; you have sex; you have power;

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and you have the urge for acquisitiveness.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
As humans, what's important to remember

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
is that we've developed, we've evolved over time

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
to temper, or tame,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
these basic animal instincts.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
We have the capacity to laugh and cry.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
We feel awe, we feel pity.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
That is separate and apart

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
from the animal kingdom.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
The other thing about human beings

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
is that we love to be entertained.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
We love to watch TV.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
This is something that clearly separates us

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
from the animal kingdom.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Animals might love to play,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
but they don't love to watch.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
So I had an ambition

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
to discover what could be understood

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
from this uniquely human relationship

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
between television programs

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and the human conscious.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
I kind of think of it

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
as this cartoon devil or angel

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
sitting on our shoulders.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Is television literally functioning

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
as our conscience,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
tempting us and rewarding us at the same time?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
So to begin to answer these questions,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
we did a research study.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
We went back 50 years

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
to the 1959/1960 television season.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
every year for 50 years --

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
a thousand shows.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
We talked to over 3,000 individuals --

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
almost 3,600 --

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
aged 18 to 70,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and we asked them how they felt emotionally.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
How did you feel

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
watching every single one of these shows?

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity?

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Did you feel outrage? Did you laugh?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
What did this mean for you?

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
So to our global TED audiences,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
I want to say that this was a U.S. sample.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
But as you can see,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
these emotional need states are truly universal.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And on a factual basis,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
over 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
are exported around the world.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
So I really hope our global audiences

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
can relate.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
Two acknowledgments

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
before our first data slide:

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
For inspiring me

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
to even think about the idea of conscience

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
I thank legendary rabbi, Jack Stern.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And for the way in which I'm going to present the data,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
who you may have just seen.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Okay, here we go.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
So here you see,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
from 1960 to 2010,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
the 50 years of our study.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Two things we're going to start with --

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
which, for this purpose,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
we defined inspiration

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
as television shows that uplift me,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
that make me feel much more positive about the world.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Moral ambiguity are televisions shows

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
in which I don't understand

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
the difference between right and wrong.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
As we start, you see in 1960

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
inspiration is holding steady.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
That's what we're watching TV for.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Moral ambiguity starts to climb.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Right at the end of the 60s,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
moral ambiguity is going up,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
inspiration is kind of on the wane.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Why?

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
The Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
the Civil Rights movement,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
race riots, the Vietnam War,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
MLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Watergate.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
Look what happens.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
In 1970, inspiration plummets.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Moral ambiguity takes off.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
They cross,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
but Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
It's trying to recover.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
But look, it can't:

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
AIDS, Iran-Contra,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.260
Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
from 1990 for the next 20 years.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Take a look at this.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
This chart is going to document a very similar trend.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
But in this case, we have comfort -- the bubble in red --

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
social commentary and irreverence

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
in blue and green.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Now this time on TV

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
you have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke,"

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
you have "Andy Griffith,"

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
you have domestic shows all about comfort.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
This is rising. Comfort stays whole.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
Irreverence starts to rise.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
You get to 1969, and look what happens.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
You have comfort, irreverence, and social commentary,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
not only battling it out in our society,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.260
but you literally have two establishment shows --

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
"Gunsmoke" and "Gomer Pyle" --

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
What's number one?

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
The socially irreverent hippie show,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
They're all living together, right.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Viewers had responded dramatically.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Look at this green spike in 1966

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
to a bellwether show.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
When you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
what does that mean?

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
It means in the 1966 television season,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.260
The "Smothers Brothers" came out of nowhere.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
This was the first show

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
that allowed viewers to say,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
"My God,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
about the presidency, through television?"

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
That's what we mean by a breakout show.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
So then, just like the last chart, look what happens.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
In 1970,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
the dam bursts. The dam bursts.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
Comfort is no longer why we watch television.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Social commentary and irreverence

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
rise throughout the 70s.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Now look at this.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
The 70s means who? Norman Lear.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
You have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son,"

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and the dominant show --

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
in the top-10 for the entire 70s --

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
"M<i>A</i>S*H."

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
In the entire 50 years

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
of television that we studied,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
seven of 10 shows

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
ranked most highly for irreverence

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
appeared on air during the Vietnam War,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.260
five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Only one generation, 20 years in,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and we discovered,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Wow! TV can do that?

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
It can make me feel this?

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
It can change us?

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
So to this very, very savvy crowd,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
I also want to note

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
the digital folks did not invent disruptive.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
along with the rest of us

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
40 years ago.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute:

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
fantasy and imagination,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
which are shows defined as,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
"takes me out of my everyday realm"

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
and "makes me feel better."

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
That's mapped against the red dot, unemployment,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.260
which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
You'll see

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
it maps to a spike in unemployment.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Do we want to see shows

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
about people saving money and being unemployed?

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
No. In the 70s

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
you have the bellwether show "The Bionic Woman"

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
followed by the "Six Million-Dollar Man" and "Charlie's Angels."

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Another spike in the 1980s --

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.260
another spike in shows about control and power.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
What were those shows?

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Glamorous and rich.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
"Dallas," "Fantasy Island."

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Incredible mapping of our national psyche

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
with some hard and fast facts:

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
unemployment.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
So here you are, in my favorite chart,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
because this is our last 20 years.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Whether or not you're in my business,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
you have surely heard or read

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and the rise of reality TV.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Well, as we say in the business,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
X marks the spot.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor --

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
we're watching "Friends," "Frasier," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld."

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Everything's good, low unemployment.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
But look: X marks the spot.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
In 2001,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
the September 2001 television season,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.260
humor succumbs to judgment once and for all.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Why not?

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
We had a 2000 presidential election

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
decided by the Supreme Court.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
We had the bursting of the tech bubble.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
We had 9/11.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
Look what happens when we keep going.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
At the turn of the century, the Internet takes off,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
reality television has taken hold.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
What do people want in their TV then?

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
I would have thought revenge

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
or nostalgia.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Give me some comfort; my world is falling apart.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
No, they want judgment.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
I can vote you off the island.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
That's all great, right?

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So as dramatically different as these television shows,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
pure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years --

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
what did I start with? --

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
one basic instinct remains.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
We're animals, we need our moms.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
There has not been a decade of television

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.260
without a definitive, dominant TV mom.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
The 1950s:

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
June Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver."

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Lucille Ball kept us laughing

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Maude Findlay,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
the epitome of the irreverent 1970s,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
who tackled abortion, divorce,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
even menopause on TV.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
The 1980s,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
our first cougar was given to us

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
in the form of Alexis Carrington.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
Murphy Brown took on a vice president

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.260
when she took on the idea of single parenthood.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
This era's mom,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Bree Van de Kamp.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
sitting on our conscience,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
sitting on television's shoulders,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.260
but I do know that I absolutely love this image.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
So to you all,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
the women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
the global audiences of TEDWomen,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
thank you for letting me present my idea

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
about the conscience of television.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
But let me also thank the incredible creators

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
who get up everyday

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
to put their ideas on our television screens

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
throughout all these ages of television.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
They give it life on television, for sure,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
but it's you as viewers,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
through your collective social consciences,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
that give it life, longevity,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
power or not.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
So thanks very much.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
(Applause)
