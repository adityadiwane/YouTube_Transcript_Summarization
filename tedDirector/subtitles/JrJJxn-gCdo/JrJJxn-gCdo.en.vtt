00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:15.187
We live in a very complex environment:

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:17.091
complexity and dynamism

00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:19.154
and patterns of evidence

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:22.039
from satellite photographs, from videos.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.050
You can even see it outside your window.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.910
It's endlessly complex, but somehow familiar,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.870
but the patterns kind of repeat,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.360
but they never repeat exactly.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.487
It's a huge challenge to understand.

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:39.619
The patterns that you see

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:43.339
are there at all of the different scales,

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.245
but you can't chop it into one little bit and say,

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:48.908
"Oh, well let me just make a smaller climate."

00:00:48.908 --> 00:00:53.120
I can't use the normal products of reductionism

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.842
to get a smaller and smaller thing that I can study

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:58.150
in a laboratory and say, "Oh,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.546
now that's something I now understand."

00:01:00.546 --> 00:01:03.913
It's the whole or it's nothing.

00:01:03.913 --> 00:01:06.465
The different scales that give you

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:08.587
these kinds of patterns

00:01:08.587 --> 00:01:12.044
range over an enormous range of magnitude,

00:01:12.044 --> 00:01:14.460
roughly 14 orders of magnitude,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.951
from the small microscopic particles

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.327
that seed clouds

00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:21.887
to the size of the planet itself,

00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:23.163
from 10 to the minus six

00:01:23.163 --> 00:01:24.240
to 10 to the eight,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.532
14 orders of spatial magnitude.

00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:29.943
In time, from milliseconds to millennia,

00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:32.998
again around 14 orders of magnitude.

00:01:32.998 --> 00:01:34.385
What does that mean?

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:36.324
Okay, well if you think about how

00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:38.984
you can calculate these things,

00:01:38.984 --> 00:01:40.944
you can take what you can see,

00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:41.970
okay, I'm going to chop it up

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.349
into lots of little boxes,

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:45.704
and that's the result of physics, right?

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:47.429
And if I think about a weather model,

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.923
that spans about five orders of magnitude,

00:01:49.923 --> 00:01:53.050
from the planet to a few kilometers,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.588
and the time scale

00:01:54.588 --> 00:01:59.000
from a few minutes to 10 days, maybe a month.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.395
We're interested in more than that.

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:01.700
We're interested in the climate.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.841
That's years, that's millennia,

00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:06.414
and we need to go to even smaller scales.

00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:08.015
The stuff that we can't resolve,

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:09.980
the sub-scale processes,

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.960
we need to approximate in some way.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.722
That is a huge challenge.

00:02:13.722 --> 00:02:15.910
Climate models in the 1990s

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.880
took an even smaller chunk of that,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.898
only about three orders of magnitude.

00:02:19.898 --> 00:02:21.993
Climate models in the 2010s,

00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:23.767
kind of what we're working with now,

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:26.707
four orders of magnitude.

00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:29.010
We have 14 to go,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.210
and we're increasing our capability

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.080
of simulating those at about

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.626
one extra order of magnitude every decade.

00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:38.521
One extra order of magnitude in space

00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:41.770
is 10,000 times more calculations.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.150
And we keep adding more things,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.524
more questions to these different models.

00:02:46.524 --> 00:02:49.257
So what does a climate model look like?

00:02:49.257 --> 00:02:51.598
This is an old climate model, admittedly,

00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:55.678
a punch card, a single line of Fortran code.

00:02:55.678 --> 00:02:57.656
We no longer use punch cards.

00:02:57.656 --> 00:02:59.897
We do still use Fortran.

00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:01.854
New-fangled ideas like C

00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:05.089
really haven't had a big impact

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:07.456
on the climate modeling community.

00:03:07.456 --> 00:03:08.856
But how do we go about doing it?

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:13.480
How do we go from that complexity that you saw

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.010
to a line of code?

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.583
We do it one piece at a time.

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:19.461
This is a picture of sea ice

00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:21.559
taken flying over the Arctic.

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:23.597
We can look at all of the different equations

00:03:23.597 --> 00:03:26.709
that go into making the ice grow

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.823
or melt or change shape.

00:03:28.823 --> 00:03:29.954
We can look at the fluxes.

00:03:29.954 --> 00:03:31.906
We can look at the rate at which

00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:34.751
snow turns to ice, and we can code that.

00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.080
We can encapsulate that in code.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.306
These models are around

00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:40.389
a million lines of code at this point,

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.859
and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.050
every year.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.703
So you can look at that piece,

00:03:46.703 --> 00:03:48.625
but you can look at the other pieces too.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:50.558
What happens when you have clouds?

00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:52.717
What happens when clouds form,

00:03:52.717 --> 00:03:54.599
when they dissipate, when they rain out?

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.341
That's another piece.

00:03:56.341 --> 00:03:58.187
What happens when we have radiation

00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:00.721
coming from the sun, going through the atmosphere,

00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:02.647
being absorbed and reflected?

00:04:02.647 --> 00:04:06.626
We can code each of those
very small pieces as well.

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:08.042
There are other pieces:

00:04:08.042 --> 00:04:11.502
the winds changing the ocean currents.

00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:15.272
We can talk about the role of vegetation

00:04:15.272 --> 00:04:17.601
in transporting water from the soils

00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:19.570
back into the atmosphere.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.484
And each of these different elements

00:04:22.484 --> 00:04:26.108
we can encapsulate and put into a system.

00:04:26.108 --> 00:04:31.256
Each of those pieces ends up adding to the whole.

00:04:31.256 --> 00:04:33.553
And you get something like this.

00:04:33.553 --> 00:04:36.401
You get a beautiful representation

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.023
of what's going on in the climate system,

00:04:39.023 --> 00:04:42.412
where each and every one of those

00:04:42.412 --> 00:04:45.194
emergent patterns that you can see,

00:04:45.194 --> 00:04:47.197
the swirls in the Southern Ocean,

00:04:47.197 --> 00:04:49.953
the tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico,

00:04:49.953 --> 00:04:51.594
and there's two more that are going to pop up

00:04:51.594 --> 00:04:53.948
in the Pacific at any point now,

00:04:53.948 --> 00:04:56.661
those rivers of atmospheric water,

00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:59.518
all of those are emergent properties

00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:01.642
that come from the interactions

00:05:01.642 --> 00:05:05.137
of all of those small-scale processes I mentioned.

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:07.042
There's no code that says,

00:05:07.042 --> 00:05:08.899
"Do a wiggle in the Southern Ocean."

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.567
There's no code that says, "Have two

00:05:11.567 --> 00:05:14.465
tropical cyclones that spin around each other."

00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:18.277
All of those things are emergent properties.

00:05:18.277 --> 00:05:20.423
This is all very good. This is all great.

00:05:20.423 --> 00:05:21.693
But what we really want to know

00:05:21.693 --> 00:05:23.642
is what happens to these emergent properties

00:05:23.642 --> 00:05:25.347
when we kick the system?

00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:28.880
When something changes, what
happens to those properties?

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.869
And there's lots of different ways to kick the system.

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:33.902
There are wobbles in the Earth's orbit

00:05:33.902 --> 00:05:35.781
over hundreds of thousands of years

00:05:35.781 --> 00:05:37.807
that change the climate.

00:05:37.807 --> 00:05:39.943
There are changes in the solar cycles,

00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:43.048
every 11 years and longer, that change the climate.

00:05:43.048 --> 00:05:46.622
Big volcanoes go off and change the climate.

00:05:46.622 --> 00:05:49.860
Changes in biomass burning, in smoke,

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.723
in aerosol particles, all of those things

00:05:51.723 --> 00:05:53.545
change the climate.

00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:57.604
The ozone hole changed the climate.

00:05:57.604 --> 00:05:59.821
Deforestation changes the climate

00:05:59.821 --> 00:06:01.747
by changing the surface properties

00:06:01.747 --> 00:06:03.737
and how water is evaporated

00:06:03.737 --> 00:06:06.203
and moved around in the system.

00:06:06.203 --> 00:06:08.488
Contrails change the climate

00:06:08.488 --> 00:06:11.355
by creating clouds where there were none before,

00:06:11.355 --> 00:06:15.953
and of course greenhouse gases change the system.

00:06:15.953 --> 00:06:18.974
Each of these different kicks

00:06:18.974 --> 00:06:21.125
provides us with a target

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:23.960
to evaluate whether we understand

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.121
something about this system.

00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:28.513
So we can go to look at

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:31.217
what model skill is.

00:06:31.217 --> 00:06:33.250
Now I use the word "skill" advisedly:

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.661
Models are not right or wrong; they're always wrong.

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.381
They're always approximations.

00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:39.275
The question you have to ask

00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:42.354
is whether a model tells you more information

00:06:42.354 --> 00:06:44.279
than you would have had otherwise.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.660
If it does, it's skillful.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.114
This is the impact of the ozone hole

00:06:50.114 --> 00:06:52.974
on sea level pressure, so
low pressure, high pressures,

00:06:52.974 --> 00:06:55.569
around the southern oceans, around Antarctica.

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:57.482
This is observed data.

00:06:57.482 --> 00:06:59.570
This is modeled data.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.164
There's a good match

00:07:01.164 --> 00:07:03.115
because we understand the physics

00:07:03.115 --> 00:07:06.253
that controls the temperatures in the stratosphere

00:07:06.253 --> 00:07:07.999
and what that does to the winds

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:10.180
around the southern oceans.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.699
We can look at other examples.

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:14.555
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991

00:07:14.555 --> 00:07:17.354
put an enormous amount of aerosols, small particles,

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:18.941
into the stratosphere.

00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:22.088
That changed the radiation
balance of the whole planet.

00:07:22.088 --> 00:07:24.870
There was less energy coming
in than there was before,

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.528
so that cooled the planet,

00:07:26.528 --> 00:07:28.547
and those red lines and those green lines,

00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:31.112
those are the differences between what we expected

00:07:31.112 --> 00:07:32.800
and what actually happened.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.583
The models are skillful,

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:36.276
not just in the global mean,

00:07:36.276 --> 00:07:39.320
but also in the regional patterns.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.160
I could go through a dozen more examples:

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.010
the skill associated with solar cycles,

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.080
changing the ozone in the stratosphere;

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.427
the skill associated with orbital changes

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.483
over 6,000 years.

00:07:51.483 --> 00:07:53.881
We can look at that too, and the models are skillful.

00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:56.975
The models are skillful in response to the ice sheets

00:07:56.975 --> 00:07:58.495
20,000 years ago.

00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:00.166
The models are skillful

00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:03.070
when it comes to the 20th-century trends

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.585
over the decades.

00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:06.867
Models are successful at modeling

00:08:06.867 --> 00:08:09.472
lake outbursts into the North Atlantic

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:11.237
8,000 years ago.

00:08:11.237 --> 00:08:14.327
And we can get a good match to the data.

00:08:15.463 --> 00:08:17.850
Each of these different targets,

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.980
each of these different evaluations,

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.371
leads us to add more scope

00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:23.522
to these models,

00:08:23.522 --> 00:08:26.266
and leads us to more and more

00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:30.254
complex situations that we can ask

00:08:30.254 --> 00:08:32.823
more and more interesting questions,

00:08:32.823 --> 00:08:35.533
like, how does dust from the Sahara,

00:08:35.533 --> 00:08:37.267
that you can see in the orange,

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:40.710
interact with tropical cyclones in the Atlantic?

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.187
How do organic aerosols from biomass burning,

00:08:44.187 --> 00:08:46.910
which you can see in the red dots,

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.844
intersect with clouds and rainfall patterns?

00:08:49.844 --> 00:08:51.631
How does pollution, which you can see

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:55.530
in the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe,

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.865
how does that affect the
temperatures at the surface

00:08:58.865 --> 00:09:02.353
and the sunlight that you get at the surface?

00:09:02.353 --> 00:09:05.841
We can look at this across the world.

00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:09.501
We can look at the pollution from China.

00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:13.099
We can look at the impacts of storms

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:16.543
on sea salt particles in the atmosphere.

00:09:16.543 --> 00:09:19.104
We can see the combination

00:09:19.104 --> 00:09:21.275
of all of these different things

00:09:21.275 --> 00:09:22.743
happening all at once,

00:09:22.743 --> 00:09:25.150
and we can ask much more interesting questions.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.774
How do air pollution and climate coexist?

00:09:29.774 --> 00:09:31.283
Can we change things

00:09:31.283 --> 00:09:33.872
that affect air pollution and
climate at the same time?

00:09:33.872 --> 00:09:36.216
The answer is yes.

00:09:36.216 --> 00:09:39.260
So this is a history of the 20th century.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.503
The first one is the model.

00:09:41.503 --> 00:09:42.910
The weather is a little bit different

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.199
to what actually happened.

00:09:44.199 --> 00:09:46.231
The second one are the observations.

00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:48.556
And we're going through the 1930s.

00:09:48.556 --> 00:09:51.380
There's variability, there are things going on,

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.562
but it's all kind of in the noise.

00:09:53.562 --> 00:09:56.424
As you get towards the 1970s,

00:09:56.424 --> 00:09:58.433
things are going to start to change.

00:09:58.433 --> 00:10:00.495
They're going to start to look more similar,

00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:03.053
and by the time you get to the 2000s,

00:10:03.063 --> 00:10:05.705
you're already seeing the
patterns of global warming,

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:08.454
both in the observations and in the model.

00:10:08.454 --> 00:10:10.581
We know what happened over the 20th century.

00:10:10.581 --> 00:10:12.341
Right? We know that it's gotten warmer.

00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:13.952
We know where it's gotten warmer.

00:10:13.952 --> 00:10:16.692
And if you ask the models why did that happen,

00:10:16.692 --> 00:10:18.817
and you say, okay, well, yes,

00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:20.683
basically it's because of the carbon dioxide

00:10:20.683 --> 00:10:22.662
we put into the atmosphere.

00:10:22.662 --> 00:10:24.344
We have a very good match

00:10:24.344 --> 00:10:26.971
up until the present day.

00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:30.391
But there's one key reason why we look at models,

00:10:30.391 --> 00:10:32.612
and that's because of this phrase here.

00:10:32.612 --> 00:10:35.107
Because if we had observations of the future,

00:10:35.107 --> 00:10:38.436
we obviously would trust them more than models,

00:10:38.436 --> 00:10:40.380
But unfortunately,

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.920
observations of the future
are not available at this time.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.625
So when we go out into the
future, there's a difference.

00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:51.187
The future is unknown, the future is uncertain,

00:10:51.187 --> 00:10:53.591
and there are choices.

00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:55.424
Here are the choices that we have.

00:10:55.424 --> 00:10:57.563
We can do some work to mitigate

00:10:57.563 --> 00:11:00.358
the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

00:11:00.358 --> 00:11:02.284
That's the top one.

00:11:02.284 --> 00:11:04.190
We can do more work

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.366
to really bring it down

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:08.584
so that by the end of the century,

00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:11.048
it's not much more than there is now.

00:11:11.048 --> 00:11:14.815
Or we can just leave it to fate

00:11:14.815 --> 00:11:16.308
and continue on

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:20.054
with a business-as-usual type of attitude.

00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:23.510
The differences between these choices

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.307
can't be answered by looking at models.

00:11:28.307 --> 00:11:29.946
There's a great phrase

00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:31.739
that Sherwood Rowland,

00:11:31.739 --> 00:11:35.603
who won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry

00:11:35.603 --> 00:11:37.876
that led to ozone depletion,

00:11:37.876 --> 00:11:40.273
when he was accepting his Nobel Prize,

00:11:40.273 --> 00:11:41.652
he asked this question:

00:11:41.652 --> 00:11:43.963
"What is the use of having developed a science

00:11:43.963 --> 00:11:47.224
well enough to make predictions if, in the end,

00:11:47.224 --> 00:11:50.053
all we're willing to do is stand around

00:11:50.053 --> 00:11:52.760
and wait for them to come true?"

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.497
The models are skillful,

00:11:55.497 --> 00:11:58.815
but what we do with the
information from those models

00:11:58.815 --> 00:12:00.986
is totally up to you.

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:02.924
Thank you.

00:12:02.924 --> 00:12:05.840
(Applause)
