00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
A few months ago

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
the Nobel Prize in physics

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
was awarded to two teams of astronomers

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
for a discovery that has been hailed

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
as one of the most important

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
astronomical observations ever.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And today, after briefly describing what they found,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
for explaining their discovery,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
namely the possibility

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
that way beyond the Earth,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
the Milky Way and other distant galaxies,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
we may find that our universe

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
is not the only universe,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
but is instead

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
part of a vast complex of universes

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
that we call the multiverse.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
I mean, most of us were raised to believe

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
that the word "universe" means everything.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And I say most of us with forethought,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And last year I was holding her

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and I said, "Sophia,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I love you more than anything in the universe."

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And she turned to me and said, "Daddy,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
universe or multiverse?"

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
(Laughter)

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
But barring such an anomalous upbringing,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
it is strange to imagine

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
other realms separate from ours,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
most with fundamentally different features,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
that would rightly be called universes of their own.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
And yet,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
speculative though the idea surely is,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
I aim to convince you

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
that there's reason for taking it seriously,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
as it just might be right.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
In part one,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and to highlight a profound mystery

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
which those results revealed.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
In part two,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
I'll offer a solution to that mystery.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
It's based on an approach called string theory,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and that's where the idea of the multiverse

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
will come into the story.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Finally, in part three,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
I'm going to describe a cosmological theory

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
called inflation,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
which will pull all the pieces of the story together.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Okay, part one starts back in 1929

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
realized that the distant galaxies

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
were all rushing away from us,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
establishing that space itself is stretching,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
it's expanding.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
Now this was revolutionary.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
the universe was static.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
But even so,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
there was one thing that everyone was certain of:

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
The expansion must be slowing down.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
That, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
the gravitational pull

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
of each galaxy on every other

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
must be slowing

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
the expansion of space.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
Now let's fast-forward to the 1990s

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
when those two teams of astronomers

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
I mentioned at the outset

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
were inspired by this reasoning

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
to measure the rate

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
at which the expansion has been slowing.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And they did this

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
by painstaking observations

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
of numerous distant galaxies,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
allowing them to chart

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
how the expansion rate has changed over time.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Here's the surprise:

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
They found that the expansion is not slowing down.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Instead they found that it's speeding up,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
going faster and faster.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
That's like tossing an apple upward

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
and it goes up faster and faster.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Now if you saw an apple do that,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
you'd want to know why.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
What's pushing on it?

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Similarly, the astronomers' results

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.260
but they raised an analogous question.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
What force is driving all galaxies

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
to rush away from every other

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
at an ever-quickening speed?

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Well the most promising answer

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
comes from an old idea of Einstein's.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
You see, we are all used to gravity

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
being a force that does one thing,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
pulls objects together.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
But in Einstein's theory of gravity,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
his general theory of relativity,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
gravity can also push things apart.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
How? Well according to Einstein's math,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
if space is uniformly filled

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
with an invisible energy,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
sort of like a uniform, invisible mist,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
then the gravity generated by that mist

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
would be repulsive,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
repulsive gravity,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
which is just what we need to explain the observations.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Because the repulsive gravity

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
of an invisible energy in space --

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
we now call it dark energy,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it --

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
its repulsive gravity

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
would cause each galaxy to push against every other,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
driving expansion to speed up,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
not slow down.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And this explanation

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
represents great progress.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
But I promised you a mystery

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
here in part one.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Here it is.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
When the astronomers worked out

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
how much of this dark energy

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
must be infusing space

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
to account for the cosmic speed up,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
look at what they found.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
This number is small.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Expressed in the relevant unit,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
it is spectacularly small.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
We want this number

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
to emerge from the laws of physics,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
but so far no one has found a way to do that.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Now you might wonder,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
should you care?

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
Maybe explaining this number

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
is just a technical issue,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
a technical detail of interest to experts,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
but of no relevance to anybody else.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Well it surely is a technical detail,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
but some details really matter.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
Some details provide

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
windows into uncharted realms of reality,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
and this peculiar number may be doing just that,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
invokes the possibility of other universes --

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
an idea that naturally emerges from string theory,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
which takes me to part two: string theory.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.260
So hold the mystery of the dark energy

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
in the back of your mind

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
as I now go on to tell you

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
three key things about string theory.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
First off, what is it?

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
of a unified theory of physics,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
a single overarching framework

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
that would be able to describe

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
all the forces at work in the universe.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And the central idea of string theory

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
is quite straightforward.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
It says that if you examine

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
any piece of matter ever more finely,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
at first you'll find molecules

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
But the theory says that if you could probe smaller,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
much smaller than we can with existing technology,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
you'd find something else inside these particles --

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
a little tiny vibrating filament of energy,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
a little tiny vibrating string.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And just like the strings on a violin,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
they can vibrate in different patterns

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
producing different musical notes.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
These little fundamental strings,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
when they vibrate in different patterns,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
they produce different kinds of particles --

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
so electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
all other particles

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
would be united into a single framework,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
as they would all arise from vibrating strings.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
It's a compelling picture,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
a kind of cosmic symphony,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
where all the richness

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
that we see in the world around us

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
emerges from the music

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
that these little, tiny strings can play.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
But there's a cost

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
to this elegant unification,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
because years of research

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
It has internal inconsistencies,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
unless we allow

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
for something wholly unfamiliar --

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
extra dimensions of space.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
And you can think about those

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
as height, width and depth.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
But string theory says that, on fantastically small scales,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
there are additional dimensions

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
crumpled to a tiny size so small

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
that we have not detected them.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
But even though the dimensions are hidden,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
they would have an impact on things that we can observe

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
because the shape of the extra dimensions

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
constrains how the strings can vibrate.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
And in string theory,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
vibration determines everything.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
So particle masses, the strengths of forces,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
and most importantly, the amount of dark energy

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
would be determined

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
by the shape of the extra dimensions.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
we should be able to calculate these features,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
calculate the amount of dark energy.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
The challenge

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
is we don't know

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
the shape of the extra dimensions.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
All we have

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
is a list of candidate shapes

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
allowed by the math.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Now when these ideas were first developed,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
there were only about five different candidate shapes,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
so you can imagine

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
analyzing them one-by-one

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
to determine if any yield

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
the physical features we observe.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
But over time the list grew

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
as researchers found other candidate shapes.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
From five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands --

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
since after all,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
graduate students need something to do.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
But then the list continued to grow

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
into the millions and the billions, until today.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
The list of candidate shapes

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.260
has soared to about 10 to the 500.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
So, what to do?

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Well some researchers lost heart,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
each giving rise to different physical features,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
string theory would never make

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
definitive, testable predictions.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.260
But others turned this issue on its head,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
taking us to the possibility of a multiverse.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Here's the idea.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Each is as real as every other,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
in the sense

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
that there are many universes,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
And this radical proposal

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
has a profound impact on this mystery:

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
Because you see,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
if there are other universes,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
and if those universes

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.260
each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
then the physical features of each universe will be different,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and in particular,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
the amount of dark energy in each universe

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
will be different.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Which means that the mystery

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
would take on a wholly different character.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
In this context,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
because there isn't just one number,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
there are many numbers.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Which means

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
we have been asking the wrong question.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
It's that the right question to ask is,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
why do we humans find ourselves in a universe

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
instead of any of the other possibilities

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
that are out there?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
And that's a question on which we can make headway.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
Because those universes

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
that have much more dark energy than ours,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
that it blows the clump apart

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and galaxies don't form.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
And in those universes that have much less dark energy,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
well they collapse back on themselves so quickly

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
that, again, galaxies don't form.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and no chance

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
for our form of life

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
to exist in those other universes.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
So we find ourselves in a universe

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
simply because our universe has conditions

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.260
hospitable to our form of life.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
And that would be that.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Mystery solved,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
multiverse found.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
We're used to physics

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
But the point is,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
if the feature you're observing

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
can and does take on

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
a wide variety of different values

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
across the wider landscape of reality,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
then thinking one explanation

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
for a particular value

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
is simply misguided.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
An early example

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
who was obsessed with understanding

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
a different number --

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.260
why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
And he worked for decades trying to explain this number,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
but he never succeeded, and we know why.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Kepler was asking

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
the wrong question.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
We now know that there are many planets

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
So hoping that the laws of physics

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
will explain one particular number, 93 million miles,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
well that is simply wrongheaded.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
Instead the right question to ask is,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
why do we humans find ourselves on a planet

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
at this particular distance,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
instead of any of the other possibilities?

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
And again, that's a question we can answer.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
would be so hot

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
that our form of life wouldn't exist.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
And those planets that are much farther away from the star,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
well they're so cold

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
that, again, our form of life would not take hold.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
So we find ourselves

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
on a planet at this particular distance

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
simply because it yields conditions

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
vital to our form of life.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
And when it comes to planets and their distances,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.260
this clearly is the right kind of reasoning.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
The point is,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.260
it may also be the right kind of reasoning.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
One key difference, of course,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
is we know that there are other planets out there,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
but so far I've only speculated on the possibility

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
that there might be other universes.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
So to pull it all together,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
we need a mechanism

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
that can actually generate other universes.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
And that takes me to my final part, part three.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Because such a mechanism has been found

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
You see, when we speak of the Big Bang,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
we often have an image

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
of a kind of cosmic explosion

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
that created our universe

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
and set space rushing outward.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
But there's a little secret.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
the Bang.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
but gives us no insight

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.260
into what would have powered the Bang itself.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
And this gap was finally filled

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
It's called inflationary cosmology,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.260
which identified a particular kind of fuel

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
that would naturally generate

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
an outward rush of space.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
The fuel is based on something called a quantum field,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
but the only detail that matters for us

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
is that this fuel proves to be so efficient

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
that it's virtually impossible

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
to use it all up,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
which means in the inflationary theory,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
the Big Bang giving rise to our universe

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
is likely not a one-time event.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:55.260
but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
each giving rise to its own separate universe

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
with our universe becoming but one bubble

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
And now, when we meld this with string theory,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
here's the picture we're led to.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
Each of these universes has extra dimensions.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
The different shapes yield different physical features.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
simply because it's only in our universe

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
that the physical features, like the amount of dark energy,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.260
are right for our form of life to take hold.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
of the wider cosmos

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
that cutting-edge observation and theory

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.260
have now led us to seriously consider.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.260
One big remaining question, of course, is,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
could we ever confirm

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
the existence of other universes?

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
Well let me describe

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
one way that might one day happen.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
The inflationary theory

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
already has strong observational support.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
Because the theory predicts

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
that the Big Bang would have been so intense

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
that as space rapidly expanded,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
tiny quantum jitters from the micro world

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
would have been stretched out to the macro world,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
yielding a distinctive fingerprint,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
across space,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
which powerful telescopes have now observed.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
Going further, if there are other universes,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
the theory predicts that every so often

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
those universes can collide.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
And if our universe got hit by another,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
that collision

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
would generate an additional subtle pattern

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
of temperature variations across space

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
that we might one day

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
be able to detect.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
And so exotic as this picture is,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
it may one day be grounded

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
in observations,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
establishing the existence of other universes.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
I'll conclude

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
with a striking implication

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
of all these ideas

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
for the very far future.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
You see, we learned

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
that our universe is not static,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
that space is expanding,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
that that expansion is speeding up

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
and that there might be other universes

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
all by carefully examining

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
faint pinpoints of starlight

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.260
coming to us from distant galaxies.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
But because the expansion is speeding up,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
in the very far future,

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.260
that we won't be able to see them --

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
not because of technological limitations,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
but because of the laws of physics.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.260
The light those galaxies emit,

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.260
even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light,

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
will not be able to overcome

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.260
the ever-widening gulf between us.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
So astronomers in the far future

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
looking out into deep space

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.260
will see nothing but an endless stretch

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.260
of static, inky, black stillness.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
And they will conclude

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
that the universe is static and unchanging

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.260
and populated by a single central oasis of matter

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
that they inhabit --

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
a picture of the cosmos

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
that we definitively know to be wrong.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260
Now maybe those future astronomers will have records

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
handed down from an earlier era,

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
like ours,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.260
attesting to an expanding cosmos

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.260
teeming with galaxies.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
But would those future astronomers

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.260
believe such ancient knowledge?

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.260
Or would they believe

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.260
in the black, static empty universe

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:30.260
that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal?

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
I suspect the latter.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260
Which means that we are living

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.260
through a remarkably privileged era

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.260
when certain deep truths about the cosmos

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.260
are still within reach

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260
of the human spirit of exploration.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:48.260
It appears that it may not always be that way.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260
Because today's astronomers,

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.260
by turning powerful telescopes to the sky,

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.260
have captured a handful of starkly informative photons --

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.260
a kind of cosmic telegram

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.260
billions of years in transit.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.260
and the message echoing across the ages is clear.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.260
Sometimes nature guards her secrets

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.260
with the unbreakable grip

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.260
of physical law.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:16.260
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.260
from just beyond the horizon.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.260
Thank you very much.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.260
(Applause)

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.260
Chris Anderson: Brian, thank you.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.260
The range of ideas you've just spoken about

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.260
are dizzying, exhilarating, incredible.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.260
How do you think

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.260
of where cosmology is now,

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.260
in a sort of historical side?

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.260
Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion?

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.260
BG: Well it's hard to say.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.260
When we learn that astronomers of the far future

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.260
may not have enough information to figure things out,

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.260
the natural question is, maybe we're already in that position

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.260
and certain deep, critical features of the universe

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.260
already have escaped our ability to understand

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.260
because of how cosmology evolves.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.260
So from that perspective,

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.260
maybe we will always be asking questions

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.260
and never be able to fully answer them.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.260
On the other hand, we now can understand

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.260
how old the universe is.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.260
We can understand

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.260
how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.260
that was set down 13.72 billion years ago --

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.260
and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.260
and it matches.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.260
Holy cow! That's just amazing.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.260
So on the one hand, it's just incredible where we've gotten,

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.260
but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.260
CA: You're going to be around for the next few days.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.260
Maybe some of these conversations can continue.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.260
Thank you. Thank you, Brian. (BG: My pleasure.)

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.260
(Applause)
