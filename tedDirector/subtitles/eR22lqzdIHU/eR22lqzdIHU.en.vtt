00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
to come and speak to you today

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
about what I consider to be

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
the biggest stunt on Earth.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
Or perhaps not quite on Earth.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.330
A parachute jump from the very edge of space.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
More about that a bit later on.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
What I'd like to do first is take you through

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
a very brief helicopter ride of stunts

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
and the stunts industry in the movies and in television,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
and show you how technology

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
has started to interface with the physical skills

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
of the stunt performer

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
in a way that makes the stunts bigger

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.330
and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
I've been a professional stunt man for 13 years.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
I'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
I often design them.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
During that time, health and safety has become everything about my job.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.330
It's critical now that when a car crash happens

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
it isn't just the stunt person we make safe, it's the crew.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
We can't be killing camera men. We can't be killing stunt men.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
or any passerby. So, safety is everything.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
But it wasn't always that way.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
In the old days of the silent movies --

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.330
Harold Lloyd here, hanging famously from the clock hands --

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
a lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
They had no safety, no real technology.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
What safety they had was very scant.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
This is the first stunt woman,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
Rosie Venger, an amazing woman.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
You can see from the slide, very very strong.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
She really paved the way

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
at a time when nobody was doing stunts, let alone women.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.330
My favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.330
Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
in the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
This is a screen capture from "Stagecoach,"

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.330
where Yakima Canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts I've ever seen.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
There is no safety, no back support,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
no pads, no crash mats, no sand pits in the ground.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
That's one of the most dangerous horse stunts, certainly.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.330
some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
We couldn't do them without technology.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
These are particularly dangerous

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
because there is no mask on my face.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
They were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
one for FHM magazine.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
Highly dangerous, but also you'll notice

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
it doesn't look as though I'm wearing anything underneath the suit.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
The fire suits of old, the bulky suits, the thick woolen suits,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
have been replaced with modern materials

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
like Nomex or, more recently, Carbonex --

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.330
to burn for longer, look more spectacular, and in pure safety.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.330
Here's a bit more.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
There's a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
One of the things that a stuntman often does,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
and you'll see it every time in the big movies,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
is be blown through the air.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
and hopefully you make it look good.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
It's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
because it will break your legs very, very quickly

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
if you land on it wrong.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
Having said that, it works with compressed nitrogen.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
And that's in the up position. When you step on it,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
it will fire you, depending on the gas pressure,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
anything from five feet to 30 feet.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.330
I could, quite literally, fire myself into the gallery.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330
Which I'm sure you wouldn't want.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
Not today.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
Car stunts are another area

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
where technology and engineering

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
advances have made life easier for us, and safer.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
We can do bigger car stunts than ever before now.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
Being run over is never easy.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
That's an old-fashioned, hard, gritty, physical stunt.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.330
But we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane --

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
the materials that help us, when we're hit like this,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
not to hurt ourselves too much.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
The picture in the bottom right-hand corner there

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
is of some crash test dummy work that I was doing.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
Showing how stunts work in different areas, really.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
And testing breakaway signpost pillars.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
A company makes a Lattix pillar, which is a network,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
a lattice-type pillar that collapses when it's hit.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.330
The car on the left drove into the steel pillar.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
And you can't see it from there, but the engine was in the driver's lap.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
They did it by remote control.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
I drove the other one at 60 miles an hour, exactly the same speed,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
and clearly walked away from it.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
We used to have to drive up a ramp, and we still do sometimes.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
But now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
You can just see, underneath the car, there is a black rod on the floor

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
by the wheel of the other car.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
That's the piston that was fired out of the floor.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
We can flip lorries, coaches, buses, anything over

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.330
with a nitrogen cannon with enough power. (Laughs)

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
It's a great job, really. (Laughter)

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.330
It's such fun!

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
You should hear

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
some of the phone conversations that I have with people

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
on my Bluetooth in the shop.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
"Well, we can flip the bus over, we can have it burst into flames,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
and how about someone, you know, big explosion."

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
And people are looking like this ...

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.330
(Laughs)

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
I sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
The next thing that I'd like to show you is something that

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
Dunlop asked me to do earlier this year

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
with our Channel Five's "Fifth Gear Show."

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
A loop-the-loop, biggest in the world.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
Only one person had ever done it before.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
Now, the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
"Let's hit this as fast as possible. 60 miles an hour.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
Let's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor."

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
Well, you'd die if you did that.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
We went to Cambridge University, the other university,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.330
and spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
a physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
Even then, I caught seven G

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
That's a long way to fall, if you get it wrong. That was just about right.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
So again, science helps us, and with the engineering too --

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
the modifications to the car and the wheel.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
High falls, they're old fashioned stunts.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
What's interesting about high falls

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
is that although we use airbags,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
and some airbags are quite advanced,

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
they're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
if you land a bit wrong. So, they're a much safer proposition.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.330
Just basically though, it is a basic piece of equipment.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
It's a bouncy castle

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
with slats in the side to allow the air to escape.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
That's all it is, a bouncy castle.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
That's the only reason we do it. See, it's all fun, this job.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
What's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
And that's interesting because they are almost retrospective.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.330
They're great for catching you, up to certain heights.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
And on the other side of the fence,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.330
that physical art, the physical performance of the stuntman,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
has interfaced with the very highest

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.330
technology in I.T. and in software.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
Not the cardboard box, but the green screen.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
This is a shot of "Terminator," the movie.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
Two stunt guys doing what I consider to be a rather benign stunt.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
It's 30 feet. It's water. It's very simple.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
With the green screen we can put any background in the world on it,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.330
moving or still,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.330
and I can assure you, nowadays you can't see the joint.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
This is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
Completely in the safety of a studio,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.330
and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
Decelerator rigs and wires, we use them a lot.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
We fly people on wires, like this.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
This guy is not skydiving. He's being flown like a kite,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
or moved around like a kite.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.330
And this is a Guinness World Record attempt.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.330
They asked me to open their 50th anniversary show in 2004.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.330
And again, technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
and stop within a couple of feet of the ground

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
without melting the rope with the friction,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
because of the alloys I used in the descender device.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
And that's Centre Point in London.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
We brought Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road to a standstill.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
Helicopter stunts are always fun,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.330
hanging out of them, whatever.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.330
And aerial stunts. No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
Which brings us quite nicely to why I'm really here today:

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
Project Space Jump.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
In 1960, Joseph Kittenger of the United States Air Force

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
did the most spectacular thing.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330
He did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
and he did it to test high altitude systems

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
for military pilots

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
in the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
And I'd just like to show you a little footage

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
of what he did back then.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.330
And just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.330
Project Excelsior, it was called.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
There were three jumps.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.330
They first dropped some dummies.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
So that's the balloon, big gas balloon.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
It's that shape because the helium has to expand.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
My balloon will expand to 500 times

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
and look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
These are the dummies being dropped from 100,000 feet,

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
and there is the camera that's strapped to them.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.330
You can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.330
And I'm planning to go from 120,000 feet,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
which is about 22 miles.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
You're in a near vacuum in that environment,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
which is in minus 50 degrees.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
So it's an extremely hostile place to be.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
This is Joe Kittenger himself.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
Bear in mind, ladies and gents, this was 1960.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
He didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.330
I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
He's a very humble and wonderful human being.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.330
He sent me an email, saying, "If you get this thing off the ground

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
I wish you all the best." And he signed it, "Happy landings,"

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
which I thought was quite lovely.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
He's in his 80s and he lives in Florida. He's a tremendous guy.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
This is him in a pressure suit.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
when you get to 30,000 feet -- it's great, isn't it? --

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.330
When you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.330
Above 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
you need pressure breathing, which is where you're wearing a G suit.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
This is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.330
pushing him in, those turned up jeans.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.330
You need a pressure suit.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
You need a pressure breathing system

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
with a G suit that squeezes you, that helps you to breathe in

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
and helps you to exhale.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.330
Above 50,000 feet you need a space suit, a pressure suit.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.330
Certainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
Not even a jet engine.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
It needs to be rocket-powered or one of these things,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.330
a great big gas balloon.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
It took me a while; it took me years to find the right balloon team

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
to build the balloon that would do this job.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
I've found that team in America now.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
And it's made of polyethylene, so it's very thin.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.330
We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
and two balloons for the main jump, because they

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
notoriously tear on takeoff.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
They're just so, so delicate.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
This is the step off. He's written on that thing,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
"The highest step in the world."

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
And what must that feel like?

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.330
I'm excited and I'm scared,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
both at the same time in equal measures.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
And this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
before his drogue chute opened to stabilize him.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
You can just see them there, popping open.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
Those are the drogue chutes. He had three of them.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.330
I did quite a lot of research.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.330
And you'll see in a second there, he comes back down to the floor.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.330
Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon,

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
the little black dots are people.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
That's in New Mexico.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
That's the U.S. Air Force Museum.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
And they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
My gondola will be more simple than that.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
It's a three sided box, basically.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.330
So I've had to do quite a lot of training.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.330
This is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
training in preparation for some high altitude jumps.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.330
This is what the view is going to be like

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
at 90,000 feet for me.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
Now you may think this is just

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
a thrill-seeking trip, a pleasure ride,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.330
just the world's biggest stunt.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
Well there's a little bit more to it than that.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.330
Trying to find a space suit to do this

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.330
has led me to an area of technology

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.330
that I never really expected when I set about doing this.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
I contacted a company in the States

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
who make suits for NASA.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
That's a current suit. This was me last year with their chief engineer.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.330
That suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.330
And it weighs 300 pounds and you can't skydive in it.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
So I've been stuck. For the past 15 years I've been trying to find a space suit

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
that would do this job, or someone that will make one.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
Something revolutionary happened

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
a little while ago, at the same facility.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
That's the prototype of the parachute. I've now had them custom make one,

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
the only one of its kind in the world. And that's the only suit of its kind in the world.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
It was made by a Russian that's designed

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
most of the suits of the past

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
18 years for the Soviets.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
He left the company because he saw,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
as some other people in the space suit industry,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
an emerging market for space suits for space tourists.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
You know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
and the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
If you're at 100,000 feet you die.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
In six seconds you've lost consciousness. In 10 seconds you're dead.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
Your blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
The body swells up. It's awful.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.330
And so we expect -- it's not much fun.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.330
We expect, and others expect,

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.330
that perhaps the FAA, the CAA

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
might say, "You need to put someone in a suit

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.330
that's not inflated, that's connected to the aircraft."

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.330
Then they're comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
And then if the cabin depressurizes

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
while the aircraft is coming back down,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
in whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
I would like to bring Costa on, if he's here,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
to show you the only one of its kind in the world.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
I was going to wear it,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
but I thought I'd get Costa to do it, my lovely assistant.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:35.330
Thank you. He's very hot. Thank you, Costa.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
This is the communication headset you'll see

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
on lots of space suits.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.330
It's a two-layer suit. NASA suits have got 13 layers.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.330
This is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about 15 pounds.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.330
It's next to nothing. Especially designed for me.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
It's a working prototype. I will use it for all the jumps.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.330
Would you just give us a little twirl, please, Costa?

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
Thank you very much.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
And it doesn't look far different when it's inflated,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
as you can see from the picture down there.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.330
I've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel,

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
which means that I can practice everything I need to practice, in safety,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
before I ever jump out of anything. Thanks very much, Costa.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.330
(Applause)

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
Ladies and gentlemen, that's just about it from me.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
The status of my mission at the moment

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
is it still needs a major sponsor.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
I'm confident that we'll find one.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
I think it's a great challenge.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
And I hope that you will agree with me,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
it is the greatest stunt on Earth.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
Thank you very much for your time.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.330
(Applause)
