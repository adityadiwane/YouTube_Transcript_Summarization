00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.718
I'd like to introduce you
to an emerging area of science,

00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:21.685
one that is still speculative
but hugely exciting,

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:24.338
and certainly one
that's growing very rapidly.

00:00:25.448 --> 00:00:29.496
Quantum biology
asks a very simple question:

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.870
Does quantum mechanics --

00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:34.196
that weird and wonderful
and powerful theory

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.908
of the subatomic world
of atoms and molecules

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:40.420
that underpins so much
of modern physics and chemistry --

00:00:40.444 --> 00:00:43.856
also play a role inside the living cell?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.959
In other words: Are there processes,
mechanisms, phenomena

00:00:47.983 --> 00:00:51.971
in living organisms
that can only be explained

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:54.738
with a helping hand
from quantum mechanics?

00:00:55.546 --> 00:00:57.183
Now, quantum biology isn't new;

00:00:57.207 --> 00:00:59.608
it's been around since the early 1930s.

00:00:59.928 --> 00:01:03.643
But it's only in the last decade or so
that careful experiments --

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:07.131
in biochemistry labs,
using spectroscopy --

00:01:07.155 --> 00:01:14.018
have shown very clear, firm evidence
that there are certain specific mechanisms

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:16.553
that require quantum mechanics
to explain them.

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:21.003
Quantum biology brings together
quantum physicists, biochemists,

00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:24.668
molecular biologists --
it's a very interdisciplinary field.

00:01:24.692 --> 00:01:28.621
I come from quantum physics,
so I'm a nuclear physicist.

00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:30.910
I've spent more than three decades

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:33.863
trying to get my head
around quantum mechanics.

00:01:33.887 --> 00:01:36.380
One of the founders
of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr,

00:01:36.404 --> 00:01:39.754
said, If you're not astonished by it,
then you haven't understood it.

00:01:40.237 --> 00:01:43.080
So I sort of feel happy
that I'm still astonished by it.

00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:44.849
That's a good thing.

00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:51.758
But it means I study the very
smallest structures in the universe --

00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:53.857
the building blocks of reality.

00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:57.096
If we think about the scale of size,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.072
start with an everyday object
like the tennis ball,

00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:02.997
and just go down orders
of magnitude in size --

00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:08.218
from the eye of a needle down to a cell,
down to a bacterium, down to an enzyme --

00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:09.971
you eventually reach the nano-world.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.490
Now, nanotechnology may be
a term you've heard of.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.694
A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.930
My area is the atomic nucleus,
which is the tiny dot inside an atom.

00:02:20.954 --> 00:02:22.886
It's even smaller in scale.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.828
This is the domain of quantum mechanics,

00:02:24.852 --> 00:02:27.368
and physicists and chemists
have had a long time

00:02:27.392 --> 00:02:28.693
to try and get used to it.

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:33.705
Biologists, on the other hand,
have got off lightly, in my view.

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:38.402
They are very happy with their
balls-and-sticks models of molecules.

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:39.508
(Laughter)

00:02:39.532 --> 00:02:42.730
The balls are the atoms, the sticks
are the bonds between the atoms.

00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:45.248
And when they can't build them
physically in the lab,

00:02:45.272 --> 00:02:47.664
nowadays, they have
very powerful computers

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:49.655
that will simulate a huge molecule.

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.343
This is a protein made up
of 100,000 atoms.

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:58.338
It doesn't really require much in the way
of quantum mechanics to explain it.

00:02:59.695 --> 00:03:02.584
Quantum mechanics
was developed in the 1920s.

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:09.845
It is a set of beautiful and powerful
mathematical rules and ideas

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.477
that explain the world of the very small.

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:15.873
And it's a world that's very different
from our everyday world,

00:03:15.897 --> 00:03:17.416
made up of trillions of atoms.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.997
It's a world built
on probability and chance.

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:23.120
It's a fuzzy world.

00:03:23.144 --> 00:03:24.874
It's a world of phantoms,

00:03:24.898 --> 00:03:28.246
where particles can also behave
like spread-out waves.

00:03:30.157 --> 00:03:33.019
If we imagine quantum mechanics
or quantum physics, then,

00:03:33.043 --> 00:03:38.257
as the fundamental
foundation of reality itself,

00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:40.011
then it's not surprising that we say

00:03:40.035 --> 00:03:42.455
quantum physics underpins
organic chemistry.

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.599
After all, it gives us
the rules that tell us

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:47.264
how the atoms fit together
to make organic molecules.

00:03:47.288 --> 00:03:50.527
Organic chemistry,
scaled up in complexity,

00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:53.873
gives us molecular biology,
which of course leads to life itself.

00:03:54.174 --> 00:03:56.151
So in a way, it's sort of not surprising.

00:03:56.175 --> 00:03:57.389
It's almost trivial.

00:03:57.413 --> 00:04:01.633
You say, "Well, of course life ultimately
must depend of quantum mechanics."

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.531
But so does everything else.

00:04:04.555 --> 00:04:08.170
So does all inanimate matter,
made up of trillions of atoms.

00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:13.379
Ultimately, there's a quantum level

00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:15.586
where we have to delve into
this weirdness.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.026
But in everyday life,
we can forget about it.

00:04:18.404 --> 00:04:21.603
Because once you put together
trillions of atoms,

00:04:21.627 --> 00:04:24.242
that quantum weirdness
just dissolves away.

00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:29.857
Quantum biology isn't about this.

00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:32.437
Quantum biology isn't this obvious.

00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:36.690
Of course quantum mechanics
underpins life at some molecular level.

00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:43.258
Quantum biology is about looking
for the non-trivial --

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:47.758
the counterintuitive ideas
in quantum mechanics --

00:04:47.782 --> 00:04:50.797
and to see if they do, indeed,
play an important role

00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:53.273
in describing the processes of life.

00:04:54.653 --> 00:04:59.873
Here is my perfect example
of the counterintuitiveness

00:04:59.897 --> 00:05:01.343
of the quantum world.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:02.618
This is the quantum skier.

00:05:02.642 --> 00:05:05.282
He seems to be intact,
he seems to be perfectly healthy,

00:05:05.306 --> 00:05:09.433
and yet, he seems to have gone around
both sides of that tree at the same time.

00:05:09.457 --> 00:05:11.120
Well, if you saw tracks like that

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.453
you'd guess it was some
sort of stunt, of course.

00:05:13.477 --> 00:05:16.068
But in the quantum world,
this happens all the time.

00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:19.890
Particles can multitask,
they can be in two places at once.

00:05:19.914 --> 00:05:22.242
They can do more than one thing
at the same time.

00:05:22.266 --> 00:05:24.909
Particles can behave
like spread-out waves.

00:05:25.298 --> 00:05:26.897
It's almost like magic.

00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:30.287
Physicists and chemists have had
nearly a century

00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:32.957
of trying to get used to this weirdness.

00:05:33.445 --> 00:05:34.795
I don't blame the biologists

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.454
for not having to or wanting
to learn quantum mechanics.

00:05:37.478 --> 00:05:40.676
You see, this weirdness is very delicate;

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.150
and we physicists work very hard
to maintain it in our labs.

00:05:45.174 --> 00:05:49.378
We cool our system down
to near absolute zero,

00:05:49.402 --> 00:05:51.347
we carry out our experiments in vacuums,

00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:54.898
we try and isolate it
from any external disturbance.

00:05:55.602 --> 00:06:00.680
That's very different from the warm,
messy, noisy environment of a living cell.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.747
Biology itself, if you think of
molecular biology,

00:06:04.771 --> 00:06:08.228
seems to have done very well
in describing all the processes of life

00:06:08.252 --> 00:06:10.738
in terms of chemistry --
chemical reactions.

00:06:10.762 --> 00:06:15.612
And these are reductionist,
deterministic chemical reactions,

00:06:15.636 --> 00:06:20.750
showing that, essentially, life is made
of the same stuff as everything else,

00:06:20.774 --> 00:06:23.834
and if we can forget about quantum
mechanics in the macro world,

00:06:23.858 --> 00:06:27.104
then we should be able to forget
about it in biology, as well.

00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:31.070
Well, one man begged
to differ with this idea.

00:06:32.062 --> 00:06:35.531
Erwin Schrödinger,
of Schrödinger's Cat fame,

00:06:35.555 --> 00:06:36.872
was an Austrian physicist.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:40.079
He was one of the founders
of quantum mechanics in the 1920s.

00:06:40.663 --> 00:06:43.370
In 1944, he wrote a book
called "What is Life?"

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.570
It was tremendously influential.

00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:48.475
It influenced Francis Crick
and James Watson,

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:51.022
the discoverers of the double-helix
structure of DNA.

00:06:51.343 --> 00:06:55.011
To paraphrase a description
in the book, he says:

00:06:55.035 --> 00:07:00.821
At the molecular level,
living organisms have a certain order,

00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:04.077
a structure to them that's very different

00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:08.837
from the random thermodynamic jostling
of atoms and molecules

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:12.567
in inanimate matter
of the same complexity.

00:07:13.504 --> 00:07:18.518
In fact, living matter seems to behave
in this order, in a structure,

00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:22.376
just like inanimate matter
cooled down to near absolute zero,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.433
where quantum effects
play a very important role.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.440
There's something special
about the structure -- the order --

00:07:30.464 --> 00:07:32.024
inside a living cell.

00:07:32.048 --> 00:07:37.341
So, Schrödinger speculated that maybe
quantum mechanics plays a role in life.

00:07:38.096 --> 00:07:41.521
It's a very speculative,
far-reaching idea,

00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:44.418
and it didn't really go very far.

00:07:45.536 --> 00:07:47.069
But as I mentioned at the start,

00:07:47.093 --> 00:07:49.892
in the last 10 years, there have been
experiments emerging,

00:07:49.916 --> 00:07:53.971
showing where some of these
certain phenomena in biology

00:07:53.995 --> 00:07:55.758
do seem to require quantum mechanics.

00:07:55.782 --> 00:07:58.905
I want to share with you
just a few of the exciting ones.

00:08:00.215 --> 00:08:03.922
This is one of the best-known
phenomena in the quantum world,

00:08:03.946 --> 00:08:05.647
quantum tunneling.

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:10.060
The box on the left shows
the wavelike, spread-out distribution

00:08:10.084 --> 00:08:12.845
of a quantum entity --
a particle, like an electron,

00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:16.506
which is not a little ball
bouncing off a wall.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:21.269
It's a wave that has a certain probability
of being able to permeate

00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:24.699
through a solid wall, like a phantom
leaping through to the other side.

00:08:24.723 --> 00:08:28.821
You can see a faint smudge of light
in the right-hand box.

00:08:29.773 --> 00:08:34.385
Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle
can hit an impenetrable barrier,

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.869
and yet somehow, as though by magic,

00:08:36.893 --> 00:08:39.337
disappear from one side
and reappear on the other.

00:08:39.658 --> 00:08:43.909
The nicest way of explaining it is
if you want to throw a ball over a wall,

00:08:43.933 --> 00:08:47.510
you have to give it enough energy
to get over the top of the wall.

00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:50.592
In the quantum world,
you don't have to throw it over the wall,

00:08:50.616 --> 00:08:54.023
you can throw it at the wall,
and there's a certain non-zero probability

00:08:54.047 --> 00:08:57.370
that it'll disappear on your side,
and reappear on the other.

00:08:57.394 --> 00:08:59.072
This isn't speculation, by the way.

00:08:59.096 --> 00:09:02.492
We're happy -- well, "happy"
is not the right word --

00:09:02.516 --> 00:09:04.561
(Laughter)

00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:06.203
we are familiar with this.

00:09:06.227 --> 00:09:08.972
(Laughter)

00:09:08.996 --> 00:09:11.290
Quantum tunneling
takes place all the time;

00:09:11.314 --> 00:09:13.981
in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.

00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:16.164
The particles fuse together,

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:19.886
and the Sun turns hydrogen
into helium through quantum tunneling.

00:09:21.464 --> 00:09:26.684
Back in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered
that quantum tunneling also takes place

00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:27.900
inside living cells.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:34.556
Enzymes, those workhorses of life,
the catalysts of chemical reactions --

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.746
enzymes are biomolecules that speed up
chemical reactions in living cells,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.473
by many, many orders of magnitude.

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:43.281
And it's always been a mystery
how they do this.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.839
Well, it was discovered

00:09:44.863 --> 00:09:49.715
that one of the tricks that enzymes
have evolved to make use of,

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:54.967
is by transferring subatomic particles,
like electrons and indeed protons,

00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:59.652
from one part of a molecule
to another via quantum tunneling.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.184
It's efficient, it's fast,
it can disappear --

00:10:03.208 --> 00:10:06.319
a proton can disappear from one place,
and reappear on the other.

00:10:06.343 --> 00:10:07.972
Enzymes help this take place.

00:10:08.548 --> 00:10:11.231
This is research that's been
carried out back in the 80s,

00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:15.292
particularly by a group
in Berkeley, Judith Klinman.

00:10:15.316 --> 00:10:17.521
Other groups in the UK
have now also confirmed

00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:18.956
that enzymes really do this.

00:10:21.048 --> 00:10:23.597
Research carried out by my group --

00:10:23.621 --> 00:10:26.055
so as I mentioned,
I'm a nuclear physicist,

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:29.134
but I've realized I've got these tools
of using quantum mechanics

00:10:29.158 --> 00:10:34.243
in atomic nuclei, and so can apply
those tools in other areas as well.

00:10:35.404 --> 00:10:37.214
One question we asked

00:10:37.238 --> 00:10:41.536
is whether quantum tunneling
plays a role in mutations in DNA.

00:10:41.843 --> 00:10:45.503
Again, this is not a new idea;
it goes all the way back to the early 60s.

00:10:45.527 --> 00:10:48.488
The two strands of DNA,
the double-helix structure,

00:10:48.512 --> 00:10:51.335
are held together by rungs;
it's like a twisted ladder.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.866
And those rungs of the ladder
are hydrogen bonds --

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.680
protons, that act as the glue
between the two strands.

00:10:58.704 --> 00:11:03.454
So if you zoom in, what they're doing
is holding these large molecules --

00:11:03.478 --> 00:11:05.085
nucleotides -- together.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.280
Zoom in a bit more.

00:11:07.304 --> 00:11:09.220
So, this a computer simulation.

00:11:09.855 --> 00:11:13.397
The two white balls
in the middle are protons,

00:11:13.421 --> 00:11:15.720
and you can see that
it's a double hydrogen bond.

00:11:15.744 --> 00:11:19.058
One prefers to sit on one side;
the other, on the other side

00:11:19.082 --> 00:11:23.640
of the two strands of the vertical lines
going down, which you can't see.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.805
It can happen that
these two protons can hop over.

00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:29.265
Watch the two white balls.

00:11:29.748 --> 00:11:31.746
They can jump over to the other side.

00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:37.885
If the two strands of DNA then separate,
leading to the process of replication,

00:11:37.909 --> 00:11:41.108
and the two protons
are in the wrong positions,

00:11:41.132 --> 00:11:42.895
this can lead to a mutation.

00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:45.076
This has been known for half a century.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.443
The question is: How likely
are they to do that,

00:11:47.467 --> 00:11:49.845
and if they do, how do they do it?

00:11:49.869 --> 00:11:52.888
Do they jump across,
like the ball going over the wall?

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:56.414
Or can they quantum-tunnel across,
even if they don't have enough energy?

00:11:57.089 --> 00:12:01.341
Early indications suggest that
quantum tunneling can play a role here.

00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:03.489
We still don't know yet
how important it is;

00:12:03.513 --> 00:12:05.305
this is still an open question.

00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:07.349
It's speculative,

00:12:07.373 --> 00:12:10.016
but it's one of those questions
that is so important

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.486
that if quantum mechanics
plays a role in mutations,

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.809
surely this must have big implications,

00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:17.527
to understand certain types of mutations,

00:12:17.551 --> 00:12:21.307
possibly even those that lead
to turning a cell cancerous.

00:12:22.803 --> 00:12:28.102
Another example of quantum mechanics
in biology is quantum coherence,

00:12:28.126 --> 00:12:30.479
in one of the most
important processes in biology,

00:12:30.503 --> 00:12:34.444
photosynthesis: plants
and bacteria taking sunlight,

00:12:34.468 --> 00:12:37.422
and using that energy to create biomass.

00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:42.367
Quantum coherence is the idea
of quantum entities multitasking.

00:12:42.912 --> 00:12:44.516
It's the quantum skier.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.492
It's an object that behaves like a wave,

00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:50.418
so that it doesn't just move
in one direction or the other,

00:12:50.442 --> 00:12:53.762
but can follow multiple pathways
at the same time.

00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:58.624
Some years ago,
the world of science was shocked

00:12:58.648 --> 00:13:02.232
when a paper was published
showing experimental evidence

00:13:02.256 --> 00:13:06.032
that quantum coherence
takes place inside bacteria,

00:13:06.056 --> 00:13:07.742
carrying out photosynthesis.

00:13:07.766 --> 00:13:10.830
The idea is that the photon,
the particle of light, the sunlight,

00:13:10.854 --> 00:13:14.198
the quantum of light
captured by a chlorophyll molecule,

00:13:14.222 --> 00:13:16.813
is then delivered to what's called
the reaction center,

00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:18.901
where it can be turned into
chemical energy.

00:13:18.925 --> 00:13:21.573
And in getting there,
it doesn't just follow one route;

00:13:21.597 --> 00:13:23.812
it follows multiple pathways at once,

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:28.173
to optimize the most efficient way
of reaching the reaction center

00:13:28.197 --> 00:13:29.918
without dissipating as waste heat.

00:13:31.228 --> 00:13:34.537
Quantum coherence taking place
inside a living cell.

00:13:34.561 --> 00:13:36.681
A remarkable idea,

00:13:36.705 --> 00:13:42.940
and yet evidence is growing almost weekly,
with new papers coming out,

00:13:42.964 --> 00:13:45.176
confirming that this
does indeed take place.

00:13:45.555 --> 00:13:50.294
My third and final example
is the most beautiful, wonderful idea.

00:13:50.318 --> 00:13:54.381
It's also still very speculative,
but I have to share it with you.

00:13:54.405 --> 00:13:59.017
The European robin
migrates from Scandinavia

00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:01.676
down to the Mediterranean, every autumn,

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.073
and like a lot of other
marine animals and even insects,

00:14:05.097 --> 00:14:09.397
they navigate by sensing
the Earth's magnetic field.

00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:13.395
Now, the Earth's magnetic field
is very, very weak;

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:15.499
it's 100 times weaker
than a fridge magnet,

00:14:15.523 --> 00:14:21.124
and yet it affects the chemistry --
somehow -- within a living organism.

00:14:21.932 --> 00:14:25.738
That's not in doubt --
a German couple of ornithologists,

00:14:25.762 --> 00:14:30.022
Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko,
in the 1970s, confirmed that indeed,

00:14:30.046 --> 00:14:34.023
the robin does find its way by somehow
sensing the Earth's magnetic field,

00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:37.374
to give it directional information --
a built-in compass.

00:14:37.398 --> 00:14:39.647
The puzzle, the mystery was:
How does it do it?

00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:43.381
Well, the only theory in town --

00:14:43.405 --> 00:14:46.841
we don't know if it's the correct theory,
but the only theory in town --

00:14:46.865 --> 00:14:49.849
is that it does it via something
called quantum entanglement.

00:14:50.567 --> 00:14:52.941
Inside the robin's retina --

00:14:52.965 --> 00:14:57.197
I kid you not -- inside the robin's retina
is a protein called cryptochrome,

00:14:57.221 --> 00:14:58.601
which is light-sensitive.

00:14:58.625 --> 00:15:02.564
Within cryptochrome, a pair of electrons
are quantum-entangled.

00:15:02.588 --> 00:15:05.820
Now, quantum entanglement
is when two particles are far apart,

00:15:05.844 --> 00:15:08.678
and yet somehow remain
in contact with each other.

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.437
Even Einstein hated this idea;

00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:12.500
he called it "spooky action
at a distance."

00:15:12.524 --> 00:15:14.405
(Laughter)

00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:17.872
So if Einstein doesn't like it,
then we can all be uncomfortable with it.

00:15:17.896 --> 00:15:20.749
Two quantum-entangled electrons
within a single molecule

00:15:20.773 --> 00:15:22.244
dance a delicate dance

00:15:22.268 --> 00:15:24.809
that is very sensitive
to the direction the bird flies

00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:26.364
in the Earth's magnetic field.

00:15:26.848 --> 00:15:29.458
We don't know if it's
the correct explanation,

00:15:29.482 --> 00:15:34.026
but wow, wouldn't it be exciting
if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate?

00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:37.790
Quantum biology is still in it infancy.

00:15:37.814 --> 00:15:41.298
It's still speculative.

00:15:41.742 --> 00:15:45.591
But I believe it's built on solid science.

00:15:45.917 --> 00:15:49.726
I also think that
in the coming decade or so,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:54.591
we're going to start to see
that actually, it pervades life --

00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:59.211
that life has evolved tricks
that utilize the quantum world.

00:16:00.026 --> 00:16:01.454
Watch this space.

00:16:01.478 --> 00:16:02.635
Thank you.

00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:04.861
(Applause)
