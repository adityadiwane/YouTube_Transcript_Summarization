00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:20.902
What I'm going to show you
are the astonishing molecular machines

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:24.226
that create the living
fabric of your body.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.033
Now molecules are really, really tiny.

00:00:28.057 --> 00:00:30.937
And by tiny, I mean really.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:33.907
They're smaller
than a wavelength of light,

00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:36.236
so we have no way
to directly observe them.

00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:39.354
But through science,
we do have a fairly good idea

00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:41.590
of what's going on
down at the molecular scale.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.836
So what we can do is actually
tell you about the molecules,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.097
but we don't really have a direct way
of showing you the molecules.

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.371
One way around this is to draw pictures.

00:00:50.395 --> 00:00:52.935
And this idea is actually nothing new.

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:55.247
Scientists have always created pictures

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:58.057
as part of their thinking
and discovery process.

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:00.956
They draw pictures
of what they're observing with their eyes,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.372
through technology
like telescopes and microscopes,

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.835
and also what they're thinking
about in their minds.

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:07.462
I picked two well-known examples,

00:01:07.486 --> 00:01:11.091
because they're very well-known
for expressing science through art.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.143
And I start with Galileo,
who used the world's first telescope

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:16.353
to look at the Moon.

00:01:16.377 --> 00:01:18.684
And he transformed
our understanding of the Moon.

00:01:18.708 --> 00:01:20.341
The perception in the 17th century

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:22.422
was the Moon was a perfect
heavenly sphere.

00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:25.819
But what Galileo saw
was a rocky, barren world,

00:01:25.843 --> 00:01:28.236
which he expressed
through his watercolor painting.

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.469
Another scientist with very big ideas,

00:01:31.594 --> 00:01:34.118
the superstar of biology
is Charles Darwin.

00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:36.186
And with this famous entry
in his notebook,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.050
he begins in the top left-hand
corner with, "I think,"

00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:41.781
and then sketches out
the first tree of life,

00:01:41.805 --> 00:01:44.735
which is his perception
of how all the species,

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.617
all living things on Earth are connected
through evolutionary history --

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.888
the origin of species
through natural selection

00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:53.236
and divergence
from an ancestral population.

00:01:53.775 --> 00:01:55.236
Even as a scientist,

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:58.161
I used to go to lectures
by molecular biologists

00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:00.910
and find them completely incomprehensible,

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:03.202
with all the fancy technical
language and jargon

00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:05.350
that they would use
in describing their work,

00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:08.425
until I encountered
the artworks of David Goodsell,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.190
who is a molecular biologist
at the Scripps Institute.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:14.783
And his pictures -- everything's accurate
and it's all to scale.

00:02:14.807 --> 00:02:17.236
And his work illuminated for me

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.575
what the molecular world
inside us is like.

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:22.100
So this is a transection through blood.

00:02:22.124 --> 00:02:25.101
In the top left-hand corner,
you've got this yellow-green area.

00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:28.341
The yellow-green area is the fluid
of blood, which is mostly water,

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:31.352
but it's also antibodies, sugars,
hormones, that kind of thing.

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:33.864
And the red region is a slice
into a red blood cell.

00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:35.754
And those red molecules are hemoglobin.

00:02:35.778 --> 00:02:38.473
They are actually red;
that's what gives blood its color.

00:02:38.497 --> 00:02:40.464
And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:42.165
to soak up the oxygen in your lungs

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.302
and then carry it
to other parts of the body.

00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:46.858
I was very much inspired
by this image many years ago,

00:02:46.882 --> 00:02:49.433
and I wondered whether
we could use computer graphics

00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:51.061
to represent the molecular world.

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:52.236
What would it look like?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.700
And that's how I really began.

00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:55.736
So let's begin.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.145
This is DNA in its classic
double helix form.

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.525
And it's from X-ray crystallography,
so it's an accurate model of DNA.

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.520
If we unwind the double helix
and unzip the two strands,

00:03:04.544 --> 00:03:06.563
you see these things that look like teeth.

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:08.404
Those are the letters of genetic code,

00:03:08.428 --> 00:03:10.697
the 25,000 genes
you've got written in your DNA.

00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:13.657
This is what they typically talk about --
the genetic code --

00:03:13.681 --> 00:03:15.372
this is what they're talking about.

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:18.166
But I want to talk about
a different aspect of DNA science,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.079
and that is the physical nature of DNA.

00:03:20.103 --> 00:03:22.688
It's these two strands
that run in opposite directions

00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:24.882
for reasons I can't go into right now.

00:03:24.906 --> 00:03:27.114
But they physically run
in opposite directions,

00:03:27.138 --> 00:03:30.769
which creates a number of complications
for your living cells,

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:32.022
as you're about to see,

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:34.408
most particularly
when DNA is being copied.

00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:36.350
And so what I'm about to show you

00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:40.390
is an accurate representation
of the actual DNA replication machine

00:03:40.414 --> 00:03:42.471
that's occurring right now
inside your body,

00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:44.307
at least 2002 biology.

00:03:44.617 --> 00:03:47.628
So DNA's entering the production line
from the left-hand side,

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:51.161
and it hits this collection,
these miniature biochemical machines,

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:54.329
that are pulling apart the DNA strand
and making an exact copy.

00:03:54.353 --> 00:03:57.862
So DNA comes in and hits this blue,
doughnut-shaped structure

00:03:57.886 --> 00:04:00.193
and it's ripped apart
into its two strands.

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.303
One strand can be copied directly,

00:04:02.327 --> 00:04:05.250
and you can see these things
spooling off to the bottom there.

00:04:05.274 --> 00:04:07.534
But things aren't so simple
for the other strand

00:04:07.558 --> 00:04:09.323
because it must be copied backwards.

00:04:09.347 --> 00:04:11.457
So it's thrown out
repeatedly in these loops

00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:15.525
and copied one section at a time,
creating two new DNA molecules.

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.832
Now you have billions of this machine
right now working away inside you,

00:04:20.856 --> 00:04:23.073
copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity.

00:04:23.936 --> 00:04:25.470
It's an accurate representation,

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:29.023
and it's pretty much at the correct speed
for what is occurring inside you.

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:31.864
I've left out error correction
and a bunch of other things.

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:33.647
(Laughter)

00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:35.792
This was work from a number of years ago--

00:04:35.816 --> 00:04:36.985
Thank you.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.381
(Applause)

00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:40.334
This is work from a number of years ago,

00:04:40.358 --> 00:04:42.625
but what I'll show you next
is updated science,

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:43.811
it's updated technology.

00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:45.195
So again, we begin with DNA.

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:46.937
And it's jiggling and wiggling there

00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:49.142
because of the surrounding
soup of molecules,

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:51.549
which I've stripped away
so you can see something.

00:04:51.573 --> 00:04:54.548
DNA is about two nanometers across,
which is really quite tiny.

00:04:54.572 --> 00:04:56.006
But in each one of your cells,

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.207
each strand of DNA is about
30 to 40 million nanometers long.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:03.490
So to keep the DNA organized
and regulate access to the genetic code,

00:05:03.514 --> 00:05:05.597
it's wrapped around these
purple proteins --

00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:07.203
or I've labeled them purple here.

00:05:07.227 --> 00:05:08.811
It's packaged up and bundled up.

00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:11.236
All this field of view
is a single strand of DNA.

00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:14.853
This huge package of DNA
is called a chromosome.

00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:17.236
And we'll come back
to chromosomes in a minute.

00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:19.741
We're pulling out, we're zooming out,

00:05:19.765 --> 00:05:21.236
out through a nuclear pore,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.920
which is the gateway to this compartment
that holds all the DNA,

00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:26.363
called the nucleus.

00:05:26.917 --> 00:05:31.148
All of this field of view
is about a semester's worth of biology,

00:05:31.172 --> 00:05:32.537
and I've got seven minutes,

00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:35.249
So we're not going to be
able to do that today?

00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:37.235
No, I'm being told, "No."

00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:41.041
This is the way a living cell
looks down a light microscope.

00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:44.563
And it's been filmed under time-lapse,
which is why you can see it moving.

00:05:44.587 --> 00:05:46.168
The nuclear envelope breaks down.

00:05:46.192 --> 00:05:48.437
These sausage-shaped things
are the chromosomes,

00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:49.642
and we'll focus on them.

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:53.704
They go through this very striking motion
that is focused on these little red spots.

00:05:54.328 --> 00:05:58.563
When the cell feels it's ready to go,
it rips apart the chromosome.

00:05:58.587 --> 00:06:00.628
One set of DNA goes to one side,

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.675
the other side gets
the other set of DNA --

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.536
identical copies of DNA.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.520
And then the cell splits down the middle.

00:06:06.544 --> 00:06:09.403
And again, you have billions of cells
undergoing this process

00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:10.784
right now inside of you.

00:06:11.602 --> 00:06:14.458
Now we're going to rewind
and just focus on the chromosomes,

00:06:14.482 --> 00:06:16.724
and look at its structure and describe it.

00:06:17.248 --> 00:06:19.673
So again, here we are
at that equator moment.

00:06:20.654 --> 00:06:21.854
The chromosomes line up.

00:06:21.878 --> 00:06:23.705
And if we isolate just one chromosome,

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.546
we're going to pull it out
and have a look at its structure.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.632
So this is one of the biggest
molecular structures that you have,

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:32.711
at least as far as we've discovered
so far inside of us.

00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:35.262
So this is a single chromosome.

00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:37.887
And you have two strands of DNA
in each chromosome.

00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:39.632
One is bundled up into one sausage.

00:06:39.656 --> 00:06:42.389
The other strand is bundled up
into the other sausage.

00:06:42.413 --> 00:06:45.975
These things that look like whiskers
that are sticking out from either side

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:47.905
are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell.

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:50.840
They're called microtubules,
that name's not important.

00:06:50.864 --> 00:06:53.595
But we're going to focus on
the region labeled red here --

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.156
and it's the interface between
the dynamic scaffolding

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.347
and the chromosomes.

00:06:57.371 --> 00:07:00.476
It is obviously central
to the movement of the chromosomes.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.072
We have no idea, really,
as to how it's achieving that movement.

00:07:04.096 --> 00:07:06.743
We've been studying this thing
they call the kinetochore

00:07:06.767 --> 00:07:08.839
for over a hundred years
with intense study,

00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:11.689
and we're still just beginning
to discover what it's about.

00:07:11.713 --> 00:07:14.467
It is made up of about
200 different types of proteins,

00:07:14.491 --> 00:07:16.202
thousands of proteins in total.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.810
It is a signal broadcasting system.

00:07:19.834 --> 00:07:21.998
It broadcasts through chemical signals,

00:07:22.022 --> 00:07:24.766
telling the rest of the cell
when it's ready,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.621
when it feels that everything
is aligned and ready to go

00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:29.623
for the separation of the chromosomes.

00:07:29.647 --> 00:07:32.979
It is able to couple onto the growing
and shrinking microtubules.

00:07:33.003 --> 00:07:36.202
It's involved with the growing
of the microtubules,

00:07:36.226 --> 00:07:38.629
and it's able to transiently
couple onto them.

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:41.179
It's also an attention-sensing system.

00:07:41.203 --> 00:07:43.179
It's able to feel when the cell is ready,

00:07:43.203 --> 00:07:45.437
when the chromosome
is correctly positioned.

00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:49.274
It's turning green here because it feels
that everything is just right.

00:07:49.298 --> 00:07:51.556
And you'll see,
there's this one little last bit

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.013
that's still remaining red.

00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:55.570
And it's walked away
down the microtubules.

00:07:57.149 --> 00:08:00.328
That is the signal broadcasting system
sending out the stop signal.

00:08:00.352 --> 00:08:03.048
And it's walked away --
I mean, it's that mechanical.

00:08:03.072 --> 00:08:04.640
It's molecular clockwork.

00:08:04.664 --> 00:08:07.236
This is how you work
at the molecular scale.

00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:10.133
So with a little bit
of molecular eye candy,

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:11.355
(Laughter)

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:13.329
we've got kinesins, the orange ones.

00:08:13.353 --> 00:08:16.126
They're little molecular courier
molecules walking one way.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.296
And here are the dynein,
they're carrying that broadcasting system.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.864
And they've got their long legs

00:08:20.888 --> 00:08:22.954
so they can step around
obstacles and so on.

00:08:22.978 --> 00:08:26.005
So again, this is all derived
accurately from the science.

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:28.579
The problem is we can't show it
to you any other way.

00:08:28.603 --> 00:08:33.437
Exploring at the frontier of science,
at the frontier of human understanding,

00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:34.696
is mind-blowing.

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:37.152
Discovering this stuff

00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:40.704
is certainly a pleasurable
incentive to work in science.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.948
But most medical researchers --

00:08:43.901 --> 00:08:48.114
discovering the stuff is simply steps
along the path to the big goals,

00:08:48.138 --> 00:08:52.559
which are to eradicate disease,
to eliminate the suffering

00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:54.658
and the misery that disease causes

00:08:54.682 --> 00:08:56.362
and to lift people out of poverty.

00:08:56.386 --> 00:08:57.658
Thank you.

00:08:57.682 --> 00:09:02.879
(Applause)
