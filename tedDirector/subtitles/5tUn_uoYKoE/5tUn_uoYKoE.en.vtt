00:00:16.656 --> 00:00:20.307
A few weeks ago, I had a chance
to go to Saudi Arabia.

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:23.353
And the first thing
I wanted to do as a Muslim

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:25.778
was to go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba,

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:27.236
the holiest shrine of Islam.

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:30.275
And I did that;
I put on my ritualistic dress,

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:31.807
I went to the holy mosque,

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.510
I did my prayers,

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.236
I observed all the rituals.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.637
And meanwhile,
besides all the spirituality,

00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:41.958
there was one mundane detail in the Kaaba

00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:43.680
that was pretty interesting for me:

00:00:43.704 --> 00:00:45.463
there was no separation of sexes.

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.236
In other words, men and women
were worshiping all together.

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:54.863
They were together while doing tawāf,
the circular walk around the Kaaba.

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:56.480
They were together while praying.

00:00:56.504 --> 00:01:00.062
And if you wonder
why this is interesting at all,

00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:02.667
you have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia,

00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:07.236
because this a country which is strictly
divided between the sexes.

00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:09.014
In other words:

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:12.781
as men, you are simply not supposed to be
in the same physical space

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:13.969
with women.

00:01:13.993 --> 00:01:15.879
And I noticed this in a very funny way.

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:19.120
I left the Kaaba to eat something
in downtown Mecca.

00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:22.106
I headed to the nearest
Burger King restaurant.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.886
And I went there -- I noticed
that there was a male section,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.708
which is carefully separated
from the female section.

00:01:28.732 --> 00:01:31.343
I had to pay, order and eat
in the male section.

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:33.740
"It's funny," I said to myself,

00:01:33.764 --> 00:01:36.568
"You can mingle with the opposite sex
at the holy Kaaba,

00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:38.236
but not at the Burger King?"

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.290
(Laughter)

00:01:39.314 --> 00:01:41.016
Quite, quite ironic.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.307
Ironic, and it's also,
I think, quite telling,

00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:46.911
because the Kaaba
and the rituals around it

00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:49.824
are relics from the earliest
phase of Islam,

00:01:49.848 --> 00:01:51.236
that of prophet Muhammad.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:55.529
And if there was a big emphasis
at the time to separate men from women,

00:01:55.553 --> 00:01:58.671
the rituals around the Kaaba
could have been designed accordingly.

00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:01.063
But apparently, that was not
an issue at the time.

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.488
So the rituals came that way.

00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:05.040
This is also, I think,
confirmed by the fact

00:02:05.064 --> 00:02:08.717
that the seclusion of women
in creating a divided society

00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:12.237
is something that you also
do not find in the Koran --

00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:15.323
the very core of Islam,
the divine core of Islam --

00:02:15.347 --> 00:02:17.760
that all Muslims, equally myself, believe.

00:02:19.054 --> 00:02:20.725
And I think it's not an accident

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:24.236
that you don't find this idea
in the very origin of Islam,

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.308
because many scholars who study
the history of Islamic thought --

00:02:28.332 --> 00:02:30.252
Muslim scholars or Westerners --

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:34.650
think that, actually, the practice
of dividing men and women physically

00:02:34.674 --> 00:02:37.809
came as a later development in Islam,

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:40.864
as Muslims adopted
some preexisting cultures

00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:42.574
and traditions of the Middle East.

00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:47.314
Seclusion of women was actually
a Byzantine and Persian practice,

00:02:47.338 --> 00:02:51.077
and Muslims adopted it
and made it a part of their religion.

00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:55.301
Actually, this is just one example
of a much larger phenomenon.

00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:59.320
What we call today Islamic law,
and especially Islamic culture --

00:02:59.344 --> 00:03:01.531
and there are many Islamic
cultures, actually;

00:03:01.555 --> 00:03:03.542
the one in Saudi Arabia is much different

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:05.811
from where I come
from in Istanbul or Turkey.

00:03:05.835 --> 00:03:09.108
But still, if you're going to speak
about a Muslim culture,

00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:13.475
this has a core: the divine message
which began the religion.

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:18.538
But then many traditions, perceptions,
practices were added on top of it.

00:03:18.562 --> 00:03:22.030
And these were traditions
of the Middle East medieval traditions.

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.202
There are two important
messages, or two lessons,

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:28.372
to take from that reality.

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:30.414
First of all, Muslims --

00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:34.320
pious, conservative, believing Muslims
who want to be loyal to their religion --

00:03:34.344 --> 00:03:36.774
should not cling onto everything
in their culture,

00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:39.006
thinking that that's divinely mandated.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.236
Maybe some things are bad traditions
and they need to be changed.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.311
On the other hand, the Westerners
who look at Islamic culture

00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:48.501
and see some troubling aspects

00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:51.715
should not readily conclude
that this is what Islam ordains.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.527
Maybe it's a Middle Eastern culture
that became confused with Islam.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:58.843
There is a practice
called female circumcision.

00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:01.357
It's something terrible, horrible.

00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:05.230
It is basically an operation
to deprive women of sexual pleasure.

00:04:06.072 --> 00:04:07.892
And Westerners --

00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:11.236
Europeans or Americans --
who didn't know about this before,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.236
[saw] this practice

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.552
within some of the Muslim communities
who migrated from North Africa.

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:18.751
And they've thought,

00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:22.885
"Oh, what a horrible religion that is,
which ordains something like that."

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:25.630
But when you look at female circumcision,

00:04:25.654 --> 00:04:27.821
you see that it has
nothing to do with Islam;

00:04:27.845 --> 00:04:30.527
it's just a North African practice
which predates Islam.

00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:32.364
It was there for thousands of years.

00:04:32.388 --> 00:04:36.002
And, quite tellingly,
some Muslims do practice it --

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.471
the Muslims in North Africa,
not in other places.

00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:42.141
But also the non-Muslim
communities of North Africa --

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:46.166
the animists, some Christians
and even a Jewish tribe in North Africa --

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.458
are known to practice female circumcision.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.606
So what might look like a problem
within Islamic faith

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.236
might turn out to be a tradition
that Muslims have subscribed to.

00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:59.957
The same thing can be said
for honor killings,

00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:02.529
which is a recurrent theme
in the Western media --

00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:05.236
and which is, of course,
a horrible tradition.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.679
And we see, truly, in some Muslim
communities, that tradition.

00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:11.984
But in the non-Muslim communities
of the Middle East,

00:05:12.008 --> 00:05:14.658
such as some Christian communities,
Eastern communities,

00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:15.967
you see the same practice.

00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:18.626
We had a tragic case of an honor killing

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.797
within Turkey's Armenian community
just a few months ago.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.944
Now, these are things
about general culture,

00:05:23.968 --> 00:05:26.818
but I'm also very much
interested in political culture

00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:29.659
and whether liberty
and democracy is appreciated,

00:05:29.683 --> 00:05:32.455
or whether there's an authoritarian
political culture

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.700
in which the state is supposed
to impose things on the citizens.

00:05:36.183 --> 00:05:37.891
And it is no secret

00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:40.442
that many Islamic movements
in the Middle East

00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:41.743
tend to be authoritarian,

00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:44.698
and some of the so-called
"Islamic regimes,"

00:05:44.722 --> 00:05:49.619
such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and the worst
case, the Taliban in Afghanistan,

00:05:49.643 --> 00:05:52.243
they are pretty authoritarian --
no doubt about that.

00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:53.693
For example, in Saudi Arabia,

00:05:53.717 --> 00:05:56.236
there is a phenomenon
called the religious police.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.236
And the religious police imposes
the supposed Islamic way of life

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.369
on every citizen, by force --

00:06:02.393 --> 00:06:05.377
like, women are forced
to cover their heads --

00:06:05.401 --> 00:06:08.189
wear the hijab, the Islamic head cover.

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.723
Now that is pretty authoritarian,

00:06:10.747 --> 00:06:13.029
and that's something
I'm very much critical of.

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:17.465
But when I realized that the non-Muslim,

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:21.108
or the non-Islamic-minded
actors in the same geography

00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:22.833
sometimes behaved similarly,

00:06:22.857 --> 00:06:24.859
I realized that the problem maybe lies

00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:27.765
in the political culture
of the whole region, not just Islam.

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.506
Let me give you an example:
in Turkey, where I come from,

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.506
which is a very hyper-secular republic,

00:06:32.937 --> 00:06:38.173
until very recently, we used to have
what I call "secularism police,"

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:42.236
which would guard the universities
against veiled students.

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.488
In other words, they would force students
to uncover their heads.

00:06:47.512 --> 00:06:49.840
And I think forcing people
to uncover their head

00:06:49.864 --> 00:06:52.979
is as tyrannical as forcing
them to cover it.

00:06:53.003 --> 00:06:54.723
It should be the citizen's decision.

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:56.406
But when I saw that, I said,

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.236
"Maybe the problem is just
an authoritarian culture in the region,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.112
and some Muslims
have been influenced by that.

00:07:03.136 --> 00:07:05.791
But the secular-minded people
can be influenced by that.

00:07:05.815 --> 00:07:07.999
Maybe it's a problem
of the political culture,

00:07:08.023 --> 00:07:11.483
and we have to think about
how to change that political culture."

00:07:11.916 --> 00:07:15.739
Now, these are some of the questions
I had in mind a few years ago

00:07:15.763 --> 00:07:17.467
when I sat down to write a book.

00:07:17.967 --> 00:07:20.120
I said, "Well, I will do research

00:07:20.144 --> 00:07:25.129
about how Islam actually
came to be what it is today,

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:28.448
and what roads were taken
and what roads could have been taken."

00:07:29.127 --> 00:07:33.236
The name of the book is "Islam Without
Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty."

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.719
And as the subtitle suggests,

00:07:35.743 --> 00:07:38.768
I looked at Islamic tradition
and the history of Islamic thought

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.870
from the perspective
of individual liberty,

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:44.860
and I tried to find what are the strengths
with regard to individual liberty.

00:07:44.884 --> 00:07:46.986
And there are strengths
in Islamic tradition.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.323
Islam, actually,
as a monotheistic religion,

00:07:49.347 --> 00:07:53.439
which defined man
as a responsible agent by itself,

00:07:53.463 --> 00:07:56.076
created the idea of the individual
in the Middle East,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.455
and saved it from the communitarianism,
the collectivism of the tribe.

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.315
You can derive many ideas from that.

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:05.484
But besides that, I also saw
problems within Islamic tradition.

00:08:05.865 --> 00:08:07.372
But one thing was curious:

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:10.803
most of those problems turn out to be
problems that emerged later,

00:08:10.827 --> 00:08:13.896
not from the very divine core
of Islam, the Koran,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.085
but from, again,
traditions and mentalities,

00:08:17.109 --> 00:08:21.056
or the interpretations of the Koran
that Muslims made in the Middle Ages.

00:08:21.484 --> 00:08:24.010
The Koran, for example,
doesn't condone stoning.

00:08:24.034 --> 00:08:26.010
There is no punishment for apostasy.

00:08:26.398 --> 00:08:29.456
There is no punishment
for personal sins like drinking.

00:08:30.027 --> 00:08:33.386
These things which make Islamic law,

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.214
the troubling aspects of Islamic law,

00:08:36.238 --> 00:08:39.334
were developed into later
interpretations of Islam.

00:08:39.358 --> 00:08:41.445
Which means that Muslims can, today,

00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:43.215
look at those things and say,

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:47.542
"Well, the core of our religion
is here to stay with us.

00:08:47.566 --> 00:08:49.636
It's our faith,
and we will be loyal to it.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.636
But we can change how it was interpreted,

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.924
because it was interpreted
according to the time

00:08:53.948 --> 00:08:55.382
and milieu in the Middle Ages.

00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:57.263
Now we're living in a different world,

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.487
with different values
and political systems."

00:08:59.511 --> 00:09:01.939
That interpretation
is quite possible and feasible.

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:05.965
Now, if I were the only person
thinking that way,

00:09:05.989 --> 00:09:07.257
we would be in trouble.

00:09:08.326 --> 00:09:10.204
But that's not the case at all.

00:09:10.887 --> 00:09:13.794
Actually, from the 19th century on,

00:09:13.818 --> 00:09:19.776
there's a whole revisionist, reformist --
whatever you call it -- tradition,

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.229
a trend in Islamic thinking.

00:09:22.253 --> 00:09:24.592
These were intellectuals or statesmen

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.636
of the 19th century,
and later, 20th century,

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.434
which looked at Europe, basically,

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:31.851
and saw that Europe
has many things to admire,

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.364
like science and technology.

00:09:33.388 --> 00:09:36.204
But not just that;
also democracy, parliament,

00:09:36.228 --> 00:09:37.832
the idea of representation,

00:09:37.856 --> 00:09:39.636
the idea of equal citizenship.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.517
These Muslim thinkers, intellectuals
and statesmen of the 19th century,

00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:46.687
looked at Europe,
saw these things, and said,

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.300
"Why don't we have these things?"

00:09:48.324 --> 00:09:50.341
And they looked back at Islamic tradition,

00:09:50.365 --> 00:09:52.777
and saw that there are
problematic aspects,

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:56.550
but they're not the core of the religion,
so maybe they can be re-understood,

00:09:56.574 --> 00:09:59.155
and the Koran can be reread
in the modern world.

00:09:59.652 --> 00:10:04.418
That trend is generally called
Islamic modernism,

00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:07.518
and it was advanced
by intellectuals and statesmen,

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:09.636
not just as an intellectual idea, though,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.373
but also as a political program.

00:10:11.397 --> 00:10:13.584
And that's why, actually,
in the 19th century,

00:10:13.608 --> 00:10:17.200
the Ottoman Empire, which then
covered the whole Middle East,

00:10:17.224 --> 00:10:19.440
made very important reforms --

00:10:19.464 --> 00:10:24.050
reforms like giving Christians and Jews
an equal citizenship status,

00:10:24.074 --> 00:10:25.636
accepting a constitution,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.512
accepting a representative parliament,

00:10:27.536 --> 00:10:30.186
advancing the idea of freedom of religion.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.636
That's why the Ottoman Empire,
in its last decades,

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.561
turned into a proto-democracy,
a constitutional monarchy,

00:10:37.585 --> 00:10:40.837
and freedom was a very important
political value at the time.

00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:42.637
Similarly, in the Arab world,

00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:46.270
there was what the great Arab
historian Albert Hourani defines

00:10:46.294 --> 00:10:47.445
as the Liberal Age.

00:10:47.469 --> 00:10:50.012
He has a book, "Arabic Thought
in the Liberal Age,"

00:10:50.036 --> 00:10:54.177
and the Liberal Age, he defines
as 19th century and early 20th century.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.636
Quite notably, this was the dominant trend
in the early 20th century

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.512
among Islamic thinkers
and statesmen and theologians.

00:11:03.493 --> 00:11:07.341
But there is a very curious pattern
in the rest of the 20th century,

00:11:07.365 --> 00:11:11.636
because we see a sharp decline
in this Islamic modernist line.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.307
And in place of that,

00:11:13.331 --> 00:11:19.750
what happens is that Islamism grows
as an ideology which is authoritarian,

00:11:19.774 --> 00:11:21.636
which is quite strident,

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.107
which is quite anti-Western,

00:11:24.131 --> 00:11:27.763
and which wants to shape society
based on a utopian vision.

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:30.818
So Islamism is the problematic idea

00:11:30.842 --> 00:11:34.960
that really created a lot of problems
in the 20th-century Islamic world.

00:11:35.572 --> 00:11:38.941
And even the very extreme
forms of Islamism

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:41.121
led to terrorism in the name of Islam --

00:11:42.113 --> 00:11:44.953
which is actually a practice
that I think is against Islam,

00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:47.963
but some, obviously, extremists,
did not think that way.

00:11:47.987 --> 00:11:49.636
But there is a curious question:

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:54.636
If Islamic modernism was so popular
in the 19th and early 20th centuries,

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.774
why did Islamism become so popular
in the rest of the 20th century?

00:11:59.241 --> 00:12:02.636
And this is a question, I think,
which needs to be discussed carefully.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.871
In my book, I went
into that question as well.

00:12:04.895 --> 00:12:08.466
And actually, you don't need to be
a rocket scientist to understand that.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.144
Just look at the political
history of the 20th century,

00:12:11.168 --> 00:12:13.089
and you see things have changed a lot.

00:12:13.113 --> 00:12:14.464
The contexts have changed.

00:12:14.488 --> 00:12:15.845
In the 19th century,

00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:18.683
when Muslims were looking
at Europe as an example,

00:12:18.707 --> 00:12:21.413
they were independent;
they were more self-confident.

00:12:21.437 --> 00:12:24.438
In the early 20th century,
with the fall of the Ottoman Empire,

00:12:24.462 --> 00:12:26.847
the whole Middle East was colonized.

00:12:27.278 --> 00:12:29.763
And when you have colonialization,
what do you have?

00:12:29.787 --> 00:12:31.636
You have anti-colonialization.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.636
So Europe is not just
an example now to emulate;

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.397
it's an enemy to fight and to resist.

00:12:37.818 --> 00:12:42.145
So there's a very sharp decline
in liberal ideas in the Muslim world,

00:12:42.169 --> 00:12:47.440
and what you see is more of a defensive,
rigid, reactionary strain,

00:12:47.464 --> 00:12:49.661
which led to Arab socialism,
Arab nationalism

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:51.907
and ultimately to the Islamist ideology.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.428
And when the colonial period ended,

00:12:55.452 --> 00:13:00.105
what you had in place of that
was generally secular dictators,

00:13:00.129 --> 00:13:01.750
which say they're a country,

00:13:01.774 --> 00:13:03.827
but did not bring
democracy to the country,

00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:05.729
and established their own dictatorship.

00:13:05.753 --> 00:13:09.216
And I think the West,
at least some powers in the West,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.768
particularly the United States,

00:13:10.792 --> 00:13:13.455
made the mistake of supporting
those secular dictators,

00:13:13.479 --> 00:13:16.739
thinking that they were more
helpful for their interests.

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:20.547
But the fact that those dictators
suppressed democracy in their country

00:13:20.571 --> 00:13:22.763
and suppressed Islamic
groups in their country

00:13:22.787 --> 00:13:25.260
actually made the Islamists
much more strident.

00:13:25.284 --> 00:13:26.636
So in the 20th century,

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.815
you had this vicious cycle
in the Arab world,

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:31.842
where you have a dictatorship
suppressing its own people,

00:13:31.866 --> 00:13:33.636
including the Islamic pious,

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.882
and they're reacting in reactionary ways.

00:13:36.938 --> 00:13:38.636
There was one country, though,

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.757
which was able to escape or stay away
from that vicious cycle.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:46.461
And that's the country
where I come from, Turkey.

00:13:46.913 --> 00:13:49.151
Turkey has never been colonized,

00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:52.859
so it remained as an independent nation
after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.

00:13:52.883 --> 00:13:54.299
That's one thing to remember;

00:13:54.323 --> 00:13:57.185
it did not share
the same anti-colonial hype

00:13:57.209 --> 00:13:59.879
that you can find in some other
countries in the region.

00:13:59.903 --> 00:14:01.440
Secondly, and most importantly,

00:14:01.464 --> 00:14:03.023
Turkey became a democracy

00:14:03.047 --> 00:14:05.636
earlier than any of the countries
we are talking about.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.232
In 1950, Turkey had the first
free and fair elections,

00:14:08.256 --> 00:14:10.870
which ended the more
autocratic secular regime,

00:14:10.894 --> 00:14:12.720
which was in the beginning of Turkey.

00:14:12.744 --> 00:14:14.706
And the pious Muslims in Turkey

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.799
saw that they could change
the political system by voting.

00:14:18.823 --> 00:14:22.333
And they realized that democracy
is something compatible with Islam,

00:14:22.357 --> 00:14:23.786
compatible with their values,

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.787
and they've been supportive of democracy.

00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:27.636
That's an experience

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.444
that not every other Muslim nation
in the Middle East had,

00:14:30.468 --> 00:14:31.636
until very recently.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.903
Secondly, in the past two decades,

00:14:33.927 --> 00:14:36.636
thanks to globalization,
thanks to the market economy,

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.958
thanks to the rise of a middle class,

00:14:38.982 --> 00:14:43.961
we in Turkey see what I define
as a rebirth of Islamic modernism.

00:14:44.326 --> 00:14:48.174
Now, there's the more urban
middle-class pious Muslims

00:14:48.198 --> 00:14:50.330
who, again, look at their tradition

00:14:50.354 --> 00:14:53.240
and see that there are
some problems in the tradition,

00:14:53.264 --> 00:14:56.698
and understand that they need to be
changed and questioned and reformed.

00:14:56.722 --> 00:15:00.199
And they look at Europe,
and see an example, again, to follow.

00:15:00.223 --> 00:15:03.136
They see an example, at least,
to take some inspiration from.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.069
That's why the EU process,
Turkey's effort to join the EU,

00:15:07.093 --> 00:15:10.751
has been supported inside Turkey
by the Islamic pious,

00:15:10.775 --> 00:15:13.238
while some secular nationalists
were against it.

00:15:13.793 --> 00:15:16.099
Well, that process
has been a little bit blurred

00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:18.707
by the fact that not all
Europeans are that welcoming,

00:15:18.731 --> 00:15:20.305
but that's another discussion.

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:23.792
But the pro-EU sentiment
in Turkey in the past decade

00:15:23.816 --> 00:15:27.812
has become almost an Islamic cause
and supported by the Islamic liberals

00:15:27.836 --> 00:15:29.966
and the secular liberals
as well, of course.

00:15:30.414 --> 00:15:31.686
And thanks to that,

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.953
Turkey has been able
to reasonably create a success story

00:15:34.977 --> 00:15:39.802
in which Islam and the most pious
understandings of Islam

00:15:39.826 --> 00:15:41.813
have become part of the democratic game,

00:15:41.837 --> 00:15:45.992
and even contributes to the democratic
and economic advance of the country.

00:15:46.565 --> 00:15:50.233
And this has been
an inspiring example right now

00:15:50.257 --> 00:15:52.295
for some of the Islamic movements

00:15:52.319 --> 00:15:54.469
or some of the countries
in the Arab world.

00:15:54.493 --> 00:15:56.636
You must have all seen the Arab Spring,

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.402
which began in Tunis and in Egypt.

00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:03.246
Arab masses just revolted
against their dictators.

00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:07.258
They were asking for democracy;
they were asking for freedom.

00:16:07.282 --> 00:16:09.898
And they did not turn out to be
the Islamist boogeyman

00:16:09.922 --> 00:16:14.708
that the dictators were always using
to justify their regime.

00:16:15.089 --> 00:16:17.511
They said, "We want freedom;
we want democracy.

00:16:17.535 --> 00:16:19.202
We are Muslim believers,

00:16:19.226 --> 00:16:23.124
but we want to be living
as free people in free societies."

00:16:23.513 --> 00:16:25.872
Of course, this is a long road.

00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:29.175
Democracy is not an overnight
achievement; it's a process.

00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:33.165
But this is a promising era
in the Muslim world.

00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:36.806
And I believe that the Islamic modernism
which began in the 19th century,

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.040
but which had a setback
in the 20th century

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:41.623
because of the political
troubles of the Muslim world,

00:16:41.647 --> 00:16:42.827
is having a rebirth.

00:16:43.225 --> 00:16:47.887
And I think the takeaway message
from that would be that Islam,

00:16:47.911 --> 00:16:50.443
despite some of the skeptics in the West,

00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:52.343
has the potential in itself

00:16:52.367 --> 00:16:55.946
to create its own way to democracy,
create its own way to liberalism,

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.506
create its own way to freedom.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.779
They just should be allowed
to work for that.

00:17:00.092 --> 00:17:01.256
Thanks so much.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:06.648
(Applause)
