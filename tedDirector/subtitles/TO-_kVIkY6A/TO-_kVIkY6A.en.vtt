00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:15.383
Let's say you despise

00:00:15.407 --> 00:00:16.853
Western democracy.

00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:20.624
Democracy, in all its trappings,

00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:23.311
free elections, town halls,

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:26.171
endless debates about
the proper role of government.

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:27.528
Too messy,

00:00:27.552 --> 00:00:28.708
too unpredictable,

00:00:28.732 --> 00:00:30.696
too constraining for your taste.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.781
And the way these democracies
band together and lecture everyone else

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:38.096
about individual rights and freedoms --

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.160
it gets under your skin.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.644
So what to do about it?

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:48.499
You can call out the hypocrisy
and failures of Western democracies

00:00:48.523 --> 00:00:51.752
and explain how your way is better,

00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:53.831
but that's never really worked for you.

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:57.212
What if you could get the people

00:00:57.236 --> 00:01:00.376
whose support is the very foundation
of these democracies

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.992
to start questioning the system?

00:01:04.262 --> 00:01:06.710
Make the idea occur in their own minds

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:10.846
that democracy and its institutions
are failing them,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.130
their elite are corrupt puppet masters

00:01:13.154 --> 00:01:15.920
and the country they knew is in free fall.

00:01:17.603 --> 00:01:18.877
To do that,

00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:21.899
you'll need to infiltrate
the information spheres

00:01:21.923 --> 00:01:23.225
of these democracies.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.950
You'll need to turn
their most powerful asset --

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:28.879
an open mind --

00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:30.885
into their greatest vulnerability.

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:33.960
You'll need people to question the truth.

00:01:35.922 --> 00:01:40.664
Now, you'll be familiar of hacking
and leaks that happened in 2016.

00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:43.510
One was the Democratic
National Committee's networks,

00:01:43.534 --> 00:01:46.365
and the personal email
accounts of its staff,

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:48.242
later released on WikiLeaks.

00:01:48.844 --> 00:01:51.170
After that, various online personas,

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:56.074
like a supposed Romanian cybercriminal
who didn't speak Romanian,

00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:59.604
aggressively pushed news
of these leaks to journalists.

00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:02.607
The media took the bait.

00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:05.738
They were consumed by how much
the DNC hated Bernie.

00:02:06.738 --> 00:02:10.978
At the time, it was that narrative
that far outshined the news

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:14.342
that a group of Russian government
sponsored hackers

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:17.599
who we called "Advanced
Persistent Threat 28,"

00:02:17.623 --> 00:02:20.204
or "APT28" for short,

00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:23.285
was carrying out
these operations against the US.

00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:26.171
And there was no shortage of evidence.

00:02:26.804 --> 00:02:30.522
This group of Russian government hackers
hadn't just appeared out of nowhere

00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:31.710
in 2016.

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:34.891
We had started tracking
this group back in 2014.

00:02:34.915 --> 00:02:39.796
And the tools that APT28 used
to compromise its victims' networks

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.413
demonstrated a thoughtful,
well-resourced effort

00:02:43.437 --> 00:02:46.263
that had taken place for now over a decade

00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:47.786
in Moscow's time zone

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.796
from about 9 am to 6 pm.

00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:55.997
APT28 loved to prey on the emails
and contacts of journalists in Chechnya,

00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:59.528
the Georgian government,
eastern European defense attachÃ©s --

00:02:59.552 --> 00:03:03.593
all targets with an undeniable interest
to the Russian government.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:05.577
We weren't the only ones onto this.

00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:09.018
Governments, research teams
across the world,

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:10.949
were coming to similar conclusions

00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:13.294
and observing the same
types of operations.

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.260
But what Russia was doing in 2016

00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:19.198
went far beyond espionage.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.498
The DNC hack was just one of many
where stolen data was posted online

00:03:26.522 --> 00:03:28.776
accompanied by a sensational narrative,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.738
then amplified in social media

00:03:30.762 --> 00:03:33.601
for lightning-speed adoption by the media.

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:39.198
This didn't ring the alarm bells

00:03:39.222 --> 00:03:43.713
that a nation-state was trying
to interfere with the credibility

00:03:43.737 --> 00:03:45.661
of another's internal affairs.

00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:50.347
So why, collectively,
did we not see this coming?

00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:54.813
Why did it take months
before Americans understood

00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:58.958
that they were under a state-sponsored
information attack?

00:04:00.276 --> 00:04:01.915
The easy answer is politics.

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.862
The Obama Administration was caught
in a perfect catch-22.

00:04:05.886 --> 00:04:10.284
By raising the specter that the Russian
government was interfering

00:04:10.308 --> 00:04:12.400
in the US presidential campaign,

00:04:12.424 --> 00:04:16.685
the Administration risked appearing
to meddle in the campaign itself.

00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:19.867
But the better answer, I think,

00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:23.744
is that the US and the West
were utterly unequipped

00:04:23.768 --> 00:04:28.422
to recognize and respond
to a modern information operation,

00:04:28.446 --> 00:04:33.558
despite the fact that the US
had wielded information

00:04:33.582 --> 00:04:36.767
with devastating success
in an era not so long ago.

00:04:38.104 --> 00:04:41.998
Look, so while the US and the West
spent the last 20 years

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:43.576
caught up in cybersecurity --

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.095
what networks to harden,

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:47.428
which infrastructure to deem critical,

00:04:47.452 --> 00:04:51.445
how to set up armies of cyber warriors
and cyber commands --

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:55.202
Russia was thinking in far more
consequential terms.

00:04:57.142 --> 00:05:00.469
Before the first iPhone
even hit the shelf,

00:05:00.493 --> 00:05:04.966
the Russian government understood
the risks and the opportunity

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.415
that technology provided

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.850
and the inter-communication
and instant communication it provided us.

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:15.528
As our realities are increasingly
based on the information

00:05:15.552 --> 00:05:17.908
that we're consuming
at the palm of our hand

00:05:17.932 --> 00:05:20.185
and from the news feeds
that we're scanning

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:23.175
and the hashtags and stories
that we see trending,

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.126
the Russian government
was the first to recognize

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.025
how this evolution

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:32.838
had turned your mind into the most
exploitable device on the planet.

00:05:34.774 --> 00:05:37.238
And your mind is particularly exploitable

00:05:37.262 --> 00:05:41.037
if you're accustomed
to an unfettered flow of information,

00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:44.340
now increasingly curated
to your own tastes.

00:05:47.064 --> 00:05:49.955
This panorama of information
that's so interesting to you

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:55.925
gives a state, or anyone for that matter,
a perfect back door into your mind.

00:05:56.798 --> 00:06:00.476
It's this new brand of state-sponsored
information operations

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.635
that can be that much more successful,

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:03.961
more insidious,

00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:08.071
and harder for the target audience --
that includes the media --

00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:09.879
to decipher and characterize.

00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:12.715
If you can get a hashtag
trending on Twitter,

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:15.854
or chum the waters with fake news

00:06:15.878 --> 00:06:18.319
directed to audiences
primed to receive it,

00:06:18.343 --> 00:06:21.220
or drive journalists to dissect
terabytes of email

00:06:21.244 --> 00:06:23.219
for a cent of impropriety --

00:06:23.243 --> 00:06:25.885
all tactics used in Russian operations --

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:30.200
then you've got a shot at effectively
camouflaging your operations

00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:32.028
in the mind of your target.

00:06:33.687 --> 00:06:37.519
This is what Russia's long called
"reflexive control."

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.451
It's the ability to use
information on someone else

00:06:42.475 --> 00:06:44.659
so that they make a decision

00:06:44.683 --> 00:06:46.234
on their own accord

00:06:46.258 --> 00:06:47.801
that's favorable to you.

00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:54.190
This is nation-state-grade image control
and perception management,

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:56.532
and it's conducted by any means,

00:06:56.556 --> 00:07:00.855
with any tools, network-based
or otherwise, that will achieve it.

00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:03.061
Take this for another example.

00:07:03.085 --> 00:07:08.038
In early February 2014, a few weeks
before Russia would invade Crimea,

00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:10.291
a phone call is posted on YouTube.

00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:12.690
In it, there's two US diplomats.

00:07:12.714 --> 00:07:15.908
They sound like they're playing
kingmaker in Ukraine,

00:07:15.932 --> 00:07:19.375
and worse, they curse the EU
for its lack of speed and leadership

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:20.985
in resolving the crisis.

00:07:21.887 --> 00:07:24.346
The media covers the phone call,

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.708
and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash

00:07:29.003 --> 00:07:31.338
leaves Washington and Europe reeling.

00:07:32.782 --> 00:07:36.861
And it creates a fissured response
and a feckless attitude

00:07:36.885 --> 00:07:39.015
towards Russia's land grab in Ukraine.

00:07:39.938 --> 00:07:41.473
Mission accomplished.

00:07:42.468 --> 00:07:45.848
So while hacked phone calls
and emails and networks

00:07:45.872 --> 00:07:47.918
keep grabbing the headlines,

00:07:47.942 --> 00:07:50.576
the real operations are the ones

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.408
that are influencing
the decisions you make

00:07:53.432 --> 00:07:55.250
and the opinions you hold,

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:59.148
all in the service of a nation-state's
strategic interest.

00:07:59.764 --> 00:08:01.775
This is power in the information age.

00:08:03.347 --> 00:08:06.791
And this information is all
that much more seductive,

00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:10.602
all that much easier to take
at face value and pass on,

00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:12.008
when it's authentic.

00:08:12.697 --> 00:08:18.091
Who's not interested in the truth
that's presented in phone calls and emails

00:08:18.115 --> 00:08:20.966
that were never intended
for public consumption?

00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:23.815
But how meaningful is that truth

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:26.279
if you don't know why
it's being revealed to you?

00:08:27.786 --> 00:08:31.974
We must recognize that this place
where we're increasingly living,

00:08:31.998 --> 00:08:34.283
which we've quaintly termed "cyberspace,"

00:08:34.307 --> 00:08:36.513
isn't defined by ones and zeroes,

00:08:36.537 --> 00:08:39.526
but by information
and the people behind it.

00:08:40.648 --> 00:08:43.791
This is far more than a network
of computers and devices.

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:46.967
This is a network composed of minds

00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:49.390
interacting with computers and devices.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.671
And for this network,

00:08:54.448 --> 00:08:57.829
there's no encryption,
there's no firewall,

00:08:57.853 --> 00:08:59.576
no two-factor authentication,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.476
no password complex enough to protect you.

00:09:03.388 --> 00:09:05.802
What you have for defense

00:09:05.826 --> 00:09:10.273
is far stronger, it's more adaptable,
it's always running the latest version.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.055
It's the ability to think critically:

00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:15.798
call out falsehood,

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:17.249
press for the facts.

00:09:18.622 --> 00:09:22.815
And above all, you must have the courage

00:09:22.839 --> 00:09:25.787
to unflinchingly pursue the truth.

00:09:27.572 --> 00:09:32.610
(Applause)
