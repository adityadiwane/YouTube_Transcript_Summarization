00:00:13.025 --> 00:00:17.433
I have a confession to make.

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:23.593
As a scientist and engineer,
I've focused on efficiency for many years.

00:00:25.213 --> 00:00:29.030
But efficiency can be a cult,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.230
and today I'd like to tell you
about a journey

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.055
that moved me out of the cult
and back to a far richer reality.

00:00:40.091 --> 00:00:45.739
A few years ago, after finishing my Ph.D. 
in London, I moved to Boston.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.381
I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge.

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:52.576
I bought a racing bicycle that summer,

00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:55.306
and I bicycled every day to work.

00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:57.692
To find my way, I used my phone.

00:00:57.692 --> 00:01:01.593
It sent me over Mass. Ave.,
Massachusetts Avenue,

00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:05.842
the shortest route from
Boston to Cambridge.

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:07.909
But after a month

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.495
that I was cycling every day
on the car-packed Mass. Ave.,

00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:15.734
I took a different route one day.

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:20.795
I'm not entirely sure why I took
a different route that day, a detour.

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:25.184
I just remember a feeling of surprise;

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:29.247
surprise at finding a street with no cars,

00:01:29.247 --> 00:01:33.078
as opposed to the nearby
Mass. Ave. full of cars;

00:01:33.078 --> 00:01:38.395
surprise at finding a street 
draped by leaves and surrounded by trees.

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:43.695
But after the feeling 
of surprise, I felt shame.

00:01:43.695 --> 00:01:46.822
How could I have been so blind?

00:01:46.822 --> 00:01:48.728
For an entire month,

00:01:48.728 --> 00:01:51.816
I was so trapped in my mobile app

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:55.322
that a journey to work
became one thing only:

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:57.783
the shortest path.

00:01:57.783 --> 00:02:00.876
In this single journey,
there was no thought

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:03.507
of enjoying the road,

00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:05.459
no pleasure in connecting with nature,

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.166
no possibility of looking
people in the eyes.

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:10.951
And why?

00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:15.400
Because I was saving a minute
out of my commute.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.399
Now let me ask you: Am I alone here?

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:26.227
How many of you have never used
a mapping app for finding directions?

00:02:26.227 --> 00:02:28.146
Most of you, if not all, have.

00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:33.239
And don't get me wrong -- mapping apps
are the greatest game-changer

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.816
for encouraging people
to explore the city.

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:39.993
You take your phone out
and you know immediately where to go.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.904
However, the app also assumes

00:02:42.904 --> 00:02:48.308
there are only a handful
of directions to the destination.

00:02:48.308 --> 00:02:52.116
It has the power to make
those handful of directions

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:57.015
the definitive direction
to that destination.

00:02:57.015 --> 00:02:59.685
After that experience, I changed.

00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:03.052
I changed my research
from traditional data-mining

00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:07.324
to understanding how people
experience the city.

00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:09.553
I used computer science tools

00:03:09.553 --> 00:03:14.996
to replicate social science
experiments at scale, at web scale.

00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:20.118
I became captivated
by the beauty and genius

00:03:20.118 --> 00:03:23.020
of traditional social science experiments

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.525
done by Jane Jacobs,
Stanley Milgram, Kevin Lynch.

00:03:27.525 --> 00:03:32.192
The result of that research
has been the creation of new maps,

00:03:32.192 --> 00:03:37.021
maps where you don't only find
the shortest path, the blue one,

00:03:37.021 --> 00:03:40.342
but also the most enjoyable path,

00:03:40.342 --> 00:03:42.060
the red one.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.662
How was that possible?

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:47.513
Einstein once said,

00:03:47.513 --> 00:03:50.999
"Logic will get you from A to B.

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.771
Imagination will take you everywhere."

00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:55.689
So with a bit of imagination,

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.570
we needed to understand

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.935
which parts of the city
people find beautiful.

00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:04.582
At the University of Cambridge,
with colleagues,

00:04:04.582 --> 00:04:07.740
we thought about this simple experiment.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.898
If I were to show you
these two urban scenes,

00:04:10.898 --> 00:04:13.684
and I were to ask you
which one is more beautiful,

00:04:13.684 --> 00:04:16.376
which one would you say?

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:21.161
Don't be shy.

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.411
Who says A? Who says B?

00:04:24.411 --> 00:04:26.013
Brilliant.

00:04:26.013 --> 00:04:27.987
Based on that idea,

00:04:27.987 --> 00:04:29.799
we built a crowdsourcing platform,

00:04:29.799 --> 00:04:30.913
a web game.

00:04:30.913 --> 00:04:33.792
Players are shown pairs of urban scenes,

00:04:33.792 --> 00:04:40.137
and they're asked to choose which one 
is more beautiful, quiet and happy.

00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:42.104
Based on thousands of user votes,

00:04:42.104 --> 00:04:45.308
then we are able to see
where consensus emerges.

00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:48.513
We are able to see which
are the urban scenes

00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:51.276
that make people happy.

00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:54.225
After that work, I joined Yahoo Labs,

00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:57.104
and I teamed up with Luca and Rossano,

00:04:57.104 --> 00:05:00.380
and together, we aggregated
those winning locations in London

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.726
to build a new map of the city,

00:05:03.726 --> 00:05:07.993
a cartography weighted for human emotions.

00:05:07.993 --> 00:05:11.825
On this cartography, you're not only
able to see and connect

00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:16.677
from point A to point B 
the shortest segments,

00:05:16.677 --> 00:05:19.812
but you're also able
to see the happy segment,

00:05:19.812 --> 00:05:23.504
the beautiful path, the quiet path.

00:05:23.504 --> 00:05:28.148
In tests, participants found the happy,
the beautiful, the quiet path

00:05:28.148 --> 00:05:31.723
far more enjoyable than the shortest one,

00:05:31.723 --> 00:05:37.528
and that just by adding
a few minutes to travel time.

00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:41.777
Participants also love to attach
memories to places.

00:05:41.777 --> 00:05:46.676
Shared memories --
that's where the old BBC building was;

00:05:46.676 --> 00:05:51.601
and personal memories --
that's where I gave my first kiss.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:56.034
They also recalled how some paths
smelled and sounded.

00:05:56.034 --> 00:05:59.261
So what if we had a mapping tool

00:05:59.261 --> 00:06:01.792
that would return
the most enjoyable routes

00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:04.412
based not only on aesthetics

00:06:04.412 --> 00:06:07.721
but also based on smell, sound, 
and memories?

00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:11.826
That's where our research
is going right now.

00:06:11.826 --> 00:06:14.028
More generally, my research,

00:06:14.028 --> 00:06:18.626
what it tries to do is avoid
the danger of the single path,

00:06:18.626 --> 00:06:23.827
to avoid robbing people of fully
experiencing the city in which they live.

00:06:23.827 --> 00:06:27.565
Walk the path through the park,
not through the car park,

00:06:27.565 --> 00:06:29.957
and you have an entirely different path.

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:32.905
Walk the path full of people you love

00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:34.221
and not full of cars,

00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:35.939
and you have an entirely different path.

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:38.392
It's that simple.

00:06:39.012 --> 00:06:41.822
I would like to end with this thought:

00:06:41.822 --> 00:06:43.842
do you remember "The Truman Show?"

00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:46.860
It's a media satire in which a real person

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.413
doesn't know he's living
in a fabricated world.

00:06:50.413 --> 00:06:55.567
Perhaps we live in a world
fabricated for efficiency.

00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:59.073
Look at some of your daily habits,

00:06:59.073 --> 00:07:05.217
and as Truman did in the movie,
escape the fabricated world.

00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:06.736
Why?

00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:13.416
Well, if you think that adventure
is dangerous, try routine. It's deadly.

00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:15.327
Thank you.

00:07:15.327 --> 00:07:19.297
(Applause)
