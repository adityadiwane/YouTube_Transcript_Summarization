00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:13.824
I'll never forget that day

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:17.723
back in the spring of 2006.

00:00:17.723 --> 00:00:19.302
I was a surgical resident

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:21.733
at The Johns Hopkins Hospital,

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.510
taking emergency call.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.873
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning

00:00:26.873 --> 00:00:28.900
to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.694
on her foot.

00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:34.395
I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:38.022
as I pulled the curtain back to see her.

00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:40.367
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:41.719
and she needed to be in the hospital.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.319
That wasn't being asked.

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.461
The question that was being asked of me was a different one,

00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:49.390
which was, did she also need an amputation?

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.357
Now, looking back on that night,

00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:57.522
I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman

00:00:57.522 --> 00:01:00.658
on that night with the same empathy and compassion

00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:04.893
I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed

00:01:04.893 --> 00:01:06.838
who came to the E.R. three nights earlier

00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:08.452
with lower back pain

00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:12.701
that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:14.864
In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:16.632
that was actually going to save her life.

00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:18.681
The cancer was too advanced.

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:21.361
But I was committed to making sure that

00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:23.784
I could do anything possible to make her stay

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.207
more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket

00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:28.927
and a cup of a coffee.

00:01:28.927 --> 00:01:31.112
I brought some for her parents.

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:34.258
But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her,

00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:36.155
because obviously she had done nothing

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:38.329
to bring this on herself.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.142
So why was it that, just a few nights later,

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:44.300
as I stood in that same E.R. and determined

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.711
that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation,

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:51.615
why did I hold her in such bitter contempt?

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:54.080
You see, unlike the woman the night before,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.479
this woman had type 2 diabetes.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.031
She was fat.

00:01:58.031 --> 00:01:59.944
And we all know that's from eating too much

00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:02.299
and not exercising enough, right?

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.983
I mean, how hard can it be?

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:07.344
As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself,

00:02:07.344 --> 00:02:10.232
if you just tried caring even a little bit,

00:02:10.232 --> 00:02:13.222
you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment

00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:14.999
with some doctor you've never met

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.814
about to amputate your foot.

00:02:18.814 --> 00:02:22.456
Why did I feel justified in judging her?

00:02:22.456 --> 00:02:25.025
I'd like to say I don't know.

00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:27.061
But I actually do.

00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.392
You see, in the hubris of my youth,

00:02:29.392 --> 00:02:32.496
I thought I had her all figured out.

00:02:32.496 --> 00:02:34.326
She ate too much. She got unlucky.

00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:37.695
She got diabetes. Case closed.

00:02:37.695 --> 00:02:39.098
Ironically, at that time in my life,

00:02:39.098 --> 00:02:41.496
I was also doing cancer research,

00:02:41.496 --> 00:02:43.839
immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific,

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:47.812
and in that world I was actually taught to question everything,

00:02:47.812 --> 00:02:49.848
to challenge all assumptions

00:02:49.848 --> 00:02:53.658
and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards.

00:02:53.658 --> 00:02:57.034
Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes

00:02:57.034 --> 00:03:00.583
that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma,

00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:04.011
I never once questioned the conventional wisdom.

00:03:04.011 --> 00:03:07.057
I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events

00:03:07.057 --> 00:03:09.642
was settled science.

00:03:09.642 --> 00:03:13.042
Three years later, I found out how wrong I was.

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:15.642
But this time, I was the patient.

00:03:15.642 --> 00:03:19.473
Despite exercising three or four hours every single day,

00:03:19.473 --> 00:03:22.038
and following the food pyramid to the letter,

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:24.195
I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something

00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:26.480
called metabolic syndrome.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.464
Some of you may have heard of this.

00:03:28.464 --> 00:03:31.909
I had become insulin-resistant.

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.358
You can think of insulin as this master hormone

00:03:34.358 --> 00:03:38.421
that controls what our body does with the foods we eat,

00:03:38.421 --> 00:03:40.535
whether we burn it or store it.

00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:43.349
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo.

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.525
Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life.

00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:49.181
And insulin resistance, as its name suggests,

00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:51.861
is when your cells get increasingly resistant

00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:55.374
to the effect of insulin trying to do its job.

00:03:55.374 --> 00:03:57.550
Once you're insulin-resistant,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.925
you're on your way to getting diabetes,

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:00.989
which is what happens when your pancreas

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.312
can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin.

00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:06.940
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.572
and an entire cascade of pathologic events

00:04:09.572 --> 00:04:13.273
sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease,

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:16.882
cancer, even Alzheimer's disease,

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:21.764
and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier.

00:04:21.764 --> 00:04:24.725
With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically,

00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:26.902
adding and subtracting things most of you would find

00:04:26.902 --> 00:04:29.982
almost assuredly shocking.

00:04:29.982 --> 00:04:33.861
I did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less.

00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:36.902
I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore.

00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:39.069
More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance.

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.113
But most important, I was left

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:44.962
with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away:

00:04:44.962 --> 00:04:47.411
How did this happen to me if I was supposedly

00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:50.108
doing everything right?

00:04:50.108 --> 00:04:53.143
If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me,

00:04:53.143 --> 00:04:56.930
was it possible it was failing someone else?

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.830
And underlying these questions,

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.076
I became almost maniacally obsessed

00:05:02.076 --> 00:05:04.803
in trying to understand the real relationship

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:08.433
between obesity and insulin resistance.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:11.249
Now, most researchers believe obesity

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:14.641
is the cause of insulin resistance.

00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.756
Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance,

00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:18.648
you get people to lose weight, right?

00:05:18.648 --> 00:05:21.412
You treat the obesity.

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:24.118
But what if we have it backwards?

00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:27.489
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:31.409
In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem,

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.231
the tip of a proverbial iceberg?

00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:36.874
I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst

00:05:36.874 --> 00:05:40.093
of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.

00:05:40.093 --> 00:05:43.307
What if obesity is a coping mechanism

00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:46.909
for a far more sinister problem going on

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.391
underneath the cell?

00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:50.757
I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign,

00:05:50.757 --> 00:05:53.060
but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.771
of two metabolic evils.

00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:58.790
You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.777
of our cells to partition fuel,

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.068
as I alluded to a moment ago,

00:06:03.068 --> 00:06:04.990
taking those calories that we take in

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.429
and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:10.071
When we become insulin-resistant,

00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.438
the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.

00:06:13.438 --> 00:06:15.566
So now, when insulin says to a cell,

00:06:15.566 --> 00:06:17.611
I want you to burn more energy

00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:20.046
than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says,

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:24.478
"No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."

00:06:24.478 --> 00:06:26.380
And because fat cells are actually missing most of

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.182
the complex cellular machinery found in other cells,

00:06:29.182 --> 00:06:31.953
it's probably the safest place to store it.

00:06:31.953 --> 00:06:36.922
So for many of us, about 75 million Americans,

00:06:36.922 --> 00:06:40.537
the appropriate response to insulin resistance

00:06:40.537 --> 00:06:45.466
may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse,

00:06:45.466 --> 00:06:50.810
getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.985
This is a really subtle distinction,

00:06:52.985 --> 00:06:56.352
but the implication could be profound.

00:06:56.352 --> 00:06:58.850
Consider the following analogy:

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.819
Think of the bruise you get on your shin

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.411
when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table.

00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:08.298
Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly

00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:11.279
don't like the discolored look, but we all know

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:14.732
the bruise per Se is not the problem.

00:07:14.732 --> 00:07:18.474
In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma,

00:07:18.474 --> 00:07:21.235
all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury

00:07:21.235 --> 00:07:24.219
to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:26.917
of infection to elsewhere in the body.

00:07:26.917 --> 00:07:30.639
Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem,

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:33.507
and we evolved a giant medical establishment

00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:36.647
and a culture around treating bruises:

00:07:36.647 --> 00:07:39.930
masking creams, painkillers, you name it,

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.156
all the while ignoring the fact that people

00:07:42.156 --> 00:07:45.776
are still banging their shins into coffee tables.

00:07:45.776 --> 00:07:48.979
How much better would we be if we treated the cause --

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.544
telling people to pay attention

00:07:50.544 --> 00:07:52.147
when they walk through the living room --

00:07:52.147 --> 00:07:55.420
rather than the effect?

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.297
Getting the cause and the effect right

00:07:57.297 --> 00:07:59.776
makes all the difference in the world.

00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:02.855
Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry

00:08:02.855 --> 00:08:05.535
can still do very well for its shareholders

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:09.451
but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins.

00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:12.295
Cause and effect.

00:08:12.295 --> 00:08:14.132
So what I'm suggesting is

00:08:14.132 --> 00:08:16.889
maybe we have the cause and effect wrong

00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:19.523
on obesity and insulin resistance.

00:08:19.523 --> 00:08:21.300
Maybe we should be asking ourselves,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.185
is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain

00:08:25.185 --> 00:08:27.251
and the diseases associated with obesity,

00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:28.781
at least in most people?

00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:31.781
What if being obese is just a metabolic response

00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:34.002
to something much more threatening,

00:08:34.002 --> 00:08:36.213
an underlying epidemic,

00:08:36.213 --> 00:08:38.770
the one we ought to be worried about?

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.242
Let's look at some suggestive facts.

00:08:40.242 --> 00:08:42.728
We know that 30 million obese Americans

00:08:42.728 --> 00:08:45.701
in the United States don't have insulin resistance.

00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:47.638
And by the way, they don't appear to be at any

00:08:47.638 --> 00:08:50.718
greater risk of disease than lean people.

00:08:50.718 --> 00:08:53.602
Conversely, we know that six million lean people

00:08:53.602 --> 00:08:57.039
in the United States are insulin-resistant,

00:08:57.039 --> 00:09:00.106
and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:02.261
for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago

00:09:02.261 --> 00:09:04.083
than their obese counterparts.

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:06.320
Now I don't know why, but it might be because,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.010
in their case, their cells haven't actually figured out

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.295
the right thing to do with that excess energy.

00:09:12.295 --> 00:09:15.614
So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance,

00:09:15.614 --> 00:09:17.485
and you can be lean and have it,

00:09:17.485 --> 00:09:21.918
this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy

00:09:21.918 --> 00:09:24.942
for what's going on.

00:09:24.942 --> 00:09:27.357
So what if we're fighting the wrong war,

00:09:27.357 --> 00:09:31.157
fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance?

00:09:31.157 --> 00:09:34.400
Even worse, what if blaming the obese

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.125
means we're blaming the victims?

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:40.844
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity

00:09:40.844 --> 00:09:42.702
are just wrong?

00:09:42.702 --> 00:09:46.825
Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore,

00:09:46.825 --> 00:09:49.408
let alone the luxury of certainty.

00:09:49.408 --> 00:09:52.254
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this,

00:09:52.254 --> 00:09:54.166
but I'm wide open to others.

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:56.885
Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me,

00:09:56.885 --> 00:09:58.502
is this.

00:09:58.502 --> 00:10:01.631
If you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from

00:10:01.631 --> 00:10:03.358
when it becomes insulin resistant,

00:10:03.358 --> 00:10:06.033
the answer probably isn't too much food.

00:10:06.033 --> 00:10:09.683
It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.

00:10:09.683 --> 00:10:11.977
Now, we know that refined grains and starches

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:14.033
elevate your blood sugar in the short run,

00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:15.941
and there's even reason to believe that sugar

00:10:15.941 --> 00:10:18.742
may lead to insulin resistance directly.

00:10:18.742 --> 00:10:22.837
So if you put these physiological processes to work,

00:10:22.837 --> 00:10:26.310
I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.173
of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving

00:10:29.173 --> 00:10:33.824
this epidemic of obesity and diabetes,

00:10:33.824 --> 00:10:35.662
but through insulin resistance,

00:10:35.662 --> 00:10:39.574
you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising.

00:10:39.574 --> 00:10:42.159
When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago,

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:44.759
I did it simply by restricting those things,

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:48.215
which admittedly suggests I have a bias

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:50.576
based on my personal experience.

00:10:50.576 --> 00:10:53.231
But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong,

00:10:53.231 --> 00:10:57.184
and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically.

00:10:57.184 --> 00:11:00.291
But step one is accepting the possibility

00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:02.663
that our current beliefs about obesity,

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:05.669
diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong

00:11:05.669 --> 00:11:08.544
and therefore must be tested.

00:11:08.544 --> 00:11:10.935
I'm betting my career on this.

00:11:10.935 --> 00:11:15.060
Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.233
and I'll go wherever the science takes me.

00:11:18.233 --> 00:11:21.764
I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:24.808
is pretend I have the answers when I don't.

00:11:24.808 --> 00:11:28.916
I've been humbled enough by all I don't know.

00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:31.073
For the past year, I've been fortunate enough

00:11:31.073 --> 00:11:34.486
to work on this problem with the most amazing team

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:37.890
of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country,

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.195
and the best part is,

00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:43.094
just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals,

00:11:43.094 --> 00:11:44.590
we've done the same thing.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.853
We've recruited a team of scientific rivals,

00:11:47.853 --> 00:11:51.298
the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses

00:11:51.298 --> 00:11:52.912
for what's at the heart of this epidemic.

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:55.293
Some think it's too many calories consumed.

00:11:55.293 --> 00:11:57.672
Others think it's too much dietary fat.

00:11:57.672 --> 00:12:01.142
Others think it's too many refined grains and starches.

00:12:01.142 --> 00:12:03.750
But this team of multi-disciplinary,

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.734
highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers

00:12:06.734 --> 00:12:09.022
do agree on two things.

00:12:09.022 --> 00:12:12.671
First, this problem is just simply too important

00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:15.414
to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer.

00:12:15.414 --> 00:12:18.198
And two, if we're willing to be wrong,

00:12:18.198 --> 00:12:20.735
if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom

00:12:20.735 --> 00:12:23.798
with the best experiments science can offer,

00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:26.103
we can solve this problem.

00:12:26.103 --> 00:12:29.158
I know it's tempting to want an answer right now,

00:12:29.158 --> 00:12:33.655
some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription --

00:12:33.655 --> 00:12:35.384
eat this, not that —

00:12:35.384 --> 00:12:37.064
but if we want to get it right,

00:12:37.064 --> 00:12:39.298
we're going to have to do much more rigorous science

00:12:39.298 --> 00:12:42.151
before we can write that prescription.

00:12:42.151 --> 00:12:44.750
Briefly, to address this, our research program

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.993
is focused around three meta-themes, or questions.

00:12:47.993 --> 00:12:50.888
First, how do the various foods we consume

00:12:50.888 --> 00:12:53.689
impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes,

00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:56.507
and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms?

00:12:56.507 --> 00:12:58.757
Second, based on these insights,

00:12:58.757 --> 00:13:01.716
can people make the necessary changes in their diets

00:13:01.716 --> 00:13:05.447
in a way that's safe and practical to implement?

00:13:05.447 --> 00:13:08.456
And finally, once we identify what safe

00:13:08.456 --> 00:13:11.484
and practical changes people can make to their diet,

00:13:11.484 --> 00:13:15.159
how can we move their behavior in that direction

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:17.412
so that it becomes more the default

00:13:17.412 --> 00:13:19.268
rather than the exception?

00:13:19.268 --> 00:13:21.688
Just because you know what to do doesn't mean

00:13:21.688 --> 00:13:23.197
you're always going to do it.

00:13:23.197 --> 00:13:25.325
Sometimes we have to put cues around people

00:13:25.325 --> 00:13:27.628
to make it easier, and believe it or not,

00:13:27.628 --> 00:13:31.269
that can be studied scientifically.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.853
I don't know how this journey is going to end,

00:13:33.853 --> 00:13:38.066
but this much seems clear to me, at least:

00:13:38.066 --> 00:13:43.062
We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients

00:13:43.062 --> 00:13:45.974
like I did.

00:13:45.974 --> 00:13:48.253
Most of them actually want to do the right thing,

00:13:48.253 --> 00:13:51.622
but they have to know what that is,

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:54.668
and it's got to work.

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:59.364
I dream of a day when our patients can

00:13:59.364 --> 00:14:01.099
shed their excess pounds

00:14:01.099 --> 00:14:03.912
and cure themselves of insulin resistance,

00:14:03.912 --> 00:14:06.642
because as medical professionals,

00:14:06.642 --> 00:14:08.612
we've shed our excess mental baggage

00:14:08.612 --> 00:14:11.938
and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently

00:14:11.938 --> 00:14:15.028
to go back to our original ideals:

00:14:15.028 --> 00:14:19.445
open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas

00:14:19.445 --> 00:14:22.773
when they don't appear to be working,

00:14:22.773 --> 00:14:25.892
and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final,

00:14:25.892 --> 00:14:28.640
but constantly evolving.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.932
Staying true to that path will be better for our patients

00:14:31.932 --> 00:14:35.180
and better for science.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.174
If obesity is nothing more than a proxy

00:14:38.174 --> 00:14:40.100
for metabolic illness,

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:45.397
what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy?

00:14:45.397 --> 00:14:49.941
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.

00:14:49.941 --> 00:14:52.254
seven years ago.

00:14:52.254 --> 00:14:55.878
I wish I could speak with that woman again.

00:14:55.878 --> 00:14:59.133
I'd like to tell her how sorry I am.

00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:02.020
I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.680
the best clinical care I could,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.577
but as a human being,

00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:11.985
I let you down.

00:15:11.985 --> 00:15:16.230
You didn't need my judgment and my contempt.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.728
You needed my empathy and compassion,

00:15:20.728 --> 00:15:22.723
and above all else, you needed a doctor

00:15:22.723 --> 00:15:25.352
who was willing to consider

00:15:25.352 --> 00:15:28.416
maybe you didn't let the system down.

00:15:28.416 --> 00:15:31.634
Maybe the system, of which I was a part,

00:15:31.634 --> 00:15:34.073
was letting you down.

00:15:34.073 --> 00:15:36.874
If you're watching this now,

00:15:36.874 --> 00:15:41.112
I hope you can forgive me.

00:15:41.112 --> 00:15:45.112
(Applause)
