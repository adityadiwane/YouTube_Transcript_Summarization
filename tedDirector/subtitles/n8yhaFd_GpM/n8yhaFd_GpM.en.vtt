00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:17.113
Eight years ago, I was haunted
by an evil spirit.

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:22.306
I was 25 at the time,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.768
and I was living in a tiny house
behind someone else's house

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.087
in Los Angeles.

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.763
It was this guest house,
it had kind of been dilapidated,

00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:34.466
not taken care of for a long time.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.941
And one night, I was sitting there

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:42.467
and I got this really spooky feeling,

00:00:42.491 --> 00:00:45.509
kind of the feeling
like you're being watched.

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.552
But no one was there except my two dogs,

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.454
and they were just chewing their feet.

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:54.961
And I looked around. No one was there.

00:00:54.985 --> 00:00:59.206
And I thought, OK,
it's just my imagination.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.841
But the feeling just kept getting worse,

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:07.157
and I started to feel
this pressure in my chest,

00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:10.273
sort of like the feeling
when you get bad news.

00:01:10.297 --> 00:01:13.608
But it started to sink lower and lower

00:01:13.632 --> 00:01:15.025
and almost hurt.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.604
And over the course of that week,
this feeling got worse and worse,

00:01:19.628 --> 00:01:25.124
and I started to become convinced
that something was there

00:01:25.148 --> 00:01:28.312
in my little guest house, haunting me.

00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:32.958
And I started to hear these sounds,

00:01:32.982 --> 00:01:38.920
this "whoosh," kind of whisper,
like something passing through me.

00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:44.581
I called my best friend, Claire, and said,

00:01:45.398 --> 00:01:48.557
"I know this is going to sound crazy,

00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:50.645
but, um ...

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:55.648
I think there's a ghost in my house,
and I need to get rid of it."

00:01:55.672 --> 00:02:00.020
And she said -- she's very
open-minded -- and she said,

00:02:00.044 --> 00:02:01.549
"I don't think you're crazy.

00:02:01.573 --> 00:02:05.447
I think you just need
to do a cleansing ritual."

00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:07.252
(Laughter)

00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:12.701
"So get some sage and burn it,

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:15.223
and tell it to go away."

00:02:15.247 --> 00:02:18.909
So I said, "OK,"
and I went and I bought sage.

00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:22.994
I had never done this before,
so I set the sage on fire,

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:29.718
waved it about, and said, "Go away!
This is my house! I live here.

00:02:29.742 --> 00:02:31.376
You don't live here!"

00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:35.694
But the feeling stayed.
Nothing got better.

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:37.914
And then I started to think,

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:40.710
OK, well now this thing is probably
just laughing at me,

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:43.162
because it hasn't left,

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:46.411
and I probably just look like
this impotent, powerless thing

00:02:46.435 --> 00:02:48.670
that couldn't get it to go away.

00:02:48.694 --> 00:02:52.619
So every day I'd come home

00:02:52.643 --> 00:02:58.159
and you guys, this feeling got so bad
that -- I mean, I'm laughing at it now --

00:02:58.183 --> 00:03:02.260
but I would sit there in bed
and cry every night.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.159
And the feeling on my chest
got worse and worse.

00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:11.175
It was physically painful.

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.621
And I even went to a psychiatrist

00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:18.073
and tried to get her
to prescribe me medicine,

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:22.199
and she wouldn't just because
I don't have schizophrenia, OK.

00:03:22.223 --> 00:03:24.000
(Laughter)

00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:32.557
So finally I got on the internet,
and I Googled "hauntings."

00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:35.667
And I came upon this forum
of ghost hunters.

00:03:35.691 --> 00:03:38.023
But these were a special
kind of ghost hunters --

00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:39.591
they were skeptics.

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:45.185
They believed that every case of ghosts
that they had investigated so far

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.384
had been explained away by science.

00:03:47.408 --> 00:03:51.352
And I was like, "OK, smart guys,
this is what's happening to me,

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:55.451
and if you have an explanation for me,
I would love to hear it."

00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:58.685
And one of them said, "OK.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.795
Um, have you heard
of carbon monoxide poisoning?"

00:04:04.697 --> 00:04:09.159
And I said, "Yeah.

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:12.530
Like, gas poisoning?"

00:04:12.554 --> 00:04:15.533
Carbon monoxide poisoning
is when you have a gas leak

00:04:15.557 --> 00:04:17.000
leaking into your home.

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:22.852
I looked it up, and the symptoms
of carbon monoxide poisoning

00:04:22.876 --> 00:04:26.006
include a pressure on your chest,

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.428
auditory hallucinations -- whoosh --

00:04:30.452 --> 00:04:34.230
and an unexplained feeling of dread.

00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:38.053
So that night, I called the gas company.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:41.882
I said, "I have an emergency.
I need you to come out.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:45.176
I don't want to get into the story now,
but I need you to come out."

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.393
(Laughter)

00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:49.204
They came out. I said,
"I suspect a gas leak."

00:04:49.228 --> 00:04:51.744
They brought their carbon
monoxide detector,

00:04:51.768 --> 00:04:53.810
and the man said,

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:57.297
"It's a really good thing
that you called us tonight,

00:04:57.321 --> 00:04:59.734
because you could have been
dead very soon."

00:05:01.487 --> 00:05:06.854
Thirty-seven percent of Americans
believe in haunted houses,

00:05:06.878 --> 00:05:11.468
and I wonder how many of them
have been in one

00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:14.484
and how many of them have been in danger.

00:05:16.603 --> 00:05:21.336
So that haunting story
has led me to my job.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.258
I'm an investigator, and I'm
an investigator in two senses:

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:25.850
I'm an investigative journalist,

00:05:25.874 --> 00:05:29.060
and I'm also an investigator
of the claims of the paranormal

00:05:29.084 --> 00:05:31.080
and claims of the spiritual.

00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:32.612
And that means a few things.

00:05:32.636 --> 00:05:36.587
Sometimes that means that I'm pretending
to need an exorcism

00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:41.176
so I can get -- yes, that's right! --
so I can go to an exorcist

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.806
and see if he's using gimmicks
or psychological tricks

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.718
to try to convince someone
that they're possessed.

00:05:47.742 --> 00:05:51.064
Sometimes that means
I'm going undercover in a fringe group

00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:54.461
which I report on
for a podcast that I co-host.

00:05:54.485 --> 00:05:59.519
And I've done over 70 investigations
like this with my co-host, Ross.

00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:04.539
I would love to tell you
that nine times out of 10, science wins,

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:07.059
saves the day, it's all explained.

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:08.252
That's not true.

00:06:08.276 --> 00:06:14.492
The truth is, 10 times out of 10,
science wins, it saves the day.

00:06:14.516 --> 00:06:18.284
(Applause)

00:06:26.847 --> 00:06:29.528
And that doesn't mean
there's no such thing as a mystery.

00:06:29.552 --> 00:06:33.478
Of course there are mysteries,
but a mystery is a mystery.

00:06:33.502 --> 00:06:35.191
It is not a ghost.

00:06:36.286 --> 00:06:39.907
Now, I believe there are
two kinds of truth,

00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:44.282
and it's taken me a while to get
to this place, but I think this is right,

00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:45.570
so hear me out.

00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:48.749
I think there is outer truth
and there's inner truth.

00:06:48.773 --> 00:06:51.988
So if you say to me,

00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:54.685
"There was a man named Jesus
and he once existed,"

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:56.406
that's outer truth, right?

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.780
And we can go and look
at the historical record.

00:06:58.804 --> 00:07:01.215
We can determine
whether that seems to be true.

00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:03.778
And I would argue,
it does seem to be true.

00:07:03.802 --> 00:07:09.473
If you say, "Jesus rose
from the dead," -- ooh, trickier.

00:07:09.497 --> 00:07:11.724
(Laughter)

00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:19.200
I would say that's an outer-truth claim,

00:07:19.224 --> 00:07:21.262
because he physically rose or he didn't.

00:07:21.286 --> 00:07:24.012
I'm not going to get into
whether he rose or he didn't,

00:07:24.036 --> 00:07:26.114
but I would say
that's an outer-truth claim.

00:07:26.138 --> 00:07:27.832
It happened or it didn't happen.

00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:31.558
But if you say, "I don't care
whether he rose from the dead.

00:07:31.582 --> 00:07:33.926
It's symbolically important to me,

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.444
and that metaphor is so meaningful,
so purposeful to me,

00:07:37.468 --> 00:07:39.771
and I'm not going to try
to persuade you of it,"

00:07:39.795 --> 00:07:42.350
now you've moved it
from outer truth to inner truth,

00:07:42.374 --> 00:07:43.896
from science to art.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.084
And I think we have a tendency
to not be clear about this,

00:07:47.108 --> 00:07:50.520
to try to move our inner truths
to outer truths,

00:07:50.544 --> 00:07:53.447
or to not be fair about it to each other,

00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:55.835
and when people are telling us
their inner truths,

00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:59.470
to try to make them defend them
by outer-truth standards.

00:07:59.494 --> 00:08:03.010
So I'm talking here about outer truth,
about objective things.

00:08:03.034 --> 00:08:08.720
And there was an objective reality
in my haunted house, right?

00:08:08.744 --> 00:08:10.793
Now that I've told you about the gas leak,

00:08:10.817 --> 00:08:12.837
I doubt a single person here
would be like,

00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:14.835
"I still think there was a ghost, too" --

00:08:14.859 --> 00:08:15.899
(Laughter)

00:08:15.923 --> 00:08:18.670
because as soon as we have
these scientific explanations,

00:08:18.694 --> 00:08:20.356
we know to give up the ghost.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.390
We use these things as stopgaps
for things that we can't explain.

00:08:24.414 --> 00:08:26.415
We don't believe them because of evidence;

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.201
we believe them because
of a lack of evidence.

00:08:30.202 --> 00:08:32.566
So there is a group in Los Angeles

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.298
called the Independent
Investigations Group, or the IIG,

00:08:36.322 --> 00:08:38.302
and they do great work.

00:08:38.326 --> 00:08:41.029
They'll give a $10,000 prize

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:45.580
to anyone who can show,
under scientific conditions,

00:08:45.604 --> 00:08:47.959
that they have a paranormal ability.

00:08:47.983 --> 00:08:49.689
No one's done it yet,

00:08:49.713 --> 00:08:54.771
but they've had a couple people
who claim that they were clairaudients,

00:08:54.795 --> 00:08:58.851
which means that they can hear voices
either from the great beyond

00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:00.773
or they can read minds.

00:09:00.797 --> 00:09:03.557
And they had one person
who was very sincere,

00:09:03.581 --> 00:09:06.472
who believed that he could read minds.

00:09:06.565 --> 00:09:12.552
So they set up a test with him,
and this is the way it always works.

00:09:12.576 --> 00:09:14.822
The group says, "OK, we have a protocol,

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.861
we have a way to scientifically test this.

00:09:16.885 --> 00:09:18.038
Do you agree with it?"

00:09:18.062 --> 00:09:19.958
The person says yes. Then they test it.

00:09:19.982 --> 00:09:21.987
It's very important that both sides agree.

00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:24.426
They did that, they tested him.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.004
They said, "OK, you know what?

00:09:27.028 --> 00:09:30.870
You weren't able to predict
what Lisa was thinking.

00:09:30.894 --> 00:09:32.923
It matched up about the same as chance.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.789
Looks like you don't have the power."

00:09:34.813 --> 00:09:36.663
And that gave them the opportunity

00:09:36.687 --> 00:09:41.956
to compassionately sit down with him
and have a very difficult discussion,

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.949
which basically amounted to,

00:09:43.973 --> 00:09:48.536
"Hey, we know you're sincere,
and what that means is,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.839
you do hear something in your head."

00:09:50.917 --> 00:09:55.525
And that guy got to make
the very difficult decision,

00:09:55.583 --> 00:10:01.661
but really the life-changing decision
about whether to go get help.

00:10:01.728 --> 00:10:06.771
We're actually helping people
to make these connections

00:10:06.795 --> 00:10:12.105
that maybe before seemed like
otherworldly explanations,

00:10:12.129 --> 00:10:17.189
help draw us into reality
and maybe change our lives for the better.

00:10:18.293 --> 00:10:24.085
Now, on the other hand,
maybe one time it'll turn out to be true.

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:26.731
Maybe we'll find out there are ghosts,

00:10:26.755 --> 00:10:28.928
and holy shit, it will be the best thing!

00:10:28.952 --> 00:10:31.676
And every time I do
one of these investigations,

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.506
I still get so excited,

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.593
and I'm like 75 into them,

00:10:35.617 --> 00:10:39.694
and still I swear on number 76,
I'm going to be like, "This is the one!"

00:10:39.718 --> 00:10:40.923
(Laughter)

00:10:40.947 --> 00:10:45.803
Maybe I'm just eternally optimistic,
but I hope I never lose this hope,

00:10:45.827 --> 00:10:49.602
and I invite you to take
this same attitude

00:10:49.626 --> 00:10:52.069
when people share
their outer beliefs with you.

00:10:52.093 --> 00:10:54.560
When talking about testable claims,

00:10:54.584 --> 00:10:58.263
respect them enough to ask
these good questions.

00:10:58.287 --> 00:11:01.149
Challenge and see
how you can examine them together,

00:11:01.173 --> 00:11:05.342
because there's this idea
that you can't respect a belief

00:11:05.366 --> 00:11:07.916
and still challenge it,
but that's not true.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.687
When we jiggle the lock,
when we test the claim,

00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:14.683
we're saying, OK, I respect you,
I'm listening to what you're saying,

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:16.699
I'm going to test it out with you.

00:11:16.723 --> 00:11:20.078
We've all had that experience
where you're telling someone something,

00:11:20.102 --> 00:11:22.833
and they're like, "Oh,
that's really interesting, yeah,"

00:11:22.857 --> 00:11:24.980
you know you're being had.

00:11:25.004 --> 00:11:28.294
But when someone says, "Really? Huh.

00:11:29.413 --> 00:11:31.803
Sounds a little sketchy to me,
but I'm listening,"

00:11:31.827 --> 00:11:34.484
you at least know
you're being engaged and respected.

00:11:34.508 --> 00:11:37.624
And that's the kind of attitude
we should have with these claims.

00:11:37.648 --> 00:11:40.355
That's showing someone
that you care what they're saying.

00:11:40.379 --> 00:11:43.315
That's respect.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:50.729
Now, yes, most of these searches
will come up empty,

00:11:50.753 --> 00:11:52.586
but that's how all of science works.

00:11:52.983 --> 00:11:57.084
Every cure for cancer so far
has not panned out,

00:11:57.108 --> 00:11:59.440
but we don't stop looking,

00:11:59.464 --> 00:12:00.994
for two reasons.

00:12:01.018 --> 00:12:03.496
Because number one, the answer matters.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.542
Whether it's looking at the afterlife
or the paranormal or the cure for cancer,

00:12:07.566 --> 00:12:09.899
it all amounts to the same question:

00:12:09.923 --> 00:12:12.602
How long will we be here?

00:12:13.785 --> 00:12:17.569
And two, because looking for the truth,

00:12:17.593 --> 00:12:18.902
being open-minded,

00:12:18.926 --> 00:12:23.295
and being willing to be wrong
and to change your whole worldview

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:25.367
is awe-inspiring.

00:12:26.138 --> 00:12:29.951
I still get excited at ghost stories
every single time.

00:12:29.975 --> 00:12:33.059
I still consider that every group
I join might be right,

00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:35.080
and I hope I never lose that hope.

00:12:35.104 --> 00:12:36.908
Let's all never lose that hope,

00:12:36.932 --> 00:12:39.787
because searching for what's out there

00:12:39.811 --> 00:12:41.725
helps us understand what's in here.

00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:48.918
And also, please have
a carbon monoxide detector in your home.

00:12:49.982 --> 00:12:51.261
Thank you.

00:12:51.285 --> 00:12:56.249
(Applause)
