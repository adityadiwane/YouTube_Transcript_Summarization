00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.223
Along the ancient path
of the Monongahela River,

00:00:17.223 --> 00:00:22.981
Braddock, Pennsylvania sits
in the eastern region of Allegheny County,

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.348
approximately nine miles
outside of Pittsburgh.

00:00:28.488 --> 00:00:30.829
An industrial suburb,

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.570
Braddock is home
to Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.238
the Edgar Thomson Works.

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:39.560
Operating since 1875,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.738
it is the last functioning
steel mill in the region.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.101
For 12 years, I have produced
collaborative portraits,

00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:54.373
still lifes, landscapes and aerial views

00:00:54.373 --> 00:00:59.724
in order to build a visual archive
to address the intersection

00:00:59.724 --> 00:01:01.571
of the steel industry,

00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:03.429
the environment,

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:10.071
and the health care system's impact
on the bodies of my family and community.

00:01:11.277 --> 00:01:14.644
The tradition and grand
narrative of Braddock

00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:20.439
is mostly comprised of stories
of industrialists and trade unions.

00:01:20.727 --> 00:01:25.027
Currently, the new narrative
about Braddock,

00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:28.564
a poster child for Rust Belt
revitalization,

00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:33.548
is a story of urban pioneers
discovering a new frontier.

00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:40.131
Mass media has omitted the fact
that Braddock is predominantly black.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:46.640
Our existence has been co-opted,
silenced and erased.

00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:51.967
Fourth generation in a lineage of women,

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:56.657
I was raised under the protection
and care of Grandma Ruby,

00:01:56.657 --> 00:02:01.032
off 8th Street
at 805 Washington Avenue.

00:02:01.562 --> 00:02:06.120
She worked as a manager for Goodwill.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.814
Mom was a nurse's aid.

00:02:08.814 --> 00:02:15.161
She watched the steel mills close
and white flight to suburban developments.

00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:19.332
By the time my generation
walked the streets,

00:02:19.332 --> 00:02:24.586
disinvestment at the local,
state and federal level,

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:26.483
eroded infrastructure,

00:02:26.483 --> 00:02:32.764
and the War on Drugs
dismantled my family and community.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.305
Grandma Ruby's stepfather Gramps

00:02:36.305 --> 00:02:40.994
was one of few black men to retire
from Carnegie's mill with his pension.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.201
He worked in high temperatures,

00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:48.930
tearing down and rebuilding furnaces,
cleaning up spilt metal and slag.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:56.039
The history of a place is written
on the body and the landscape.

00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:00.244
Areas of heavy truck traffic,

00:03:00.244 --> 00:03:04.609
exposure to benzene and atomized metals,

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.742
risk cancer and lupus.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.847
One hundred twenty-three licensed beds,
652 employees,

00:03:15.847 --> 00:03:20.349
rehabilitation programs decimated.

00:03:23.486 --> 00:03:27.363
A housing discrimination lawsuit
against Allegheny County

00:03:27.363 --> 00:03:33.215
removed where the projects
Talbot Towers once stood.

00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:38.957
Recent rezoning for more light industry
has since appeared.

00:03:39.568 --> 00:03:45.595
Google Maps and Google Earth pixelations
conceal the flammable waste

00:03:45.595 --> 00:03:50.890
being used to squeeze the Bunn family
off their home and land.

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.545
In 2013, I chartered a helicopter

00:03:57.545 --> 00:04:03.101
with my cameras to document
this aggressive dispossession.

00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:10.252
In flight, my observation reveals
thousands of plastic white bundles

00:04:10.252 --> 00:04:13.728
owned by a conservation industry

00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:15.981
that claims it's eco-friendly

00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:18.697
and recycles millions of tires

00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:21.484
to preserve people's lives

00:04:21.484 --> 00:04:24.560
and to improve people's lives.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.461
My work spirals from the micro
to the macro level,

00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.688
excavating hidden histories.

00:04:33.688 --> 00:04:36.196
Recently, at the Seattle Art Museum,

00:04:36.196 --> 00:04:40.166
Isaac Bunn and I mounted this exhibition,

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:46.133
and the exhibition was used
as a platform to launch his voice.

00:04:46.133 --> 00:04:49.820
Through reclamation of our narrative,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.319
we will continue to fight historic erasure
and socioeconomic inequality.

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:58.370
Thank you.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.400
(Applause)
