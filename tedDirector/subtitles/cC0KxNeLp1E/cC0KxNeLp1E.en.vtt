00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Hi.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
(Laughter)

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I did that for two reasons.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
First of all, I wanted to give you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
a good visual first impression.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
But the main reason I did it is that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
that's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
a Lady Gaga skanky mic.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
(Laughter)

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.260
I'm used to a stationary mic.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
It's the sensible shoe of public address.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.260
(Laughter)

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
But you clamp this thing on my head, and something happens.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
I just become skanky.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.260
(Laughter) So I'm sorry about that.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And I'm already off-message.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
(Laughter)

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I have devoted the past 25 years of my life

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
to designing books.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
("Yes, BOOKS. You know, the bound volumes with ink on paper.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
You cannot turn them off with a switch.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Tell your kids.")

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.260
It all sort of started as a benign mistake,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
like penicillin. (Laughter)

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
What I really wanted

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
was to be a graphic designer

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
at one of the big design firms in New York City.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
But upon arrival there,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.260
in the fall of 1986, and doing a lot of interviews,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
I found that the only thing I was offered

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
a book publisher.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Now I was stupid,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
but not so stupid that I turned it down.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
I had absolutely no idea

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
what I was about to become part of,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and I was incredibly lucky.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Soon, it had occurred to me what my job was.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
My job was to ask this question:

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.260
"What do the stories look like?"

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Because that is what Knopf is.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
It is the story factory, one of the very best in the world.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
We bring stories to the public.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
The stories can be anything,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and some of them are actually true.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.260
But they all have one thing in common:

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
They all need to look like something.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
They all need a face.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Why? To give you a first impression

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
of what you are about to get into.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.260
A book designer gives form to content,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
but also

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
manages a very careful balance between the two.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Now, the first day

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
of my graphic design training at Penn State University,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
the teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and wrote the word "Apple" underneath,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
and he said, "OK. Lesson one. Listen up."

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And he covered up the picture and he said,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
"You either say this," and then he covered up the word,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
"or you show this.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
But you don't do this."

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Because this is treating your audience like a moron.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
(Laughter)

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
And they deserve better.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And lo and behold, soon enough,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
I was able to put this theory to the test

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
on two books that I was working on for Knopf.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.260
The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
Now the Hepburn book

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
was written in a very conversational style,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
The Dietrich book was an observation

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
by her daughter; it was a biography.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
So the Hepburn story is words

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and the Dietrich story is pictures, and so we did this.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
So there you are.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Pure content and pure form, side by side.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
No fighting, ladies.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
("What's a Jurassic Park?")

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Now, what is the story here?

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Someone

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
is re-engineering dinosaurs

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
by extracting their DNA

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
from prehistoric amber.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Genius!

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.260
(Laughter)

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Now, luckily for me,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
I live and work in New York City,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
where there are plenty of dinosaurs.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
(Laughter)

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.260
So,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
I went to the Museum of Natural History,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.260
and I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.260
and I bought a book.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And I was particularly taken with this page of the book,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and more specifically the lower right-hand corner.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Now I took this diagram,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and I put it in a Photostat machine,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.260
(Laughter)

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and I took a piece of tracing paper,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and I taped it over the Photostat

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I'm going too fast --

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.260
(Laughter) --

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and then I took a Rapidograph pen --

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
explain it to the youngsters --

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
(Laughter)

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
I had no idea what I was doing,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
I had no idea where I was going,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
but at some point, I stopped --

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.260
when to keep going would seem like I was going too far.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.260
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.260
of us seeing this animal coming into being.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
We're in the middle of the process.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And then I just threw some typography on it.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Very basic stuff,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
slightly suggestive of public park signage.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.260
(Laughter)

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Everybody in house loved it,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and so off it goes to the author.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
And even back then,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Michael was on the cutting edge.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.260
("Michael Crichton responds by fax:")

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
("Wow! Fucking Fantastic Jacket")

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:58.260
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.260
That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
(Laughter)

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
I miss Michael.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
And sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
calls our legal department to see if they can

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
maybe look into buying the rights to the image,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
just in case they might want to use it.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Well, they used it.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.260
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And I was thrilled.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
We all know it was an amazing movie,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and it was so interesting to see it

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.260
go out into the culture and become this phenomenon

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and to see all the different permutations of it.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
But not too long ago,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
I came upon this on the Web.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
No, that is not me.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
But whoever it is,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
I can't help but thinking they woke up one day like,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
"Oh my God, that wasn't there last night. Ooooohh!

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
I was so wasted."

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
(Laughter)

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
But if you think about it, from my head

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
to my hands to his leg.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.260
(Laughter)

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
That's a responsibility.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
And it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
The book designer's responsibility is threefold:

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.260
to the reader, to the publisher and, most of all, to the author.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
I want you to look at the author's book

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
and say, "Wow! I need to read that."

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and the title essay

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
And the reason he went is because

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
he had a fear of his body image,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
and he wanted to explore what was underlying that.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
For me, it was simply an excuse to design a book

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
that you could literally take the pants off of.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
But when you do,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
you don't get what you expect.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
You get something that goes much deeper than that.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.260
And David especially loved this design

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
because at book signings, which he does a lot of,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
he could take a magic marker and do this.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:20.260
(Laughter)

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
Hello!

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
(Laughter)

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
called ["Dry"], and it's about his time in rehab.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:37.260
In his 20s, he was a hotshot ad executive,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and as Mad Men has told us, a raging alcoholic.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
He did not think so, however,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
but his coworkers did an intervention and they said,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.260
"You are going to rehab, or you will be fired and you will die."

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Now to me, this was always going to be a typographic solution,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
what I would call the opposite of Type 101.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
What does that mean?

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
you get the assignment of, select a word

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
and make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type 101, right?

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Very simple stuff.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
This is going to be the opposite of that.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
I want this book to look like it's lying to you,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.260
desperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.260
I set up the type, I printed it out on an Epson printer

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
with water-soluble ink, taped it to the wall

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and threw a bucket of water at it. Presto!

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Then when we went to press,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
the printer put a spot gloss on the ink

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
and it really looked like it was running.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
Not long after it came out, Augusten was waylaid in an airport

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
and he was hiding out in the bookstore

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
spying on who was buying his books.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
And this woman came up to it,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and she squinted, and she took it to the register,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
and she said to the man behind the counter, "This one's ruined."

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.260
(Laughter)

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.260
And the guy behind the counter said, "I know, lady. They all came in that way."

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.260
(Laughter)

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
Now, that's a good printing job.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
A book cover

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
is a distillation.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
It is a haiku,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
if you will, of the story.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
This particular story

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
by Osama Tezuka

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
is his epic life of the Buddha,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
and it's eight volumes in all. But the best thing is

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.260
when it's on your shelf, you get a shelf life

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.260
of the Buddha, moving from one age to the next.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
All of these solutions

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.260
derive their origins from the text of the book,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
but once the book designer has read the text,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
then he has to be an interpreter

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and a translator.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
This story was a real puzzle.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
This is what it's about.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
("Intrigue and murder among 16th century Ottoman court painters.")

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
(Laughter)

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.260
All right, so I got a collection of the paintings together

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
and I looked at them and I deconstructed them

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
and I put them back together.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
And so, here's the design, right?

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
And so here's the front and the spine, and it's flat.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.260
Ahh! We come upon them,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
the clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.260
Huhh! They've been discovered by the sultan.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
He will not be pleased.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
Huhh! And now the sultan is in danger.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
And now, we have to open it up

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
to find out what's going to happen next.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Try experiencing that on a Kindle.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:02.260
(Laughter)

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Don't get me started.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Seriously.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Much is to be gained by eBooks:

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
ease, convenience, portability.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
But something is definitely lost: tradition,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:23.260
a sensual experience, the comfort of thingy-ness --

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
a little bit of humanity.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
Do you know what John Updike used to do

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
the first thing when he would get a copy

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
of one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf?

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
He'd smell it.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.260
Then he'd run his hand over the rag paper,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:48.260
All those years, all those books, he never got tired of it.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Now, I am all for the iPad,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.260
but trust me -- smelling it will get you nowhere.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
(Laughter)

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
Now the Apple guys are texting,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
"Develop odor emission plug-in."

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.260
(Laughter)

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
And the last story I'm going to talk about is quite a story.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
A woman

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
negotiating down a spiral staircase

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
she can't help but feel that, all of a sudden,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
she's entered a new reality

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
that's just slightly different from the one that she left,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
but very similar, but different.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
And so, we're talking about parallel planes of existence,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.260
sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
So how do we show this?

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.260
We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich, but now we merge them.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.260
So we're talking about different planes, different pieces of paper.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
It's one part of the form and content.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
When it's on top of the paper board,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
which is the opposite, it forms this.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.260
So even if you don't know anything about this book,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
you are forced to consider a single person

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
straddling two planes of existence.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:19.260
And the object itself invited exploration

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:24.260
interaction, consideration

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
and touch.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
This debuted at number two

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
on the New York Times Best Seller list.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
This is unheard of,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
both for us the publisher, and the author.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
We're talking a 900-page book

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
that is as weird as it is compelling,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
and featuring a climactic scene

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
in which a horde of tiny people

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
and cause a German Shepherd to explode.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:55.260
(Laughter)

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
Not exactly Jackie Collins.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
eight printings, and still going strong.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
So even though we love publishing as an art,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
we very much know it's a business too,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
that great art can be great business.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
So that's my story. To be continued.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
What does it look like?

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:27.260
Yes. It can, it does and it will,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
but for this book designer,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
page-turner,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
dog-eared place-holder,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
notes in the margins-taker,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
ink-sniffer,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.260
the story looks like this.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
Thank you.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
(Applause)
