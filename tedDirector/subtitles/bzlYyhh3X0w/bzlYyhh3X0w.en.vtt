00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.496
I'm here today to talk to you
about a very powerful little word,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.055
one that people will do almost anything

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.360
to avoid becoming.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.536
Billion-dollar industries thrive

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.336
because of the fear of it,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.536
and those of us who undeniably are it

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.896
are left to navigate a relentless storm

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.120
surrounding it.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.856
I'm not sure if any of you have noticed,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.240
but I'm fat.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.576
Not the lowercase,
muttered-behind-my-back kind,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.976
or the seemingly harmless
chubby or cuddly.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.600
I'm not even the more sophisticated
voluptuous or curvaceous kind.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.696
Let's not sugarcoat it.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.576
I am the capital F-A-T kind of fat.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200
I am the elephant in the room.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.576
When I walked out on stage,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.296
some of you may have been thinking,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.736
"Aww, this is going to be hilarious,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.376
because everybody knows
that fat people are funny."

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.416
(Laughter)

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.575
Or you may have been thinking,
"Where does she get her confidence from?"

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.920
Because a confident fat woman
is almost unthinkable.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.016
The fashion-conscious
members of the audience

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.696
may have been thinking how fabulous I look

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.296
in this Beth Ditto dress --

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.536
(Cheers)

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.456
thank you very much.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.376
Whereas some of you might have thought,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.056
"Hmm, black would have been
so much more slimming."

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.336
(Laughter)

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.856
You may have wondered, consciously or not,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.816
if I have diabetes, or a partner,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.056
or if I eat carbs after 7pm.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.336
(Laughter)

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.296
You may have worried
that you ate carbs after 7pm last night,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.040
and that you really should renew
your gym membership.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.576
These judgments are insidious.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.176
They can be directed
at individuals and groups,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.760
and they can also
be directed at ourselves.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.560
And this way of thinking
is known as fatphobia.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.216
Like any form of systematic oppression,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.896
fatphobia is deeply rooted
in complex structures

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.976
like capitalism, patriarchy and racism,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.776
and that can make it
really difficult to see,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.080
let alone challenge.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.256
We live in a culture

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.256
where being fat
is seen as being a bad person --

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.096
lazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.600
and morally suspect.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.016
And we tend to see thinness

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.240
as being universally good --

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.056
responsible, successful,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.440
and in control of our appetites,
bodies and lives.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.576
We see these ideas again and again

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.536
in the media, in public health policy,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.176
doctors' offices,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.376
in everyday conversations

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.080
and in our own attitudes.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.856
We may even blame fat people themselves

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.456
for the discrimination they face

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.176
because, after all, if we don't like it,
we should just lose weight.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.440
Easy.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.856
This antifat bias has become
so integral, so ingrained

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.416
to how we value ourselves and each other

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.176
that we rarely question why
we have such contempt for people of size

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.040
and where that disdain comes from.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.896
But we must question it,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.096
because the enormous value
we place on how we look

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.240
affects every one of us.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.536
And do we really want to live in a society

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.496
where people are denied
their basic humanity

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.480
if they don't subscribe
to some arbitrary form of acceptable?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.936
So when I was six years old,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.496
my sister used to teach ballet
to a bunch of little girls in our garage.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.720
I was about a foot taller and a foot wider
than most of the group.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.536
When it came to doing
our first performance,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.176
I was so excited
about wearing a pretty pink tutu.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.720
I was going to sparkle.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.936
As the other girls slipped easily
into their Lycra and tulle creations,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.840
not one of the tutus
was big enough to fit me.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.856
I was determined not to be
excluded from the performance,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.696
so I turned to my mother

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.656
and loud enough for everyone to hear

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.296
said, "Mom, I don't need a tutu.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.496
I need a fourfour."

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.720
(Laughter)

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.976
Thanks, Mom.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.536
(Applause)

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.976
And although I didn't
recognize it at the time,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.256
claiming space for myself
in that glorious fourfour

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.160
was the first step towards becoming
a radical fat activist.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.696
Now, I'm not saying
that this whole body-love thing

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.976
has been an easy skip along
a glittering path of self-acceptance

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.896
since that day in class.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.120
Far from it.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.936
I soon learned that living outside
what the mainstream considers normal

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.800
can be a frustrating and isolating place.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.336
I've spent the last 20 years unpacking
and deprogramming these messages,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.080
and it's been quite the roller coaster.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.896
I've been openly laughed at,
abused from passing cars

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.560
and been told that I'm delusional.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.856
I also receive smiles from strangers

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.696
who recognize what it takes
to walk down the street

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.296
with a spring in your step
and your head held high.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.656
(Cheer)

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.016
Thanks.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.096
And through it all, that fierce
little six-year-old has stayed with me,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.976
and she has helped me
stand before you today

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.016
as an unapologetic fat person,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.136
a person that simply refuses to subscribe

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.576
to the dominant narrative

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.296
about how I should move
through the world in this body of mine.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.120
(Applause)

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.520
And I'm not alone.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.576
I am part of an international
community of people

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.216
who choose to, rather
than passively accepting

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.176
that our bodies are
and probably always will be big,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.520
we actively choose to flourish
in these bodies as they are today.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.056
People who honor our strength
and work with, not against,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.456
our perceived limitations,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.296
people who value health

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.776
as something much more holistic

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.976
than a number on an outdated BMI chart.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.096
Instead, we value mental health,
self-worth and how we feel in our bodies

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.600
as vital aspects
to our overall well-being.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.776
People who refuse to believe
that living in these fat bodies

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.640
is a barrier to anything, really.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.656
There are doctors, academics and bloggers

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.856
who have written countless volumes

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.040
on the many facets
of this complex subject.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.616
There are fatshionistas
who reclaim their bodies and their beauty

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.576
by wearing fatkinis and crop tops,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.520
exposing the flesh
that we're all taught to hide.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.776
There are fat athletes

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.776
who run marathons,
teach yoga or do kickboxing,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.560
all done with a middle finger
firmly held up to the status quo.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.056
And these people have taught me
that radical body politics

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.360
is the antidote
to our body-shaming culture.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.456
But to be clear, I'm not saying
that people shouldn't change their bodies

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.960
if that's what they want to do.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.576
Reclaiming yourself can be one
of the most gorgeous acts of self-love

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.200
and can look like
a million different things,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.696
from hairstyles to tattoos
to body contouring

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.800
to hormones to surgery
and yes, even weight loss.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.616
It's simple: it's your body,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.080
and you decide what's best to do with it.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.816
My way of engaging in activism

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.936
is by doing all the things
that we fatties aren't supposed to do,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.496
and there's a lot of them,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.720
inviting other people to join me
and then making art about it.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.776
The common thread
through most of this work

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.456
has been reclaiming spaces that are
often prohibitive to bigger bodies,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.416
from the catwalk to club shows,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.000
from public swimming pools
to prominent dance stages.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.416
And reclaiming spaces en masse
is not only a powerful artistic statement

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.000
but a radical community-building approach.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.936
This was so true of "AQUAPORKO!" --

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.896
(Laughter)

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.536
the fat fem synchronized swim team

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.000
I started with a group
of friends in Sydney.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.776
The impact of seeing
a bunch of defiant fat women

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.015
in flowery swimming caps and bathers

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:48.856
throwing their legs in the air
without a care

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.000
should not be underestimated.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.640
(Laughter)

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:02.016
Throughout my career, I have learned
that fat bodies are inherently political,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.136
and unapologetic fat bodies

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.040
can blow people's minds.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.736
When director Kate Champion,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.736
of acclaimed dance theater
company Force Majeure,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.216
asked me to be the artistic associate

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.536
on a work featuring all fat dancers,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.680
I literally jumped at the opportunity.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.200
And I mean literally.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.896
"Nothing to Lose" is a work made
in collaboration with performers of size

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.496
who drew from their lived experiences

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.056
to create a work as varied
and authentic as we all are.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.320
And it was as far from ballet
as you could imagine.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.936
The very idea of a fat dance work
by such a prestigious company

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.056
was, to put it mildly, controversial,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:56.096
because nothing like it had ever been done
on mainstream dance stages before

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.960
anywhere in the world.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.960
People were skeptical.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.376
"What do you mean, 'fat dancers?'

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.800
Like, size 10, size 12 kind of fat?

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.896
Where did they do their dance training?

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.480
Are they going to have the stamina
for a full-length production?"

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.696
But despite the skepticism,

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.816
"Nothing to Lose" became
a sellout hit of Sydney Festival.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.176
We received rave reviews, toured,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.736
won awards and were written about
in over 27 languages.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.200
These incredible images of our cast
were seen worldwide.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.976
I've lost count of how many times
people of all sizes

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.096
have told me that the show
has changed their lives,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.136
how it helped them
shift their relationship

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.496
to their own and other people's bodies,

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.280
and how it made them confront
their own bias.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.776
But of course, work
that pushes people's buttons

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.000
is not without its detractors.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.296
I have been told
that I'm glorifying obesity.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.816
I have received violent death threats

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.296
and abuse for daring to make work
that centers fat people's bodies and lives

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.840
and treats us as worthwhile human beings
with valuable stories to tell.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.616
I've even been called

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.576
"the ISIS of the obesity epidemic" --

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.296
(Laughter)

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.880
a comment so absurd that it is funny.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.776
But it also speaks to the panic,

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.776
the literal terror,

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.880
that the fear of fat can evoke.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.976
It is this fear that's feeding
the diet industry,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.776
which is keeping so many of us
from making peace with our own bodies,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.096
for waiting to be the after-photo

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.376
before we truly start to live our lives.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.200
Because the real elephant
in the room here is fatphobia.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.536
Fat activism refuses to indulge this fear.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.856
By advocating for self-determination
and respect for all of us,

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.816
we can shift society's reluctance
to embrace diversity

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.840
and start to celebrate the myriad ways
there are to have a body.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.736
Thank you.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.156
(Applause)
