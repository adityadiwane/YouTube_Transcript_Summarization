00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.360
Why bother?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.800
The game is rigged.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.440
My vote won't count.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.960
The choices are terrible.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.080
Voting is for suckers.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.416
Perhaps you've thought
some of these things.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.869
Perhaps you've even said them.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.960
And if so, you wouldn't be alone,
and you wouldn't be entirely wrong.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.056
The game of public policy today
is rigged in many ways.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.056
How else would more than half
of federal tax breaks

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.560
flow up to the wealthiest
five percent of Americans?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.600
And our choices indeed are often terrible.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.536
For many people
across the political spectrum,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.720
Exhibit A is the 2016
presidential election.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.296
But in any year, you can look
up and down the ballot

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.000
and find plenty to be uninspired about.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.976
But in spite of all this,
I still believe voting matters.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.896
And crazy as it may sound,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.160
I believe we can revive the joy of voting.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.320
Today, I want to talk
about how we can do that, and why.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.256
There used to be a time
in American history when voting was fun,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.480
when it was much more than just
a grim duty to show up at the polls.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.496
That time is called
"most of American history."

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.936
(Laughter)

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.936
From the Revolution
to the Civil Rights Era,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.536
the United States had a vibrant,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.800
robustly participatory
and raucous culture of voting.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.616
It was street theater, open-air debates,
fasting and feasting and toasting,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.696
parades and bonfires.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.256
During the 19th century,
immigrants and urban political machines

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.040
helped fuel this culture of voting.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.920
That culture grew with each
successive wave of new voters.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.976
During Reconstruction,
when new African-American voters,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.720
new African-American citizens,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.576
began to exercise their power,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.816
they celebrated in jubilee parades

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.200
that connected emancipation
with their newfound right to vote.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.840
A few decades later, the suffragettes

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.776
brought a spirit
of theatricality to their fight,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.920
marching together in white dresses
as they claimed the franchise.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.216
And the Civil Rights Movement,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.015
which sought to redeem
the promise of equal citizenship

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.039
that had been betrayed by Jim Crow,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.277
put voting right at the center.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.736
From Freedom Summer to the march in Selma,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.976
that generation of activists
knew that voting matters,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.096
and they knew that spectacle
and the performance of power

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.080
is key to actually claiming power.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.080
But it's been over a half century
since Selma and the Voting Rights Act,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.856
and in the decades since,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.176
this face-to-face culture of voting

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.176
has just about disappeared.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.136
It's been killed by television

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.696
and then the internet.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.016
The couch has replaced the commons.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.016
Screens have made
citizens into spectators.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.336
And while it's nice to share
political memes on social media,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.520
that's a rather quiet kind of citizenship.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.200
It's what the sociologist Sherry Turkle
calls "being alone together."

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.816
What we need today

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.696
is an electoral culture
that is about being together together,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.936
in person,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.176
in loud and passionate ways,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.456
so that instead of being
"eat your vegetables" or "do you duty,"

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.456
voting can feel more like "join the club"

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.160
or, better yet, "join the party."

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.696
Imagine if we had,
across the country right now,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.656
in local places but nationwide,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.336
a concerted effort
to revive a face-to-face set of ways

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.880
to engage and electioneer:

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.456
outdoor shows in which candidates
and their causes are mocked

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.176
and praised in broad satirical style;

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.120
soapbox speeches by citizens;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.160
public debates held inside pubs;

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.656
streets filled with political art
and handmade posters and murals;

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.720
battle of the band concerts in which
competing performers rep their candidates.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.416
Now, all of this may sound
a little bit 18th century to you,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.776
but in fact, it doesn't have to be
any more 18th century

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.016
than, say, Broadway's "Hamilton,"

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.040
which is to say vibrantly contemporary.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.640
And the fact is that all around the world,

00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:23.256
today, millions of people
are voting like this.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.536
In India, elections are colorful,
communal affairs.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.320
In Brazil, election day
is a festive, carnival-type atmosphere.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:35.456
In Taiwan and Hong Kong,
there is a spectacle,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.736
eye-popping, eye-grabbing spectacle

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.040
to the street theater of elections.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.456
You might ask, well,
here in America, who has time for this?

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.736
And I would tell you

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.840
that the average American
watches five hours of television a day.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.536
You might ask, who has the motivation?

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.776
And I'll tell you,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.936
any citizen who wants to be seen and heard

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.256
not as a prop, not as a talking point,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.600
but as a participant, as a creator.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.080
Well, how do we make this happen?

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.320
Simply by making it happen.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.776
That's why a group of colleagues and I

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.880
launched a new project
called "The Joy of Voting."

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.336
In four cities across the United States --

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.016
Philadelphia, Miami,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.496
Akron, Ohio, and Wichita, Kansas --

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.456
we've gathered together
artists and activists,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.216
educators, political folks,
neighbors, everyday citizens

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.976
to come together and create projects

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.560
that can foster this culture
of voting in a local way.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.296
In Miami, that means
all-night parties with hot DJs

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.654
where the only way to get in
is to show that you're registered to vote.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.176
In Akron, it means political plays

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.736
being performed
in the bed of a flatbed truck

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.880
that moves from neighborhood
to neighborhood.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.176
In Philadelphia,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.136
it's a voting-themed scavenger hunt
all throughout colonial old town.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.176
And in Wichita, it's making
mixtapes and live graffiti art

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.000
in the North End to get out the vote.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.256
There are 20 of these projects,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.136
and they are remarkable
in their beauty and their diversity,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.736
and they are changing people.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.816
Let me tell you about a couple of them.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.816
In Miami, we've commissioned and artist,

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.856
a young artist named Atomico,

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.120
to create some vivid and vibrant images
for a new series of "I voted" stickers.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.400
But the thing is, Atomico had never voted.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.776
He wasn't even registered.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.296
So as he got to work on creating
this artwork for these stickers,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.456
he also began to get over
his sense of intimidation about politics.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.096
He got himself registered,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.416
and then he got educated
about the upcoming primary election,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.736
and on election day he was out there
not just passing out stickers,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.336
but chatting up voters
and encouraging people to vote,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.640
and talking about
the election with passersby.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.496
In Akron, a theater company
called the Wandering Aesthetics

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.296
has been putting on
these pickup truck plays.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.096
And to do so, they put out
an open call to the public

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.616
asking for speeches,
monologues, dialogues, poems,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.976
snippets of anything
that could be read aloud

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.560
and woven into a performance.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.040
They got dozens of submissions.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.616
One of them was a poem

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.776
written by nine students in an ESL class,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.936
all of them Hispanic migrant workers

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.320
from nearby Hartville, Ohio.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.000
I want to read to you from this poem.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.760
It's called "The Joy of Voting."

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.016
"I would like to vote for the first time

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.080
because things are changing for Hispanics.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.136
I used to be afraid of ghosts.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.400
Now I am afraid of people.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.280
There's more violence and racism.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.400
Voting can change this.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.320
The border wall is nothing.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.000
It's just a wall.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.640
The wall of shame is something.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.696
It's very important to vote

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.080
so we can break down this wall of shame.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.880
I have passion in my heart.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.520
Voting gives me a voice and power.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.720
I can stand up and do something."

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.896
"The Joy of Voting" project
isn't just about joy.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.456
It's about this passion.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.816
It's about feeling and belief,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.040
and it isn't just our organization's work.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.496
All across this country right now,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.896
immigrants, young people, veterans,
people of all different backgrounds

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.416
are coming together to create
this kind of passionate, joyful activity

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.856
around elections,

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.816
in red and blue states,
in urban and rural communities,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.936
people of every political background.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.656
What they have in common is simply this:

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.200
their work is rooted in place.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.080
Because remember,
all citizenship is local.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.256
When politics becomes
just a presidential election,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.880
we yell and we scream at our screens,
and then we collapse, exhausted.

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:49.296
But when politics is about us

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.096
and our neighbors
and other people in our community

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.480
coming together to create experiences
of collective voice and imagination,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.880
then we begin to remember
that this stuff matters.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.000
We begin to remember
that this is the stuff of self-government.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.080
Which brings me back to where I began.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.080
Why bother?

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.545
There's one way to answer this question.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.640
Voting matters because it is
a self-fulfilling act of belief.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.840
It feeds the spirit of mutual interest
that makes any society thrive.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.616
When we vote, even if it is in anger,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.600
we are part of a collective,
creative leap of faith.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.360
Voting helps us generate
the very power that we wish we had.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.056
It's no accident
that democracy and theater

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.480
emerged around the same time
in ancient Athens.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.440
Both of them yank the individual
out of the enclosure of her private self.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.080
Both of them create great
public experiences of shared ritual.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.736
Both of them bring the imagination to life

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.056
in ways that remind us
that all of our bonds in the end

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.920
are imagined, and can be reimagined.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.960
This moment right now,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.216
when we think about
the meaning of imagination,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.440
is so fundamentally important,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.656
and our ability to take that spirit

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.256
and to take that sense

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.336
that there is something greater out there,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.136
is not just a matter
of technical expertise.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.216
It's not just a matter of making the time
or having the know-how.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.520
It is a matter of spirit.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.656
But let me give you an answer
to this question, "Why bother?"

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.120
that is maybe a little less spiritual
and a bit more pointed.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.216
Why bother voting?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.136
Because there is
no such thing as not voting.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.976
Not voting is voting,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.896
for everything that you
may detest and oppose.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.656
Not voting can be dressed up

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.696
as an act of principled,
passive resistance,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.656
but in fact not voting

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.896
is actively handing power over

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.256
to those whose interests
are counter to your own,

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.816
and those who would be very glad
to take advantage of your absence.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.160
Not voting is for suckers.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.496
Imagine where this country would be

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.616
if all the folks who in 2010
created the Tea Party

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.576
had decided that,
you know, politics is too messy,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.856
voting is too complicated.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.680
There is no possibility
of our votes adding up to anything.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.616
They didn't preemptively
silence themselves.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.416
They showed up,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.800
and in the course of showing up,
they changed American politics.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.256
Imagine if all of the followers
of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.976
had decided not to upend
the political status quo

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.056
and blow apart the frame
of the previously possible

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.696
in American politics.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.680
They did that by voting.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.376
We live in a time right now,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.936
divided, often very dark,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.576
where across the left and the right,
there's a lot of talk of revolution

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.680
and the need for revolution
to disrupt everyday democracy.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.736
Well, here's the thing:

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.760
everyday democracy already
gives us a playbook for revolution.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.816
In the 2012 presidential election,

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.576
young voters, Latino voters,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.856
Asian-American voters, low-income voters,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.400
all showed up at less than 50 percent.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.256
In the 2014 midterm elections,
turnout was 36 percent,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.960
which was a 70-year low.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.816
And in your average local election,

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.200
turnout hovers
somewhere around 20 percent.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.560
I invite you to imagine 100 percent.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.360
Picture 100 percent.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.216
Mobilize 100 percent,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.480
and overnight, we get revolution.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.056
Overnight, the policy priorities
of this country change dramatically,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.616
and every level of government
becomes radically more responsive

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.920
to all the people.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.800
What would it take
to mobilize 100 percent?

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.016
Well, we do have to push back
against efforts afoot

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.776
all across the country right now

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.000
to make voting harder.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.976
But at the same time,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.136
we have to actively create
a positive culture of voting

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.776
that people want to belong to,

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.336
be part of, and experience together.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.976
We have to make purpose.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.320
We have to make joy.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.816
So yes, let's have that revolution,

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.336
a revolution of spirit, of ideas,

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.376
of policy and participation,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.536
a revolution against cynicism,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.000
a revolution against the self-fulfilling
sense of powerlessness.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.856
Let's vote this revolution into existence,

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.216
and while we're at it,

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.776
let's have some fun.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.016
Thank you very much.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.320
(Applause)
