00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:17.664
When I was 11,

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:22.226
I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:24.697
My father was listening to BBC News

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:28.871
on his small, gray radio.

00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:31.747
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then,

00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:35.718
because the news mostly depressed him.

00:00:35.718 --> 00:00:40.603
"The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted.

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:43.191
I didn't know what it meant,

00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:48.377
but I could see that my father was very, very happy.

00:00:48.377 --> 00:00:56.888
"You can go to a real school now," he said.

00:00:56.888 --> 00:01:02.057
A morning that I will never forget.

00:01:02.057 --> 00:01:07.225
A real school.

00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:10.333
You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.856
and made it illegal for girls to go to school.

00:01:13.856 --> 00:01:16.964
So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy

00:01:16.964 --> 00:01:19.475
to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:24.889
to be outside alone, to a secret school.

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:29.514
It was the only way we both could be educated.

00:01:29.514 --> 00:01:32.748
Each day, we took a different route

00:01:32.748 --> 00:01:36.771
so that no one would suspect where we were going.

00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:38.965
We would cover our books in grocery bags

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:45.101
so it would seem we were just out shopping.

00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:47.477
The school was in a house,

00:01:47.477 --> 00:01:53.140
more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.990
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.511
We all knew we were risking our lives --

00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:05.865
the teacher, the students and our parents.

00:02:05.865 --> 00:02:08.238
From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled

00:02:08.238 --> 00:02:12.154
for a week because Taliban were suspicious.

00:02:12.154 --> 00:02:14.934
We always wondered what they knew about us.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.966
Were we being followed?

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:21.498
Do they know where we live?

00:02:21.498 --> 00:02:24.156
We were scared,

00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:31.082
but still, school was where we wanted to be.

00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:34.822
I was very lucky to grow up in a family

00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:41.069
where education was prized and daughters were treasured.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.220
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.699
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan,

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.195
he insisted that his daughter, my mom,

00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:59.608
go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.

00:02:59.608 --> 00:03:03.118
But my educated mother became a teacher.

00:03:03.118 --> 00:03:06.144
There she is.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.811
She retired two years ago, only to turn our house

00:03:08.811 --> 00:03:14.189
into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.577
And my father -- that's him --

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:25.478
he was the first ever in his family to receive an education.

00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:27.587
There was no question that his children

00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:32.676
would receive an education, including his daughters,

00:03:32.676 --> 00:03:37.096
despite the Taliban, despite the risks.

00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:45.442
To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.

00:03:45.442 --> 00:03:48.570
During Taliban years, I remember

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.663
there were times I would get so frustrated by our life

00:03:53.663 --> 00:03:57.615
and always being scared and not seeing a future.

00:03:57.615 --> 00:04:00.669
I would want to quit,

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.805
but my father,

00:04:03.805 --> 00:04:06.314
he would say,

00:04:06.314 --> 00:04:08.419
"Listen, my daughter,

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.735
you can lose everything you own in your life.

00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:15.940
Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.721
But the one thing that will always remain with you

00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:22.029
is what is here,

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.945
and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees,

00:04:26.945 --> 00:04:30.166
we will.

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:35.248
So do you still not want to continue?"

00:04:35.248 --> 00:04:38.376
Today I am 22.

00:04:38.376 --> 00:04:41.146
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:44.316
by decades of war.

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:49.457
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school,

00:04:49.457 --> 00:04:51.922
and had my family not been so committed to my education,

00:04:51.922 --> 00:04:54.526
I would be one of them.

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:59.841
Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:09.854
(Applause)

00:05:09.854 --> 00:05:12.802
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather,

00:05:12.802 --> 00:05:17.381
the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters,

00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:20.875
was among the first to congratulate me.

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:23.505
He not only brags about my college degree,

00:05:23.505 --> 00:05:25.714
but also that I was the first woman,

00:05:25.714 --> 00:05:27.436
and that I am the first woman

00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:30.938
to drive him through the streets of Kabul.

00:05:30.938 --> 00:05:36.300
(Applause)

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.949
My family believes in me.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.899
I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:48.366
That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10,

00:05:48.366 --> 00:05:51.130
a global campaign to educate women.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.709
That's why I cofounded SOLA,

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:56.176
the first and perhaps only boarding school

00:05:56.176 --> 00:05:57.905
for girls in Afghanistan,

00:05:57.905 --> 00:06:03.542
a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.

00:06:03.542 --> 00:06:07.307
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school

00:06:07.307 --> 00:06:12.935
with ambition grabbing at opportunity.

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:15.862
And I see their parents and their fathers

00:06:15.862 --> 00:06:20.440
who, like my own, advocate for them,

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:29.372
despite and even in the face of daunting opposition.

00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:32.078
Like Ahmed. That's not his real name,

00:06:32.078 --> 00:06:34.706
and I cannot show you his face,

00:06:34.706 --> 00:06:38.351
but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.

00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:42.187
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter

00:06:42.187 --> 00:06:45.521
were on their way from SOLA to their village,

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:52.014
and they literally missed being killed

00:06:52.014 --> 00:06:56.796
by a roadside bomb by minutes.

00:06:56.796 --> 00:07:00.199
As he arrived home, the phone rang,

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.894
a voice warning him

00:07:02.894 --> 00:07:06.289
that if he sent his daughter back to school,

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:09.066
they would try again.

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:12.968
"Kill me now, if you wish," he said,

00:07:12.968 --> 00:07:16.862
"but I will not ruin my daughter's future

00:07:16.862 --> 00:07:21.694
because of your old and backward ideas."

00:07:21.694 --> 00:07:24.063
What I've come to realize about Afghanistan,

00:07:24.063 --> 00:07:27.583
and this is something that is often dismissed in the West,

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:30.806
that behind most of us who succeed

00:07:30.806 --> 00:07:38.169
is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:42.796
and who sees that her success is his success.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:46.734
It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.

00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:51.270
In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.610
of a bright future for their daughters,

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.021
but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan,

00:07:58.021 --> 00:08:01.441
we must have the support of men.

00:08:01.441 --> 00:08:04.991
Under the Taliban, girls who went to school

00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:06.783
numbered in the hundreds --

00:08:06.783 --> 00:08:09.121
remember, it was illegal.

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:14.613
But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.

00:08:14.613 --> 00:08:21.860
(Applause)

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:28.011
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.

00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:32.983
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes.

00:08:32.983 --> 00:08:36.033
I fear that these changes will not last

00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:40.525
much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal.

00:08:40.525 --> 00:08:44.178
But when I am back in Afghanistan,

00:08:44.178 --> 00:08:48.963
when I see the students in my school

00:08:48.963 --> 00:08:51.603
and their parents who advocate for them,

00:08:51.603 --> 00:08:56.070
who encourage them, I see a promising future

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.370
and lasting change.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:07.837
To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities,

00:09:07.837 --> 00:09:11.249
and every single day

00:09:11.249 --> 00:09:14.657
the girls of SOLA remind me of that.

00:09:14.657 --> 00:09:17.864
Like me, they are dreaming big.

00:09:17.864 --> 00:09:19.575
Thank you.

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:30.452
(Applause)
