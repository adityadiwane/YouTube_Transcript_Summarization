00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:15.811
We're going to share
a lot of secrets today, you and I,

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:18.291
and in doing so, I hope that we can lift

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:20.915
some of the shame
many of us feel about sex.

00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:26.395
How many here have ever been
catcalled by a stranger?

00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:29.635
Lots of women.

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:33.178
For me, the time I remember best

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:36.562
is when that stranger
was a student of mine.

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:40.531
He came up to me after class that night

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:43.411
and his words confirmed
what I already knew:

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:45.211
"I am so sorry, professor.

00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:49.131
If I had known it was you,
I would never have said those things."

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:51.451
(Laughter)

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:55.555
I wasn't a person to him
until I was his professor.

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:59.091
This concept, called objectification,

00:00:59.115 --> 00:01:01.171
is the foundation of sexism,

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:04.715
and we see it reinforced
through every aspect of our lives.

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:09.851
We see it in the government

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:13.291
that refuses to punish men

00:01:13.315 --> 00:01:15.051
for raping women.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.371
We see it in advertisements.

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:19.403
How many of you have seen an advertisement

00:01:19.427 --> 00:01:24.795
that uses a woman's breast
to sell an entirely unrelated product?

00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:30.291
Or movie after movie after movie

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:33.195
that portrays women
as only love interests?

00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:37.811
These examples might seem
inconsequential and harmless,

00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:39.091
but they're insidious,

00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:43.395
slowly building into a culture
that refuses to see women as people.

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:48.145
We see this in the school
that sends home a 10-year-old girl

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:51.811
because her clothes were
a distraction to boys trying to learn,

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:57.011
or the government that refuses
to punish men for raping women

00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:58.611
over and over,

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:00.091
or the woman who is killed

00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:04.195
because she asked a man to stop
grinding on her on the dance floor.

00:02:07.515 --> 00:02:12.275
Media plays a large role in perpetuating
the objectification of women.

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:16.211
Let's consider
the classic romantic comedy.

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:20.131
We're typically introduced
to two kinds of women in these movies,

00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:22.891
two kinds of desirable women, anyway.

00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:25.331
The first is the sexy bombshell.

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:29.011
This is the unbelievably gorgeous woman
with the perfect body.

00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:31.651
Our leading man
has no trouble identifying her

00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:34.035
and even less trouble having sex with her.

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:36.611
The second is our leading lady,

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:40.491
the beautiful but demure woman
our leading man falls in love with

00:02:40.515 --> 00:02:42.651
despite not noticing her at first

00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:45.275
or not liking her if he did.

00:02:45.835 --> 00:02:47.851
The first is the slut.

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.891
She is to be consumed and forgotten.

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:51.195
She is much too available.

00:02:51.795 --> 00:02:55.451
The second is desirable but modest,

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.931
and therefore worthy
of our leading man's future babies.

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:00.155
Marriage material.

00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:03.691
We're actually told
that women have two roles,

00:03:03.715 --> 00:03:07.955
but these two roles have a difficult time
existing within the same woman.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:12.211
On the rare occasion
that I share with a new acquaintance

00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:13.971
that I study sex,

00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:16.371
if they don't end
the conversation right then,

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:18.395
they're usually pretty intrigued.

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:21.091
"Oh. Tell me more."

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:22.315
So I do.

00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:26.811
"I'm really interested
in studying the sexual behaviors

00:03:26.835 --> 00:03:28.611
of pregnant and postpartum couples."

00:03:28.635 --> 00:03:32.171
At this point I get
a different kind of response.

00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:34.171
(Laughter)

00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:35.995
"Oh. Huh.

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.875
Do pregnant people even have sex?

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:44.011
Have you thought
about studying sexual desire

00:03:44.035 --> 00:03:45.371
or orgasms?

00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:48.395
That would be interesting, and sexy."

00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:52.651
Tell me. What are the first words
that come to mind

00:03:52.675 --> 00:03:54.475
when you picture a pregnant woman?

00:03:55.275 --> 00:03:58.691
I asked this question
in a survey of over 500 adults,

00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:02.291
and most responded with "belly" or "round"

00:04:02.315 --> 00:04:04.355
and "cute."

00:04:05.035 --> 00:04:06.651
This didn't surprise me too much.

00:04:06.675 --> 00:04:08.315
What else do we label as cute?

00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:12.331
Babies. Puppies. Kittens.

00:04:12.355 --> 00:04:14.011
The elderly. Right?

00:04:14.035 --> 00:04:15.755
(Laughter)

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.707
When we label an adult as cute, though,

00:04:19.731 --> 00:04:22.211
we take away a lot of their intelligence,

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:23.435
their complexity.

00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:26.675
We reduce them to childlike qualities.

00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:29.211
I also asked heterosexual men

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:32.371
to imagine a woman that they're
partnered with is pregnant,

00:04:32.395 --> 00:04:35.171
and then asked women
to imagine that they are pregnant,

00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:37.811
and then tell me
the first words that come to mind

00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:39.875
when they imagine having sex.

00:04:40.955 --> 00:04:43.035
Most of the responses were negative.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.669
"Gross."

00:04:45.693 --> 00:04:47.066
"Awkward."

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.531
"Not sexy." "Odd."

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:50.755
"Uncomfortable."

00:04:51.235 --> 00:04:52.491
"How?"

00:04:52.515 --> 00:04:54.515
(Laughter)

00:04:55.315 --> 00:04:58.411
"Not worth the trouble."
"Not worth the risk."

00:04:58.435 --> 00:05:00.435
That last one really stuck with me.

00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:06.451
We might think that because we divorce
pregnant women and moms from sexuality,

00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:11.491
we are removing the constraints
of sexual objectification.

00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:13.555
They experience less sexism. Right?

00:05:14.235 --> 00:05:15.811
Not exactly.

00:05:15.835 --> 00:05:18.955
What happens instead
is a different kind of objectification.

00:05:19.755 --> 00:05:22.011
In my efforts to explain this to others,

00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:25.811
one conversation
led to the Venus of Willendorf,

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:30.651
a Paleolithic figurine scholars assumed
was a goddess of love and beauty,

00:05:30.675 --> 00:05:32.115
hence the name Venus.

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:34.651
This theory was later revised, though,

00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:38.371
when scholars noted
the sculptor's obvious focus

00:05:38.395 --> 00:05:41.811
on the figurine's reproductive features:

00:05:41.835 --> 00:05:45.091
large breasts,
considered ideal for nursing;

00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:47.731
a round, possibly pregnant belly;

00:05:47.755 --> 00:05:51.235
the remnants of red dye,
alluding to menstruation or birth.

00:05:52.555 --> 00:05:56.090
They also assumed that she was
meant to be held or placed lying down

00:05:56.114 --> 00:06:00.491
because her tiny feet
don't allow her to be freestanding.

00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:01.995
She also had no face.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:06.891
For this reason, it was assumed
that she was a representation of fertility

00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:09.771
and not a portrait of a person.

00:06:09.795 --> 00:06:11.075
She was an object.

00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:13.491
In the history of her interpretation,

00:06:13.515 --> 00:06:16.651
she went from object
of ideal beauty and love

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:18.515
to object of reproduction.

00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:21.811
I think this transition speaks more

00:06:21.835 --> 00:06:25.611
about the scholars
who have interpreted her purpose

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:29.635
than the actual purpose
of the figurine herself.

00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:32.451
When a woman becomes pregnant,

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:36.211
she leaves the realm
of men's sexual desire

00:06:36.235 --> 00:06:40.811
and slides into her reproductive
and child-rearing role.

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:43.451
In doing so, she also becomes

00:06:43.475 --> 00:06:45.251
the property of the community,

00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:49.755
considered very important
but only because she's pregnant. Right?

00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:52.811
I've taken to calling this
the Willendorf effect,

00:06:52.835 --> 00:06:56.515
and once again we see it reinforced
in many aspects of her life.

00:06:57.218 --> 00:06:59.731
Has anyone here
ever been visibly pregnant?

00:06:59.755 --> 00:07:00.971
(Laughter)

00:07:00.995 --> 00:07:02.251
Yeah. Lots of you, right?

00:07:02.275 --> 00:07:06.411
So how many of you ever had a stranger
touch your belly during pregnancy,

00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:09.771
maybe without even asking
your permission first?

00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:12.531
Or told what you can and cannot eat

00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:16.171
by somebody who is not your doctor,
your medical care provider?

00:07:16.195 --> 00:07:19.115
Or asked private questions
about your birth plan?

00:07:20.075 --> 00:07:22.875
And then told why
those choices are all wrong?

00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:24.771
Yeah, me too.

00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:29.051
Or had a server refuse
to bring you a glass of wine?

00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:31.811
This one might give you pause,
I know, but stay with me.

00:07:31.835 --> 00:07:33.931
This is a huge secret.

00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:37.875
It is actually safe to drink
in moderation during pregnancy.

00:07:38.515 --> 00:07:40.051
Many of us don't know this

00:07:40.075 --> 00:07:43.811
because doctors don't trust
pregnant women with this secret --

00:07:43.835 --> 00:07:45.595
(Laughter)

00:07:49.355 --> 00:07:53.611
especially if she's less educated
or a woman of color.

00:07:53.635 --> 00:07:55.371
What this tells us is,

00:07:55.395 --> 00:07:59.611
this Willendorf effect,
it's also classist and racist.

00:07:59.635 --> 00:08:05.531
It's present when
the government reminds women

00:08:05.555 --> 00:08:08.211
with every new anti-choice bill

00:08:08.235 --> 00:08:11.091
that the contents of her uterus
are not her own,

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.171
or when an ob-gyn says,

00:08:13.195 --> 00:08:15.491
"While it's safe
to have sex during pregnancy,

00:08:15.515 --> 00:08:16.851
sometimes you never know.

00:08:16.875 --> 00:08:18.515
Better safe than sorry, right?"

00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:23.651
She's denied basic privacy
and bodily autonomy

00:08:23.675 --> 00:08:25.675
under the guise of "be a good mother."

00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:28.595
We don't trust her
to make her own decisions.

00:08:29.115 --> 00:08:30.715
She's cute, remember?

00:08:33.795 --> 00:08:36.091
When we tell women

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:39.051
that sexual pleasure -- excuse me.

00:08:39.075 --> 00:08:43.891
When we tell women that sex
isn't worth the risk during pregnancy,

00:08:43.915 --> 00:08:48.171
what we're telling her is that
her sexual pleasure doesn't matter.

00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:51.491
So what we are telling her
is that she in fact doesn't matter,

00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:56.235
even though the needs of her fetus
are not at odds with her own needs.

00:08:57.195 --> 00:08:59.451
So medical providers,

00:08:59.475 --> 00:09:02.451
such as the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:07.371
have the opportunity to educate
about the safety of sex during pregnancy.

00:09:07.395 --> 00:09:08.795
So what do the experts say?

00:09:09.755 --> 00:09:12.251
ACOG actually has
no public official statement

00:09:12.275 --> 00:09:15.435
about the safety of sex during pregnancy.

00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:19.091
Guidance from the Mayo Clinic
is generally positive

00:09:19.115 --> 00:09:21.611
but presented with a caveat:

00:09:21.635 --> 00:09:24.786
"Although most women can safely
have sex throughout pregnancy,

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.931
sometimes it's best to be cautious."

00:09:26.955 --> 00:09:30.051
Some women don't want
to have sex during pregnancy,

00:09:30.075 --> 00:09:31.331
and that's OK.

00:09:31.355 --> 00:09:33.971
Some women do want
to have sex during pregnancy,

00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:35.411
and that's OK, too.

00:09:35.435 --> 00:09:38.091
What needs to stop
is society telling women

00:09:38.115 --> 00:09:40.435
what they can and cannot do
with their bodies.

00:09:41.475 --> 00:09:43.595
(Applause)

00:09:48.035 --> 00:09:52.691
Pregnant women are not faceless,
identity-less vessels of reproduction

00:09:52.715 --> 00:09:54.835
who can't stand on their own two feet.

00:09:56.115 --> 00:09:58.531
But the truth is, the real secret is,

00:09:58.555 --> 00:10:02.811
we tell all women that
their sexual pleasure doesn't matter.

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:06.051
We refuse to even acknowledge
that women who have sex with women

00:10:06.075 --> 00:10:08.395
or women who don't
want children even exist.

00:10:08.835 --> 00:10:10.531
"Oh, it's just a phase ...

00:10:10.555 --> 00:10:12.875
she just needs the right man
to come along."

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.491
Every time a woman has sex

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:18.491
simply because it feels good,

00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:20.251
it is revolutionary.

00:10:20.275 --> 00:10:22.451
She is revolutionary.

00:10:22.475 --> 00:10:25.051
She is pushing back
against society's insistence

00:10:25.075 --> 00:10:27.291
that she exist simply for men's pleasure

00:10:27.315 --> 00:10:28.635
or for reproduction.

00:10:30.435 --> 00:10:34.411
A woman who prioritizes
her sexual needs is scary,

00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:39.571
because a woman who prioritizes
her sexual needs prioritizes herself.

00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:43.371
(Applause)

00:10:43.395 --> 00:10:47.811
That is a woman demanding
that she be treated as an equal.

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:49.371
That is a woman who insists

00:10:49.395 --> 00:10:52.731
that you make room for her
at the table of power,

00:10:52.755 --> 00:10:54.651
and that is the most terrifying of all

00:10:54.675 --> 00:10:57.491
because we can't make room for her

00:10:57.515 --> 00:11:01.035
without some of us giving up
the extra space we hold.

00:11:02.835 --> 00:11:05.035
(Applause)

00:11:08.475 --> 00:11:10.115
I have one last secret for you.

00:11:10.955 --> 00:11:12.811
I am the mother of two boys

00:11:12.835 --> 00:11:14.835
and we could use your help.

00:11:15.315 --> 00:11:20.011
Even though my boys hear me say regularly

00:11:20.035 --> 00:11:23.571
that it's important for men
to recognize women as equals

00:11:23.595 --> 00:11:26.131
and they see their father modeling this,

00:11:26.155 --> 00:11:30.275
we need what happens in the world
to reinforce what happens in our home.

00:11:30.595 --> 00:11:33.891
This is not a men's problem
or a women's problem.

00:11:33.915 --> 00:11:35.491
This is everyone's problem,

00:11:35.515 --> 00:11:39.915
and we all play a role
in dismantling systems of inequality.

00:11:40.515 --> 00:11:43.131
For starters, we have got
to stop telling women

00:11:43.155 --> 00:11:45.571
what they can and cannot do
with their bodies.

00:11:45.595 --> 00:11:48.635
(Applause)

00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:54.131
This includes not treating pregnant women
like community property.

00:11:54.155 --> 00:11:57.851
If you don't know her,
don't even ask to touch her belly.

00:11:57.875 --> 00:11:59.571
You wouldn't anybody else.

00:11:59.595 --> 00:12:01.731
Don't tell her
what she can and cannot eat.

00:12:01.755 --> 00:12:04.771
Don't ask her private details
about her medical decisions.

00:12:04.795 --> 00:12:06.691
This also includes understanding

00:12:06.715 --> 00:12:09.291
that even if you are
personally against abortion,

00:12:09.315 --> 00:12:11.995
you can still fight
for a woman's right to choose.

00:12:12.515 --> 00:12:16.275
When it comes to women's equality,
the two need not oppose one another.

00:12:16.995 --> 00:12:19.251
If you're somebody who has sex with women,

00:12:19.275 --> 00:12:20.771
prioritize her pleasure.

00:12:20.795 --> 00:12:23.195
If you don't know how, ask.

00:12:24.075 --> 00:12:25.571
If you have children --

00:12:25.595 --> 00:12:27.531
(Laughter)

00:12:27.555 --> 00:12:31.331
have conversations about sex
as early as possible,

00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:35.731
because kids don't look up s-e-x
in the dictionary anymore.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.395
They look it up on the internet.

00:12:38.355 --> 00:12:41.035
And when you're having
those conversations about sex,

00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:43.731
don't center them on reproduction only.

00:12:43.755 --> 00:12:45.411
People have sex for many reasons,

00:12:45.435 --> 00:12:47.211
some because they want a baby,

00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:50.171
but most of us have sex
because it feels good.

00:12:50.195 --> 00:12:51.395
Admit it.

00:12:52.795 --> 00:12:55.371
And regardless of whether
you have children or not,

00:12:55.395 --> 00:12:59.651
support comprehensive sex education
that doesn't shame our teenagers.

00:12:59.675 --> 00:13:02.355
(Applause)

00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:10.731
Nothing positive comes from shaming teens

00:13:10.755 --> 00:13:13.355
for their sexual desires, behaviors,

00:13:14.155 --> 00:13:17.635
other than positive STD
and pregnancy tests.

00:13:18.635 --> 00:13:21.691
Every single day,
we are all given the opportunity

00:13:21.715 --> 00:13:24.435
to disrupt patterns of inequality.

00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:28.475
I think we can all agree
that it's worth the trouble to do so.

00:13:29.235 --> 00:13:30.451
Thank you.

00:13:30.475 --> 00:13:37.431
(Applause)
