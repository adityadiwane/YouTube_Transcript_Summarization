00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I have a doppelganger.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
(Laughter)

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Dr. Gero is a brilliant

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
but slightly mad scientist

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
in the "Dragonball Z: Android Saga."

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
If you look very carefully,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
you see that his skull has been replaced

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
with a transparent Plexiglas dome

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
so that the workings of his brain can be observed

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and also controlled with light.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
That's exactly what I do --

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
optical mind control.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
(Laughter)

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
But in contrast to my evil twin

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
who lusts after world domination,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
my motives are not sinister.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
I control the brain

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
in order to understand how it works.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
Now wait a minute, you may say,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
how can you go straight to controlling the brain

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
without understanding it first?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Isn't that putting the cart before the horse?

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Many neuroscientists agree with this view

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and think that understanding will come

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
from more detailed observation and analysis.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
They say, "If we could record the activity of our neurons,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
we would understand the brain."

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
But think for a moment what that means.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Even if we could measure

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
what every cell is doing at all times,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
we would still have to make sense

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
of the recorded activity patterns,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and that's so difficult,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
chances are we'll understand these patterns

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
just as little as the brains that produce them.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Take a look at what brain activity might look like.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
In this simulation, each black dot

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
is one nerve cell.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
The dot is visible

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
There's 10,000 neurons here.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
So you're looking at roughly one percent

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
of the brain of a cockroach.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Your brains are about 100 million times

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
more complicated.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Somewhere, in a pattern like this,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
is you,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
your perceptions,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
your emotions, your memories,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
your plans for the future.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
But we don't know where,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
since we don't know how to read the pattern.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
We don't understand the code used by the brain.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
To make progress,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
we need to break the code.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
But how?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
An experienced code-breaker will tell you

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
it's essential to be able to play with them,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
to rearrange them at will.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
So in this situation too,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
to decode the information

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
contained in patterns like this,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
watching alone won't do.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
We need to rearrange the pattern.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
In other words,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
instead of recording the activity of neurons,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
we need to control it.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
It's not essential that we can control

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
The more targeted our interventions, the better.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And I'll show you in a moment

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
how we can achieve the necessary precision.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
will at once unravel all its mysteries.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
But we'll certainly learn a lot.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Now, I'm by no means

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
the first person to realize

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
how powerful a tool intervention is.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
The history of attempts

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
to tinker with the function of the nervous system

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
is long and illustrious.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
It dates back at least 200 years,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
to Galvani's famous experiments

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
in the late 18th century and beyond.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
when he connected the lumbar nerve

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
to a source of electrical current.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
This experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
nugget of the neural code:

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
that information is written in the form

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
of electrical impulses.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Galvani's approach

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
of probing the nervous system with electrodes

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
has remained state-of-the-art until today,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
despite a number of drawbacks.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
It's hard to do in animals that run around,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and there is a physical limit

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
to the number of wires

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
that can be inserted simultaneously.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
So around the turn of the last century,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
I started to think,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
"Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and turn it upside down?"

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
So instead of inserting a wire

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
into one spot of the brain,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
re-engineer the brain itself

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
so that some of its neural elements

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
such as a flash of light.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
overcome many of the obstacles to discovery.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
First, it's clearly a non-invasive,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
wireless form of communication.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And second, just as in a radio broadcast,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
you can communicate with many receivers at once.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
You don't need to know where these receivers are,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and it doesn't matter if these receivers move --

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
just think of the stereo in your car.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
It gets even better,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
out of materials that are encoded in DNA.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
So each nerve cell

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
with the right genetic makeup

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
will spontaneously produce a receiver

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that allows us to control its function.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
I hope you'll appreciate

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
the beautiful simplicity

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
of this concept.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
There's no high-tech gizmos here,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
just biology revealed through biology.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
Now let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
we see that its outer membrane

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
is studded with microscopic pores.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Pores like these conduct electrical current

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and are responsible

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
for all the communication in the nervous system.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
But these pores here are special.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
They are coupled to light receptors

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
similar to the ones in your eyes.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and the neuron fires electrical impulses.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
we can achieve incredible precision.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
This is because,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
although each cell in our bodies

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
contains the same set of genes,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
different mixes of genes get turned on and off

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
in different cells.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
You can exploit this to make sure

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
that only some neurons

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
contain our light-activated pore and others don't.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
in the upper-left corner

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
does not respond to light

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
because it lacks the light-activated pore.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
The approach works so well

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
that we can write purely artificial messages

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
directly to the brain.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
In this example, each electrical impulse,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
each deflection on the trace,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
is caused by a brief pulse of light.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
And the approach, of course, also works

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
in moving, behaving animals.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
This is the first ever such experiment,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
It was done six or seven years ago

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
by my then graduate student, Susana Lima.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.260
so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
expressed the light-activated pore.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
You're familiar with these cells

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
because they are the ones that frustrate you

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
when you try to swat the fly.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
and fly away whenever you move your hand in position.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
but it can't actually take off

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
to a flash it could see,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Susana did a simple

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
but brutally effective experiment.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
She cut the heads off of her flies.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
These headless bodies can live for about a day,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
but they don't do much.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
They just stand around

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and groom excessively.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
(Laughter)

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
Anyway, as you'll see in a moment,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
Susana was able to turn on the flight motor

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and get some of the headless bodies

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
to actually take off and fly away.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
They didn't get very far, obviously.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Since we took these first steps,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
the field of optogenetics has exploded.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
And there are now hundreds of labs

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
using these approaches.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And we've come a long way

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
since Galvani's and Susana's first successes

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
in making animals twitch or jump.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
We can now actually interfere with their psychology

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
in rather profound ways,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
as I'll show you in my last example,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
which is directed at a familiar question.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Life is a string of choices

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
We cope with this pressure by having brains,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and within our brains, decision-making centers

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
that I've called here the "Actor."

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
The Actor implements a policy that takes into account

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
the state of the environment

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
and the context in which we operate.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
Our actions change the environment, or context,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
Now to put some neurobiological meat

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
on this abstract model,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
we constructed a simple one-dimensional world

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
for our favorite subject, fruit flies.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Each chamber in these two vertical stacks

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
contains one fly.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
The left and the right halves of the chamber

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
are filled with two different odors,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
and a security camera watches

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
as the flies pace up and down between them.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
Here's some such CCTV footage.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
where the two odor streams meet,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
it has to make a decision.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
It has to decide whether to turn around

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
and stay in the same odor,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
or whether to cross the midline

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and try something new.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
These decisions are clearly a reflection

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
of the Actor's policy.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
Now for an intelligent being like our fly,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
this policy is not written in stone

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
but rather changes as the animal learns from experience.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
We can incorporate such an element

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
of adaptive intelligence into our model

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
by assuming that the fly's brain

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
contains not only an Actor,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
but a different group of cells,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
a "Critic," that provides a running commentary

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
on the Actor's choices.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
You can think of this nagging inner voice

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
as sort of the brain's equivalent

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
of the Catholic Church,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
if you're an Austrian like me,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
or the super-ego, if you're Freudian,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
or your mother, if you're Jewish.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.260
(Laughter)

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
Now obviously,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
the Critic is a key ingredient

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
in what makes us intelligent.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
So we set out to identify

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
the cells in the fly's brain

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
that played the role of the Critic.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
And the logic of our experiment was simple.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
We thought if we could use our optical remote control

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
to activate the cells of the Critic,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
into changing its policy.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
In other words,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
the fly should learn from mistakes

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
that it thought it had made

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
but, in reality, it had not made.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
So we bred flies

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
whose brains were more or less randomly peppered

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
with cells that were light addressable.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
And then we took these flies

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
and allowed them to make choices.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
And whenever they made one of the two choices,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
chose one odor,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
in this case the blue one over the orange one,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
we switched on the lights.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
If the Critic was among the optically activated cells,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
the result of this intervention

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
should be a change in policy.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
The fly should learn to avoid

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
the optically reinforced odor.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Here's what happened in two instances:

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
We're comparing two strains of flies,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
each of them having

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
shown here in green on the left and on the right.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
What's common among these groups of cells

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
But the identities of the individual

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
dopamine-producing neurons

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
are clearly largely different on the left and on the right.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Optically activating

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
these hundred or so cells

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
into two strains of flies

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
has dramatically different consequences.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
If you look first at the behavior

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
of the fly on the right,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
where the two odors meet,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
it marches straight through, as it did before.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Its behavior is completely unchanged.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
it pauses,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
it carefully scans the odor interface

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
as if it was sniffing out its environment,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and then it turns around.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
This means that the policy that the Actor implements

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
now includes an instruction to avoid the odor

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
that's in the right half of the chamber.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
This means that the Critic

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
must have spoken in that animal,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
and that the Critic must be contained

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Through many such experiments,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
we were able to narrow down

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
the identity of the Critic

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
to just 12 cells.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
These 12 cells, as shown here in green,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
send the output to a brain structure

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
called the "mushroom body,"

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
which is shown here in gray.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
We know from our formal model

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
that the brain structure

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
So this anatomy suggests

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
that the mushroom bodies have something to do

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
with action choice.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
this makes perfect sense.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
In fact, it makes so much sense

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
that we can construct an electronic toy circuit

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
that simulates the behavior of the fly.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
In this electronic toy circuit,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
the mushroom body neurons are symbolized

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
by the vertical bank of blue LEDs

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
in the center of the board.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
These LED's are wired to sensors

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
Each odor activates a different combination of sensors,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
which in turn activates

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
a different odor detector in the mushroom body.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
the Actor,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
can tell which odor is present

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.260
simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
What the Actor does with this information

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
depends on its policy,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
which is stored in the strengths of the connection,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
between the odor detectors

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
and the motors

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
that power the fly's evasive actions.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
If the connection is weak, the motors will stay off

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
and the fly will continue straight on its course.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
If the connection is strong, the motors will turn on

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
and the fly will initiate a turn.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
Now consider a situation

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
in which the motors stay off,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
the fly continues on its path

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
and it suffers some painful consequence

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
such as getting zapped.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
In a situation like this,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
we would expect the Critic to speak up

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
and to tell the Actor

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
to change its policy.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
We have created such a situation, artificially,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
by turning on the critic with a flash of light.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
That caused a strengthening of the connections

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
between the currently active odor detector

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
and the motors.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
So the next time

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
the fly finds itself facing the same odor again,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
and to trigger an evasive maneuver.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
I don't know about you,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
but I find it exhilarating to see

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
how vague psychological notions

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
evaporate and give rise

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
even if it's the mind of the fly.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
This is one piece of good news.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
The other piece of good news,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
for a scientist at least,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
is that much remains to be discovered.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
In the experiments I told you about,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
we have lifted the identity of the Critic,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
but we still have no idea

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
how the Critic does its job.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
Come to think of it, knowing when you're wrong

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
without a teacher, or your mother, telling you,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
is a very hard problem.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
There are some ideas in computer science

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
and in artificial intelligence

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
as to how this might be done,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
but we still haven't solved

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
a single example

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
of how intelligent behavior

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
springs from the physical interactions

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
in living matter.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
I think we'll get there in the not too distant future.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
Thank you.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.260
(Applause)
