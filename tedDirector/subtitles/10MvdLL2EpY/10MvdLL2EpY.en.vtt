00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.261
[On April 3, 2016 we saw
the largest data leak in history.]

00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:20.892
[The Panama Papers exposed
rich and powerful people]

00:00:20.932 --> 00:00:23.382
[hiding vast amounts of money
in offshore accounts.]

00:00:23.828 --> 00:00:26.338
[What does this mean?]

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:30.212
[We called Robert Palmer
of Global Witness to explain.]

00:00:32.852 --> 00:00:37.804
This week, there have been
a whole slew and deluge of stories

00:00:37.828 --> 00:00:41.124
coming out from the leak
of 11 million documents

00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:45.572
from a Panamanian-based law firm
called Mossack Fonseca.

00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:51.378
The release of these papers from Panama
lifts the veil on a tiny piece

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:53.640
of the secretive offshore world.

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:58.972
We get an insight into how clients
and banks and lawyers

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:01.024
go to companies like Mossack Fonseca

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:03.555
and say, "OK, we want
an anonymous company,

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.971
can you give us one?"

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.805
So you actually get to see the emails,

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.792
you get to see the exchanges of messages,

00:01:08.816 --> 00:01:11.891
you get to see the mechanics
of how this works,

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:13.316
how this operates.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.393
Now, this has already started
to have pretty immediate repercussions.

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:20.018
The Prime Minister
of Iceland has resigned.

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:21.257
We've also had news

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:26.324
that an ally of the brutal
Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad

00:01:26.348 --> 00:01:28.903
has also got offshore companies.

00:01:28.927 --> 00:01:34.156
There's been allegations
of a $2 billion money trail

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.083
that leads back to President
Vladimir Putin of Russia

00:01:38.107 --> 00:01:40.568
via his close childhood friend,

00:01:40.592 --> 00:01:42.820
who happens to be a top cellist.

00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:45.444
And there will be a lot
of rich individuals out there

00:01:45.468 --> 00:01:49.786
and others who will be nervous
about the next set of stories

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.363
and the next set of leaked documents.

00:01:52.387 --> 00:01:56.573
Now, this sounds like the plot
of a spy thriller

00:01:56.597 --> 00:01:58.260
or a John Grisham novel.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:02.300
It seems very distant
from you, me, ordinary people.

00:02:02.324 --> 00:02:04.832
Why should we care about this?

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:09.099
But the truth is that if rich
and powerful individuals

00:02:09.123 --> 00:02:11.777
are able to keep their money offshore

00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:14.288
and not pay the taxes that they should,

00:02:14.312 --> 00:02:18.406
it means that there is less money
for vital public services

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.783
like healthcare, education, roads.

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:24.128
And that affects all of us.

00:02:24.152 --> 00:02:26.868
Now, for my organization Global Witness,

00:02:26.892 --> 00:02:30.954
this exposé has been phenomenal.

00:02:30.978 --> 00:02:35.466
We have the world's media
and political leaders

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.145
talking about how individuals
can use offshore secrecy

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.564
to hide and disguise their assets --

00:02:42.588 --> 00:02:47.372
something we have been talking about
and exposing for a decade.

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:52.031
Now, I think a lot of people find
this entire world baffling and confusing,

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:56.520
and hard to understand how
this sort of offshore world works.

00:02:56.544 --> 00:02:59.376
I like to think of it a bit
like a Russian doll.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.859
So you can have one company
stacked inside another company,

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:04.994
stacked inside another company,

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:09.429
making it almost impossible
to really understand

00:03:09.453 --> 00:03:11.680
who is behind these structures.

00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:14.617
It can be very difficult
for law enforcement

00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:17.604
or tax authorities,
journalists, civil society

00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:19.890
to really understand what's going on.

00:03:20.318 --> 00:03:21.755
I also think it's interesting

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.986
that there's been less coverage
of this issue in the United States.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.773
And that's perhaps because
some prominent US people

00:03:28.797 --> 00:03:33.335
just haven't figured
in this exposé, in this scandal.

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.294
Now, that's not because
there are no rich Americans

00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:40.128
who are stashing their assets offshore.

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:43.974
It's just because of the way
in which offshore works,

00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:47.488
Mossack Fonseca has fewer
American clients.

00:03:47.512 --> 00:03:50.768
I think if we saw leaks
from the Cayman Islands

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:54.443
or even from Delaware
or Wyoming or Nevada,

00:03:54.467 --> 00:04:00.259
you would see many more cases
and examples linking back to Americans.

00:04:00.283 --> 00:04:06.201
In fact, in a number of US states
you need less information,

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:10.399
you need to provide less
information to get a company

00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:13.216
than you do to get a library card.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.022
That sort of secrecy in America
has allowed employees of school districts

00:04:19.046 --> 00:04:20.952
to rip off schoolchildren.

00:04:20.976 --> 00:04:25.872
It has allowed scammers
to rip off vulnerable investors.

00:04:26.452 --> 00:04:30.142
This is the sort of behavior
that affects all of us.

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:32.037
Now, at Global Witness,

00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:35.322
we wanted to see what this
actually looked like in practice.

00:04:35.346 --> 00:04:37.759
How does this actually work?

00:04:37.783 --> 00:04:38.958
So what we did

00:04:38.982 --> 00:04:45.219
is we sent in an undercover investigator
to 13 Manhattan law firms.

00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:49.537
Our investigator posed
as an African minister

00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:53.688
who wanted to move suspect funds
into the United States

00:04:53.712 --> 00:04:56.851
to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.

00:04:57.288 --> 00:05:02.349
Now, what was truly shocking
was that all but one of those lawyers

00:05:02.373 --> 00:05:06.966
provided our investigator with suggestions

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.954
on how to move those suspect funds.

00:05:08.978 --> 00:05:10.790
These were all preliminary meetings,

00:05:10.814 --> 00:05:13.086
and none of the lawyers
took us on as a client

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.399
and of course no money moved hands,

00:05:15.423 --> 00:05:18.881
but it really shows the problem
with the system.

00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:20.824
It's also important

00:05:20.848 --> 00:05:24.214
to not just think about this
as individual cases.

00:05:24.238 --> 00:05:26.451
This is not just about
an individual lawyer

00:05:26.475 --> 00:05:30.329
who's spoken to our undercover
investigator and provided suggestions.

00:05:30.353 --> 00:05:33.208
It's not just about
a particular senior politician

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:34.861
who's been caught up in a scandal.

00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:37.941
This is about how a system works,

00:05:37.965 --> 00:05:43.908
that entrenches corruption,
tax evasion, poverty and instability.

00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:45.747
And in order to tackle this,

00:05:45.771 --> 00:05:47.442
we need to change the game.

00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:49.988
We need to change the rules of the game

00:05:50.012 --> 00:05:52.004
to make this sort of behavior harder.

00:05:52.028 --> 00:05:54.972
This may seem like doom and gloom,

00:05:54.996 --> 00:05:56.917
like there's nothing we can do about it,

00:05:56.941 --> 00:05:58.571
like nothing has ever changed,

00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:01.931
like there will always be rich
and powerful individuals.

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:04.402
But as a natural optimist,

00:06:04.426 --> 00:06:07.904
I do see that we are starting
to get some change.

00:06:07.928 --> 00:06:09.803
Over the last couple of years,

00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:13.495
we've seen a real push towards
greater transparency

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.353
when it comes to company ownership.

00:06:15.755 --> 00:06:18.092
This issue was put on the political agenda

00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:20.610
by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron

00:06:20.634 --> 00:06:25.394
at a big G8 Summit that was held
in Northern Ireland in 2013.

00:06:25.872 --> 00:06:30.222
And since then, the European Union
is going to be creating

00:06:30.246 --> 00:06:32.403
central registers at a national level

00:06:32.427 --> 00:06:35.834
of who really owns and controls
companies across Europe.

00:06:35.858 --> 00:06:40.537
One of the things that is sad is that,
actually, the US is lagging behind.

00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.658
There's bipartisan legislation
that had been introduced

00:06:43.682 --> 00:06:45.585
in the House and the Senate,

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:48.766
but it isn't making as much progress
as we'd like to see.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.877
So we'd really want to see
the Panama leaks,

00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:55.695
this huge peek into the offshore world,

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:00.771
be used as a way of opening up
in the US and around the world.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:05.585
For us at Global Witness,
this is a moment for change.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.698
We need ordinary people to get angry

00:07:09.722 --> 00:07:12.975
at the way in which people
can hide their identity

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.912
behind secret companies.

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:18.523
We need business leaders
to stand up and say,

00:07:18.547 --> 00:07:21.831
"Secrecy like this is not
good for business."

00:07:21.855 --> 00:07:26.235
We need political leaders
to recognize the problem,

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:31.266
and to commit to changing the law
to open up this sort of secrecy.

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.918
Together, we can end the secrecy

00:07:34.942 --> 00:07:37.999
that is currently allowing tax evasion,

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:41.214
corruption, money laundering to flourish.
