00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I'll try to spin a story about energy,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and oil's a convenient starting place.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
The talk will be broadly about energy,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
but oil's a good place to start.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
You take about eight or so carbon atoms,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
about 20 hydrogen atoms,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
you put them together in exactly the right way

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
and you get this marvelous liquid:

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
very energy-dense and very easy to refine

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
into a number of very useful products and fuels.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
It's great stuff.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
Now, as far as it goes,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
there's a lot of oil out there in the world.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Here's my little pocket map

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
of where it's all located.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
A bigger one for you to look at.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
But this is it, this is the oil in the world.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
This is about 100 trillion gallons

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
of crude oil

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
still to be developed and produced in the world today.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Now, that's just one story about oil,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and we could end it there and say,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
"Well, oil's going to last forever

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
because, well, there's just a lot of it."

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
But there's actually more to the story than that.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Oh, by the way, if you think you're very far from some of this oil,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
1000 meters below where you're all sitting

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Come talk to me about it, I'll fill in some of the details if you want.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
So, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
But what about oil? Where is it in the energy system?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
and it's been a dominant part of our energy system

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
for most of those 150 years.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Now, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about:

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
For the last 25 years,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
oil has been playing less and less of a role

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
in global energy systems.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Now, it's about 35 percent.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
It's been declining

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and I believe it will continue to decline.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and is declining.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
So oil is playing a less significant role

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
every year.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And so, 25 years ago,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
there was a peak oil;

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
just like, in the 1920s,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
there was a peak coal;

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and a hundred years before that,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
there was a peak wood.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Well, a lot of natural gas

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and a little bit of nuclear, for starters.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And what goes on in the future?

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Well, I think out ahead of us a few decades

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
is peak gas,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and beyond that,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
peak renewables.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Now, I'll tell you another little, very important

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
story about this picture.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Now, I'm not pretending that energy use in total

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
isn't increasing, it is --

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
that's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
we'll fill in some of the details --

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
but there's a very important message here:

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
This is 200 years of history,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
our energy system.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Energy systems of the world

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
becoming progressively -- year on year,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
decade on decade, century on century --

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
becoming less carbon intense.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
And that continues into the future

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
with the renewables that we're developing today,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
by mid century.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Now that might be the end of the story --

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Okay, we just replace it all with conventional renewables --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
but I think, actually, there's more to the story than that.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
And to tell the next part of the story --

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
What is the future

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
of truly sustainable, carbon-free energy?

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Well, we have to take a little excursion,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and we'll start in central Texas.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
Here's a piece of limestone.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls, Texas.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
It's about 400 million years old.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And it's just limestone, nothing really special about it.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Now, here's a piece of chalk.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
And it's different than this limestone, you can see that.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
You wouldn't build a building out of this stuff,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Yeah, it's very different -- no, it's not different.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
It's not different, it's the same stuff:

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
What's different is how the molecules are put together.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Now, if you think that's kind of neat,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
the story gets really neat right now.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Off the coast of California comes this:

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
It's an abalone shell.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Now, millions of abalone every year

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
make this shell.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Oh, by the way, just in case you weren't already guessing,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
it's calcium carbonate.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
It's the same stuff as this

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and the same stuff as this.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
But it's not the same stuff; it's different.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
It's thousands of times,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
maybe 3,000 times tougher than this.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And why? Because the lowly abalone

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
is able to lay down

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
the calcium carbonate crystals in layers,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
making this beautiful, iridescent

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
mother of pearl.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Very specialized material

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
that the abalone self-assembles,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
millions of abalone,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
all the time, every day, every year.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
This is pretty incredible stuff.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
All the same, what's different?

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
How the molecules are put together.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Now, what does this have to do with energy?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Here's a piece of coal.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And I'll suggest that this coal

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
is about as exciting

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
as this chalk.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Now, whether we're talking about fuels

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
or energy carriers,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
or perhaps novel materials for batteries

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
or fuel cells,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
because nature didn't need to.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Nature didn't need to because, unlike the abalone shell,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
the survival of a species didn't depend

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
on building those materials,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
until maybe now when it might just matter.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
So, when we think about the future of energy,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
imagine

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
what would it be like

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
if instead of this,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
we could build the energy equivalent of this

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
just by rearranging the molecules differently.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And so that is my story.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
The oil will never run out.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
It's not because we have a lot of it.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
It's because, well,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
thousands of years ago,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
people invented ideas --

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
they had ideas, innovations, technology --

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
and the Stone Age ended,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
not because we ran out of stones.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
(Laughter)

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
It's ideas, it's innovation, it's technology

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
that will end the age of oil, long before we run out of oil.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
Thank you very much.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
(Applause)
