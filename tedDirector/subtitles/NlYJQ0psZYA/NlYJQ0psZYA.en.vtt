00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:55.160
(Music)

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.160
(Applause)

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
Thank you for being here.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:12.160
And I say "thank you for being here" because I was silent for 17 years.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.160
And the first words that I spoke were in Washington, D.C.,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
And I said, "Thank you for being here."

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.160
My mother, out in the audience, she jumped up,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
"Hallelujah, Johnny’s talking!"

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
(Laughter)

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.160
and your mother was out in the audience, say.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
My dad said to me, "That’s one" --

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
I’ll explain that.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160
But I turned around because I didn’t recognize where my voice was coming from.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
I hadn’t heard my voice in 17 years,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
so I turned around and I looked and I said,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
"God, who's saying what I’m thinking?"

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.160
And then I realized it was me, you know, and I kind of laughed.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.160
And I could see my father: "Yeah, he really is crazy."

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.160
Well, I want to take you on this journey.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
And the journey, I believe, is a metaphor for all of our journeys.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.160
Even though this one is kind of unusual,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.160
I want you to think about your own journey.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.160
My journey began in 1971

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.160
when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
It disturbed me so much

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.160
that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
That’s a big thing in California.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.160
And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
in Inverness, California, because there were only

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.160
about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in '71 now.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.160
And so when I came in and I started walking around, people --

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
they just knew what was going on.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
And people would drive up next to me

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
and say, "John, what are you doing?"

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.160
And I’d say, "Well, I’m walking for the environment."

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.160
And they said, "No, you’re walking to make us look bad, right?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
You’re walking to make us feel bad."

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
And maybe there was some truth to that,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.160
because I thought that if I started walking, everyone would follow.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
Because of the oil, everybody talked about the polllution.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.160
And so I argued with people about that, I argued and I argued.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
I called my parents up.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
I said, "I’ve given up riding and driving in cars."

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
My dad said, "Why didn’t you do that when you were 16?"

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
(Laughter)

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.160
I didn’t know about the environment then.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
They’re back in Philadelphia.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.160
And so I told my mother, "I’m happy though, I’m really happy."

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
She said, "If you were happy, son, you wouldn’t have to say it."

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Mothers are like that.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:14.160
And so, on my 27th birthday I decided, because I argued so much

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.160
and I talk so much, that I was going to stop speaking

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160
for just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
And so I did.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
I got up in the morning and I didn’t say a word.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
And I have to tell you, it was a very moving experience,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.160
because for the first time, I began listening -- in a long time.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160
And what I heard, it kind of disturbed me.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
Because what I used to do, when I thought I was listening,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.160
and think that I could -- I knew what they were going to say,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
and so I stopped listening.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
And in my mind, I just kind of raced ahead

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
and thought of what I was going to say back,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
while they were still finishing up.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
And then I would launch in.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.160
Well, that just ended communication.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
So on this first day I actually listened.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
And it was very sad for me,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.160
because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
I was 27. I thought I knew everything.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
I didn’t.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.160
And so I decided I’d better do this for another day,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160
and another day, and another day until finally,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.160
because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
So for a year I said I would keep quiet,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.160
and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
and maybe I would talk again.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Well, that lasted 17 years.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.160
Now during that time -- those 17 years -- I walked and I played the banjo

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.160
and I painted and I wrote in my journal, and

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.160
I tried to study the environment by reading books.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.160
And I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
I walked up to Ashland, Oregon,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.160
where they were offering an environmental studies degree.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
It’s only 500 miles.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
And I went into the Registrar’s office and --

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
"What, what, what?"

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
I had a newspaper clipping.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
"Oh, so you really want to go to school here?

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
You don’t …?

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
We have a special program for you." They did.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.160
And in those two years, I graduated with my first degree -- a bachelor’s degree.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
And my father came out, he was so proud.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
He said, "Listen, we’re really proud of you son,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
but what are you going to do with a bachelor’s degree?

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
You don’t ride in cars, you don’t talk --

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
you’re going to have to do those things."

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
(Laughter)

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
I hunched my shoulder, I picked my backpack up again

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
and I started walking.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.160
I walked all the way up to Port Townsend, Washington, where I built a wooden boat,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
rode it across Puget Sound

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.160
and walked across Washington [to] Idaho and down to Missoula, Montana.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.160
I had written the University of Montana two years earlier

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
and said I'd like to go to school there.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
I said I'd be there in about two years.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160
(Laughter)

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
And I was there. I showed up in two years and they --

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
I tell this story because they really helped me.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
There are two stories in Montana.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
The first story is I didn’t have any money -- that’s a sign I used a lot.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
And they said,"Don't worry about that."

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
The director of the program said, "Come back tomorrow."

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
He gave me 150 dollars,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
and he said, "Register for one credit.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
You’re going to go to South America, aren’t you?"

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
And I said --

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.160
Rivers and lakes, the hydrological systems, South America.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
So I did that.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
He came back; he said to me,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.160
"OK John, now that you've registered for that one credit,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
you can have a key to an office, you can matriculate --

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
you’re matriculating, so you can use the library.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.160
And what we’re going to do

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.160
is, we’re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
They’re going to save your grade,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:37.160
then you can register for that class and they’ll give you the grade."

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
Wow, they don’t do that in graduate schools, I don’t think.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.160
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
They saw that I was really interested in the environment,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
and they really wanted to help me along the way.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.160
And during that time, I actually taught classes without speaking.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:03.160
I explained, with a friend who could interpret my sign language,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
that I was John Francis, I was walking around the world,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.160
I didn’t talk and this was the last time

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
this person’s going to be here interpreting for me.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
All the students sat around and they went ...

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160
(Laughter)

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
I could see they were looking for the schedule,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
to see when they could get out.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.160
They had to take that class with me.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
Two weeks later, everyone was trying to get into our class.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.160
And I learned in that class -- because I would do things like this ...

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
and they were all gathered around, going, "What's he trying to say?"

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.160
"I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting." "Yeah, clear cutting."

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.160
"No, no, no, that's not clear cutting, that’s -- he's using a handsaw."

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
"Well, you can’t clearcut with a ..."

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
"Yes, you can clear cut ..."

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
"No, I think he’s talking about selective forestry."

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.160
Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.160
I just backed out of that, you know, and I just kind of kept the fists from flying.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.160
But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.160
and they said things that I absolutely did not mean,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
but I should have.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.160
And so what came to me is, if you were a teacher

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
and you were teaching, if you weren’t learning

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
you probably weren’t teaching very well.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
And so I went on.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
My dad came out to see me graduate

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
and, you know, I did the deal,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
and my father said, "We’re really proud of you son, but ... "

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
You know what went on,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
he said, "You’ve got to start riding and driving and start talking.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
What are you going to do with a master’s degree?"

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.160
I hunched my shoulder, I got my backpack

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
and I went on to the University of Wisconsin.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.160
I spent two years there writing on oil spills.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
No one was interested in oil spills.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
But something happened --

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
Exxon Valdez.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.160
And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160
My dad came out again.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
He said, "I don't know how you do this, son --

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
I mean, you don't ride in cars, you don’t talk.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
My sister said maybe I should leave you alone,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
because you seem to be doing a lot better

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
when you’re not saying anything."

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
(Laughter)

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
Well, I put on my backpack again.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean --

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.160
it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.160
And on Earth Day, 1990 --

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
the 20th anniversary of Earth Day -- that’s when I began to speak.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
And that’s why I said, "Thank you for being here."

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.160
Because it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling;

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.160
and if there's no one there to hear, does it really make a sound?

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.160
And I’m thanking you, and I'm thanking my family

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
because they had come to hear me speak.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
And that’s communication.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:53.160
And they also taught me about listening -- that they listened to me.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.160
And it’s one of those things that came out of the silence,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
the listening to each other.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
Really, very important --

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
we need to listen to each other.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
Well, my journey kept going on.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
My dad said, "That’s one,"

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
and I still didn’t let that go.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
I worked for the Coastguard, was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
I wrote regulations for the United States --

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
I mean, I wrote oil spill regulations.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.160
20 years ago, if someone had said to me,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
"John, do you really want to make a difference?"

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160
"Yeah, I want to make a difference."

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
He said, "You just start walking east;

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
get out of your car and just start walking east."

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.160
And as I walked off a little bit, they'd say, "Yeah, and shut up, too."

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
(Laughter)

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.160
"You’re going to make a difference, buddy."

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.160
How could that be, how could that be?

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160
How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
make a difference?

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.160
Well, my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
And after that -- I only worked one year --

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.160
I said, "That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that."

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:12.160
and walked through all of the islands, and to Venezuela.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.160
And you know, I forgot the most important thing,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.160
which is why I started talking, which I have to tell you.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.160
I started talking because I had studied environment.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.160
I’d studied environment at this formal level,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
but there was this informal level.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
And the informal level --

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.160
I learned about people, and what we do and how we are.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:50.160
and endangered species to being about how we treated each other.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
Because if we are the environment,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160
then all we need to do is look around us

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.160
and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.160
And so that’s the message that I had.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
And I said, "Well, I'm going to have to spread that message."

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.160
And I got in my sailboat, sailed all the way through the Caribbean --

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.160
it wasn't really my sailboat, I kind of worked on that boat --

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.160
got to Venezuela and I started walking.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
This is the last part of this story, because it’s how I got here,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.160
because I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:30.160
I was walking through El Dorado -- it's a prison town, famous prison,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.160
or infamous prison -- in Venezuela, and I don’t know what possessed me,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
because this was not like me.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:44.160
There I am, walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.160
"Pasaporte, pasaporte," and with an M16 pointed at me.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.160
And I looked at him and I said, "Passport, huh?

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
I don't need to show you my passport. It’s in the back of my pack.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.160
I'm Dr. Francis; I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world."

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
And I started walking off.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
What possessed me to say this thing?

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
The road turned into the jungle.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.160
I didn’t get shot.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.160
And I got to -- I start saying, "Free at last --

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.160
thank God Almighty, I’m free at last."

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.160
"What was that about," I’m saying. What was that about?

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:35.160
It took me 100 miles to figure out that, in my heart, in me,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.160
I had become a prisoner.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.160
I was a prisoner and I needed to escape.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:48.160
The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
or use motorized vehicles.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
Now how could that be?

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.160
Because when I started, it seemed very appropriate to me

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.160
not to use motorized vehicles.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
But the thing that was different

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
was that every birthday, I asked myself about silence,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:11.160
but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.160
I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.160
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:24.160
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.160
and that I was going to have to change.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.160
You know, we can do it.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.160
I was going to have to change.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
And I was afraid to change,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
because I was so used to the guy who only just walked.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:42.160
I was so used to that person that I didn’t want to stop.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.160
I didn’t know who I would be if I changed.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.160
But I know I needed to.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.160
I know I needed to change, because it would be the only way

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.160
that I could be here today.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.160
And I know that a lot of times

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.160
we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we’ve gotten to,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.160
but there’s another place for us to go.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:12.160
And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we’ve become,

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:19.160
and go to the place of who we are becoming.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:28.160
And so, I want to encourage you to go to that next place,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.160
to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:41.160
as comfortable as it may be, because we have to do something now.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.160
We have to change now.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.160
As our former Vice President said,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
we have to become activists.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.160
So if my voice can touch you,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.160
if my actions can touch you, if my being here can touch you,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.160
please let it be.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.160
And I know that all of you have touched me

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.160
while I’ve been here.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.160
So, let’s go out into the world

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
and take this caring, this love, this respect

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.160
that we’ve shown each other right here at TED,

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160
and take this out into the world.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.160
Because we are the environment,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.160
and how we treat each other

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.160
is really how we’re going to treat the environment.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.160
So I want to thank you for being here

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.160
and I want to end this in five seconds of silence.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.160
Thank you.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:19.160
(Applause)
