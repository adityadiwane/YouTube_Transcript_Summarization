00:00:16.018 --> 00:00:19.309
We're going to begin in 1964.

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:22.282
Bob Dylan is 23 years old, and his career

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:24.443
is just reaching its pinnacle.

00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:26.884
He's been christened the voice of a generation,

00:00:26.884 --> 00:00:29.344
and he's churning out classic songs

00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:31.307
at a seemingly impossible rate,

00:00:31.307 --> 00:00:35.758
but there's a small minority of dissenters, and they claim

00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:39.497
that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:43.637
2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse,

00:00:43.637 --> 00:00:45.550
takes the Beatles' "White Album,"

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.327
combines it with Jay-Z's "The Black Album"

00:00:47.327 --> 00:00:49.151
to create "The Grey Album."

00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:51.070
"The Grey Album" becomes an immediate sensation online,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.830
and the Beatles' record company sends out countless

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.070
cease-and-desist letters for "unfair competition

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.951
and dilution of our valuable property."

00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:02.943
Now, "The Grey Album" is a remix.

00:01:02.943 --> 00:01:05.340
It is new media created from old media.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.925
It was made using these three techniques:

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:11.167
copy, transform and combine.

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:13.089
It's how you remix. You take existing songs,

00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:14.809
you chop them up, you transform the pieces,

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:16.649
you combine them back together again,

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.626
and you've got a new song, but that new song

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:21.360
is clearly comprised of old songs.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.673
But I think these aren't just the components of remixing.

00:01:24.673 --> 00:01:27.717
I think these are the basic elements of all creativity.

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:29.528
I think everything is a remix,

00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:34.219
and I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.212
All right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear

00:01:37.212 --> 00:01:40.233
where some of Dylan's early songs came from.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.110
We'll do some side-by-side comparisons here.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.316
All right, this first song you're going to hear

00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:45.730
is "Nottamun Town." It's a traditional folk tune.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.311
After that, you'll hear Dylan's "Masters of War."

00:01:48.318 --> 00:01:53.218
Jean Ritchie: ♫ In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look out, ♫

00:01:53.218 --> 00:01:59.816
♫ not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down. ♫

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:04.090
Bob Dylan: ♫ Come you masters of war, ♫

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.695
♫ you that build the big guns, you that build the death planes, ♫

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:15.764
♫ You that build all the bombs. ♫

00:02:15.764 --> 00:02:17.686
Kirby Ferguson: Okay, so that's the same basic melody

00:02:17.686 --> 00:02:20.845
and overall structure. This next one is "The Patriot Game,"

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:22.837
by Dominic Behan. Alongside that,

00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:25.111
you're going to hear "With God on Our Side," by Dylan.

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:30.369
Dominic Behan: ♫ Come all ye young rebels, ♫

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:34.899
♫ and list while I sing, ♫

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:43.111
♫ for the love of one's land is a terrible thing. ♫

00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:48.923
BD: ♫ Oh my name it is nothin', ♫

00:02:48.923 --> 00:02:53.451
♫ my age it means less, ♫

00:02:53.451 --> 00:03:00.270
♫ the country I come from is called the Midwest. ♫

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.896
KF: Okay, so in this case, Dylan admits

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:04.336
he must have heard "The Patriot Game," he forgot about it,

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:05.895
then when the song kind of bubbled back up

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:08.206
in his brain, he just thought it was his song.

00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:09.438
Last one, this is "Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons,"

00:03:09.438 --> 00:03:10.998
another traditional folk tune.

00:03:10.998 --> 00:03:13.295
Alongside that is "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right."

00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:15.120
This one's more about the lyric.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.011
Paul Clayton: ♫ It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, ♫

00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:29.875
♫ darlin', and it ain't no use to sit and cry now. ♫

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:35.820
BD: ♫ It ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.472
♫ if you don't know by now, ♫

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:44.863
♫ and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫

00:03:44.863 --> 00:03:47.750
♫ it'll never do somehow. ♫

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.022
KF: Okay, now, there's a lot of these.

00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:52.036
It's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies

00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:54.579
Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed.

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.435
This is pretty typical among folk singers.

00:03:56.435 --> 00:03:58.798
Here's the advice of Dylan's idol, Woody Guthrie.

00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:00.328
"The worlds are the important thing.

00:04:00.328 --> 00:04:02.160
Don't worry about tunes. Take a tune,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.836
sing high when they sing low,

00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:07.044
sing fast when they sing slow, and you've got a new tune."

00:04:07.044 --> 00:04:11.041
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:12.988
And that's, that's what Guthrie did right here,

00:04:12.988 --> 00:04:15.595
and I'm sure you all recognize the results.

00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:21.512
(Music)

00:04:21.512 --> 00:04:23.907
We know this tune, right? We know it?

00:04:23.907 --> 00:04:25.320
Actually you don't.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.004
That is "When the World's on Fire," a very old melody,

00:04:28.004 --> 00:04:30.265
in this case performed by the Carter Family.

00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:32.943
Guthrie adapted it into "This Land Is Your Land."

00:04:32.943 --> 00:04:37.263
So, Bob Dylan, like all folk singers, he copied melodies,

00:04:37.263 --> 00:04:39.985
he transformed them, he combined them with new lyrics

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:42.382
which were frequently their own concoction

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.643
of previous stuff.

00:04:44.643 --> 00:04:48.306
Now, American copyright and patent laws run counter

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:51.029
to this notion that we build on the work of others.

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.696
Instead, these laws and laws around the world

00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:57.418
use the rather awkward analogy of property.

00:04:57.418 --> 00:04:59.861
Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property,

00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:02.170
but it's property that we're all building on,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.659
and creations can only take root and grow

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.375
once that ground has been prepared.

00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:10.221
Henry Ford once said, "I invented nothing new.

00:05:10.221 --> 00:05:12.224
I simply assembled the discoveries of other men

00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:14.811
behind whom were centuries of work.

00:05:14.811 --> 00:05:17.194
Progress happens when all the factors that make for it

00:05:17.194 --> 00:05:21.224
are ready and then it is inevitable."

00:05:21.224 --> 00:05:25.769
2007. The iPhone makes it debut.

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:28.436
Apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early,

00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:30.933
but its time was approaching because its core technology

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:32.979
had been evolving for decades.

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.961
That's multi-touch, controlling a device

00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.738
by touching its display.

00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:39.157
Here is Steve Jobs introducing multi-touch

00:05:39.157 --> 00:05:41.397
and making a rather foreboding joke.

00:05:41.397 --> 00:05:44.200
Steve Jobs: And we have invented a new technology

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.460
called multi-touch.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.913
You can do multi-fingered gestures on it,

00:05:48.913 --> 00:05:52.524
and boy have we patented it. (Laughter)

00:05:52.524 --> 00:05:56.690
KF: Yes. And yet, here is multi-touch in action.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.711
This is at TED, actually, about a year earlier.

00:05:58.711 --> 00:06:01.179
This is Jeff Han, and, I mean, that's multi-touch.

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:02.930
It's the same animal, at least.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.697
Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.523
newfangled technology.

00:06:06.523 --> 00:06:08.691
Jeff Han: Multi-touch sensing isn't anything --

00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:10.897
isn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton

00:06:10.897 --> 00:06:12.546
have been playing around with it in the '80s.

00:06:12.546 --> 00:06:15.745
The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here

00:06:15.745 --> 00:06:18.807
right now other than probably its newfound accessibility.

00:06:18.807 --> 00:06:20.740
KF: So he's pretty frank about it not being new.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.283
So it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented.

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:25.420
It's the small parts of it that are,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.724
and it's in these small details where

00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:29.842
we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent:

00:06:29.842 --> 00:06:33.003
to promote the progress of useful arts.

00:06:33.003 --> 00:06:36.187
Here is the first ever slide-to-unlock.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:39.056
That is all there is to it. Apple has patented this.

00:06:39.056 --> 00:06:41.868
It's a 28-page software patent, but I will summarize

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:45.804
what it covers. Spoiler alert: Unlocking your phone

00:06:45.804 --> 00:06:48.741
by sliding an icon with your finger. (Laughter)

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.758
I'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent.

00:06:51.758 --> 00:06:54.607
Now, can someone own this idea?

00:06:54.607 --> 00:06:57.037
Now, back in the '80s, there were no software patents,

00:06:57.037 --> 00:07:00.198
and it was Xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface.

00:07:00.198 --> 00:07:03.116
What if they had patented pop-up menus,

00:07:03.116 --> 00:07:07.540
scrollbars, the desktop with icons that look like folders

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.527
and sheets of paper?

00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:11.876
Would a young and inexperienced Apple

00:07:11.876 --> 00:07:14.745
have survived the legal assault from a much larger

00:07:14.745 --> 00:07:18.825
and more mature company like Xerox?

00:07:18.825 --> 00:07:21.272
Now, this idea that everything is a remix might sound

00:07:21.272 --> 00:07:25.399
like common sense until you're the one getting remixed.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.049
For example ...

00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:28.288
SJ: I mean, Picasso had a saying.

00:07:28.288 --> 00:07:31.845
He said, "Good artists copy. Great artists steal."

00:07:31.845 --> 00:07:34.167
And we have, you know,

00:07:34.167 --> 00:07:37.295
always been shameless about stealing great ideas.

00:07:37.295 --> 00:07:39.193
KF: Okay, so that's in '96. Here's in 2010.

00:07:39.193 --> 00:07:42.102
"I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product."

00:07:42.102 --> 00:07:43.644
(Laughter)

00:07:43.644 --> 00:07:47.283
"I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this." (Laughter)

00:07:47.283 --> 00:07:50.787
Okay, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.

00:07:50.787 --> 00:07:53.138
(Laughter)

00:07:53.138 --> 00:07:56.746
Now, behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion

00:07:56.746 --> 00:07:58.965
We have a strong predisposition towards protecting

00:07:58.965 --> 00:08:00.894
what we feel is ours.

00:08:00.894 --> 00:08:02.812
We have no such aversion towards copying

00:08:02.812 --> 00:08:05.545
what other people have, because we do that nonstop.

00:08:05.545 --> 00:08:08.020
So here's the sort of equation we're looking at.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.677
We've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property,

00:08:10.677 --> 00:08:13.462
plus massive rewards or settlements

00:08:13.462 --> 00:08:15.659
in infringement cases, plus huge legal fees

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:17.322
to protect yourself in court,

00:08:17.322 --> 00:08:20.826
plus cognitive biases against perceived loss.

00:08:20.826 --> 00:08:22.969
And the sum looks like this.

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.792
That is the last four years of lawsuits

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:28.358
in the realm of smartphones.

00:08:28.358 --> 00:08:34.129
Is this promoting the progress of useful arts?

00:08:34.129 --> 00:08:39.897
1983. Bob Dylan is 42 years old, and his time

00:08:39.897 --> 00:08:43.223
in the cultural spotlight is long since past.

00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:45.832
He records a song called "Blind Willie McTell,"

00:08:45.832 --> 00:08:48.018
named after the blues singer, and the song

00:08:48.018 --> 00:08:51.688
is a voyage through the past, through a much darker time,

00:08:51.688 --> 00:08:54.838
but a simpler one, a time when musicians like Willie McTell

00:08:54.838 --> 00:08:57.358
had few illusions about what they did.

00:08:57.358 --> 00:08:59.608
"I jump 'em from other writers

00:08:59.608 --> 00:09:02.173
but I arrange 'em my own way."

00:09:02.173 --> 00:09:03.890
I think this is mostly what we do.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.256
Our creativity comes from without, not from within.

00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:10.177
We are not self-made. We are dependent on one another,

00:09:10.177 --> 00:09:13.002
and admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace

00:09:13.002 --> 00:09:15.836
of mediocrity and derivativeness.

00:09:15.836 --> 00:09:18.469
It's a liberation from our misconceptions,

00:09:18.469 --> 00:09:21.552
and it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves

00:09:21.552 --> 00:09:24.287
and to simply begin.

00:09:24.287 --> 00:09:27.237
Thank you so much. It was an honor to be here.

00:09:27.237 --> 00:09:30.014
Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:30.014 --> 00:09:33.398
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:33.398 --> 00:09:36.739
Thank you. (Applause)
