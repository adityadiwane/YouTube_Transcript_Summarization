00:00:17.057 --> 00:00:19.524
So I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:22.250
from a totally unique point of view,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.275
and this world I'm going to talk about is the micro world.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.855
I've found, after doing this for many, many years,

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.571
that there's a magical world behind reality.

00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:33.730
And that can be seen directly through a microscope,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.835
and I'm going to show you some of this today.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.522
So let's start off looking at something rather not-so-small,

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.786
something that we can see with our naked eye,

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:44.227
and that's a bee. So when you look at this bee,

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:47.123
it's about this size here, it's about a centimeter.

00:00:47.123 --> 00:00:49.411
But to really see the details of the bee, and really

00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:53.140
appreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.226
So that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope,

00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:58.573
and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has

00:00:58.573 --> 00:01:01.404
thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia,

00:01:01.404 --> 00:01:03.836
and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes

00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:06.205
so they know when they're right up close to something,

00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:09.909
because they can't see in stereo.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.613
As we go smaller, here is a human hair.

00:01:13.613 --> 00:01:16.432
A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.

00:01:16.432 --> 00:01:19.166
It's about a tenth of a millimeter.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.342
And as we go smaller again,

00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:23.748
about ten times smaller than that, is a cell.

00:01:23.748 --> 00:01:26.331
So you could fit 10 human cells

00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:29.997
across the diameter of a human hair.

00:01:29.997 --> 00:01:31.583
So when we would look at cells, this is how I really got

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:34.851
involved in biology and science is by looking

00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:37.318
at living cells in the microscope.

00:01:37.318 --> 00:01:39.389
When I first saw living cells in a microscope, I was

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:43.288
absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like.

00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:46.604
So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system,

00:01:46.604 --> 00:01:48.428
they're actually moving all over the place.

00:01:48.443 --> 00:01:52.193
This cell is looking for foreign objects,

00:01:52.193 --> 00:01:54.550
bacteria, things that it can find.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.198
And it's looking around, and when it finds something,

00:01:57.198 --> 00:01:59.494
and recognizes it being foreign,

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:00.786
it will actually engulf it and eat it.

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:05.070
So if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.692
and it engulfs it and eats it.

00:02:10.692 --> 00:02:13.873
If you take some heart cells from an animal,

00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:16.769
and put it in a dish, they'll just sit there and beat.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.359
That's their job. Every cell has a mission in life,

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.160
and these cells, the mission is

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.687
to move blood around our body.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:28.471
These next cells are nerve cells, and right now,

00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.407
as we see and understand what we're looking at,

00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:33.521
our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this

00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:36.063
right now. They're not just static. They're moving around

00:02:36.063 --> 00:02:39.565
making new connections, and that's what happens when we learn.

00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:42.355
As you go farther down this scale here,

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:45.259
that's a micron, or a micrometer, and we go

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:47.607
all the way down to here to a nanometer

00:02:47.607 --> 00:02:50.364
and an angstrom. Now, an angstrom is the size

00:02:50.364 --> 00:02:53.731
of the diameter of a hydrogen atom.

00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:55.364
That's how small that is.

00:02:55.364 --> 00:02:57.666
And microscopes that we have today can actually see

00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:00.739
individual atoms. So these are some pictures

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.572
of individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom.

00:03:03.572 --> 00:03:06.401
This is a ring of cobalt atoms.

00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:09.059
So this whole world, the nano world, this area in here

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.254
is called the nano world, and the nano world,

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:15.388
the whole micro world that we see,

00:03:15.388 --> 00:03:18.421
there's a nano world that is wrapped up within that, and

00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:22.816
the whole -- and that is the world of molecules and atoms.

00:03:22.816 --> 00:03:25.274
But I want to talk about this larger world,

00:03:25.274 --> 00:03:27.611
the world of the micro world.

00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:31.730
So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower,

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.881
what would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.396
It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see

00:03:37.396 --> 00:03:40.690
when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.522
and you're a little bug, if you're on that surface

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:46.588
of that flower, that's what the terrain would look like.

00:03:46.588 --> 00:03:48.964
The petal of that flower looks like that, so the ant

00:03:48.964 --> 00:03:51.645
is kind of crawling over these objects, and if you look

00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:54.989
a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here,

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.734
this is the style of that flower, and you notice

00:03:57.734 --> 00:04:01.959
that it's got these little -- these are like little jelly-like things

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.701
that are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs.

00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:09.318
So this little ant that's crawling here, it's like

00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:11.144
it's in a little Willy Wonka land.

00:04:11.144 --> 00:04:15.279
It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see.

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:19.182
These are little bits of individual grain of pollen

00:04:19.182 --> 00:04:22.628
there and there, and here is a --

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:25.206
what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen,

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:27.170
when you look in a microscope, it's actually made

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.934
of thousands of little grains of pollen.

00:04:30.934 --> 00:04:33.169
So this, for example, when you see bees flying around

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.974
these little plants, and they're collecting pollen,

00:04:35.974 --> 00:04:38.397
those pollen grains that they're collecting, they pack

00:04:38.397 --> 00:04:40.830
into their legs and they take it back to the hive,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.460
and that's what makes the beehive,

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.278
the wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar,

00:04:47.278 --> 00:04:51.189
and that's what makes the honey that we eat.

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.446
Here's a close-up picture, or this is actually a regular picture

00:04:54.446 --> 00:04:57.119
of a water hyacinth, and if you had really, really good vision,

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:59.680
with your naked eye, you'd see it about that well.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.308
There's the stamen and the pistil. But look what the stamen

00:05:02.308 --> 00:05:05.822
and the pistil look like in a microscope. That's the stamen.

00:05:05.822 --> 00:05:08.473
So that's thousands of little grains of pollen there,

00:05:08.473 --> 00:05:11.759
and there's the pistil there, and these are the little things

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.478
called trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give

00:05:15.478 --> 00:05:19.438
a fragrance, and plants actually communicate

00:05:19.438 --> 00:05:24.832
with one another through their fragrances.

00:05:24.832 --> 00:05:27.200
I want to talk about something really ordinary,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.124
just ordinary sand.

00:05:29.124 --> 00:05:31.054
I became interested in sand about 10 years ago,

00:05:31.054 --> 00:05:33.615
when I first saw sand from Maui,

00:05:33.615 --> 00:05:36.762
and in fact, this is a little bit of sand from Maui.

00:05:36.762 --> 00:05:39.793
So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.

00:05:39.793 --> 00:05:42.704
Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.

00:05:42.704 --> 00:05:45.287
But when you look closer at this, look at what's there.

00:05:45.287 --> 00:05:48.789
It's really quite amazing. You have microshells there.

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.982
You have things like coral.

00:05:50.982 --> 00:05:54.516
You have fragments of other shells. You have olivine.

00:05:54.516 --> 00:05:56.712
You have bits of a volcano. There's a little bit

00:05:56.712 --> 00:05:59.339
of a volcano there. You have tube worms.

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:04.065
An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand.

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:06.744
And the reason that is, is because in a place like this island,

00:06:06.744 --> 00:06:09.110
a lot of the sand is made of biological material

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.107
because the reefs provide a place where all these

00:06:12.107 --> 00:06:15.997
microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow,

00:06:15.997 --> 00:06:18.335
and when they die, their shells and their teeth

00:06:18.335 --> 00:06:20.677
and their bones break up and they make grains of sand,

00:06:20.677 --> 00:06:23.647
things like coral and so forth.

00:06:23.647 --> 00:06:27.440
So here's, for example, a picture of sand from Maui.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.977
This is from Lahaina,

00:06:29.977 --> 00:06:31.707
and when we're walking along a beach, we're actually

00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:35.161
walking along millions of years of biological and geological history.

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:37.628
We don't realize it, but it's actually a record

00:06:37.628 --> 00:06:40.201
of that entire ecology.

00:06:40.201 --> 00:06:43.359
So here we see, for example, a sponge spicule,

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:45.945
two bits of coral here,

00:06:45.945 --> 00:06:49.795
that's a sea urchin spine. Really some amazing stuff.

00:06:49.795 --> 00:06:52.172
So when I first looked at this, I was -- I thought,

00:06:52.172 --> 00:06:53.921
gee, this is like a little treasure trove here.

00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:56.087
I couldn't believe it, and I'd go around dissecting

00:06:56.087 --> 00:06:59.396
the little bits out and making photographs of them.

00:06:59.396 --> 00:07:01.907
Here's what most of the sand in our world looks like.

00:07:01.907 --> 00:07:05.168
These are quartz crystals and feldspar,

00:07:05.168 --> 00:07:07.629
so most sand in the world on the mainland

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:11.379
is made of quartz crystal and feldspar. It's the erosion of granite rock.

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:15.730
So mountains are built up, and they erode away by water

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.757
and rain and ice and so forth,

00:07:17.757 --> 00:07:19.063
and they become grains of sand.

00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:21.513
There's some sand that's really much more colorful.

00:07:21.513 --> 00:07:23.582
These are sand from near the Great Lakes,

00:07:23.597 --> 00:07:25.608
and you can see that it's filled with minerals

00:07:25.608 --> 00:07:29.100
like pink garnet and green epidote, all kinds of amazing stuff,

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.484
and if you look at different sands from different places,

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:34.735
every single beach, every single place you look at sand,

00:07:34.735 --> 00:07:39.767
it's different. Here's from Big Sur, like they're little jewels.

00:07:39.767 --> 00:07:42.256
There are places in Africa where they do the mining

00:07:42.256 --> 00:07:46.425
of jewels, and you go to the sand where the rivers have

00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:48.724
the sand go down to the ocean, and it's like literally looking

00:07:48.724 --> 00:07:51.587
at tiny jewels through the microscope.

00:07:51.587 --> 00:07:54.764
So every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different.

00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:57.946
Every single grain is different. There are no two grains

00:07:57.946 --> 00:07:59.646
of sand alike in the world.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:03.178
Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere.

00:08:03.178 --> 00:08:06.906
They're like a snapshot in time.

00:08:06.906 --> 00:08:10.329
Now sand is not only on Earth, but sand is

00:08:10.329 --> 00:08:12.927
ubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact, outer space

00:08:12.927 --> 00:08:16.591
is filled with sand, and that sand comes together

00:08:16.591 --> 00:08:19.788
to make our planets and the Moon.

00:08:19.788 --> 00:08:21.370
And you can see those in micrometeorites.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.913
This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me,

00:08:23.913 --> 00:08:27.007
and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole.

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.753
And they're quite amazing-looking, and these are the

00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:34.177
tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in --

00:08:34.177 --> 00:08:36.092
the planets and the Moon.

00:08:36.092 --> 00:08:39.336
So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand,

00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:41.599
so they sent me sand from all the different landings

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:46.077
of the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago.

00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:49.717
And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes.

00:08:49.717 --> 00:08:52.684
This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing.

00:08:52.684 --> 00:08:56.467
I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon, which is sort of interesting.

00:08:56.467 --> 00:08:59.130
Now, the way my microscopes work is, normally

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.596
in a microscope you can see very little at one time,

00:09:01.596 --> 00:09:04.543
so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope,

00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:08.334
keep taking pictures, and then I have a computer program

00:09:08.334 --> 00:09:10.808
that puts all those pictures together

00:09:10.808 --> 00:09:13.930
into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like,

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.165
and I do that in 3D. So there, you can see,

00:09:17.165 --> 00:09:19.867
is a left-eye view. There's a right-eye view.

00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:22.420
So sort of left-eye view, right-eye view.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.788
Now something's interesting here. This looks very different

00:09:24.788 --> 00:09:27.166
than any sand on Earth that I've ever seen, and I've

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:30.966
seen a lot of sand on Earth, believe me. (Laughter)

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:33.924
Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused

00:09:33.924 --> 00:09:36.263
by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon.

00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:38.620
Now, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeorites

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.836
come in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moon

00:09:41.836 --> 00:09:44.436
is covered with powder now, because for four billion years

00:09:44.436 --> 00:09:47.230
it's been bombarded by micrometeorites,

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.620
and when micrometeorites come in at about

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.630
20 to 60,000 miles an hour, they vaporize on contact.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.540
And you can see here that that is --

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.134
that's sort of vaporized, and that material is holding this

00:09:58.134 --> 00:10:00.680
little clump of little sand grains together.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.859
This is a very small grain of sand, this whole thing.

00:10:02.859 --> 00:10:05.019
And that's called a ring agglutinate.

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:08.963
And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that,

00:10:08.963 --> 00:10:12.420
and you'd never find that on Earth.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.673
Most of the sand on the Moon,

00:10:15.673 --> 00:10:17.372
especially -- and you know when you look at the Moon,

00:10:17.372 --> 00:10:19.732
there's the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areas

00:10:19.732 --> 00:10:23.873
are lava flows. They're basaltic lava flows,

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:26.538
and that's what this sand looks like, very similar

00:10:26.538 --> 00:10:30.301
to the sand that you would see in Haleakala.

00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:33.724
Other sands, when these micrometeorites come in,

00:10:33.724 --> 00:10:36.813
they vaporize and they make these fountains,

00:10:36.813 --> 00:10:39.436
these microscopic fountains that go up into the --

00:10:39.436 --> 00:10:41.800
I was going to say "up into the air," but there is no air --

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.020
goes sort of up, and these microscopic glass beads

00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:48.564
are formed instantly, and they harden, and by the time

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:51.949
they fall down back to the surface of the Moon,

00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:54.845
they have these beautiful colored glass spherules.

00:10:54.845 --> 00:10:56.390
And these are actually microscopic;

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.358
you need a microscope to see these.

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:02.795
Now here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon,

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.949
and you can see that the entire

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:07.432
crystal structure is still there.

00:11:07.432 --> 00:11:09.580
This grain of sand is probably about

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.862
three and a half or four billion years old,

00:11:11.862 --> 00:11:14.053
and it's never eroded away like the way we have sand

00:11:14.053 --> 00:11:18.072
on Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling,

00:11:18.072 --> 00:11:21.322
air, and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosion

00:11:21.322 --> 00:11:25.929
down here by the Sun, has these solar storms,

00:11:25.929 --> 00:11:30.692
and that's erosion by solar radiation.

00:11:30.692 --> 00:11:33.278
So what I've been trying to tell you today is

00:11:33.278 --> 00:11:36.847
things even as ordinary as a grain of sand

00:11:36.847 --> 00:11:39.822
can be truly extraordinary if you look closely

00:11:39.822 --> 00:11:43.127
and if you look from a different and a new point of view.

00:11:43.127 --> 00:11:47.502
I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said,

00:11:47.502 --> 00:11:50.044
"To see a world in a grain of sand

00:11:50.044 --> 00:11:52.798
and a heaven in a wild flower,

00:11:52.798 --> 00:11:55.131
hold infinity in the palm of your hand,

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.464
and eternity in an hour."

00:11:57.464 --> 00:12:01.193
Thank you. (Applause)
