00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
So, I'm in Chile,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.330
in the Atacama desert, sitting in a hotel lobby,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
because that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
and I have this picture up on my screen,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
and a woman comes up behind me.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
She says, "Oh, that's beautiful.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
What is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?"

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
And unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
I said, "No, it's -- it's penguin shit."

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
(Laughter)

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
And, you know, "Excuse me!"

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.330
And I could sense

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
that she thought I was speaking synecdochically.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.330
(Laughter)

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
So, I said, "No, no, really -- it's penguin shit."

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
(Laughter)

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
taking pictures of penguins.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
So, literally, a few minutes before that,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
I downloaded this scientific paper

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330
about calculations on avian defecation,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
which is really quite interesting, because it turns out

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
you can model this as something called "Poiseuille flow,"

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
and you can learn an awful lot

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
about the physics of the avian rectum.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
Actually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
At this point, she stops me,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
and she says, "Who are you?

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
Wha -- what do you do?"

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
And I was stuck,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
because I didn't have any way to describe what I do.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
And so, in some sense,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
this talk today

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
is my answer to that.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.330
It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
And it's very hard for me to make sense of it,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
so I'm not sure that you can.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes --

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
often at four in the morning.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
So, some people are afraid of what I do.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
Some people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
and in response, I have ordered

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
a bulletproof pocket protector.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
I'm not sure what these people think,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
because I don't speak Norsk.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
(Laughter)

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
But I'm not thinking "monsteret" is a good thing.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
I don't know, you know?

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
So, one of the things that I love to do

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
Because archaeology gives us an opportunity

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
to study past civilizations,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
and see where they succeeded

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
and where they failed.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
Use science to, you know,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
work backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?"

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
And recently, I was in Easter Island,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
which is an incredibly beautiful place,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
and an incredibly mysterious place,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
because no matter where you go in Easter Island,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
you're struck by these statues, called the moai.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
The place is 64 square miles.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
They made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
Why on Earth? And if you haven't read

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
Jared Diamond's book, "Collapse,"

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.330
I totally recommend that you do.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
He's got a great chapter about it.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
Basically, these people

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
committed ecological suicide

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
in order to make more of these.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
And somewhere along the line, somebody said,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
"I know! Let's cut down the last tree

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
and commit suicide, because

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
we need more identical statues."

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
(Laughter)

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
And,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
one thing that isn't a mystery, actually,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
was when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures --

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
and I thought, "Well, why that look on the face?

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
Why that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
Where did they get that inspiration?

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
And then I met Yoyo,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
who is the native Rapa Nui-an guide,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
and if you look at Yoyo's face,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
you kind of figure out where they got it.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
There's many mysteries, these statues.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
Everyone wants to know, how did they make them,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
how did they transport them?

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
And she has studied the statues for 20-some years,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
and she has detailed records of every single statue.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
The one on the page here is the same that's up there.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
So, this used to be completely smooth.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
In fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
But after 1,000 years out in the weather,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
they look like this.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
and we're going to do a very high-res digitization,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
first because it's a way of preserving them.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
Second, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
learn a few of the mysteries about them.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
How long have they been standing in what positions?

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
And maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues of

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
what caused them to be the way they are.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
While I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
so you get a gratuitous picture

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
of a moai with a comet.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
I also have an archaeological project going on

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
in Egypt.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
"Going on" is perhaps a little bit strong.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
We're trying to get all of the permissions

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
to get everything all set, to get it going.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
So, I'll talk about it at a future TED.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
Another thing I do is I invent stuff.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
In fact, I design nuclear reactors.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
Not a joke.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
This is the conventional

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
nuclear fuel cycle.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
The red line is what is done in

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
where you reprocess.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
Now, this is the normal way it's done.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
It's got the huge advantage that it

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.330
does not create carbon pollution.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
It has a lot of disadvantages:

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
each one of these steps is extremely expensive,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
it's potentially dangerous

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
and they have the interesting property that the step

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
cannot be performed in anyone's backyard,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
which is a problem.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
So, our reactor eliminates these steps,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
which, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
Now, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
There's -- no reactor's been even built

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
to an old design, much less a new one, in the United States

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
for 25 years.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
It's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
thing that we do.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
Changing into a totally different field,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
particularly in an area called metamaterials.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.330
A metamaterial is an artificial material,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330
in a way that you couldn't otherwise.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
So, this device here is an invisibility cloak.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
It may not seem that, but if you were a microwave,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
this is how you would view it.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
Rays of light -- in this case, microwave light --

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.330
come in, and they just squish around the cell,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.330
and they come back the other side.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
Now, you could do that with mirrors from one angle.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
The cool thing is, this does it from all angles.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
Metamaterials, unfortunately --

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
A, it only works on microwave,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
and B, it doesn't work all that well yet.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
It's -- you know, today I'd like to say

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
it's a zero billion dollar business, but,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
in fact, it's negative.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
But some day, some day, maybe it's going to work.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
We do a lot of work in biomedical fields.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
In this case, we're working with a major medical foundation

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
diseases in developing countries.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.330
So, they say the eyes are the windows of the soul --

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.330
turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.330
And these happen to be my eyes, by the way.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
Now, I'm also very interested in cooking.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
While I was at Microsoft, I took a leave of absence

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
and went to a chef school in France.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
I used to work, also while at Microsoft,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.330
at a leading restaurant in Seattle,

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
so I do a lot of cooking.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
I've been on a team that won

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
the world championship of barbecue.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
like chili, or bouillabaisse.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
Various parts of the world will have a cult food

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
that people get enormously attached to --

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
there's tremendous traditions, there's secrecy.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
And I'm trying to use a very

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
scientific approach.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
So, this is my latest cooker,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
that's because it is.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials --

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.330
and of course, really the controller over there does it all on software --

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
you can make some terrific ribs.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
(Laughter)

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
This is a high-speed centrifuge.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
You should all have one in your kitchen,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
beside your Turbochef.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
This subjects food to a force about 50,000 times

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
that of normal gravity,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
and oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
You would not believe it!

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
I perform a series of ghoulish experiments

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
on food --

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
in this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical model

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
so that one can predict exactly

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
what the internal cooking times are.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
It turns out, A, it's useful, and for a geek like me, it's fun.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
Theory is red,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
black is experiment.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.330
So, I'm either really good at faking it,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
or this particular model seems to work.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
So, another random thing I do

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
or SETI.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
And you may be familiar with the movie "Contact,"

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
which sort of popularized that.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
It turns out there are real people who go out

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.330
and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.330
In fact, almost everybody in the movie

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.330
is based on a real character, a real person.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
So, the Jodie Foster character here

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
is actually this woman, Jill Tarter,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
and Jill has dedicated her life to this.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
You know, a lot of people risk their lives

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
in a brief act of heroism,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
which is kind of cool,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
but Jill has

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
what I call slow heroism.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
She is risking her professional life on something

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
that her own calculations show

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
So, I like to support people that are risking their lives.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.330
After the movie came out, of course, there was a lot of interest in SETI.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.330
My kids saw the movie,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
and afterwards they came to me and they said,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
"So, Dad, so -- so --

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
that character -- that's Jill, right?"

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah -- absolutely."

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
"And that other person, that's someone -- " I said, "Yes."

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.330
They said, "Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie?

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
Is that you?"

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
I said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on."

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.330
(Laughter)

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
So, the SETI Institute,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
with a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allen

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
and a variety of other people,

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.330
is building a dedicated radio telescope

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
in Hat Creek, California,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
so they can do this SETI work.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
Now, I travel a lot, and I change cell phones a lot,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
and the one person who always gets updated

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.330
on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
is Jill, because I really don't want to miss

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
"the call."

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
(Laughter)

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
I mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home,

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330
and I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible!

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
So, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.330
I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.330
And I resemble that remark.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
which is the finding of them.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
Now, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditions

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
looking for a dinosaur.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
It sounds really dumb, but that's what it is.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
It's horrible conditions, because

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
wherever you have nice weather,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.330
plants grow,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.330
and you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
So, you always find dinosaurs

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.330
in deserts or badlands,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
areas that have very little plant growth

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.330
and have flash floods in the spring.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
You know, skiers pray for snow?

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
Paleontologists pray for erosion.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
So, you hike around

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
and -- this is after you dig them up, they look like this.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
You hike around, you see something like this.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.330
Now, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.330
You've got this bentonite clay,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.330
which is -- sort of swells up and expands.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
And there's some stuff poking out. So, you look at that,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
and you look up close, and you say,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.330
"Well, gee, that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?"

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
Well, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
from the shape, that these are skull fragments.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.330
And then when you look at this,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.330
you say, "That's a tooth.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
It's a big tooth."

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.330
It's about the size of a banana.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.330
It has a big serration on the edge.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.330
This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.330
And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex,

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.330
Now, this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
Not the same one, actually. This is a cast, which I had bought,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
and then, after buying the cast, I found my own,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
and I don't have room for two.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
You know.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
So, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.330
is that it is both an intellectual thing,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.330
because you're trying to reconstruct the environment

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
of millions of years ago.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
It's something that can inform all sorts of science

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
in unexpected ways.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
The study of dinosaurs led to the realization

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
that there's a problem with asteroid impact,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
for example.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
The study of dinosaurs may, literally,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
one day save the planet.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.330
Study of the ancient climate is very important.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.330
had much higher CO2 than today,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
for the effects of CO2 on climate.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.330
But, besides being intellectually

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.330
and scientifically interesting, it's also very different

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
than the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.330
This is one of my papers: "A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod."

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
so we're not going to go into it further.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
Now, I'm also really big on photography.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
I travel all over the world taking pictures --

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
some of them good, most of them not.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
These days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that means

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
you've got to spend more time sorting through them.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.330
Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
of king penguins on a beach.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330
Here's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
I'd gone up to photograph Orcas,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
and we had looked for a week,

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
and we hadn't seen a damn Orca.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
And the last day, the sun comes out,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
the Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.330
And I get lots of pictures like this.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
Then, a little bit later,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
I start getting some pictures like this.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.330
Now, to a human audience, I need to explain that

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.330
if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition,

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.330
this would be the centerfold.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.330
It's true.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.330
So, there's more and more activity near the boat,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.330
and all of a sudden somebody shouts,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.330
"What's that in the water?"

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
I said, "Well, I think that's what you call a free willy."

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.330
(Laughter)

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
(Laughter)

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.330
The first thing you learn

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.330
is the overwhelming importance of hands.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.330
They don't have them.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.330
(Laughter)

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.330
I think Paul Simon is in the audience,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.330
and he has --

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.330
he may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.330
"Slip-Slidin' Away."

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.330
That's kind of what it's like.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.330
The other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex:

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.330
they curl their toes too.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.330
(Laughter)

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.330
So --

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.330
where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together?

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.330
You know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.330
in finding a great thing, passion in life,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.330
and focusing all your energy on it,

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
and I've never been able to do that.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.330
I just -- you know, because, yes,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.330
I'll focus passion on something,

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.330
but then there will be something else, and then there's something else again.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.330
And for a long time I fought this, and I thought,

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.330
"Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down."

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.330
And you know, when I was at Microsoft,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.330
that was so engrossing,

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.330
and the whole industry was expanding so much,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.330
that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.330
But ultimately,

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.330
I decided

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.330
that what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.330
but embrace it.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.330
And say, "Yeah, you know, I --

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.330
this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.330
but that's really what works for me."

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.330
And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.330
or metamaterials or whale sex,

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.330
the common -- or lowest common denominator -- is me.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.330
That's it, thank you.

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.330
(Applause)
