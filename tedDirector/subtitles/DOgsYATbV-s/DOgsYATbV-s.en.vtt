00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:14.056
When I was born,

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:15.736
there was really only one book

00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:17.622
about how to raise your children,

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:20.789
and it was written by Dr. Spock.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.725
(Laughter)

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:23.956
Thank you for indulging me.

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:27.562
I have always wanted to do that.

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:29.665
No, it was Benjamin Spock,

00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:33.515
and his book was called "The Common
Sense Book of Baby And Child Care."

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:39.162
It sold almost 50 million copies 
by the time he died.

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:42.807
Today, I, as the mother of a six-year-old,

00:00:42.807 --> 00:00:44.484
walk into Barnes and Noble,

00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:47.165
and see this.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:49.124
And it is amazing

00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:52.828
the variety that one finds 
on those shelves.

00:00:52.828 --> 00:00:57.250
There are guides to raising 
an eco-friendly kid,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.445
a gluten-free kid,

00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:01.810
a disease-proof kid,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.763
which, if you ask me, is a little bit creepy.

00:01:05.763 --> 00:01:08.300
There are guides to raising a bilingual kid

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.151
even if you only speak one language at home.

00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:14.767
There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:17.529
and a science-minded kid

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:20.639
and a kid who is a whiz at yoga.

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:23.849
Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.199
a nuclear bomb,

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:31.705
there is pretty much a guide to everything.

00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:34.319
All of these books are well-intentioned.

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.829
I am sure that many of them are great.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.930
But taken together, I am sorry,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.281
I do not see help

00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:49.130
when I look at that shelf.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.404
I see anxiety.

00:01:51.404 --> 00:01:54.131
I see a giant candy-colored monument

00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:57.074
to our collective panic,

00:01:57.074 --> 00:01:59.655
and it makes me want to know,

00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:02.038
why is it that raising our children

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:03.820
is associated with so much anguish

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.078
and so much confusion?

00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:08.792
Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:11.768
about the one thing human beings

00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:13.632
have been doing successfully for millennia,

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:16.468
long before parenting message boards

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:19.345
and peer-reviewed studies came along?

00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:21.998
Why is it that so many mothers and fathers

00:02:21.998 --> 00:02:28.220
experience parenthood as a kind of crisis?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.566
Crisis might seem like a strong word,

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:33.544
but there is data suggesting it probably isn't.

00:02:33.544 --> 00:02:36.300
There was, in fact, a paper of just this very name,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.386
"Parenthood as Crisis," published in 1957,

00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:42.924
and in the 50-plus years since,

00:02:42.924 --> 00:02:45.010
there has been plenty of scholarship

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.417
documenting a pretty clear pattern

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.472
of parental anguish.

00:02:49.472 --> 00:02:52.778
Parents experience more stress than non-parents.

00:02:52.778 --> 00:02:55.694
Their marital satisfaction is lower.

00:02:55.694 --> 00:02:57.211
There have been a number of studies

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:58.500
looking at how parents feel

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.917
when they are spending time with their kids,

00:03:00.917 --> 00:03:04.817
and the answer often is, not so great.

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.855
Last year, I spoke with a researcher

00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:08.151
named Matthew Killingsworth

00:03:08.151 --> 00:03:11.611
who is doing a very, very imaginative project

00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:13.509
that tracks people's happiness,

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.478
and here is what he told me he found:

00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:19.092
"Interacting with your friends

00:03:19.092 --> 00:03:22.004
is better than interacting with your spouse,

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:25.360
which is better than interacting with other relatives,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.585
which is better than interacting with acquaintances,

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:31.530
which is better than interacting with parents,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.306
which is better than interacting with children.

00:03:35.306 --> 00:03:37.306
Who are on par with strangers."

00:03:37.306 --> 00:03:41.812
(Laughter)

00:03:41.812 --> 00:03:44.179
But here's the thing.

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.257
I have been looking at what underlies these data

00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:49.168
for three years,

00:03:49.168 --> 00:03:52.394
and children are not the problem.

00:03:52.394 --> 00:03:57.381
Something about parenting right now at this moment

00:03:57.381 --> 00:03:59.421
is the problem.

00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:01.910
Specifically, I don't think we know

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.426
what parenting is supposed to be.

00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:06.606
Parent, as a verb,

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:10.868
only entered common usage in 1970.

00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:14.190
Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.031
The roles of our children have changed.

00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:19.373
We are all now furiously improvising

00:04:19.373 --> 00:04:21.279
our way through a situation

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.872
for which there is no script,

00:04:24.872 --> 00:04:26.913
and if you're an amazing jazz musician,

00:04:26.913 --> 00:04:29.100
then improv is great,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.505
but for the rest of us,

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:35.321
it can kind of feel like a crisis.

00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:37.901
So how did we get here?

00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.017
How is it that we are all now navigating

00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:41.569
a child-rearing universe

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.397
without any norms to guide us?

00:04:44.397 --> 00:04:46.557
Well, for starters, there has been

00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:48.396
a major historical change.

00:04:48.396 --> 00:04:50.589
Until fairly recently,

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:54.301
kids worked, on our farms primarily,

00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:57.169
but also in factories, mills, mines.

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.085
Kids were considered economic assets.

00:05:00.085 --> 00:05:02.181
Sometime during the Progressive Era,

00:05:02.181 --> 00:05:03.809
we put an end to this arrangement.

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:06.080
We recognized kids had rights,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.600
we banned child labor,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.370
we focused on education instead,

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.546
and school became a child's new work.

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:15.252
And thank God it did.

00:05:15.252 --> 00:05:17.649
But that only made a parent's role

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:19.420
more confusing in a way.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.972
The old arrangement might not have been

00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:24.090
particularly ethical, but it was reciprocal.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.446
We provided food, clothing, shelter,

00:05:26.446 --> 00:05:28.570
and moral instruction to our kids,

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.210
and they in return provided income.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.178
Once kids stopped working,

00:05:36.178 --> 00:05:39.482
the economics of parenting changed.

00:05:39.482 --> 00:05:42.054
Kids became, in the words of one

00:05:42.054 --> 00:05:45.496
brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist,

00:05:45.496 --> 00:05:50.258
"economically worthless but emotionally priceless."

00:05:50.258 --> 00:05:52.649
Rather than them working for us,

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:54.552
we began to work for them,

00:05:54.552 --> 00:05:56.412
because within only a matter of decades

00:05:56.412 --> 00:05:57.820
it became clear:

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.190
if we wanted our kids to succeed,

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.183
school was not enough.

00:06:03.183 --> 00:06:07.980
Today, extracurricular activities are a kid's new work,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.737
but that's work for us too,

00:06:09.737 --> 00:06:12.920
because we are the ones
driving them to soccer practice.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.783
Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work,

00:06:15.783 --> 00:06:17.351
but that's also work for us,

00:06:17.351 --> 00:06:19.462
because we have to check it.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.787
About three years ago, a Texas woman

00:06:21.787 --> 00:06:22.841
told something to me

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:26.120
that totally broke my heart.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.160
She said, almost casually,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.594
"Homework is the new dinner."

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:37.194
The middle class now pours all of its time

00:06:37.194 --> 00:06:40.636
and energy and resources into its kids,

00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:41.989
even though the middle class

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:45.602
has less and less of those things to give.

00:06:45.602 --> 00:06:48.886
Mothers now spend more time with their children

00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:51.269
than they did in 1965,

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:56.663
when most women were not even in the workforce.

00:06:56.663 --> 00:06:58.775
It would probably be easier for parents

00:06:58.775 --> 00:07:00.166
to do their new roles

00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:03.731
if they knew what they were preparing their kids for.

00:07:03.731 --> 00:07:06.175
This is yet another thing that
makes modern parenting

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:08.245
so very confounding.

00:07:08.245 --> 00:07:11.933
We have no clue what portion our wisdom, if any,

00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:13.690
is of use to our kids.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.123
The world is changing so rapidly,

00:07:15.123 --> 00:07:17.326
it's impossible to say.

00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:19.401
This was true even when I was young.

00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:22.425
When I was a kid, high school specifically,

00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:24.409
I was told that I would be at sea

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:26.194
in the new global economy

00:07:26.194 --> 00:07:30.700
if I did not know Japanese.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.202
And with all due respect to the Japanese,

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:35.643
it didn't turn out that way.

00:07:35.643 --> 00:07:37.931
Now there is a certain kind of middle-class parent

00:07:37.931 --> 00:07:40.635
that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin,

00:07:40.635 --> 00:07:43.245
and maybe they're onto something,

00:07:43.245 --> 00:07:45.980
but we cannot know for sure.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.609
So, absent being able to anticipate the future,

00:07:48.609 --> 00:07:51.234
what we all do, as good parents,

00:07:51.234 --> 00:07:53.161
is try and prepare our kids

00:07:53.161 --> 00:07:56.209
for every possible kind of future,

00:07:56.209 --> 00:08:00.266
hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off.

00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:02.194
We teach our kids chess,

00:08:02.194 --> 00:08:04.829
thinking maybe they will need analytical skills.

00:08:04.829 --> 00:08:07.274
We sign them up for team sports,

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:10.561
thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills,

00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:13.081
you know, for when they go
to Harvard Business School.

00:08:13.081 --> 00:08:16.310
We try and teach them to be financially savvy

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.767
and science-minded and eco-friendly

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:22.733
and gluten-free,

00:08:22.733 --> 00:08:24.705
though now is probably a good time to tell you

00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:30.245
that I was not eco-friendly and gluten-free as a child.

00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:35.035
I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef.

00:08:35.035 --> 00:08:37.212
And you know what? I'm doing okay.

00:08:37.212 --> 00:08:39.625
I pay my taxes.

00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:42.842
I hold down a steady job.

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:47.170
I was even invited to speak at TED.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.552
But the presumption now is that

00:08:48.552 --> 00:08:51.950
what was good enough for me,
or for my folks for that matter,

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.761
isn't good enough anymore.

00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:57.425
So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf,

00:08:57.425 --> 00:09:00.737
because we feel like if we aren't trying everything,

00:09:00.737 --> 00:09:02.867
it's as if we're doing nothing

00:09:02.867 --> 00:09:08.204
and we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids.

00:09:08.204 --> 00:09:10.812
So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles

00:09:10.812 --> 00:09:12.334
as mothers and fathers.

00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:14.780
Now add to this problem something else:

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.708
we are also navigating new roles

00:09:16.708 --> 00:09:18.312
as husbands and wives

00:09:18.312 --> 00:09:21.960
because most women today are in the workforce.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.490
This is another reason, I think,

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.812
that parenthood feels like a crisis.

00:09:25.812 --> 00:09:28.462
We have no rules, no scripts, no norms

00:09:28.462 --> 00:09:31.002
for what to do when a child comes along

00:09:31.002 --> 00:09:34.193
now that both mom and dad are breadwinners.

00:09:34.193 --> 00:09:36.598
The writer Michael Lewis once put this

00:09:36.598 --> 00:09:37.835
very, very well.

00:09:37.835 --> 00:09:40.347
He said that the surest way

00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:42.142
for a couple to start fighting

00:09:42.142 --> 00:09:45.170
is for them to go out to dinner with another couple

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.355
whose division of labor

00:09:46.355 --> 00:09:49.965
is ever so slightly different from theirs,

00:09:49.965 --> 00:09:53.641
because the conversation in
the car on the way home

00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:55.858
goes something like this:

00:09:56.775 --> 00:10:01.408
"So, did you catch that Dave is the one

00:10:01.408 --> 00:10:05.309
who walks them to school every morning?"

00:10:05.309 --> 00:10:09.130
(Laughter)

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:12.257
Without scripts telling us who does what

00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:15.306
in this brave new world, couples fight,

00:10:15.306 --> 00:10:18.545
and both mothers and fathers each have

00:10:18.545 --> 00:10:20.475
their legitimate gripes.

00:10:20.475 --> 00:10:22.330
Mothers are much more likely

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.408
to be multi-tasking when they are at home,

00:10:24.408 --> 00:10:26.619
and fathers, when they are at home,

00:10:26.619 --> 00:10:29.578
are much more likely to be mono-tasking.

00:10:29.578 --> 00:10:32.146
Find a guy at home, and odds are

00:10:32.146 --> 00:10:35.907
he is doing just one thing at a time.

00:10:35.907 --> 00:10:38.811
In fact, UCLA recently did a study

00:10:38.811 --> 00:10:41.344
looking at the most common configuration

00:10:41.344 --> 00:10:44.390
of family members in middle-class homes.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.123
Guess what it was?

00:10:46.123 --> 00:10:48.770
Dad in a room by himself.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.210
According to the American Time Use Survey,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.435
mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers,

00:10:54.435 --> 00:10:58.034
which is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day,

00:10:58.034 --> 00:11:00.300
but I still think that something she wrote

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.172
is highly relevant:

00:11:03.172 --> 00:11:06.890
"I have not been alone in the
bathroom since October."

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.224
(Laughter)

00:11:11.224 --> 00:11:16.054
But here is the thing: Men are doing plenty.

00:11:16.054 --> 00:11:17.830
They spend more time with their kids

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.164
than their fathers ever spent with them.

00:11:21.164 --> 00:11:23.144
They work more paid hours, on average,

00:11:23.144 --> 00:11:24.837
than their wives,

00:11:24.837 --> 00:11:26.671
and they genuinely want to be good,

00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:28.250
involved dads.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.618
Today, it is fathers, not mothers,

00:11:31.618 --> 00:11:35.729
who report the most work-life conflict.

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:37.961
Either way, by the way,

00:11:37.961 --> 00:11:40.296
if you think it's hard for traditional families

00:11:40.296 --> 00:11:41.920
to sort out these new roles,

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.756
just imagine what it's like now

00:11:43.756 --> 00:11:45.651
for non-traditional families:

00:11:45.651 --> 00:11:48.246
families with two dads, families with two moms,

00:11:48.246 --> 00:11:49.951
single-parent households.

00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:54.344
They are truly improvising as they go.

00:11:54.344 --> 00:11:58.135
Now, in a more progressive country,

00:11:58.135 --> 00:12:00.865
and forgive me here for capitulating to cliché

00:12:00.865 --> 00:12:03.919
and invoking, yes, Sweden,

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:06.840
parents could rely on the state

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.489
for support.

00:12:09.489 --> 00:12:11.368
There are countries that acknowledge

00:12:11.368 --> 00:12:12.801
the anxieties and the changing roles

00:12:12.801 --> 00:12:15.165
of mothers and fathers.

00:12:15.165 --> 00:12:18.429
Unfortunately, the United States is not one of them,

00:12:18.429 --> 00:12:20.394
so in case you were wondering what the U.S.

00:12:20.394 --> 00:12:25.697
has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia,

00:12:25.697 --> 00:12:28.728
it's this:

00:12:28.728 --> 00:12:32.455
We too have no paid maternity leave policy.

00:12:32.455 --> 00:12:39.702
We are one of eight known countries that does not.

00:12:39.702 --> 00:12:43.273
In this age of intense confusion,

00:12:43.273 --> 00:12:46.675
there is just one goal upon which

00:12:46.675 --> 00:12:48.507
all parents can agree,

00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:49.971
and that is whether they are

00:12:49.971 --> 00:12:54.537
tiger moms or hippie moms, helicopters or drones,

00:12:54.537 --> 00:12:58.678
our kids' happiness is paramount.

00:12:58.678 --> 00:13:00.560
That is what it means

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.010
to raise kids in an age

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.235
when they are economically worthless

00:13:05.235 --> 00:13:07.480
but emotionally priceless.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.880
We are all the custodians of their self-esteem.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.713
The one mantra no parent ever questions is,

00:13:14.713 --> 00:13:20.444
"All I want is for my children to be happy."

00:13:20.444 --> 00:13:22.157
And don't get me wrong:

00:13:22.157 --> 00:13:27.037
I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child.

00:13:27.037 --> 00:13:30.743
But it is a very elusive one.

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:34.683
Happiness and self-confidence,

00:13:34.683 --> 00:13:36.664
teaching children that is not like teaching them

00:13:36.664 --> 00:13:38.180
how to plow a field.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.881
It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike.

00:13:40.881 --> 00:13:43.438
There's no curriculum for it.

00:13:43.438 --> 00:13:47.035
Happiness and self-confidence can
be the byproducts of other things,

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:50.090
but they cannot really be goals unto themselves.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.756
A child's happiness

00:13:51.756 --> 00:13:55.511
is a very unfair burden to place on a parent.

00:13:55.521 --> 00:13:58.359
And happiness is an even more unfair burden

00:13:58.359 --> 00:14:01.199
to place on a kid.

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:03.222
And I have to tell you,

00:14:03.222 --> 00:14:07.104
I think it leads to some very strange excesses.

00:14:07.104 --> 00:14:09.506
We are now so anxious

00:14:09.506 --> 00:14:12.824
to protect our kids from the world's ugliness

00:14:12.824 --> 00:14:17.576
that we now shield them from "Sesame Street."

00:14:17.576 --> 00:14:19.712
I wish I could say I was kidding about this,

00:14:19.712 --> 00:14:22.384
but if you go out and you buy

00:14:22.384 --> 00:14:25.323
the first few episodes of "Sesame Street" on DVD,

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:28.404
as I did out of nostalgia,

00:14:28.404 --> 00:14:31.517
you will find a warning at the beginning

00:14:31.517 --> 00:14:34.147
saying that the content is not suitable

00:14:34.147 --> 00:14:35.915
for children.

00:14:35.915 --> 00:14:38.025
(Laughter)

00:14:38.025 --> 00:14:39.230
Can I just repeat that?

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.861
The content of the original "Sesame Street"

00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:45.203
is not suitable for children.

00:14:45.203 --> 00:14:48.845
When asked about this by The New York Times,

00:14:48.845 --> 00:14:52.150
a producer for the show gave
a variety of explanations.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.909
One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe

00:14:54.909 --> 00:14:56.670
in one skit and then swallowed it.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.105
Bad modeling. I don't know.

00:14:58.105 --> 00:15:01.087
But the thing that stuck with me

00:15:01.087 --> 00:15:03.542
is she said that she didn't know

00:15:03.542 --> 00:15:07.881
whether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today

00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:12.779
because he was too depressive.

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:15.187
I cannot tell you how much this distresses me.

00:15:15.187 --> 00:15:16.706
(Laughter)

00:15:16.706 --> 00:15:18.559
You are looking at a woman

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:21.603
who has a periodic table of the Muppets

00:15:21.603 --> 00:15:25.395
hanging from her cubicle wall.

00:15:25.395 --> 00:15:29.154
The offending muppet, right there.

00:15:30.239 --> 00:15:35.025
That's my son the day he was born.

00:15:35.025 --> 00:15:37.217
I was high as a kite on morphine.

00:15:37.217 --> 00:15:41.080
I had had an unexpected C-section.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.596
But even in my opiate haze,

00:15:44.596 --> 00:15:47.529
I managed to have one very clear thought

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:50.481
the first time I held him.

00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:52.385
I whispered it into his ear.

00:15:52.385 --> 00:16:01.269
I said, "I will try so hard not to hurt you."

00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:02.589
It was the Hippocratic Oath,

00:16:02.589 --> 00:16:06.467
and I didn't even know I was saying it.

00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:08.791
But it occurs to me now

00:16:08.791 --> 00:16:10.870
that the Hippocratic Oath

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:15.202
is a much more realistic aim than happiness.

00:16:15.202 --> 00:16:18.802
In fact, as any parent will tell you,

00:16:18.802 --> 00:16:21.570
it's awfully hard.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:26.424
All of us have said or done hurtful things

00:16:26.424 --> 00:16:32.398
that we wish to God we could take back.

00:16:32.398 --> 00:16:35.246
I think in another era

00:16:35.246 --> 00:16:39.238
we did not expect quite so much from ourselves,

00:16:39.238 --> 00:16:42.920
and it is important that we all remember that

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.754
the next time we are staring with our hearts racing

00:16:46.754 --> 00:16:50.800
at those bookshelves.

00:16:52.254 --> 00:16:55.508
I'm not really sure how to create new norms

00:16:55.508 --> 00:16:57.186
for this world,

00:16:57.186 --> 00:17:00.270
but I do think that

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.588
in our desperate quest to create happy kids,

00:17:03.588 --> 00:17:06.615
we may be assuming the wrong moral burden.

00:17:06.615 --> 00:17:08.333
It strikes me as a better goal,

00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:10.549
and, dare I say, a more virtuous one,

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:13.268
to focus on making productive kids

00:17:13.268 --> 00:17:14.608
and moral kids,

00:17:14.608 --> 00:17:16.924
and to simply hope that happiness will come to them

00:17:16.924 --> 00:17:19.670
by virtue of the good that they do

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.898
and their accomplishments

00:17:21.898 --> 00:17:24.796
and the love that they feel from us.

00:17:24.796 --> 00:17:30.429
That, anyway, is one response to having no script.

00:17:30.429 --> 00:17:33.762
Absent having new scripts,

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:37.447
we just follow the oldest ones in the book --

00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:43.046
decency, a work ethic, love —

00:17:43.046 --> 00:17:47.370
and let happiness and self-esteem
take care of themselves.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.414
I think if we all did that,

00:17:49.414 --> 00:17:52.955
the kids would still be all right,

00:17:52.955 --> 00:17:55.601
and so would their parents,

00:17:55.601 --> 00:17:59.569
possibly in both cases even better.

00:17:59.569 --> 00:18:01.448
Thank you.

00:18:01.448 --> 00:18:05.448
(Applause)
