00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:14.074
First of all, for those of you who

00:00:14.074 --> 00:00:16.413
are not familiar with my work,

00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:19.215
I create multicultural characters,

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:22.140
so characters from lots of different backgrounds.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.397
So before the present is the new future,

00:00:24.397 --> 00:00:27.839
a bit about the past is that I grew up in a family

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.478
that was multi-everything -- multi-racial, multi-cultural,

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:33.059
black and white, Caribbean,

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.844
Irish-American, German-American.

00:00:34.844 --> 00:00:39.028
There was Dominican
music blasting from stereos.

00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:41.910
There were Christians and Jews.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.730
That's a long story filled with

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.412
intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame.

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:50.900
But I was totally immersed in this world

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.962
that was filled with everybody,

00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:56.002
and then I went on to the United Nations school,

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.688
and that just completely —

00:00:57.688 --> 00:01:01.771
So I began sort of developing these voices

00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:03.657
and these people,

00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:06.027
all of whom were loosely based
on people I really know,

00:01:06.027 --> 00:01:10.210
and so, for example, in performing them,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.168
I would really try to inhabit them.

00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:13.525
And for example,

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:15.700
I don't really talk like that,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.494
but that was one of my people,

00:01:18.494 --> 00:01:21.578
and I'm going to bring a few of my friends --

00:01:21.578 --> 00:01:23.130
I think of them as my friends —

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.612
to this stage, in this spirit of the idea

00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:28.004
that the present is the new future,

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:29.960
in sort of a meta way,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.950
because I thought about it, and the future, for me,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.428
what can be so frightening

00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:35.394
is that I don't know what's coming.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:36.856
I don't know if that's true for other people,

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:39.144
but that notion of thinking about

00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:42.327
how we can understand the future

00:01:42.327 --> 00:01:43.998
and predict outcomes,

00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:48.392
for me, it's terrifying to not
know what might be coming.

00:01:48.392 --> 00:01:50.850
And so the idea that there are questions

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.370
that I've never seen

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.846
that my people are going to answer,

00:01:54.846 --> 00:01:56.586
and some of these characters
have been with me for ages,

00:01:56.586 --> 00:01:58.340
some of them don't even have names,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.910
I don't know what's going to happen.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.608
I don't know what's coming,

00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:04.403
and all I can do is remind myself

00:02:04.403 --> 00:02:06.734
that I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants,

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:08.608
and now that I'm up here it sort of feels like

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:11.308
that dream where you don't have any pants on,

00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:13.080
and so I suppose I'm going to be

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.507
flying by the seat of my ass.

00:02:16.507 --> 00:02:18.405
That said, let's just see who comes out.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:19.840
May we have the first question:

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.024
"Do you ever get headaches

00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:23.582
from the microchips implanted in your brain?"

00:02:23.582 --> 00:02:26.860
Right.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.460
Okay.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.460
Well first of all, I'll just say

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.976
that I hope you can hear me okay.

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:36.116
My name is Lorraine Levine,

00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:42.090
and the idea of microchips implanted in my brain,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.410
frankly, just putting on my glasses reminds me

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.140
of thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.328
No offense to them. I'm glad that you all enjoy them,

00:02:53.328 --> 00:02:54.904
but at my age,

00:02:54.904 --> 00:02:57.118
just putting on the regular ones I have

00:02:57.118 --> 00:02:59.724
already gives me too much information.

00:02:59.724 --> 00:03:01.950
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.890
I don't need to know more. I don't want to know.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.540
That's it. That's enough.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.649
I love you all. You're wonderful.

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.402
It's fabulous to be here with such big machers

00:03:11.402 --> 00:03:14.393
again this year. Mwah!

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:17.919
Okay, next question. (Applause)

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.896
Next, please.

00:03:19.896 --> 00:03:20.992
"Is dating boring,

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.576
now that humans reproduce asexually?"

00:03:23.576 --> 00:03:27.436
Who do we got?

00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:30.276
Hi, um, okay, hi everybody.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:31.820
My name is Nereida.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.148
I just want to say first of all

00:03:33.148 --> 00:03:35.670
that dating is never boring under any circumstance.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.390
But I am very excited to be here right now,

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.804
so I am just trying to remind myself that,

00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:41.589
you know, like, the purpose
of being here and everything,

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:44.294
I mean, trying to answer these
questions, it is very exciting.

00:03:44.294 --> 00:03:46.190
But I also, I just need to acknowledge

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.782
that TED is an incredible experience right now

00:03:48.782 --> 00:03:50.732
in the present, like, I just need to say, like,

00:03:50.732 --> 00:03:52.972
Isabel Allende. Isabel Allende!

00:03:52.972 --> 00:03:54.544
Okay, maybe it doesn't mean,

00:03:54.544 --> 00:03:55.840
of course it means something to you,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.400
but to me, it's like, another level, okay?

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.459
Because I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.317
that there are role models here that I can really,

00:04:02.317 --> 00:04:03.815
I don't know, I just need to say that.

00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:06.593
That's incredible to me, and sometimes
when I'm nervous and everything like that,

00:04:06.593 --> 00:04:08.933
I just need to, like, say some affirmations

00:04:08.933 --> 00:04:11.337
that can help me.

00:04:11.337 --> 00:04:13.395
I usually just try to use, like, the three little words

00:04:13.395 --> 00:04:15.879
that always make me feel better:

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.860
Sotomayor, Sotomayor, Sotomayor. (Laughter)

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.617
Just, it really helps me to get grounded.

00:04:20.617 --> 00:04:22.914
Now I can use Allende, Allende, Allende,

00:04:22.914 --> 00:04:24.480
and, you know, I just need to say it, like,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.914
it's so incredible to be here, and I knew
that we were going to have these questions.

00:04:26.914 --> 00:04:29.167
I was so nervous and I was thinking
just, like, oh my God, oh my God,

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:31.144
and reminding me, because
I've had, like, some very,

00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:32.737
especially since the last time we were here at TED,

00:04:32.737 --> 00:04:34.063
it was, like, unbelievable,

00:04:34.063 --> 00:04:35.267
and then right after that, like,

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:36.221
so many crazy things happened, like,

00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:37.965
we ended up going to the White House to perform.

00:04:37.965 --> 00:04:39.189
That was, like, amazing,

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:40.209
and I'm standing there,

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:41.719
and I was just like, please don't say, "Oh my God."

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:42.473
Don't say, "Oh my God."

00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:44.480
And I just kept saying it: "Oh my God. Oh my God."

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.416
And, you know, I kept thinking to myself, like,

00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:49.171
President Obama has to come
up here at the same podium,

00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:50.511
and I'm standing here saying, "Oh my God."

00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:51.864
It's like, the separation of church and state.

00:04:51.864 --> 00:04:53.781
It's just, I couldn't, like, I couldn't process.

00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:54.946
It was really too much.

00:04:54.946 --> 00:04:56.900
So I think I've lost my way.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.675
But what I wanted to say is that dating, for me,

00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:01.421
you know, as far as I'm concerned,

00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:04.040
however you reproduce, as long
as you're enjoying yourself

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.110
and it's with another consenting
asexual -- I don't know.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.430
You know where I'm going with that.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.501
Okay, ciao, gracias.

00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:14.023
Okay, next question. (Applause)

00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:18.719
What are your top five favorite songs right now?

00:05:22.472 --> 00:05:24.500
All right, well first of all, I'mma say,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.840
you know what I'm saying, I'm
the only dude up here right now.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.479
My name is Rashid,

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.902
and I never been at TED before,

00:05:31.902 --> 00:05:32.737
you know what I'm saying.

00:05:32.737 --> 00:05:36.029
I think, Sarah Jones, maybe she
didn't want me to come out last time.

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.012
I don't know why. You know what I'm saying.

00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:40.566
Obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED.

00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:42.898
You know what I'm saying.

00:05:42.898 --> 00:05:45.235
First of all, that I'm in hip hop,
you know what I'm saying.

00:05:45.235 --> 00:05:47.071
I know some of y'all may be not really

00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:48.255
as much into the music,

00:05:48.255 --> 00:05:50.253
but the first way y'all can always know,

00:05:50.253 --> 00:05:52.257
you know what I'm saying, that I'm in hip hop,

00:05:52.257 --> 00:05:54.735
is 'cos I hold the microphone

00:05:54.735 --> 00:05:56.487
in an official emcee posture.

00:05:56.487 --> 00:05:57.615
Y'all can see that right there.

00:05:57.615 --> 00:05:59.193
That's how you hold it.

00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:01.261
All right, so you get your little tutorial right there.

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:04.160
But when Sarah Jones told me
we was gonna come up here,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.737
I was like, betch, you know what I'm saying,

00:06:05.737 --> 00:06:07.993
TED is real fly, I got a whole lot of dope,

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:10.217
you know what I'm saying,
shit going on and everything,

00:06:10.217 --> 00:06:11.189
but she was like, yeah,

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.147
we're going to have to answer,
like, some random questions,

00:06:14.147 --> 00:06:15.805
just like, and I was like, what the hell is that?

00:06:15.805 --> 00:06:17.135
You know what I'm saying, just stand up there

00:06:17.135 --> 00:06:18.640
and answer some random questions?

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.675
I don't want to,

00:06:19.675 --> 00:06:21.733
I mean, it's like an intellectual stop-and-frisk.

00:06:21.733 --> 00:06:22.909
You know what I'm saying? (Laughter)

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:24.615
I don't want to be standing up there just

00:06:24.615 --> 00:06:26.539
all getting interrogated and whatnot.

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:27.607
That's what I'm trying to leave behind

00:06:27.607 --> 00:06:29.215
in New York. You know what I'm saying?

00:06:29.215 --> 00:06:32.687
So anyway, I would have to say
my top five songs right now

00:06:32.687 --> 00:06:35.201
is all out of my own personal catalogue,

00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:36.678
you know what I mean?

00:06:36.678 --> 00:06:38.155
So if you want to know more about that,

00:06:38.155 --> 00:06:39.059
you know what I'm saying,

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:41.526
we could talk about the anti-piracy and all that,

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.051
but as far as I'm concerned,

00:06:43.051 --> 00:06:44.867
you know, I believe in creative commons,

00:06:44.867 --> 00:06:47.597
and I think it's really important that, you know,

00:06:47.597 --> 00:06:49.933
that needs to be sustainable and everything,

00:06:49.933 --> 00:06:52.617
and I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

00:06:52.617 --> 00:06:53.883
I mean, this right here,

00:06:53.883 --> 00:06:55.717
this environment, I would like to sustain.

00:06:55.717 --> 00:06:57.101
You know what I mean?

00:06:57.101 --> 00:06:59.565
But I'm just saying, if y'all are interested

00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:01.593
in the top five songs, you need to holler at me.

00:07:01.593 --> 00:07:03.161
You know what I'm saying?

00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:05.483
Aight? In the future or the present. Yeah.

00:07:05.483 --> 00:07:07.040
Enjoy the rest of it.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.231
Okay, next question.

00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:10.893
What do you got?

00:07:10.893 --> 00:07:12.821
"How many of your organs have been 3D printed?"

00:07:12.821 --> 00:07:16.851
(Laughter)

00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:18.969
Well I have to say that I don't know about

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:20.256
how many of my organs

00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:22.835
have been 3-D printed as such,

00:07:22.835 --> 00:07:25.990
but I can tell you that it is so challenging to me,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.334
kind of thinking about this concept of the future

00:07:28.334 --> 00:07:31.007
and that, you know, all around the world

00:07:31.007 --> 00:07:35.070
parents are kind of telling their small children,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.547
please, you have to eat that, you know,

00:07:36.547 --> 00:07:39.271
I have slaved over a hot 3D printer all day

00:07:39.271 --> 00:07:40.910
so that you can have this meal.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.515
You know, that kind of thing.

00:07:43.515 --> 00:07:46.375
And of course now that we have changed, you know,

00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:48.303
from the global South, there is this total

00:07:48.303 --> 00:07:51.967
kind of perspective shift that is happening around the --

00:07:51.967 --> 00:07:53.213
You can't just say to them,

00:07:53.213 --> 00:07:55.040
well, there are starving children.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.991
Well, it is the future.

00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:59.091
Nobody is starving anymore, thank God.

00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:03.164
But as you can tell I have kind of that optimism,

00:08:03.164 --> 00:08:05.428
and I do hope that we can continue

00:08:05.428 --> 00:08:07.221
to kind of 3D print,

00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:09.695
well, let us just say I like to think that

00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:12.109
even in the future we will have the publication,

00:08:12.109 --> 00:08:15.955
kind of, you know, all the food that's fit to print.

00:08:15.955 --> 00:08:18.217
But everybody, please do enjoy that,

00:08:18.227 --> 00:08:20.270
and again, I think that you do throw

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.107
a cracking good party here at TED.

00:08:22.107 --> 00:08:24.037
Thank you.

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:28.327
Next question. (Applause)

00:08:28.327 --> 00:08:35.421
What has changed? Okay, it's like,

00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:37.743
I have to think about that.

00:08:37.743 --> 00:08:42.444
"What has changed now that women run the world?"

00:08:42.444 --> 00:08:44.388
First of all,

00:08:44.388 --> 00:08:46.271
I really, like, I just want to say,

00:08:46.271 --> 00:08:47.733
and my name is Bella,

00:08:47.733 --> 00:08:50.155
I just want to, like, identify myself,

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:53.825
that, like, as a feminist,

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:58.657
I, like, I really find that, like,

00:08:58.657 --> 00:09:01.130
because I was born in the '90s,

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:06.439
and, like, there were a lot of women who were

00:09:06.439 --> 00:09:08.620
as far as feminism was concerned,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.306
like, maybe they didn't understand that, like,

00:09:11.306 --> 00:09:14.706
a feminist like me, like,

00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:17.354
I don't think it's required that you have to have

00:09:17.354 --> 00:09:19.384
a certain kind of voice,

00:09:19.384 --> 00:09:22.027
or, like, a certain way of presenting yourself

00:09:22.027 --> 00:09:23.620
to be feminist, because I think that, like,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.370
feminism can be really hot,

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.764
and I think actually that it's really vital and important.

00:09:29.764 --> 00:09:32.170
Like, the quotation I'm wearing is from, like,

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.674
Gloria Steinem,

00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:37.510
and, like, I'm named Bella for, like, Bella Abzug,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.512
who's, like, obviously, like, a really
important feminist from, like, history,

00:09:41.512 --> 00:09:45.070
and like, I just think that those women, like,

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.860
really represent, like, that you can, like,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.486
be vital and, like, amazing,

00:09:50.486 --> 00:09:52.273
like, a-mazing,

00:09:52.273 --> 00:09:53.830
and you don't have to wear, like,

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.565
an Eileen Fisher caftan,

00:09:56.565 --> 00:09:59.360
just to, like, prove that you are a feminist.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.193
Like, not that there's anything wrong with that,

00:10:02.193 --> 00:10:05.031
but my mom, she's like, like,

00:10:05.031 --> 00:10:09.170
why do you have to wear pants that, like,

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.625
objectify your body? I like my pants.

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:15.626
Like, I like my voice.

00:10:15.626 --> 00:10:17.857
Like, she's like, why do you have to talk like —

00:10:17.857 --> 00:10:21.321
Talk like what? Like, I'm expressing myself,

00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:22.993
and I think that we have to, like,

00:10:22.993 --> 00:10:25.870
reach out, like, not only across, like,

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.161
the different generations of feminists,

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:34.496
but also across the, like, vocal ranges,

00:10:34.496 --> 00:10:37.537
so that, like, we,

00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:39.948
because otherwise it's just, like,

00:10:39.948 --> 00:10:42.417
restriculous within feminism,

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:45.789
which is just, like, a word that I created

00:10:45.789 --> 00:10:48.961
that means, like, so strict it's ridiculous.

00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:50.993
So that's my feeling about that.

00:10:50.993 --> 00:10:53.873
You guys are a-mazing, by the way.

00:10:53.873 --> 00:10:56.983
Okay. Next question.

00:10:56.983 --> 00:10:58.601
(Applause)

00:10:58.601 --> 00:11:02.355
["They've discovered a cure for cancer,
but not baldness? What's up with that?"]

00:11:03.749 --> 00:11:05.215
Yeah, you know what,

00:11:05.215 --> 00:11:07.439
so my name is Joseph Mancuso.

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:10.743
First of all, I just want to say that I appreciate

00:11:10.743 --> 00:11:13.693
that TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd,

00:11:13.693 --> 00:11:17.123
a pretty orderly group.

00:11:17.123 --> 00:11:19.632
And, you know, I just have to say,

00:11:19.632 --> 00:11:21.932
the whole thing with baldness,

00:11:21.932 --> 00:11:26.733
and, you know, here's the thing.

00:11:26.733 --> 00:11:30.288
As long as the woman, in my case --

00:11:30.288 --> 00:11:31.425
because it's a modern world,

00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:34.328
do whatever you want to do, I don't
have any problem with anybody,

00:11:34.328 --> 00:11:39.195
enjoy yourself, LGBTQLMNOP. All right?

00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:42.182
But as far as I'm concerned,

00:11:42.182 --> 00:11:43.595
attractiveness,

00:11:43.595 --> 00:11:45.745
women don't really care

00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:47.848
as much as you think they do

00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:49.242
about the, you know.

00:11:49.242 --> 00:11:50.617
I mean, I remember hearing this woman.

00:11:50.617 --> 00:11:53.459
She loved her husband, it was the sweetest thing.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:55.304
It's a pretty young girl, you know?

00:11:55.304 --> 00:11:56.845
And this guy's older.

00:11:56.845 --> 00:12:00.050
And, you know, she said she would love him

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.260
even if he had snow on the roof

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.260
or even if melted and disappeared altogether.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.880
As far as I'm concerned, it's about the love.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.542
Am I right, or am I right?

00:12:10.542 --> 00:12:12.528
So that's it. That's it. That's it.

00:12:12.528 --> 00:12:13.304
I don't got nothing more to say.

00:12:13.304 --> 00:12:15.022
Keep your noses clean.

00:12:15.022 --> 00:12:19.476
All right, next question.

00:12:19.476 --> 00:12:23.557
"Have you ever tasted meat that's not lab grown?"

00:12:26.057 --> 00:12:30.610
Um, well, I,

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.730
I want to start by saying

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.248
that this is a very difficult experience

00:12:37.248 --> 00:12:42.564
for a Chinese-American.

00:12:42.564 --> 00:12:45.637
I don't know what to call myself now,

00:12:45.637 --> 00:12:49.951
because I have really my Chinese identity,

00:12:49.951 --> 00:12:56.112
but my kids, they are American-Chinese,

00:12:56.112 --> 00:13:00.503
but it's difficult to try to express myself

00:13:00.503 --> 00:13:06.295
in front of audience of people like this.

00:13:06.295 --> 00:13:13.657
But if had to give my opinion about meat,

00:13:13.657 --> 00:13:18.621
I think first, the most important thing is to say

00:13:18.621 --> 00:13:24.369
that we don't have to have perfect food,

00:13:24.369 --> 00:13:29.299
but maybe it can also not be poison.

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:34.395
Maybe we can have some middle ground for that.

00:13:34.395 --> 00:13:38.113
But I will continue to consider this idea,

00:13:38.113 --> 00:13:42.879
and I will report back maybe next year.

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:44.129
Next.

00:13:44.129 --> 00:13:47.197
Next. Next. (Applause)

00:13:47.197 --> 00:13:52.573
"Will there ever be a post-racial world?"

00:13:54.387 --> 00:13:56.771
Thank you for having me.

00:13:56.771 --> 00:14:01.791
My name is Gary Weaselhead. Enjoy that.

00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:04.111
I'm a member of the Blackfeet Nation.

00:14:04.111 --> 00:14:08.122
I'm also half Lakota, but that is my given name,

00:14:08.122 --> 00:14:11.411
and no, even though it would have seemed

00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:12.987
like an obvious choice,

00:14:12.987 --> 00:14:16.964
no, I did not go into politics.

00:14:18.058 --> 00:14:19.302
Tough crowd.

00:14:19.302 --> 00:14:20.312
(Laughter)

00:14:20.312 --> 00:14:23.575
But I always like to just let people know

00:14:23.575 --> 00:14:27.432
when they ask about race or those kinds of things,

00:14:27.432 --> 00:14:32.168
you know, as a member of
the First Nations community,

00:14:32.168 --> 00:14:36.048
you know, I'm probably

00:14:36.048 --> 00:14:37.800
not your typical guy.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.773
For example, in addition to being an activist,

00:14:40.773 --> 00:14:44.908
I'm also a professional stand-up comedian.

00:14:44.908 --> 00:14:48.348
(Laughter)

00:14:48.348 --> 00:14:53.764
And, you know, I'm most popular

00:14:53.764 --> 00:14:55.787
on college and university campuses.

00:14:55.787 --> 00:15:00.424
You know, whenever they want to do a diversity day,

00:15:00.424 --> 00:15:06.310
or hey-we're-not-all-white week,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.418
then I'm there. (Laughter)

00:15:08.418 --> 00:15:12.100
Do I think there will ever be a post-racial world?

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.121
I think, really, I can't talk about race

00:15:15.121 --> 00:15:18.190
without remembering that it is a construct

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.381
in certain respects,

00:15:20.381 --> 00:15:22.907
but also that, you know,

00:15:22.907 --> 00:15:26.493
until we redress the wrongs of the past,

00:15:26.493 --> 00:15:28.041
we're going to be turned around.

00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:32.010
I don't care if the present is the new future.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.716
I think there's a lot of great people here at TED

00:15:33.716 --> 00:15:35.822
who are working to address that,

00:15:35.822 --> 00:15:39.060
so with that, if anything I've said today

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.468
makes you feel uncomfortable, you're welcome.

00:15:42.468 --> 00:15:45.355
(Applause)

00:15:45.355 --> 00:15:49.162
I think we have time for one more.

00:15:49.162 --> 00:15:52.637
"What's the most popular diet these days?"

00:15:52.637 --> 00:15:54.445
Who's here?

00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:56.497
Okay, well, I'm just gonna answer this really fast,

00:15:56.497 --> 00:15:58.223
as, like, three or four different people.

00:15:58.223 --> 00:15:59.320
I mean really fast.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.305
I'm just gonna let y'all know that,
as far as diet is concerned,

00:16:02.305 --> 00:16:04.990
if you don't love yourself inside,

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.289
there is no diet on this Earth

00:16:07.289 --> 00:16:10.280
that is going to make your behind small enough

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.650
for you to feel good,

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.290
so just stop wasting your time.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.020
I would just like to say as an African woman

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.120
that I believe the diet that we need

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.390
is really to remove the crazy belief

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.406
that there is anything wrong

00:16:26.406 --> 00:16:27.660
with a nice backside.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.539
No, I am teasing about that.

00:16:29.539 --> 00:16:31.834
There is nothing wrong with a woman of size.

00:16:31.834 --> 00:16:33.859
That is what I am trying to say.

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:36.915
Women, celebrate your body, for God's sake.

00:16:36.915 --> 00:16:38.792
Stop running around starving.

00:16:38.792 --> 00:16:42.653
You are making yourselves
and other people miserable.

00:16:42.653 --> 00:16:46.273
Last answer.

00:16:46.273 --> 00:16:50.765
So we're talking about what's the most popular diet?

00:16:50.765 --> 00:16:54.521
I'm gonna start off by telling y'all that

00:16:54.521 --> 00:16:58.922
this is my first time here at TED.

00:16:58.922 --> 00:17:01.515
I might not be your typical person

00:17:01.515 --> 00:17:03.840
you find on this stage.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.103
My dental work not as nice as some people.

00:17:07.103 --> 00:17:09.162
But I made Sarah Jones promise

00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:11.318
she gonna bring me this time,

00:17:11.318 --> 00:17:16.318
'cause she didn't bring me before,

00:17:16.318 --> 00:17:18.210
but you know, I just want to say,

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.670
there's a lot of things more important

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.570
than counting calories,

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.898
and as somebody living on the streets in New York,

00:17:25.898 --> 00:17:30.217
and getting to come here,
hear y'all ideas worth spreading,

00:17:30.217 --> 00:17:32.584
I want to tell y'all I believe in this idea

00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:34.700
that the present is the new future,

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.896
that where you sit, you create everything

00:17:37.896 --> 00:17:40.910
that's gonna come, for better or worse.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.530
And for me, I think homeless

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.642
is the wrong word for it anyway.

00:17:45.642 --> 00:17:47.509
You know, I might not have me no place

00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:49.208
to lay my head at night,

00:17:49.208 --> 00:17:52.509
but that just makes me houseless.

00:17:52.509 --> 00:17:54.850
I have me a home. You do too.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:59.073
Find it and try to find yourself in there.

00:17:59.073 --> 00:18:00.602
Make sure you know,

00:18:00.602 --> 00:18:05.190
it's not just about virtual reality in space.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.832
That's wonderful, but it's also about

00:18:06.832 --> 00:18:09.526
the actual reality here on Earth.

00:18:09.526 --> 00:18:10.998
How are people living today?

00:18:10.998 --> 00:18:13.368
How can you be part of the solution?

00:18:13.368 --> 00:18:15.217
Thank y'all for thinking about that

00:18:15.217 --> 00:18:16.796
right now in the present moment

00:18:16.796 --> 00:18:18.529
to influence the future.

00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:20.584
I appreciate it. Bye-bye.

00:18:20.584 --> 00:18:23.102
(Applause)

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:26.474
Thank you all very, very much.

00:18:26.474 --> 00:18:28.642
Thank you for trusting me, Chris.

00:18:28.642 --> 00:18:31.255
(Applause)
