00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:19.627
So let me start by taking you back,

00:00:19.627 --> 00:00:21.863
back into the mists of your memory

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:25.376
to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life,

00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:28.012
but certainly the most anticipated year

00:00:28.012 --> 00:00:29.990
in all human history:

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.928
the year 2000. Remember that?

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:36.481
Y2K, the dotcom bubble,

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:38.878
stressing about whose party you're going to go to

00:00:38.878 --> 00:00:41.100
as the clock strikes midnight,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.142
before the champagne goes flat,

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:46.461
and then there's that inchoate yearning

00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:49.700
that was felt, I think, by many, that the millennium,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.216
that the year 2000, should mean more,

00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:55.435
more than just a two and some zeroes.

00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:59.193
Well, amazingly, for once, our world leaders

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:01.815
actually lived up to that millennium moment

00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:03.964
and back in 2000 agreed to some

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:06.371
pretty extraordinary stuff:

00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:09.817
visionary, measurable, long-term targets

00:01:09.817 --> 00:01:12.550
called the Millennium Development Goals.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.795
Now, I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:17.577
under your pillow, or by the bedside table,

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.663
but just in case you don't,

00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:21.493
and your memory needs some jogging,

00:01:21.493 --> 00:01:24.115
the deal agreed then goes like this:

00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:26.690
developing countries promised to at least halve

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.088
extreme poverty, hunger and deaths from disease,

00:01:30.088 --> 00:01:32.868
alongside some other targets, by 2015,

00:01:32.868 --> 00:01:35.723
and developed nations promised to help them

00:01:35.723 --> 00:01:38.121
get that done by dropping debts,

00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:40.842
increasing smart aid, and trade reform.

00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:43.091
Well, we're approaching 2015,

00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:45.890
so we'd better assess, how are we doing on these goals?

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.652
But we've also got to decide, do we like such global goals?

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:52.891
Some people don't. And if we like them, we've got to decide

00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:56.124
what we want to do on these goals going forward.

00:01:56.124 --> 00:01:58.303
What does the world want to do together?

00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:00.826
We've got to decide a process by which we decide.

00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:03.724
Well, I definitely think these goals are worth building on

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:07.525
and seeing through, and here's just a few reasons why.

00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:10.642
Incredible partnerships between the private sector,

00:02:10.642 --> 00:02:12.846
political leaders, philanthropists

00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:14.875
and amazing grassroots activists

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:16.604
across the developing world,

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:21.138
but also 250,000 people marched in the streets

00:02:21.138 --> 00:02:23.574
of Edinburgh outside this very building

00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:24.918
for Make Poverty History.

00:02:24.918 --> 00:02:27.609
All together, they achieved these results:

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.701
increased the number of people on anti-retrovirals,

00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:32.874
life-saving anti-AIDS drugs;

00:02:32.874 --> 00:02:35.562
nearly halved deaths from malaria;

00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:40.324
vaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved.

00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:42.627
And combined, this is going to result

00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:45.710
in two million fewer children dying every year,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.755
last year, than in the year 2000.

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:50.690
That's 5,000 fewer kids dying every day,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.234
ten times you lot not dead every day,

00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:56.216
because of all of these partnerships.

00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:59.319
So I think this is amazing living proof of progress

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.276
that more people should know about,

00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:03.683
but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.723
is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk.

00:03:06.723 --> 00:03:09.241
Anyway, for now, anyone involved in getting these results,

00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:12.452
thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it.

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:15.069
But there's still a lot of unfinished business.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.671
Still, 7.6 million children die every year of preventable,

00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:21.742
treatable diseases,

00:03:21.742 --> 00:03:24.475
and 178 million kids are malnourished

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:25.905
to the point of stunting, a horrible term

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:29.683
which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment.

00:03:29.683 --> 00:03:32.171
So there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got.

00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:35.219
But then, a lot of people think there are things

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.132
that should have been in the original package

00:03:37.132 --> 00:03:39.404
that weren't agreed back then that should now be included,

00:03:39.404 --> 00:03:41.934
like sustainable development targets,

00:03:41.934 --> 00:03:44.196
natural resource governance targets,

00:03:44.196 --> 00:03:46.391
access to opportunity, to knowledge,

00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:48.381
equity, fighting corruption.

00:03:48.381 --> 00:03:51.037
All of this is measurable and could be in the new goals.

00:03:51.037 --> 00:03:53.005
But the key thing here is,

00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:55.120
what do you think should be in the new goals?

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.032
What do you want?

00:03:57.032 --> 00:03:59.476
Are you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:01.353
or education?

00:04:01.353 --> 00:04:03.739
Should those be in the new package of goals?

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.753
And quite frankly, that's a good question,

00:04:05.753 --> 00:04:07.699
but there's going to be some tough tradeoffs

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.655
and choices here, so you want to hope

00:04:09.655 --> 00:04:11.592
that the process by which the world decides

00:04:11.592 --> 00:04:14.831
these new goals is going to be legitimate, right?

00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:16.857
Well, as we gather here in Edinburgh,

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:19.839
technocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments,

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.302
with the best intentions, are busying themselves

00:04:22.302 --> 00:04:24.701
designing a new package of goals,

00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:28.021
and currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old

00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:31.754
late-20th-century, top-down, elite, closed process.

00:04:31.754 --> 00:04:35.556
But, of course, since then, the Web and mobile telephony,

00:04:35.556 --> 00:04:38.298
along with ubiquitous reality TV formats

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:40.415
have spread all around the world.

00:04:40.415 --> 00:04:43.199
So what we'd like to propose is that we use them

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.221
to involve people from all around the world

00:04:46.221 --> 00:04:49.990
in an historic first: the world's first truly global

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.580
poll and consultation, where everyone everywhere

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.928
has an equal voice for the very first time.

00:04:56.928 --> 00:05:00.463
I mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity

00:05:00.463 --> 00:05:03.111
not to do this, given that we can?

00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:08.010
There's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake,

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.956
tens of millions of lives, or deaths, at stake,

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:14.303
and, I'd argue, the security and future

00:05:14.303 --> 00:05:16.766
of you and your family is also at stake.

00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:20.355
So, if you're with me, I'd say there's three essential steps

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:22.710
in this crowdsourcing campaign:

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.587
collecting, connecting and committing.

00:05:25.587 --> 00:05:27.759
So first of all, we've got to ground this campaign

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.883
in core polling data.

00:05:29.883 --> 00:05:31.997
Let's go into every country that will let us in,

00:05:31.997 --> 00:05:34.585
ask 1,001 people what they want

00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:36.645
the new goals to be, making special efforts

00:05:36.645 --> 00:05:38.884
to reach the poorest, those without access

00:05:38.884 --> 00:05:41.933
to modern technology, and let's make sure that their views

00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:44.217
are at the center of the goals going forward.

00:05:44.217 --> 00:05:48.312
Then, we've got to commission a baseline survey

00:05:48.312 --> 00:05:50.552
to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals

00:05:50.552 --> 00:05:52.578
going forward. The original goals didn't really have

00:05:52.578 --> 00:05:54.452
good baseline survey data,

00:05:54.452 --> 00:05:58.844
and we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure

00:05:58.844 --> 00:06:00.916
we can really monitor the progress.

00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:03.621
And then we've got to connect with the big crowd.

00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.738
Now here, we see the role for an unprecedented coalition

00:06:06.738 --> 00:06:09.708
of social media giants and upstarts,

00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:13.657
telecoms companies, reality TV show formats,

00:06:13.657 --> 00:06:17.155
gaming companies, telecoms, all of them together

00:06:17.155 --> 00:06:20.596
in kind of their "We Are The World" moment.

00:06:20.596 --> 00:06:22.903
Could they come together and help

00:06:22.903 --> 00:06:25.684
the Millennium Development Goals get rebranded

00:06:25.684 --> 00:06:28.708
into the Millennial Generation's Goals?

00:06:28.708 --> 00:06:31.521
And if just five percent of the five billion plus

00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:34.768
who are currently connected made a comment,

00:06:34.768 --> 00:06:37.090
and that comment turned into a commitment,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.226
we could crowdsource a force of 300 million people

00:06:40.226 --> 00:06:43.644
around the world to help see these goals through.

00:06:43.644 --> 00:06:47.146
If we have this collected data, and this connected crowd,

00:06:47.146 --> 00:06:48.875
based upon our experience of campaigning

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.516
and getting world leaders to commit,

00:06:50.516 --> 00:06:51.957
I think world leaders will commit

00:06:51.957 --> 00:06:54.364
to most of the crowdsourced recommendations.

00:06:54.364 --> 00:06:56.987
But the question really is, through this process

00:06:56.987 --> 00:06:59.675
will we all have become committed?

00:06:59.675 --> 00:07:02.576
And if we are, are we ready to iterate, monitor

00:07:02.576 --> 00:07:04.840
and provide feedback, make sure these promises

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.823
are really delivering results?

00:07:06.823 --> 00:07:10.024
Well, there's some fantastic examples here to scale up,

00:07:10.024 --> 00:07:12.736
mostly piloted within Africa, actually.

00:07:12.736 --> 00:07:14.975
There's Open Data Kenya, which geocodes

00:07:14.975 --> 00:07:17.427
and crowdsources information about where projects are,

00:07:17.427 --> 00:07:19.014
are they delivering results.

00:07:19.014 --> 00:07:20.790
Often, they're not in the right place.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.244
And Ushahidi, which means "witness" in Swahili,

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:26.642
which geocodes and crowdsources information

00:07:26.642 --> 00:07:30.555
in complex emergencies to help target responses.

00:07:30.555 --> 00:07:33.964
This is some of the most exciting stuff

00:07:33.964 --> 00:07:35.823
in development and democracy,

00:07:35.823 --> 00:07:37.922
where citizens on the edge of a network

00:07:37.922 --> 00:07:39.863
are helping to force open the process

00:07:39.863 --> 00:07:42.574
to make sure that the big global aid promises

00:07:42.574 --> 00:07:46.028
and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people

00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:50.184
at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid.

00:07:50.184 --> 00:07:53.696
This openness, this forcing openness, is key,

00:07:53.696 --> 00:07:56.632
and if it wasn't entirely transparent already,

00:07:56.632 --> 00:08:01.276
I should be open: I've got a completely transparent agenda.

00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:03.683
Long-term trends suggest that this century

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:05.939
is going to be a tough place to live,

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:09.836
with population increases, consumption patterns increasing,

00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:13.270
and conflict over scarce natural resources.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.914
And look at the state of global politics today.

00:08:16.914 --> 00:08:20.015
Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week,

00:08:20.015 --> 00:08:22.369
or the Mexican G20, also last week.

00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:25.280
Both, if we're honest, a bust.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.443
Our world leaders, our global politics,

00:08:27.443 --> 00:08:30.132
currently can't get it done.

00:08:30.132 --> 00:08:33.505
They need our help. They need the cavalry,

00:08:33.505 --> 00:08:35.738
and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars.

00:08:35.738 --> 00:08:38.973
It's got to come from us, and I see this process

00:08:38.973 --> 00:08:41.924
of deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion

00:08:41.924 --> 00:08:44.318
what the world wants to work on together

00:08:44.318 --> 00:08:47.685
as one vital means by which we can crowdsource

00:08:47.685 --> 00:08:51.013
the force to really build that constituency

00:08:51.013 --> 00:08:53.444
that's going to reinvigorate global governance

00:08:53.444 --> 00:08:55.435
in the 21st century.

00:08:55.435 --> 00:09:00.564
I started in 2000. Let me finish in 2030.

00:09:00.564 --> 00:09:04.063
Many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago

00:09:04.063 --> 00:09:06.206
we had called Make Poverty History.

00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:09.496
It was a naive thought in many people's minds,

00:09:09.496 --> 00:09:12.265
and it's true, it was just a t-shirt slogan

00:09:12.265 --> 00:09:15.495
that worked for the moment. But look.

00:09:15.495 --> 00:09:19.640
The empirical condition of living under a dollar and 25

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.784
is trending down, and look where it gets to by 2030.

00:09:22.784 --> 00:09:25.111
It's getting near zero.

00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:27.351
Now sure, progress in China and India

00:09:27.351 --> 00:09:29.573
and poverty reduction there was key to that,

00:09:29.573 --> 00:09:32.706
but recently also in Africa, poverty rates are being reduced.

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:35.540
It will get harder as we get towards zero,

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.678
as the poor will be increasingly located

00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:39.968
in post-conflict, fragile states,

00:09:39.968 --> 00:09:41.944
or maybe in middle income states

00:09:41.944 --> 00:09:44.598
where they don't really care about the marginalized.

00:09:44.598 --> 00:09:48.545
But I'm confident, with the right kind of political campaigning

00:09:48.545 --> 00:09:51.707
and creative and technological innovation combined

00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:54.126
working together more and more as one,

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:57.749
I think we can get this and other goals done.

00:09:57.749 --> 00:10:00.435
Thank you. (Applause)

00:10:00.435 --> 00:10:05.760
(Applause)

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.920
Chris Anderson: Jamie, here's the puzzle to me.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.696
If there was an incident today where a hundred kids

00:10:11.696 --> 00:10:15.221
died in some tragedy or where, say, a hundred kids

00:10:15.221 --> 00:10:18.112
were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces,

00:10:18.112 --> 00:10:21.366
I mean, it would be all over the news for a week, right?

00:10:21.366 --> 00:10:23.986
You just put up, just as one of your numbers there,

00:10:23.986 --> 00:10:27.068
that 5,000 -- is that the number?

00:10:27.068 --> 00:10:29.060
Jamie Drummond: Fewer children every day.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.731
CA: Five thousand fewer children dying every day.

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:34.044
I mean, it dwarfs, dwarfs everything

00:10:34.044 --> 00:10:37.396
that is actually on our news agenda, and it's invisible.

00:10:37.396 --> 00:10:39.230
This must drive you crazy.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.069
JD: It does, and we're having a huge debate in this country

00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:44.584
about aid levels, for example, and aid alone is not

00:10:44.584 --> 00:10:46.902
the whole solution. Nobody thinks it is.

00:10:46.902 --> 00:10:51.456
But, you know, if people saw the results of this smart aid,

00:10:51.456 --> 00:10:53.925
I mean, they'd be going crazy for it.

00:10:53.925 --> 00:10:57.556
I wish the 250,000 people who really did march

00:10:57.556 --> 00:11:00.810
outside this very building knew these results.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.689
Right now they don't, and it would be great to find a way

00:11:03.689 --> 00:11:05.941
to better communicate it, because we have not.

00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:09.223
Creatively, we've failed to communicate this success so far.

00:11:09.223 --> 00:11:12.431
If those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice

00:11:12.431 --> 00:11:14.940
and amplify it at the key moments, I know for a fact

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.941
we'd get better policy.

00:11:16.941 --> 00:11:19.462
The Mexican G20 need not have been a bust.

00:11:19.462 --> 00:11:22.003
Rio, if anyone cares about the environment,

00:11:22.003 --> 00:11:24.345
need not have been a bust, okay?

00:11:24.345 --> 00:11:26.215
But these conferences are going on,

00:11:26.215 --> 00:11:27.912
and I know people get skeptical and cynical

00:11:27.912 --> 00:11:29.688
about the big global summits and the promises

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:31.435
and their never being kept, but actually,

00:11:31.435 --> 00:11:33.818
the bits that are, are making a difference,

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.267
and what the politicians need

00:11:35.267 --> 00:11:37.508
is more permission from the public.

00:11:37.508 --> 00:11:39.597
CA: But you haven't fully worked out the Web mechanisms, etc.

00:11:39.597 --> 00:11:41.557
by which this might happen.

00:11:41.557 --> 00:11:43.444
I mean, if the people here who've had experience

00:11:43.444 --> 00:11:46.604
using open platforms, you're interested to talk with them

00:11:46.604 --> 00:11:48.230
this week and try to take this forward.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.200
JD: Absolutely. CA: All right, well I must say,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.812
if this conference led in some way

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:55.821
to advancing that idea, that's a huge idea,

00:11:55.821 --> 00:11:58.178
and if you carry that forward, that is really awesome,

00:11:58.178 --> 00:11:59.619
so thank you. JD: I'd love your help.

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:01.567
CA: Thank you, thank you.

00:12:01.567 --> 00:12:04.640
(Applause)
