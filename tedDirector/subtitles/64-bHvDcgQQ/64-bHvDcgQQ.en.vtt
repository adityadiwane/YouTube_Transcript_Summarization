00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
"The Better Man."

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.160
I was the better at getting and keeping.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.160
You were the better at spend and spend;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
I was the better at grubbing and heaping,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.160
But who was the better man in the end?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
Yes, who was the better man, my friend?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
You were the better with lords and ladies,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
I was the better at pillaging Troy;

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.160
You were the better at kissing the babies,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.160
I was the better at search and destroy.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
But who was the better man, old boy?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
Who was the better man?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
I was the better at improvisation,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
You were the better at spinning the plates;

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
I was the better at procrastination,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
You were the better at quiet debate.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.160
But who was the better man, old mate?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
Who was the better man?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
You were the better at rolling a reefer,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.160
I was the better at coke and rum;

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.160
Remember that night on the beach in Ibiza?

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
The Maori twins

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
with the tattooed bum?

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.160
But who was the better man, old chum?

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
Who was the better man?

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
Now we come down to it, relatives grieving.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Out in the hall with their crocodile tears;

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.160
Now that you're out of it, now that you're leaving,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
Now that they've sealed your arse and your ears,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
What I've been meaning to tell you for years,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:06.160
And years, and years, and years, old friend ...

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.160
Is that you were the better man, in the end;

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
You were the better man,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
My friend.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.160
(Applause)

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
I wrote this next poem for my mother.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
Every one of us had a mother,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
only one --

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
probably the most important person in your life,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
if you're lucky enough to know them.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
My mother was certainly the most important in mine.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Let me try and describe her to you.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.160
She's 86 years old. She's frail.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.160
White, platinum hair.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
Why do they do that? Why do old ladies go to those hair shops,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
and make those helmets?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.160
(Laughter)

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
Bright as a button. All the ducks in a row.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
Looks like a much prettier version

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
of Margaret Thatcher,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
(Laughter)

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
but without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.160
(Laughter)

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
I wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
But my mother has lived by this creed

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
all her life.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
"Never Go Back."

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
Never go back. Never go back.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
Never return to the haunts of your youth.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.160
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.160
Memory holds all you need of the truth.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
Never look back. Never look back.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
Never succumb to the gorgon's stare.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.160
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.160
No-one is waiting and nothing is there.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
Never go back. Never go back.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
Never surrender the future you earned.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.160
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.160
Never return to the bridges you've burned.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
Never look back. Never look back.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
Never retreat to the 'glorious past.'

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
Treat every day of your life as your last.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Never go back. Never go back.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.160
Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.160
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:51.160
No-one is waiting and nothing is there.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.160
(Applause)

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
Now ladies and gentlemen, I'm up on me hobbyhorse.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
If every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
were tied end to end along a railroad track,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
that would be me,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
stoking the train

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
without a qualm in the world.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.160
Ladies, don't do it.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
Don't do it.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
You think we want you to do it, but we don't want you to do it.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
Stop it.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
Tell them to go to hell.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
You bodies are wonderful as they are.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
Just leave them alone.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.160
"To a Beautiful Lady of a Certain Age."

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
Lady lady, do not weep.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
What is gone is gone. Now sleep.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Turn your pillow. Dry your tears.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.160
Count thy sheep and not thy years.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Nothing good can come of this.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
Time rules all, my dearest.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
'Tis but folly to be waging war

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
On one who never lost before.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.160
Lady, this is all in vain.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
Youth can never come again;

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
We have drunk the summer wine.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
None can make a stitch in time.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
Nip and tuck till crack of doom.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
What is foretold in the womb

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.160
May not be foresworn with gold.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.160
Nor may time be bought or sold.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:35.160
Dearest, do I love thee less?

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
Do I shrink from thy caress?

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160
Think you I could cease to care?

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.160
Never was there one so fair!

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
Lady lady, do not weep --

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.160
What is gone is gone. Now sleep.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.160
Lean against me, calm your fears,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.160
Count thy blessings, not thy years.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:11.160
(Applause)

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
America, ladies and gentlemen, has done more for me financially than Britain

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
ever has, or ever could have done.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.160
I was born in Britain, as you have probably guessed.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
Even when on its worst behavior,

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.160
I find myself automatically defending the USA

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160
from the sneers of green-eyed Europhiles

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.160
playing their Greek card to Roman trumps.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
America is an empire.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
I hope you know that now.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
All empires, by definition, are bumbling,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.160
shambolic, bullying, bureaucratic affairs,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.160
as they are corrupted by power in their dotage.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
I am no historian, ladies and gentlemen.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
But it seems to be that the USA's sins,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.160
compared to those of many previous empires,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.160
are of a more moderate,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
if more pervasive, kind.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
Let me put this bluntly.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
If Americans are so fat,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160
stupid and ignorant,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
my dear friends from Birmingham,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.160
how come they rule the world?

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
"Hail to the Gods of America."

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
Hail to the Gods of America!

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.160
Hail to the gods of the dream.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
Invictus E Pluribus Unum.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.160
But which of them reigns supreme?

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
Which is America's Jupiter?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
The Brahmins of Capital Hill?

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.160
A sorcerer's profit on Wall Street?

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.160
They eye of a dollar bill?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
Or is it celebrity status?

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
The worship of those we hate.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
Or the cult of living forever,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
If only we'd watch our weight.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
What of the titans of media?

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
Or Hollywood's siren call?

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
What of the temples of justice,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160
Whose servants enslave us all?

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
What of the Brand and the Label?

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160
What of the upstart Sport?

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
And what of the Constitution,

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.160
That bully of last resort?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.160
Hail to the God of America,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.160
Whose power the masses extol --

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.160
Convenience rules America;

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.160
Convenience owns our soul.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
Aye, that it does.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.160
(Applause)

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
And if you would like to know why I am not a father --

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:02.160
I, who by a miracle have 22 godchildren --

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
the answer is in this poem,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
which upsets me every time I read it.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.160
"Love Came to Visit Me."

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
Love came to visit me,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160
shy as a fawn.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
But finding me busy,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.160
she fled, with the dawn.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.160
At 20 the torch of resentment was lit.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
My rage at injustice

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
waxed hot as the pits.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
The flux of its lava cleared all in its path.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.160
Comrades and enemies fled from its wrath.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.160
Yet lovers grew wary, once novelty waned

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
To lie with a bloody man,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.160
his terror unfeigned.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.160
At 30 my powers seemed mighty to me.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160
The fruits of my rivals, I shook from the tree.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
By guile and by bluster,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
by night and by day,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.160
I battered and scattered the fools from my way.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:12.160
And women grew willing to sham and to bluff.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.160
Their trinkets and baubles cost little enough.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
From 40 to 50, grown easy and sly,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.160
I wined them and dined them, like pigs in a sty.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.160
We feasted and reveled and rutted in muck,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
Forgetting our peril, forgetting to duck,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.160
Forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.160
Grown sick to our stomachs,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
and sick of our lives.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
Love came to visit me,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
shy as a fawn.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
But finding me busy,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:56.160
she fled with the dawn.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:06.160
(Applause)

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
Um, there are --

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.160
in my businesses.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.160
So poetry came as a complete shock to me, ladies and gentlemen.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160
A complete shock. I was a little ill.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
Okay, I was ill.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
Okay, I had a life-threatening illness, you know.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:30.160
I was in a clinic. I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
I wasn't allowed to see any of my -- you know, whatever.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.160
So, in the end I begged a pack of Post-it notes off a nurse.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
And from another nurse, I begged a pencil, pen.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
And I didn't know what else to do. So I started to write poetry.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:48.160
That was in October of 2000.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
I'm not an evil man.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.160
I'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160
who men fall down, you know, when she walks in a room.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160
But sometimes I try to put myself in that position.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.160
(Laughter)

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.160
Not with much success.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160
But it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
I love to think what they thought, what it was like.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
Because although

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160
many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
although you guys can not only go to the moon,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
you know, you're going to totally transform everything.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160
Cloning will transform everything. Voice navigation will transform everything.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160
I don't know. You can do anything you want.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
All you guys are so clever, and women, you can do it all!

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.160
But human nature doesn't change, mate.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.160
My friends, human nature is exactly the same as it was

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
when my ancestor --

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160
probably it was my ancestor --

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.160
got his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:50.160
and battered the bastard to death.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
You think we didn't do that?

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160
Oh, we did.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.160
We killed every single one of them.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
Inch by inch we killed them.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.160
We hunted them down wherever they were.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:10.160
Rivals for meat. Rivals for berries.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
We're still doing it,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.160
with all of the genius assembled in this room.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.160
Our natures haven't changed a single iota.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.160
And they never will.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:28.160
Even when we've got off this little planet,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:35.160
and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
And I am as bad as you.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
I spent eight years

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.160
running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
And at seven o'clock every night,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.160
I took me some more girls, already corrupted.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160
I never did anything to anyone that wasn't.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.160
And I took crack cocaine,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.160
every single night for seven years.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.160
It was like Dante's "Inferno."

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.160
It was unbelievable.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.160
One of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.160
for about four hours.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:20.160
And you stay up for 12.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.160
It was absolutely unbelievable.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
Twenty-two godchildren I've got.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.160
What do I say to them?

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
I only stopped because I thought if I got caught,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.160
what would happen to my mother.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
If you're a woman, remember that.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
The love of your son

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:48.160
can utterly transform anything he does.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.160
"Our Lady in White."

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
Pale she was, listless;

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.160
And soft to the touch.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.160
A generous mistress Whom many loved much.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
Shoulder to shoulder, Night after night,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
We hoarded and sold her --

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
Our Lady in White.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.160
We breathed but to savor

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160
her crystal caress.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.160
We craved but to favor the hem of her dress.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
We dabbled and babbled,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.160
Denying our thirsts.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.160
But always we scrabbled

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.160
to lie with her first.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.160
Absent, we missed her,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160
grew haggard and limp.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160
Toyed with her sister,

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.160
or threatened her pimp.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160
Came word out of Babel, the lady returns!

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:44.160
And there on the table we took her, in turns.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.160
Sensing the power that tyranny craves,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
There in that hour, she made us her slaves.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:57.160
Many there were, to covet her kiss.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
My shame as a spur,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.160
I fled the abyss.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.160
But only just.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:18.160
(Applause)
