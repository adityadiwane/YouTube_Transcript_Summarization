00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:17.351
How many people here would like to live
to be at least 80 years old?

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:19.367
Yeah.

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:22.186
I think we all have
this hopeful expectation

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.170
of living into old age.

00:00:24.648 --> 00:00:26.734
Let's project out into the future,

00:00:26.758 --> 00:00:28.318
to your future "you's,"

00:00:28.342 --> 00:00:31.195
and let's imagine that we're all 85.

00:00:31.714 --> 00:00:33.732
Now, everyone look at two people.

00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:38.503
One of you probably has
Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:42.609
(Laughter)

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.227
Alright, alright.

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:48.591
And maybe you're thinking,
"Well, it won't be me."

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.555
Then, OK. You are a caregiver.

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:54.372
So --

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:57.268
(Laughter)

00:00:57.292 --> 00:00:58.649
so in some way,

00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:02.317
this terrifying disease
is likely to affect us all.

00:01:02.753 --> 00:01:05.767
Part of the fear around Alzheimer's
stems from the sense

00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:08.205
that there's nothing we can do about it.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.354
Despite decades of research, we still
have no disease-modifying treatment

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:14.685
and no cure.

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.610
So if we're lucky enough
to live long enough,

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:20.742
Alzheimer's appears to be
our brain's destiny.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.069
But maybe it doesn't have to be.

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:26.770
What if I told you we could
change these statistics,

00:01:26.794 --> 00:01:29.484
literally change our brain's destiny,

00:01:29.508 --> 00:01:33.037
without relying on a cure
or advancements in medicine?

00:01:33.803 --> 00:01:36.328
Let's begin by looking at
what we currently understand

00:01:36.352 --> 00:01:38.709
about the neuroscience of Alzheimer's.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.559
Here's a picture
of two neurons connecting.

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:45.940
The point of connection,
this space circled in red,

00:01:45.964 --> 00:01:47.603
is called the synapse.

00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:50.819
The synapse is where
neurotransmitters are released.

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:55.111
This is where signals are transmitted,
where communication happens.

00:01:55.135 --> 00:02:00.241
This is where we think,
feel, see, hear, desire ...

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:01.914
and remember.

00:02:01.938 --> 00:02:04.836
And the synapse
is where Alzheimer's happens.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.822
Let's zoom in on the synapse

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:09.933
and look at a cartoon representation
of what's going on.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.906
During the business
of communicating information,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.928
in addition to releasing neurotransmitters
like glutamate into the synapse,

00:02:16.952 --> 00:02:21.413
neurons also release a small peptide
called amyloid beta.

00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:27.421
Normally, amyloid beta is cleared away
metabolized by microglia,

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:29.598
the janitor cells of our brains.

00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:34.084
While the molecular causes
of Alzheimer's are still debated,

00:02:34.108 --> 00:02:37.362
most neuroscientists believe
that the disease begins

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:40.216
when amyloid beta begins to accumulate.

00:02:40.787 --> 00:02:43.536
Too much is released,
or not enough is cleared away,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.894
and the synapse begins
to pile up with amyloid beta.

00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:49.137
And when this happens, it binds to itself,

00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:52.450
forming sticky aggregates
called amyloid plaques.

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:56.355
How many people here
are 40 years old or older?

00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:59.524
You're afraid to admit it now.

00:02:59.548 --> 00:03:01.774
This initial step into the disease,

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:04.882
this presence of amyloid
plaques accumulating,

00:03:04.906 --> 00:03:07.500
can already be found in your brains.

00:03:08.091 --> 00:03:11.561
The only way we could be sure of this
would be through a PET scan,

00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:15.401
because at this point,
you are blissfully unaware.

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:19.714
You're not showing any impairments
in memory, language, or cognition ...

00:03:19.738 --> 00:03:20.889
yet.

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:25.828
We think it takes at least 15 to 20 years
of amyloid plaque accumulation

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:28.233
before it reaches a tipping point,

00:03:28.257 --> 00:03:30.492
then triggering a molecular cascade

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:33.183
that causes the clinical
symptoms of the disease.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.591
Prior to the tipping point,

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:39.199
your lapses in memory
might include things like,

00:03:39.223 --> 00:03:41.548
"Why did I come in this room?"

00:03:41.572 --> 00:03:43.800
or "Oh ... what's his name?"

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.643
or "Where did I put my keys?"

00:03:47.373 --> 00:03:49.929
Now, before you all
start freaking out again,

00:03:49.953 --> 00:03:55.351
because I know half of you did at least
one of those in the last 24 hours --

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:58.612
these are all normal kinds of forgetting.

00:03:58.636 --> 00:04:00.949
In fact, I would argue that these examples

00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:02.950
might not even involve your memory,

00:04:02.974 --> 00:04:05.866
because you didn't pay attention
to where you put your keys

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.235
in the first place.

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:08.937
After the tipping point,

00:04:08.961 --> 00:04:12.484
the glitches in memory,
language and cognition are different.

00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:15.408
Instead of eventually finding
your keys in your coat pocket

00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:17.434
or on the table by the door,

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:20.172
you find them in the refrigerator,

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:22.162
or you find them and you think,

00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:23.719
"What are these for?"

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:29.871
So what happens when amyloid plaques
accumulate to this tipping point?

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:33.214
Our microglia janitor cells
become hyper-activated,

00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:37.372
releasing chemicals that cause
inflammation and cellular damage.

00:04:37.396 --> 00:04:39.991
We think they might actually
start clearing away

00:04:40.015 --> 00:04:41.719
the synapses themselves.

00:04:42.218 --> 00:04:46.666
A crucial neural transport protein
called "tau" becomes hyperphosphorylated

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.274
and twists itself
into something called "tangles,"

00:04:49.298 --> 00:04:52.333
which choke off the neurons
from the inside.

00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:56.191
By mid-stage Alzheimer's,
we have massive inflammation and tangles

00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:58.162
and all-out war at the synapse

00:04:58.186 --> 00:04:59.439
and cell death.

00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:03.146
So if you were a scientist
trying to cure this disease,

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.167
at what point would you ideally
want to intervene?

00:05:06.954 --> 00:05:10.858
Many scientists are betting big
on the simplest solution:

00:05:10.882 --> 00:05:14.716
keep amyloid plaques
from reaching that tipping point,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.768
which means that drug discovery is largely
focused on developing a compound

00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:24.140
that will prevent, eliminate, or reduce
amyloid plaque accumulation.

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:29.868
So the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be
a preventative medicine.

00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:33.321
We're going to have to take this pill
before we reach that tipping point,

00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:35.597
before the cascade is triggered,

00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:38.649
before we start leaving
our keys in the refrigerator.

00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:42.874
We think this is why, to date,
these kinds of drugs have failed

00:05:42.898 --> 00:05:44.135
in clinical trials --

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.604
not because the science wasn't sound,

00:05:46.628 --> 00:05:50.762
but because the people in these trials
were already symptomatic.

00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:52.518
It was too late.

00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:55.794
Think of amyloid plaques as a lit match.

00:05:55.818 --> 00:05:59.236
At the tipping point, the match
sets fire to the forest.

00:05:59.704 --> 00:06:01.654
Once the forest is ablaze,

00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:04.160
it doesn't do any good
to blow out the match.

00:06:04.184 --> 00:06:07.707
You have to blow out the match
before the forest catches fire.

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:10.014
Even before scientists sort this out,

00:06:10.038 --> 00:06:12.906
this information is actually
really good news for us,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.974
because it turns out that the way we live
can influence the accumulation

00:06:16.998 --> 00:06:18.227
of amyloid plaques.

00:06:18.251 --> 00:06:19.827
And so there are things we can do

00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:22.470
to keep us from reaching
that tipping point.

00:06:22.937 --> 00:06:26.825
Let's picture your risk
of Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale.

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.898
We're going to pile
risk factors on one arm,

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:31.400
and when that arm hits the floor,
you are symptomatic

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.359
and diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

00:06:33.878 --> 00:06:36.597
Let's imagine you're 50 years old.

00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:38.356
You're not a spring chicken anymore,

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.452
so you've accumulated
some amyloid plaques with age.

00:06:41.476 --> 00:06:43.667
Your scale is tipped a little bit.

00:06:44.143 --> 00:06:45.882
Now let's look at your DNA.

00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:49.908
We've all inherited our genes
from our moms and our dads.

00:06:49.932 --> 00:06:54.010
Some of these genes will increase our risk
and some will decrease it.

00:06:54.034 --> 00:06:56.223
If you're like Alice in "Still Alice,"

00:06:56.247 --> 00:07:00.798
you've inherited a rare genetic mutation
that cranks out amyloid beta,

00:07:00.822 --> 00:07:04.375
and this alone will tip
your scale arm to the ground.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:08.565
But for most of us, the genes we inherit
will only tip the arm a bit.

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:13.404
For example, APOE4 is a gene variant
that increases amyloid,

00:07:13.428 --> 00:07:16.696
but you can inherit a copy of APOE4
from mom and dad

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.111
and still never get Alzheimer's,

00:07:19.135 --> 00:07:21.248
which means that for most of us,

00:07:21.272 --> 00:07:25.112
our DNA alone does not determine
whether we get Alzheimer's.

00:07:25.804 --> 00:07:27.278
So what does?

00:07:27.302 --> 00:07:31.094
We can't do anything about getting older
or the genes we've inherited.

00:07:31.118 --> 00:07:34.115
So far, we haven't changed
our brain's destiny.

00:07:34.964 --> 00:07:36.429
What about sleep?

00:07:37.098 --> 00:07:41.180
In slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells
rinse cerebral spinal fluid

00:07:41.204 --> 00:07:42.420
throughout our brains,

00:07:42.444 --> 00:07:46.016
clearing away metabolic waste
that accumulated in our synapses

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.941
while we were awake.

00:07:47.965 --> 00:07:50.771
Deep sleep is like
a power cleanse for the brain.

00:07:51.466 --> 00:07:54.652
But what happens if you shortchange
yourself on sleep?

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.773
Many scientists believe

00:07:56.797 --> 00:08:01.047
that poor sleep hygiene might actually
be a predictor of Alzheimer's.

00:08:01.433 --> 00:08:06.359
A single night of sleep deprivation
leads to an increase in amyloid beta.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.656
And amyloid accumulation
has been shown to disrupt sleep,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.167
which in turn causes
more amyloid to accumulate.

00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:15.667
And so now we have
this positive feedback loop

00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:18.564
that's going to accelerate
the tipping of that scale.

00:08:19.126 --> 00:08:20.549
What else?

00:08:20.573 --> 00:08:22.199
Cardiovascular health.

00:08:22.863 --> 00:08:26.608
High blood pressure, diabetes,
obesity, smoking, high cholesterol,

00:08:26.632 --> 00:08:30.768
have all been shown to increase our risk
of developing Alzheimer's.

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:32.683
Some autopsy studies have shown

00:08:32.707 --> 00:08:35.379
that as many as 80 percent
of people with Alzheimer's

00:08:35.403 --> 00:08:38.165
also had cardiovascular disease.

00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:43.194
Aerobic exercise has been shown
in many studies to decrease amyloid beta

00:08:43.218 --> 00:08:44.948
in animal models of the disease.

00:08:45.439 --> 00:08:49.019
So a heart-healthy
Mediterranean lifestyle and diet

00:08:49.043 --> 00:08:51.697
can help to counter
the tipping of this scale.

00:08:52.517 --> 00:08:54.866
So there are many things we can do

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.262
to prevent or delay
the onset of Alzheimer's.

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.515
But let's say
you haven't done any of them.

00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:02.485
Let's say you're 65;

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:06.175
there's Alzheimer's in your family,
so you've likely inherited a gene or two

00:09:06.199 --> 00:09:08.223
that tips your scale arm a bit;

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:10.979
you've been burning the candle
at both ends for years;

00:09:11.003 --> 00:09:12.506
you love bacon;

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.753
and you don't run unless
someone's chasing you.

00:09:14.777 --> 00:09:16.078
(Laughter)

00:09:16.102 --> 00:09:19.714
Let's imagine that your amyloid plaques
have reached that tipping point.

00:09:19.738 --> 00:09:21.786
Your scale arm has crashed to the floor.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.491
You've tripped the cascade,

00:09:23.515 --> 00:09:25.081
setting fire to the forest,

00:09:25.105 --> 00:09:28.203
causing inflammation, tangles,
and cell death.

00:09:28.957 --> 00:09:31.616
You should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.956
You should be having trouble
finding words and keys

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.126
and remembering what I said
at the beginning of this talk.

00:09:38.737 --> 00:09:40.451
But you might not be.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.478
There's one more thing you can do
to protect yourself

00:09:43.502 --> 00:09:46.088
from experiencing
the symptoms of Alzheimer's,

00:09:46.112 --> 00:09:50.603
even if you have the full-blown disease
pathology ablaze in your brain.

00:09:50.627 --> 00:09:54.534
It has to do with neural plasticity
and cognitive reserve.

00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:57.458
Remember, the experience
of having Alzheimer's

00:09:57.482 --> 00:10:00.688
is ultimately a result of losing synapses.

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:04.536
The average brain has
over a hundred trillion synapses,

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.273
which is fantastic;
we've got a lot to work with.

00:10:07.297 --> 00:10:08.966
And this isn't a static number.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.388
We gain and lose synapses all the time,

00:10:11.412 --> 00:10:14.215
through a process
called neural plasticity.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.311
Every time we learn something new,

00:10:16.335 --> 00:10:20.462
we are creating and strengthening
new neural connections,

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:22.103
new synapses.

00:10:22.808 --> 00:10:24.383
In the Nun Study,

00:10:24.407 --> 00:10:29.300
678 nuns, all over the age of 75
when the study began,

00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:31.633
were followed for more than two decades.

00:10:31.657 --> 00:10:35.117
They were regularly given
physical checkups and cognitive tests,

00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:39.189
and when they died, their brains
were all donated for autopsy.

00:10:39.213 --> 00:10:43.588
In some of these brains, scientists
discovered something surprising.

00:10:43.612 --> 00:10:48.188
Despite the presence of plaques
and tangles and brain shrinkage --

00:10:48.212 --> 00:10:51.081
what appeared to be
unquestionable Alzheimer's --

00:10:51.105 --> 00:10:54.784
the nuns who had belonged
to these brains showed no signs

00:10:54.808 --> 00:10:57.375
of having the disease
while they were alive.

00:10:58.001 --> 00:10:59.450
How can this be?

00:10:59.829 --> 00:11:03.956
We think it's because these nuns
had a high level of cognitive reserve,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.903
which is a way of saying that they had
more functional synapses.

00:11:07.927 --> 00:11:10.501
People who have more years
of formal education,

00:11:10.525 --> 00:11:12.760
who have a high degree of literacy,

00:11:12.784 --> 00:11:16.363
who engage regularly
in mentally stimulating activities,

00:11:16.387 --> 00:11:18.868
all have more cognitive reserve.

00:11:18.892 --> 00:11:23.019
They have an abundance
and a redundancy in neural connections.

00:11:23.043 --> 00:11:25.723
So even if they have a disease
like Alzheimer's

00:11:25.747 --> 00:11:27.801
compromising some of their synapses,

00:11:27.825 --> 00:11:30.810
they've got many extra backup connections,

00:11:30.834 --> 00:11:34.169
and this buffers them from noticing
that anything is amiss.

00:11:34.797 --> 00:11:37.059
Let's imagine a simplified example.

00:11:37.083 --> 00:11:39.809
Let's say you only know one thing
about a subject.

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:41.362
Let's say it's about me.

00:11:41.386 --> 00:11:43.692
You know that Lisa Genova
wrote "Still Alice,"

00:11:43.716 --> 00:11:46.152
and that's the only thing
you know about me.

00:11:46.176 --> 00:11:48.566
You have that single neural connection,

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.536
that one synapse.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.721
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's.

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:55.078
You have plaques and tangles
and inflammation

00:11:55.102 --> 00:11:57.837
and microglia devouring that synapse.

00:11:58.423 --> 00:12:02.653
Now when someone asks you,
"Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'"

00:12:02.677 --> 00:12:03.922
you can't remember,

00:12:03.946 --> 00:12:07.129
because that synapse
is either failing or gone.

00:12:07.153 --> 00:12:08.912
You've forgotten me forever.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.206
But what if you had learned more about me?

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.319
Let's say you learned
four things about me.

00:12:14.343 --> 00:12:16.188
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's,

00:12:16.212 --> 00:12:19.207
and three of those synapses
are damaged or destroyed.

00:12:19.897 --> 00:12:22.358
You still have a way
to detour the wreckage.

00:12:22.382 --> 00:12:24.401
You can still remember my name.

00:12:25.103 --> 00:12:29.029
So we can be resilient
to the presence of Alzheimer's pathology

00:12:29.053 --> 00:12:32.156
through the recruitment
of yet-undamaged pathways.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.959
And we create these pathways,
this cognitive reserve,

00:12:35.983 --> 00:12:37.683
by learning new things.

00:12:38.275 --> 00:12:42.796
Ideally, we want these new things
to be as rich in meaning as possible,

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.559
recruiting sight and sound
and associations and emotion.

00:12:48.218 --> 00:12:51.353
So this really doesn't mean
doing crossword puzzles.

00:12:51.377 --> 00:12:55.474
You don't want to simply retrieve
information you've already learned,

00:12:55.498 --> 00:12:58.841
because this is like traveling
down old, familiar streets,

00:12:58.865 --> 00:13:01.450
cruising neighborhoods you already know.

00:13:01.933 --> 00:13:04.767
You want to pave new neural roads.

00:13:04.791 --> 00:13:07.303
Building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain

00:13:07.327 --> 00:13:09.507
means learning to speak Italian,

00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:11.041
meeting new friends,

00:13:11.065 --> 00:13:12.232
reading a book,

00:13:12.256 --> 00:13:14.625
or listening to a great TED Talk.

00:13:15.103 --> 00:13:20.416
And if, despite all of this, you are
someday diagnosed with Alzheimer's,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.593
there are three lessons I've learned
from my grandmother

00:13:23.617 --> 00:13:27.354
and the dozens of people I've come to know
living with this disease.

00:13:27.935 --> 00:13:31.119
Diagnosis doesn't mean
you're dying tomorrow.

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:32.865
Keep living.

00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:35.255
You won't lose your emotional memory.

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:38.785
You'll still be able
to understand love and joy.

00:13:38.809 --> 00:13:41.812
You might not remember
what I said five minutes ago,

00:13:41.836 --> 00:13:44.121
but you'll remember how I made you feel.

00:13:44.764 --> 00:13:48.040
And you are more than what
you can remember.

00:13:48.064 --> 00:13:49.353
Thank you.

00:13:49.377 --> 00:13:54.700
(Applause)
