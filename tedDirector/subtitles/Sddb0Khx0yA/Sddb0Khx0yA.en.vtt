00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The electricity powering the lights in this theater

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
was generated just moments ago.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Because the way things stand today,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
electricity demand must be in constant balance

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
with electricity supply.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
If in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
some tens of megawatts of wind power

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
stopped pouring into the grid,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
the difference would have to be made up

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.260
from other generators immediately.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
But coal plants, nuclear plants

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
can't respond fast enough.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
A giant battery could.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
With a giant battery,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
we'd be able to address the problem of intermittency

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
that prevents wind and solar

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
from contributing to the grid

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.260
in the same way that coal, gas and nuclear do today.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
You see, the battery

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
is the key enabling device here.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
With it, we could draw electricity from the sun

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
even when the sun doesn't shine.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And that changes everything.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Because then renewables

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
such as wind and solar

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
come out from the wings,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
here to center stage.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Today I want to tell you about such a device.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
It's called the liquid metal battery.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
It's a new form of energy storage

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
that I invented at MIT

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
along with a team of my students

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and post-docs.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Now the theme of this year's TED Conference is Full Spectrum.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
The OED defines spectrum

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
as "The entire range of wavelengths

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
of electromagnetic radiation,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
of which the range of visible light

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
is only a small part."

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
So I'm not here today only to tell you

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
how my team at MIT has drawn out of nature

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
a solution to one of the world's great problems.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I want to go full spectrum and tell you how,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
in the process of developing

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
this new technology,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
we've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
that can serve as lessons for innovation,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
ideas worth spreading.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And you know,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.260
if we're going to get this country out of its current energy situation,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
we can't just conserve our way out;

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
we can't just drill our way out;

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
we can't bomb our way out.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
We're going to do it the old-fashioned American way,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
we're going to invent our way out,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
working together.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
(Applause)

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Now let's get started.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
The battery was invented about 200 years ago

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
by a professor, Alessandro Volta,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
at the University of Padua in Italy.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
His invention gave birth to a new field of science,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
electrochemistry,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
and new technologies

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
such as electroplating.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Perhaps overlooked,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Volta's invention of the battery

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
for the first time also

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
demonstrated the utility of a professor.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
(Laughter)

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Until Volta, nobody could imagine

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
a professor could be of any use.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Here's the first battery --

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
a stack of coins, zinc and silver,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
separated by cardboard soaked in brine.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
This is the starting point

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
for designing a battery --

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
two electrodes,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
in this case metals of different composition,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and an electrolyte,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
in this case salt dissolved in water.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
The science is that simple.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Admittedly, I've left out a few details.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Now I've taught you

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
that battery science is straightforward

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and the need for grid-level storage

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
is compelling,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
but the fact is

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
that today there is simply no battery technology

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
capable of meeting

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.260
the demanding performance requirements of the grid --

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
namely uncommonly high power,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
long service lifetime

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and super-low cost.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
We need to think about the problem differently.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
We need to think big,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
we need to think cheap.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
So let's abandon the paradigm

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
of let's search for the coolest chemistry

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and then hopefully we'll chase down the cost curve

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
by just making lots and lots of product.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Instead, let's invent

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
to the price point of the electricity market.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
So that means

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
that certain parts of the periodic table

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
are axiomatically off-limits.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
This battery needs to be made

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
out of earth-abundant elements.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
I say, if you want to make something dirt cheap,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
make it out of dirt --

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
(Laughter)

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
preferably dirt

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
that's locally sourced.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And we need to be able to build this thing

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
using simple manufacturing techniques and factories

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
that don't cost us a fortune.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
So about six years ago,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
I started thinking about this problem.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And in order to adopt a fresh perspective,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.260
I sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
In fact, I looked to a technology

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
that neither stores nor generates electricity,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
but instead consumes electricity,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
huge amounts of it.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.260
I'm talking about the production of aluminum.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
The process was invented in 1886

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
by a couple of 22-year-olds --

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Hall in the United States and Heroult in France.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And just a few short years following their discovery,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
aluminum changed

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
from a precious metal costing as much as silver

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
to a common structural material.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
You're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
It's about 50 feet wide

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and recedes about half a mile --

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
row after row of cells

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
that, inside, resemble Volta's battery,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
with three important differences.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Volta's battery works at room temperature.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
It's fitted with solid electrodes

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and an electrolyte that's a solution of salt and water.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
The Hall-Heroult cell

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
operates at high temperature,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
a temperature high enough

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
that the aluminum metal product is liquid.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
The electrolyte

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
is not a solution of salt and water,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
but rather salt that's melted.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
It's this combination of liquid metal,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
molten salt and high temperature

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.260
that allows us to send high current through this thing.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
Today, we can produce virgin metal from ore

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
at a cost of less than 50 cents a pound.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
That's the economic miracle

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
of modern electrometallurgy.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
It is this that caught and held my attention

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.260
to the point that I became obsessed with inventing a battery

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.260
that could capture this gigantic economy of scale.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
And I did.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
I made the battery all liquid --

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
liquid metals for both electrodes

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and a molten salt for the electrolyte.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
I'll show you how.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
So I put low-density

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.260
liquid metal at the top,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:37.260
put a high-density liquid metal at the bottom,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and molten salt in between.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
So now,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
how to choose the metals?

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
For me, the design exercise

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
always begins here

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
with the periodic table,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
enunciated by another professor,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
Dimitri Mendeleyev.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Everything we know

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
is made of some combination

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
of what you see depicted here.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And that includes our own bodies.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
I recall the very moment one day

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
when I was searching for a pair of metals

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
that would meet the constraints

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
of earth abundance,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
different, opposite density

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and high mutual reactivity.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
I felt the thrill of realization

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
when I knew I'd come upon the answer.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
Magnesium for the top layer.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
And antimony

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
for the bottom layer.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
You know, I've got to tell you,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
one of the greatest benefits of being a professor:

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
colored chalk.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
(Laughter)

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
So to produce current,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
magnesium loses two electrons

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
to become magnesium ion,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
which then migrates across the electrolyte,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
accepts two electrons from the antimony,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and then mixes with it to form an alloy.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
The electrons go to work

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
in the real world out here,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
powering our devices.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Now to charge the battery,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
we connect a source of electricity.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
It could be something like a wind farm.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.260
And then we reverse the current.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:33.260
And this forces magnesium to de-alloy

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and return to the upper electrode,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:41.260
restoring the initial constitution of the battery.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And the current passing between the electrodes

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
generates enough heat to keep it at temperature.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
It's pretty cool,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
at least in theory.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
But does it really work?

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
So what to do next?

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
We go to the laboratory.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Now do I hire seasoned professionals?

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
No, I hire a student

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
and mentor him,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
teach him how to think about the problem,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
to see it from my perspective

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
and then turn him loose.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
This is that student, David Bradwell,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
who, in this image,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
What I didn't tell David at the time

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
was I myself wasn't convinced it would work.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
But David's young and he's smart

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
and he wants a Ph.D.,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and he proceeds to build --

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
(Laughter)

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
He proceeds to build

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
the first ever liquid metal battery

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
of this chemistry.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
And based on David's initial promising results,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
which were paid

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
with seed funds at MIT,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
I was able to attract major research funding

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
from the private sector

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
and the federal government.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
And that allowed me to expand my group to 20 people,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
a mix of graduate students, post-docs

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
and even some undergraduates.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
And I was able to attract really, really good people,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
people who share my passion

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
for science and service to society,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.260
not science and service for career building.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
And if you ask these people

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
why they work on liquid metal battery,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
their answer would hearken back

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
to President Kennedy's remarks

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
at Rice University in 1962

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
when he said -- and I'm taking liberties here --

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
"We choose to work on grid-level storage,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
not because it is easy,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
but because it is hard."

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:38.260
(Applause)

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
So this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
We start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
I called it the shotglass.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
We've operated over 400 of these,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries --

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
not just magnesium and antimony.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Along the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
I call it the hockey puck.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And we got the same remarkable results.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
And then it was onto the saucer.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
That's 200 watt-hours.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
The technology was proving itself

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
to be robust and scalable.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
But the pace wasn't fast enough for us.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
So a year and a half ago,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
David and I,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
along with another research staff-member,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
formed a company

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
to accelerate the rate of progress

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
and the race to manufacture product.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
So today at LMBC,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
we're building cells 16 inches in diameter

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
with a capacity of one kilowatt-hour --

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
1,000 times the capacity

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
of that initial shotglass cell.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
We call that the pizza.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
It's going to be 36 inches in diameter.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
We call that the bistro table,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
but it's not ready yet for prime-time viewing.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
And one variant of the technology

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.260
has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
aggregating the modules into a giant battery

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
that fits in a 40-foot shipping container

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
for placement in the field.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
And this has a nameplate capacity of two megawatt-hours --

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
two million watt-hours.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
That's enough energy

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
to meet the daily electrical needs

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
of 200 American households.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
So here you have it, grid-level storage:

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
silent, emissions-free,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
no moving parts,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
remotely controlled,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
designed to the market price point

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
without subsidy.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
So what have we learned from all this?

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:35.260
(Applause)

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
So what have we learned from all this?

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Let me share with you

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
some of the surprises, the heterodoxies.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
They lie beyond the visible.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
Temperature:

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
Conventional wisdom says set it low,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
at or near room temperature,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
and then install a control system to keep it there.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
Avoid thermal runaway.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
with minimum regulation.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
Our battery can handle the very high temperature rises

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.260
that come from current surges.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
Scaling: Conventional wisdom says

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
reduce cost by producing many.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
Liquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
by producing fewer, but they'll be larger.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
And finally, human resources:

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Conventional wisdom says

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
hire battery experts,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
seasoned professionals,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
who can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
To develop liquid metal battery,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
I hired students and post-docs and mentored them.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
In a battery,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
I strive to maximize electrical potential;

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
when mentoring,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
I strive to maximize human potential.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
So you see,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
the liquid metal battery story

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
is more than an account

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
of inventing technology,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
it's a blueprint

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
for inventing inventors, full-spectrum.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:08.260
(Applause)
