00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.759
I'm a bug lover, myself --

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:19.536
not from childhood, by the way,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.130
but rather late.

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:23.536
When I bachelored,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.253
majoring in zoology
at Tel Aviv University,

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:28.414
I kind of fell in love with bugs.

00:00:28.438 --> 00:00:30.176
And then, within zoology,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.340
I took the course
or the discipline of entomology,

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:35.615
the science of insects.

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:39.202
And then I thought to myself,
how can I be practical

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.202
or help in the science of entomology?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.793
And then I moved to the world
of plant protection --

00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:48.319
plant protection from insects,

00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:50.157
from bad bugs.

00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:52.536
And then within plant protection,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.821
I came into the discipline
of biological pest control,

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:58.535
which we actually define

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.536
as the use of living organisms

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.060
to reduce populations
of noxious plant pests.

00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:09.186
So it's a whole discipline
in plant protection

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.667
aimed at the reduction of chemicals.

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:15.502
And biological pest control, by the way,

00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:18.294
or these "good bugs"
that we are talking about,

00:01:18.318 --> 00:01:22.150
they've existed in the world
for thousands and thousands of years,

00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:23.777
for a long, long time.

00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:27.383
But only in the last 120 years,

00:01:27.488 --> 00:01:30.878
people started, or people
knew more and more

00:01:30.902 --> 00:01:35.288
how to exploit, or how to use,
this biological control phenomenon,

00:01:35.312 --> 00:01:38.692
or in fact, natural control phenomenon,

00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:40.954
for their own needs.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.048
Because biological control phenomenon --
you can see it in your backyard.

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:48.028
Just take a magnifying glass.
You see what I have here?

00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:52.066
That's a magnifier, times 10.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.088
You just open it, twist leaves,

00:01:55.112 --> 00:01:58.536
and you see a whole new world
of minute insects,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.536
or little spiders of one millimeter,
one-and-a-half, two millimeters long,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.560
and you can distinguish
between the good ones and the bad ones.

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:11.124
So this phenomenon of natural control
exists literally everywhere.

00:02:11.148 --> 00:02:13.202
Here, in front of this building, I'm sure.

00:02:13.226 --> 00:02:14.748
Just have a look at the plants.

00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:18.826
So it's everywhere,
and we need to know how to exploit it.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.306
Well, let's go hand by hand

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.536
and browse through just a few examples.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.075
What is a pest?

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.409
What damage does it actually
inflict on the plant?

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:31.694
And what is the natural enemy,

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:34.701
the biological control agent,
or the "good bug"

00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:35.926
that we're talking about?

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.963
In general, I'm going to talk
about insects and spiders,

00:02:40.987 --> 00:02:43.210
or mites, let us call them.

00:02:43.234 --> 00:02:46.003
Insects, those six-legged organisms

00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:50.105
and spiders or mites,
the eight-legged organisms.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.536
Let's have a look at that.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.788
Here is a devastating pest, a spider mite,

00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:57.684
because it does a lot
of webbing, like a spider.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.582
You see the mother in between,

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:02.016
and two daughters, probably,
on the left and right,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.108
and a single egg on the right-hand side.

00:03:04.132 --> 00:03:06.620
And then you see
what kind of damage it can inflict.

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:09.186
On your right-hand side,
you can see a cucumber leaf,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.651
in the middle, a cotton leaf,

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:13.873
and on the left, a tomato leaf
with these little stipplings.

00:03:13.897 --> 00:03:16.950
They can literally turn
from green to white,

00:03:16.974 --> 00:03:22.536
because of the sucking, piercing
mouth parts of those spiders.

00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:26.688
But here comes nature,
that provides us with a good spider.

00:03:26.712 --> 00:03:30.094
This is a predatory mite --
just as small as a spider mite;

00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:32.922
one, two millimeters long,
not more than that --

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:37.360
running quickly, hunting,
chasing the spider mites.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:41.252
And here, you can see this lady
in action on your left-hand side --

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:46.902
just pierces, sucks the body fluids
on the left-hand side of the pest mite.

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:49.536
And after five minutes,
this is what you see:

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.879
just a typical dead corpse --

00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:55.536
the shriveled, sucked-out,
dead corpse of the spider mite,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.424
and next to it, two satiated
individuals, predatory mites,

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:03.945
a mother on the left-hand side,
a young nymph on the right-hand side.

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.891
By the way, a meal for them for 24 hours,

00:04:06.915 --> 00:04:11.165
is about five of the spider mites,
of the bad mites,

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:16.074
and-or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites.

00:04:16.098 --> 00:04:18.536
By the way, they are always hungry.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.799
(Laughter)

00:04:20.823 --> 00:04:23.130
And here is another example: aphids.

00:04:23.154 --> 00:04:25.008
It's springtime now in Israel.

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:27.537
When temperatures rise sharply,

00:04:27.561 --> 00:04:30.834
you can see those bad ones,
those aphids, all over the plants --

00:04:30.858 --> 00:04:33.536
in your hibiscus, in your lantana,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.536
in the young, fresh foliage
of the so-called spring flush.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.536
By the way, with aphids you have
only females, like Amazons.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.985
Females giving rise to females,
giving rise to other females.

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.238
No males at all.

00:04:46.262 --> 00:04:48.698
Parthenogenesis, as it's so called.

00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:50.837
And they're very happy
with that, apparently.

00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:51.886
(Laughter)

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.536
Here we can see the damage.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.320
Those aphids secrete a sticky,
sugary liquid called honeydew,

00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:04.363
and this just clogs
the upper parts of the plant.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:08.100
Here you see a typical cucumber leaf
that turned from green to black

00:05:08.124 --> 00:05:12.843
because of a black fungus, sooty mold,
which is covering it.

00:05:12.867 --> 00:05:18.195
And here comes the salvation,
through this parasitic wasp.

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.321
Here we are not talking about a predator.

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:22.809
Here we are talking a parasite --

00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:24.706
not a two-legged parasite,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.739
but an eight-legged parasite, of course.

00:05:27.763 --> 00:05:29.537
This is a parasitic wasp,

00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:35.316
again, two millimeters long, slender,
a very quick and sharp flier.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.124
And here you can see
this parasite in action,

00:05:38.148 --> 00:05:40.815
like in an acrobatic maneuver.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.536
She stands vis-Ã -vis

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.887
in front of the victim
at the right-hand side,

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:50.085
bending its abdomen
and inserting a single egg

00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:52.216
into the body fluids of the aphid.

00:05:52.898 --> 00:05:55.055
By the way, the aphid tries to escape.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:59.338
She kicks and bites
and secretes different liquids,

00:05:59.362 --> 00:06:01.412
but nothing will happen, in fact --

00:06:01.436 --> 00:06:04.846
only the egg of the parasitoid
will be inserted

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.008
into the body fluids of the aphid.

00:06:07.032 --> 00:06:09.968
And after a few days,
depending upon temperature,

00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:11.409
the egg will hatch

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:16.404
and the larva of this parasite
will eat the aphid from the inside.

00:06:16.428 --> 00:06:17.479
(Laughter)

00:06:17.503 --> 00:06:19.747
This is all natural. This is all natural.

00:06:19.771 --> 00:06:21.770
This is not fiction, nothing at all.

00:06:21.794 --> 00:06:24.745
Again -- in your backyard.
In your backyard.

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:26.274
(Laughter)

00:06:26.298 --> 00:06:27.763
(Applause)

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:34.244
But this is the end result: mummies.

00:06:34.354 --> 00:06:39.536
This is the visual result
of a dead aphid encompassing inside,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.455
a developing parasitoid that,
after a few minutes, you see halfway out.

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.685
The birth is almost complete.

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:50.883
You can see, by the way,
in different movies, etc.,

00:06:50.907 --> 00:06:52.536
it takes just a few minutes.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.062
And if this is a female,
she'll immediately mate with a male

00:06:56.086 --> 00:06:58.922
and off she goes,
because time is very short.

00:06:58.946 --> 00:07:01.536
This female can live
only three to four days,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.422
and she needs to give rise
to around 400 eggs.

00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:08.848
That means she has 400 bad aphids

00:07:08.872 --> 00:07:11.853
to put her eggs into their body fluids.

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:14.440
This is, of course, not the end of it.

00:07:14.464 --> 00:07:16.846
There is a whole wealth
of other natural enemies

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.536
and this is just the last example.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.053
Again, we'll start first with the pest:

00:07:21.077 --> 00:07:22.536
the thrips.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.863
By the way, all these weird names --

00:07:24.887 --> 00:07:28.386
I didn't bother you with the Latin
names of these creatures,

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.650
just the popular names.

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:33.786
But this is a nice,
slender, very bad pest.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.158
If you can see this: sweet peppers.

00:07:36.182 --> 00:07:39.181
This is not just an exotic,
ornamental sweet pepper.

00:07:39.205 --> 00:07:41.752
This is a sweet pepper
which is not consumable

00:07:41.776 --> 00:07:44.536
because it is suffering
from a viral disease

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.725
transmitted by those thrip adults.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.687
And here comes the natural enemy,
minute pirate bug --

00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:54.290
"minute," because it is rather small.

00:07:54.314 --> 00:07:57.733
Here you can see the adult,
black, and two young ones.

00:07:57.757 --> 00:07:59.302
And again, in action.

00:07:59.326 --> 00:08:02.137
This adult pierces the thrips,

00:08:02.874 --> 00:08:05.120
sucking it within just several minutes,

00:08:05.144 --> 00:08:08.374
going to the other prey,
continuing all over the place.

00:08:08.398 --> 00:08:12.693
And if we spread those minute
pirate bugs, the good ones,

00:08:12.717 --> 00:08:15.613
for example, in a sweet pepper plot,

00:08:15.637 --> 00:08:17.206
they go to the flowers.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:22.314
And look -- this flower is flooded
with predatory bugs, with the good ones,

00:08:22.338 --> 00:08:25.536
after wiping out the bad ones, the thrips.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.144
So this is a very positive situation.

00:08:28.168 --> 00:08:31.468
No harm to the developing fruit.
No harm to the fruit set.

00:08:31.492 --> 00:08:34.556
Everything is just fine
under these circumstances.

00:08:35.305 --> 00:08:36.766
But again, the question is,

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.991
here you saw them on a one-to-one basis --
the pest, the natural enemy.

00:08:41.357 --> 00:08:44.328
What we do is actually this.

00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:48.233
In Northeast Israel,
in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu,

00:08:48.257 --> 00:08:52.626
there is a facility that mass-produces
those natural enemies.

00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:59.449
In other words, what we do there
is amplify the natural control,

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:01.450
or the biological control phenomenon.

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:06.351
And in 30,000 square meters
of state-of-the-art greenhouses,

00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:09.679
there, we are mass-producing
those predatory mites,

00:09:09.703 --> 00:09:11.398
those minute pirate bugs,

00:09:11.422 --> 00:09:14.318
those parasitic wasps, etc.

00:09:14.342 --> 00:09:15.669
Many different parts.

00:09:15.693 --> 00:09:17.949
By the way, they have
a very nice landscape --

00:09:17.973 --> 00:09:20.349
you see the Jordanian Mountains
on the one hand,

00:09:20.373 --> 00:09:22.350
and the Jordan Valley on the other hand,

00:09:22.374 --> 00:09:26.427
and a good, mild winter
and a nice, hot summer,

00:09:26.451 --> 00:09:30.446
which is an excellent condition
to mass-produce those creatures.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.710
And by the way, mass-production --
it is not genetic manipulation.

00:09:34.734 --> 00:09:38.781
There are no GMOs -- genetically
modified organisms -- whatsoever.

00:09:38.805 --> 00:09:40.536
We take them from nature,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.857
and the only thing that we do
is give them the optimal conditions,

00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:47.536
under the greenhouses
or in the climate rooms,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.977
in order to proliferate,
multiply and reproduce.

00:09:51.627 --> 00:09:53.318
And that's what we get.

00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:55.199
You see under a microscope.

00:09:55.223 --> 00:09:58.367
You see in the upper left corner?
You see a single predatory mite.

00:09:58.391 --> 00:10:01.786
And this is the whole bunch
of predatory mites.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.130
You see this ampul. You see this one.

00:10:04.154 --> 00:10:07.330
I have one gram of those predatory mites.

00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:11.199
One gram is 80,000 individuals.

00:10:11.763 --> 00:10:17.349
80,000 individuals are good enough
to control one acre,

00:10:17.373 --> 00:10:19.211
4,000 square meters,

00:10:19.235 --> 00:10:21.088
of a strawberry plot

00:10:21.112 --> 00:10:24.041
against spider mites for the whole season

00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:25.478
of almost one year.

00:10:26.242 --> 00:10:29.790
And we can produce
from this, believe you me,

00:10:29.814 --> 00:10:34.216
several dozens of kilograms
on an annual basis.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.448
So this is what I call
amplification of the phenomenon.

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:42.271
And no, we do not disrupt the balance.

00:10:42.295 --> 00:10:43.536
On the contrary,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.443
because we bring it to every cultural plot

00:10:46.467 --> 00:10:49.220
where the balance was already disrupted

00:10:49.244 --> 00:10:50.536
by the chemicals.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.437
Here we come with those natural enemies

00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:55.368
in order to reverse
a little bit of the wheel

00:10:55.392 --> 00:10:59.374
and to bring more natural balance
to the agricultural plot

00:10:59.398 --> 00:11:01.239
by reducing those chemicals.

00:11:01.263 --> 00:11:02.818
That's the whole idea.

00:11:02.842 --> 00:11:04.280
And what is the impact?

00:11:04.304 --> 00:11:07.536
In this table, you can
actually see what is an impact

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.288
of a successful biological
control by good bugs.

00:11:11.908 --> 00:11:18.277
For example, in Israel, where we employ
more than 1,000 hectares --

00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:20.976
10,000 dunams in Israeli terms --

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.625
of biological pests
controlling sweet pepper

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:25.173
under protection,

00:11:25.197 --> 00:11:28.852
75 percent of the pesticides
were actually reduced.

00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:31.361
And Israeli strawberries, even more --

00:11:31.385 --> 00:11:33.159
80 percent of the pesticides,

00:11:33.183 --> 00:11:37.751
especially those aimed
against pest mites in strawberries.

00:11:38.106 --> 00:11:39.982
So the impact is very strong.

00:11:41.244 --> 00:11:43.392
And there goes the question,

00:11:43.416 --> 00:11:46.393
especially if you ask
growers, agriculturists:

00:11:46.417 --> 00:11:48.110
Why biological control?

00:11:48.134 --> 00:11:49.912
Why good bugs?

00:11:49.936 --> 00:11:52.702
By the way, the number of answers you get

00:11:52.726 --> 00:11:54.857
equals the number of people you ask.

00:11:56.314 --> 00:12:00.872
But if we go, for example,
to this place, Southeast Israel,

00:12:00.896 --> 00:12:04.372
the Arava area
above the Great Rift Valley,

00:12:04.396 --> 00:12:09.441
where the pearl of Israeli
agriculture is located,

00:12:09.465 --> 00:12:13.058
especially under greenhouse conditions,
or under screenhouse conditions --

00:12:13.082 --> 00:12:15.871
if you drive all the way
to Eilat, you see this

00:12:15.895 --> 00:12:17.808
just in the middle of the desert.

00:12:17.832 --> 00:12:19.341
And if you zoom in,

00:12:19.365 --> 00:12:21.068
you can definitely watch this:

00:12:21.456 --> 00:12:23.643
grandparents with their grandchildren,

00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:26.536
distributing the natural
enemies, the good bugs,

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.933
instead of wearing special clothes

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.157
and gas masks and applying chemicals.

00:12:31.745 --> 00:12:34.331
So safety, with respect
to the application,

00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:37.774
is the number one answer
that we get from growers,

00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:39.771
for "Why biological control?"

00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:44.919
Number two, many growers
are, in fact, petrified

00:12:44.943 --> 00:12:48.126
by the idea of resistance,

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.703
that the pests will become
resistant to the chemicals,

00:12:52.727 --> 00:12:56.536
just like in our case, that bacteria
becomes resistant to antibiotics.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.328
It's the same, and it can
happen very quickly.

00:13:00.168 --> 00:13:04.536
Fortunately, in either biological control
or even natural control,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.621
resistance is extremely rare.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.749
It hardly happens.

00:13:09.773 --> 00:13:13.125
Because this is evolution,
this is the natural ratio,

00:13:13.149 --> 00:13:17.003
unlike resistance, which happens
in the case of chemicals.

00:13:17.027 --> 00:13:20.003
And thirdly, public demand.

00:13:20.496 --> 00:13:25.300
The more the public demands
the reduction of chemicals,

00:13:25.324 --> 00:13:29.169
the more growers become aware of the fact

00:13:29.193 --> 00:13:31.935
that they should, wherever they can
and wherever possible,

00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:35.890
replace the chemical control
with biological control.

00:13:35.994 --> 00:13:38.056
Even here, there is another grower,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.807
you see, very interested in the bugs,
the bad ones and the good ones,

00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:44.026
wearing this magnifier
already on her head,

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.459
just walking safely in her crop.

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:50.387
Finally, I want to get to my vision,

00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:52.363
or, in fact, to my dream.

00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:54.894
Because, you see, this is the reality.

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:56.394
Have a look at the gap.

00:13:56.418 --> 00:13:58.536
If we take the overall turnover

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.005
of the biocontrol industry worldwide,

00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:02.903
it's 250 million dollars.

00:14:04.022 --> 00:14:07.116
And look at the overall pesticide industry

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.994
in all the crops throughout the world.

00:14:09.337 --> 00:14:12.208
I think it's times 100
or something like that.

00:14:12.232 --> 00:14:13.938
Twenty-five billion.

00:14:13.962 --> 00:14:16.577
So there is a huge gap to bridge.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.224
So actually, how can we do it?

00:14:19.248 --> 00:14:24.128
How can we bridge, or let's say,
narrow, this gap over the years?

00:14:24.152 --> 00:14:27.900
First of all, we need to find more robust,

00:14:27.924 --> 00:14:30.536
good and reliable biological solutions,

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.183
more good bugs that we can
either mass-produce

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:37.711
or actually conserve in the field.

00:14:38.273 --> 00:14:42.859
Secondly, to create even more intensive
and strict public demand

00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:46.135
for the reduction of chemicals
in agricultural fresh produce.

00:14:46.976 --> 00:14:50.734
And thirdly, also to increase
awareness by the growers

00:14:50.758 --> 00:14:52.909
to the potential of this industry.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.059
And this gap really narrows.

00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:58.698
Step by step, it does narrow.

00:14:59.817 --> 00:15:02.022
So I think my last slide is:

00:15:02.046 --> 00:15:04.311
All we are saying --
we can actually sing it --

00:15:04.335 --> 00:15:06.129
Give nature a chance.

00:15:06.153 --> 00:15:09.319
I'm saying it on behalf
of all the biocontrol practitioners

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:10.657
and implementers,

00:15:10.681 --> 00:15:12.902
in Israel and abroad,

00:15:12.926 --> 00:15:14.958
really give nature a chance.

00:15:14.982 --> 00:15:16.141
Thank you.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:18.236
(Applause)
