00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
while writing an article for Italian Wired.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
but I'd already finished editing the piece,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and I realized that I had never once in my life

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.260
looked up the word "disabled" to see what I'd find.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Let me read you the entry.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.260
"Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.260
stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:06.260
run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.260
senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
cracked-up, counted-out;

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
see also hurt, useless and weak.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable."

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
it was so ludicrous,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.260
but I'd just gotten past "mangled," and my voice broke,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and I had to stop and collect myself

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:49.260
from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.260
But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
when I would have been starting primary school

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and as related to the other kids and the world around me.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.260
I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
that perceived someone like me

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.260
to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.260
when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
my life has procured.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.260
So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.260
expecting to find a revision worth noting.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Here's the updated version of this entry.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Unfortunately, it's not much better.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.260
I find the last two words under "Near Antonyms," particularly unsettling:

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
"whole" and "wholesome."

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
So, it's not just about the words.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.260
It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.260
It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and how we view other people.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.260
believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.260
because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.260
So, what reality do we want to call into existence:

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.260
a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered?

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.260
By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.260
we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead?

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.260
at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
His name was Dr. Pizzutillo,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
an Italian American, whose name, apparently,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
so he went by Dr. P.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.260
and had the very perfect disposition to work with children.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.260
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.260
with the exception of my physical therapy sessions.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.260
I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.260
with these thick, elastic bands -- different colors,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.260
you know -- to help build up my leg muscles,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and I hated these bands more than anything --

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
I hated them, had names for them. I hated them.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.260
And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
unsuccessfully, of course.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And, one day, he came in to my session --

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.260
exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions --

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
I think you're going to break one of those bands.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks."

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.260
before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:46.260
but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.260
into a new and promising experience for me.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
shaped my own view of myself

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:08.260
as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
This is an example of how adults in positions of power

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.260
can ignite the power of a child.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.260
But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:26.260
our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.260
the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.260
Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
many of which have been brought about by technology.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
Certainly, from a medical standpoint,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.260
my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:00.260
and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them --

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
not to mention social networking platforms

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.260
allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.260
so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.260
So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
what has always been a truth:

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:27.260
that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:42.260
because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
and I'm going to make an admission:

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
This phrase never sat right with me,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.260
and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.260
and I think I'm starting to figure out why.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Implicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity"

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.260
is the idea that success, or happiness,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.260
unscathed or unmarked by the experience,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.260
as if my successes in life have come about from an ability

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.260
to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
or what other people perceive as my disability.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:29.260
But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
whether physically, emotionally or both.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.260
Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
in order to resume living our life.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
It's part of our life.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And I tend to think of it like my shadow.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
but it's always with me.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
There is adversity and challenge in life,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and it's all very real and relative to every single person,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.260
but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
but how you're going to meet it.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:20.260
So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
but preparing them to meet it well.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.260
And we do a disservice to our kids

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:34.260
when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
There's an important difference and distinction

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.260
between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:48.260
and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.260
is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
In our desire to protect those we care about

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.260
by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.260
or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.260
we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
that will actually disable someone.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
than the pathology itself.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:36.260
By not treating the wholeness of a person,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
by not acknowledging their potency,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:45.260
we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:51.260
We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
So we need to see through the pathology

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:59.260
and into the range of human capability.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And, most importantly, there's a partnership

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
between those perceived deficiencies

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and our greatest creative ability.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.260
So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.260
as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:24.260
but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:31.260
not so much overcoming adversity

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.260
as it is opening ourselves up to it,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
embracing it,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
grappling with it,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
to use a wrestling term,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.260
maybe even dancing with it.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:54.260
And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
we're less burdened by the presence of it.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.260
and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.260
that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.260
To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
nor is it the most intelligent that survives;

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.260
it is the one that is most adaptable to change.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.260
Conflict is the genesis of creation.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.260
the human ability to survive and flourish

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:39.260
is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
into transformation.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:47.260
So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:54.260
And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
Maybe that's what adversity gives us:

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
a sense of self, a sense of our own power.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
So, we can give ourselves a gift.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:10.260
We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
Maybe we can see it as change.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:18.260
Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
is this idea of normalcy.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
Now, who's normal?

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
There's no normal.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
There's common, there's typical. There's no normal,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
and would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed?

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
(Laughter)

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
I don't think so.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:44.260
If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:49.260
to one of possibility -- or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous --

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
we can release the power of so many more children,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:14:00.260
and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
Anthropologists tell us that the one thing

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
we as humans have always required of our community members

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
is to be of use, to be able to contribute.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.260
There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:20.260
carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
proved of value to the community.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.260
They didn't view these people as broken and useless;

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
they were seen as rare and valuable.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.260
in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
It was summertime: I had shorts on.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:52.260
I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins."

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.260
And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:02.260
And I said, "I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you."

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb."

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
(Laughter)

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
Oh, that guy.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
And, but of course, actually, it did click.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
This man was Dr. Kean,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.260
a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:27.260
because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:36.260
so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
And, because I was born without the fibula bones,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:47.260
he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.260
He said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
that you would never walk,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
or any kind of life of independence,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
and you've been making liar out of me ever since."

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
(Laughter)

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:09.260
(Applause)

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.260
The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
whether winning a second grade spelling bee,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:26.260
winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:32.260
and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:37.260
med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
And he called this part of the course the X Factor,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
the potential of the human will.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.260
No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.260
as a determinant in the quality of someone's life.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
And Dr. Kean went on to tell me,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:17:02.260
he said, "In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.260
and even if given a modicum of support,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:12.260
if left to their own devices, a child will achieve."

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.260
See, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
and what someone might do with it.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
And there's been a shift in my thinking over time,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.260
in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.260
if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:42.260
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.260
But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:50.260
And it's because of the experiences I've had with them,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:56.260
not in spite of the experiences I've had with them.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.260
And perhaps this shift in me has happened

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.260
because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:11.260
than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
See, all you really need is one person

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.260
to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:23.260
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power --

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
and open a door for someone at a crucial moment,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.260
you are educating them in the best sense.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:36.260
You're teaching them to open doors for themselves.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:42.260
In fact, the exact meaning of the word "educate"

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
comes from the root word "educe."

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.260
It means "to bring forth what is within,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
to bring out potential."

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:55.260
So again, which potential do we want to bring out?

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.260
There was a case study done in 1960s Britain,

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:03.260
when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.260
It's called the streaming trials. We call it "tracking" here in the States.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:11.260
It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:16.260
And the "A students" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
Well, they took, over a three-month period,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.260
D-level students, gave them A's,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.260
told them they were "A's," told them they were bright,

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
and at the end of this three-month period,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.260
they were performing at A-level.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.260
And, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study,

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:37.260
is that they took the "A students" and told them they were "D's."

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.260
And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.260
Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:55.260
A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.260
The teachers didn't know a switch had been made.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.260
They were simply told, "These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'"

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:06.260
And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:16.260
So, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit,

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:21.260
a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope,

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.260
it doesn't see beauty,

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:29.260
it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.260
and our innate ability to imagine.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.260
If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope,

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.260
to see beauty in themselves and others,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.260
to be curious and imaginative,

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.260
then we are truly using our power well.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:54.260
When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.260
and new ways of being.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.260
I'd like to leave you with a poem

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.260
by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.260
that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about,

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:11.260
and the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words":

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.260
"Every child has known God,

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.260
not the God of names,

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.260
not the God of don'ts,

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.260
but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them,

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:32.260
saying, 'Come dance with me.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.260
Come, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'"

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.260
Thank you.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:50.260
(Applause)
