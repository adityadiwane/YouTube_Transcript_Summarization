00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.437
This is the first of two
rather extraordinary photographs

00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:16.811
I'm going to show you today.

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:18.413
It was taken 18 years ago.

00:00:18.437 --> 00:00:19.938
I was 19 years old at the time.

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:21.113
I had just returned

00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:23.923
from one of the deepest dives
I'd ever made at that time --

00:00:23.947 --> 00:00:25.105
a little over 200 feet.

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.074
And I had caught this little fish.

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:29.868
It turns out that particular one
was the first of its kind

00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:31.046
ever taken alive.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.744
I'm not just an ichthyologist,
I'm a bona fide fish nerd.

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:36.465
And to a fish nerd,
this is some pretty exciting stuff.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.410
More exciting was the fact
that the person who took this photo

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:40.770
is a guy named Jack Randall,

00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:43.577
the greatest living
ichthyologist on earth --

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:46.141
the Grand Poobah
of fish nerds, if you will.

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:51.067
And so, it was really exciting
to me to have this moment in time.

00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:53.191
It set the course for the rest of my life.

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:56.662
But really, the most significant,
most profound thing about this picture

00:00:56.686 --> 00:00:59.425
is it was taken two days
before I was completely paralyzed

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:00.611
from the neck down.

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:02.984
I made a really stupid kind of mistake

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:06.048
that most 19-year-old males do
when they think they're immortal,

00:01:06.072 --> 00:01:08.643
and I got a bad case of the bends
and was paralyzed,

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.738
and had to be flown back for treatment.

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:14.766
I learned two really
important things that day.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.180
The first thing I learned -- well,
I'm mortal. That's a really big one.

00:01:18.204 --> 00:01:21.653
And the second thing I learned
was that I knew, with profound certainty,

00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:24.917
that this is exactly what I was going
to do for the rest of my life.

00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:26.569
I had to focus all my energies

00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:29.712
towards going to find
new species of things

00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:31.484
down on deep coral reefs.

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:34.625
When you think of a coral reef,
this is what most people think of:

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.419
these big, hard, elaborate corals,

00:01:36.443 --> 00:01:38.462
lots of bright, colorful
fishes and things.

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:40.692
But this is really
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:01:40.716 --> 00:01:42.807
If you look at this diagram
of a coral reef,

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:44.981
we know a lot about that part
up near the top.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:47.336
The reason we know so much about it

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.200
is scuba divers can very easily
go down there and access it.

00:01:50.224 --> 00:01:52.336
There is a problem with scuba, though,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.128
in that it imposes some limitations
on how deep you can go.

00:01:55.152 --> 00:01:57.167
It turns out that depth is about 200 feet.

00:01:57.191 --> 00:01:59.508
I'll get into why that is
in just a minute,

00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:03.058
but the point is, scuba divers
generally stay less than 100 feet deep,

00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:06.606
and very rarely go much below this,
at least, not with any kind of sanity.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.162
So to go deeper, most biologists
have turned to submersibles.

00:02:10.186 --> 00:02:12.336
Now, submersibles are great,
wonderful things,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.015
but if you're going to spend 30,000
dollars a day to use one of these things

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.833
and it's capable of going 2,000 feet,

00:02:17.857 --> 00:02:21.336
you're not going to go farting around
up here in a couple of hundred feet,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.134
you're going to go way down deep.

00:02:23.158 --> 00:02:26.027
So the bottom line is, almost
all research using submersibles

00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:27.791
has taken place well below 500 feet.

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:29.637
Now, it's pretty obvious at this point

00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:31.289
there's a zone here in the middle.

00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:32.584
That's the zone

00:02:32.608 --> 00:02:35.314
that centers around my own
personal pursuit of happiness.

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:38.736
I want to find out what's in this zone;
we know almost nothing about it.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.737
Scuba divers can't get there,
submarines go right on past it.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:45.308
It took me a year to learn to walk again
after my diving accident in Palau.

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:46.483
During that year,

00:02:46.507 --> 00:02:49.946
I spent a lot of time learning
about the physics and physiology of diving

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.783
and how to overcome these limitations.

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:53.729
I'm just going to show you a basic idea.

00:02:53.753 --> 00:02:55.384
We're all breathing air right now.

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.320
Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen,

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.423
20 percent oxygen, 80 percent nitrogen.

00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:00.597
It's in our lungs.

00:03:00.621 --> 00:03:02.685
And there's a phenomenon
called Henry's law,

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.715
that says gases will dissolve into a fluid

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.713
in proportion to the partial pressures
you're exposing them to.

00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:09.896
So, basically the gas
dissolves into our body.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.548
The oxygen is bound by metabolism,
we use it for energy.

00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:15.393
The nitrogen sort of floats around
in our blood and tissues.

00:03:15.417 --> 00:03:17.336
That's fine, it's how we're designed.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.371
The problem happens
when you go underwater.

00:03:19.395 --> 00:03:22.198
The deeper you go underwater,
the higher the pressure is.

00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:24.763
If you were to go down
to a depth of about 130 feet,

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:27.312
which is the recommended
limit for most scuba divers,

00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:28.834
you'd get this pressure effect.

00:03:28.858 --> 00:03:32.541
The effect of that pressure is you have
an increased density of gas molecules

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:33.781
in every breath you take.

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:37.644
Over time, those gas molecules
dissolve into your blood and tissues

00:03:37.668 --> 00:03:39.081
and start to fill you up.

00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:41.748
Now, if you were to go
down to, say, 300 feet,

00:03:41.772 --> 00:03:44.710
you don't have five times as many
gas molecules in your lungs,

00:03:44.734 --> 00:03:47.362
you've got 10 times as many
gas molecules in your lungs.

00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:50.667
And, sure enough, they dissolve
into your blood and tissues as well.

00:03:50.691 --> 00:03:53.772
And if you were to go down to where
there's 15 times as much --

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:56.805
the deeper you go, the more
exacerbating the problem becomes.

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.318
The limitation of diving with air
is all those dots in your body,

00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:03.111
all the nitrogen and all the oxygen.

00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:05.835
There are three basic
limitations of scuba diving.

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.694
The first limitation is the oxygen --

00:04:07.718 --> 00:04:09.045
oxygen toxicity.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.323
Now, we all know the song:
"Love is like oxygen.

00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:14.642
You get too much, you get too high.
Not enough, and you're gonna die."

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:17.654
Well, in the context of diving,
you get too much, you die also.

00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:20.678
You die because oxygen
toxicity can cause a seizure.

00:04:20.702 --> 00:04:24.250
It makes you convulse underwater --
not a good thing to happen underwater.

00:04:24.274 --> 00:04:27.781
It happens because there's too much
concentration of oxygen in your body.

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:29.447
The nitrogen has two problems.

00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:33.844
One of them is what Jacques Cousteau
called "rapture of the deep."

00:04:33.868 --> 00:04:35.210
It's nitrogen narcosis.

00:04:35.234 --> 00:04:38.021
It makes you loopy; the deeper
you go, the loopier you get.

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:40.914
You don't want to drive drunk,
you don't want to dive drunk.

00:04:40.938 --> 00:04:42.336
So that's a real big problem.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.903
And of course, the third problem

00:04:43.927 --> 00:04:46.070
is the one I found out
the hard way in Palau,

00:04:46.094 --> 00:04:47.252
which is the bends.

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:48.667
One thing I forgot to mention

00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:51.224
is that to obviate the problem
of nitrogen narcosis --

00:04:51.248 --> 00:04:53.034
all of those blue dots in our body --

00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:55.458
you remove the nitrogen
and replace it with helium.

00:04:55.482 --> 00:04:58.315
Helium's a gas; there're a lot
of reasons why helium's good,

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:01.326
it's a tiny molecule, it's inert,
it doesn't give you narcosis.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.052
So that's the basic concept we use.

00:05:03.076 --> 00:05:04.655
But the theory's relatively easy.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.512
The tricky part is the implementation.

00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:08.645
So this is how I began about 15 years ago.

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.375
I'll admit, it wasn't exactly
the smartest of starts,

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:13.065
but you've got to start somewhere.

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:14.097
(Laughter)

00:05:14.121 --> 00:05:17.319
At the time, I wasn't the only one
who didn't know what I was doing.

00:05:17.343 --> 00:05:18.502
Almost nobody did.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:20.866
This rig was actually used
for a dive of 300 feet.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.525
But over time we got better at it,

00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:25.241
and we came up with this really
sophisticated-looking rig

00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:28.572
with four scuba tanks, five regulators
and all the right gas mixtures,

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:29.747
all that good stuff.

00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.048
It was fine and dandy, it allowed us
to go down and find new species.

00:05:33.072 --> 00:05:36.124
This picture was taken at 300 feet,
catching new species of fish.

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:38.251
The problem was
it didn't allow us much time.

00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:41.477
For all its bulk and size, it only gave us
about 15 minutes at most

00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:43.013
down at those sorts of depths.

00:05:43.037 --> 00:05:45.374
We needed more time.
There had to be a better way.

00:05:45.398 --> 00:05:47.072
And indeed, there is a better way.

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:49.256
In 1994, I was fortunate
enough to get access

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.880
to these prototype
closed-circuit rebreathers.

00:05:52.687 --> 00:05:55.704
Closed-circuit rebreather:
what makes it different from scuba,

00:05:55.728 --> 00:05:56.889
and why is it better?

00:05:56.913 --> 00:05:59.764
Well, there are three main
advantages to a rebreather.

00:05:59.788 --> 00:06:01.948
One, they're quiet,
they don't make any noise.

00:06:01.972 --> 00:06:04.137
Two, they allow you to stay
underwater longer.

00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:06.034
Three, they allow you to go deeper.

00:06:06.058 --> 00:06:07.415
How is it that they do that?

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:09.646
In order to really understand
how they do that,

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.559
you have to look underneath the hood
and see what's going on.

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:15.454
There are three basic systems
to a closed-circuit rebreather.

00:06:15.478 --> 00:06:18.066
The most fundamental
is called the breathing loop.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.532
It's a breathing loop
because you breathe off of it;

00:06:20.556 --> 00:06:23.713
it's a closed loop, and you breathe
the same gas around and around.

00:06:23.737 --> 00:06:26.081
There's a mouthpiece
that you put in your mouth,

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:29.130
and there's a counter lung,
or in this case, two counter lungs.

00:06:29.154 --> 00:06:32.218
The counter lungs aren't high tech,
they're simply flexible bags.

00:06:32.242 --> 00:06:35.219
They allow you to mechanically
breathe, mechanically ventilate.

00:06:35.243 --> 00:06:37.694
When you exhale, it goes
in the exhale counter lung;

00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:40.303
when you inhale, it comes
from the inhale counter lung.

00:06:40.327 --> 00:06:44.112
It's just pure mechanics, allowing you
to cycle air through this breathing loop.

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:48.340
The other component on a breathing loop
is the carbon-dioxide-absorbent canister.

00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:51.236
Now, as we breathe,
we produce carbon dioxide,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.261
and that carbon dioxide needs
to be scrubbed out of the system.

00:06:54.285 --> 00:06:55.933
There's a chemical filter in there

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.538
that pulls the carbon dioxide
out of the breathing gas,

00:06:58.562 --> 00:07:01.950
so that when it comes back to us,
it's safe to breathe again.

00:07:01.974 --> 00:07:04.192
That's the breathing loop in a nutshell.

00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:07.160
The second main component
of a closed-circuit rebreather

00:07:07.184 --> 00:07:08.526
is the gas system.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.000
The primary purpose of the gas system
is to provide oxygen,

00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:14.640
to replenish the oxygen
that your body consumes.

00:07:14.664 --> 00:07:16.755
So the main tank, the main critical thing,

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:19.620
is this oxygen gas
supply cylinder we have here.

00:07:19.644 --> 00:07:22.001
But if we only had
an oxygen gas supply cylinder,

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.741
we wouldn't be able to go very deep,

00:07:23.765 --> 00:07:26.190
because we'd run into
oxygen toxicity very quickly.

00:07:26.214 --> 00:07:29.336
So we need another gas,
something to dilute the oxygen with.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.622
And that, fittingly enough,
is called the diluent gas supply.

00:07:32.646 --> 00:07:37.082
In our applications, we generally
put air inside this diluent gas supply,

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:39.806
because it's a very cheap
and easy source of nitrogen.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.807
So that's where we get our nitrogen from.

00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:45.300
But if we want to go deeper,
of course, we need another gas supply,

00:07:45.324 --> 00:07:47.435
and helium is what
we really need to go deep.

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:49.607
Usually we'll have
a slightly larger cylinder,

00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:51.798
mounted exterior
on the rebreather, like this.

00:07:51.822 --> 00:07:54.845
That's what we use to inject,
as we start to do our deep dives.

00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:58.035
We also have a second oxygen cylinder,
solely as a backup;

00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:00.398
if there's a problem
with our first oxygen supply,

00:08:00.422 --> 00:08:01.731
we can continue to breathe.

00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:05.216
The way you manage all these different
gases and different gas supplies

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.631
is this really high-tech, sophisticated
gas block up on the front here,

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:09.863
where it's easy to reach.

00:08:09.887 --> 00:08:12.179
It's got the valves and knobs
and things you need

00:08:12.203 --> 00:08:14.262
to inject the right gases
at the right time.

00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:16.005
Normally, you don't have to do that,

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:17.842
because all of it's done automatically

00:08:17.866 --> 00:08:20.494
with the electronics,
the third system of a rebreather.

00:08:20.518 --> 00:08:23.443
The most critical part of a rebreather
are the oxygen sensors.

00:08:23.467 --> 00:08:26.333
You need three, so if one goes bad,
you know which one it is.

00:08:26.357 --> 00:08:27.511
You need voting logic.

00:08:27.535 --> 00:08:29.440
You also have three microprocessors.

00:08:29.464 --> 00:08:31.944
Any one of those computers
can run the entire system,

00:08:31.968 --> 00:08:33.646
so if you have to lose two of them,

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.162
there's back-up power supplies.

00:08:35.186 --> 00:08:38.459
And there are multiple displays,
to get the information to the diver.

00:08:38.483 --> 00:08:41.975
This is the high-tech gadgetry
that allows us to do what we do

00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:43.233
on these deep dives.

00:08:43.257 --> 00:08:45.664
I can talk about it all day --
just ask my wife --

00:08:45.688 --> 00:08:48.367
but I want to move on
to something much more interesting.

00:08:48.391 --> 00:08:50.157
I'm going to take you on a deep dive,

00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:51.992
and show you what it's like to do one.

00:08:52.016 --> 00:08:53.167
We start up on the boat,

00:08:53.191 --> 00:08:55.296
For all this high-tech,
expensive equipment,

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.529
this is still the best way
to get in the water,

00:08:57.553 --> 00:08:59.292
just flop over the side of the boat.

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:01.543
Now, as I showed you
in the earlier diagram,

00:09:01.567 --> 00:09:04.932
these reefs that we dive on
start out near the surface

00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:07.604
and they go almost vertically,
completely straight down.

00:09:07.628 --> 00:09:10.509
So we drop in the water
and go over the edge of this cliff,

00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:12.747
and then we start dropping,
dropping, dropping.

00:09:12.771 --> 00:09:15.081
People ask if it takes
a long time to get there.

00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:18.798
No; it only takes a couple minutes
to get down to three or four hundred feet,

00:09:18.822 --> 00:09:20.314
which is what we're aiming for.

00:09:20.338 --> 00:09:23.404
It's like skydiving in slow motion.
It's really very interesting.

00:09:23.428 --> 00:09:24.716
You ever see "The Abyss,"

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.526
where Ed Harris is sinking down
along the side of the wall?

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.273
That's what it feels like. Amazing.

00:09:29.297 --> 00:09:32.694
And down there, you find that the water
is very clear, extremely clear,

00:09:32.718 --> 00:09:34.441
because there's hardly any plankton.

00:09:34.465 --> 00:09:37.002
When you turn on your light
and look around the caves,

00:09:37.026 --> 00:09:39.659
you're confronted with a tremendous
amount of diversity,

00:09:39.683 --> 00:09:41.496
much more than anyone used to believe.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.254
Now, not all of it is new species --

00:09:43.278 --> 00:09:46.979
that fish you see with the white stripe,
that's a known species.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.329
But if you look carefully
into the cracks and crevices,

00:09:50.353 --> 00:09:53.433
you'll see little things
scurrying all over the place.

00:09:53.457 --> 00:09:55.920
There's a just unbelievable diversity.

00:09:55.944 --> 00:09:57.270
It's not just fish, either.

00:09:57.294 --> 00:10:00.772
These are crinoids, sponges, black corals.
There're some more fishes.

00:10:00.796 --> 00:10:03.058
Those fishes that you see now
are new species.

00:10:03.082 --> 00:10:04.432
They're still new species,

00:10:04.456 --> 00:10:06.678
because I had a video camera
instead of my net,

00:10:06.702 --> 00:10:09.745
so they're still waiting down there
for someone to go find them.

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:11.289
But this is what it looks like.

00:10:11.313 --> 00:10:14.447
And this kind of habitat just goes
on and on and on for miles.

00:10:14.471 --> 00:10:16.405
This is Papua, New Guinea.

00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:20.964
Now little fishes and invertebrates
aren't the only things we see down there.

00:10:20.988 --> 00:10:22.262
We also see sharks,

00:10:22.286 --> 00:10:24.667
much more regularly
than I would have expected to.

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:25.892
We're not quite sure why.

00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:29.025
What I want you to do now
is imagine yourself 400 feet underwater,

00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:31.057
with all this high-tech gear on your back,

00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:33.229
you're in a remote reef
off Papua, New Guinea,

00:10:33.253 --> 00:10:36.014
thousands of miles from the nearest
recompression chamber,

00:10:36.038 --> 00:10:38.449
and you're completely
surrounded by sharks.

00:10:38.473 --> 00:10:40.958
(Video) Diver 1: (In squeaky voice)
Look at those ...

00:10:40.982 --> 00:10:42.145
Diver 2: Uh, oh ...

00:10:42.169 --> 00:10:43.320
Uh, oh!

00:10:43.344 --> 00:10:44.558
Audience: (Laughter)

00:10:44.582 --> 00:10:47.107
(Video) Diver 1: I think we have
their attention ...

00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:49.661
Richard Pyle: When you start
talking like Donald Duck,

00:10:49.685 --> 00:10:52.258
there's no situation in the world
that can seem tense.

00:10:52.282 --> 00:10:54.216
(Laughter)

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.154
So we're down there --
this is at 400 feet.

00:10:57.178 --> 00:11:01.052
That's looking straight up, by the way,
to give a sense of how far the surface is.

00:11:01.076 --> 00:11:03.324
And if you're a biologist
and know about sharks,

00:11:03.348 --> 00:11:06.598
and you want to assess,
how much jeopardy am I really in here,

00:11:06.622 --> 00:11:10.724
there's one question that sort of jumps
to the forefront of your mind immediately,

00:11:12.534 --> 00:11:13.690
which is --

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:16.166
(Video) Diver 1: What kind of sharks?

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.952
Diver 2: Silvertip sharks.

00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:19.142
Diver 1: Oh.

00:11:19.166 --> 00:11:21.663
RP: There are actually
three species of sharks here.

00:11:21.687 --> 00:11:24.575
The silvertips are the ones
with the white edges on the fins,

00:11:24.599 --> 00:11:28.083
and there're also gray reef sharks
and hammerheads off in the distance.

00:11:28.107 --> 00:11:30.044
And yes, it's a little nerve-racking.

00:11:31.964 --> 00:11:33.360
(Video) Diver 2: Hoo!

00:11:34.686 --> 00:11:36.521
That little guy is frisky!

00:11:36.545 --> 00:11:38.171
Audience: (Laughter)

00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:44.317
Now, you've seen video like this on TV
a lot, and it's very intimidating.

00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:46.734
I think it gives the wrong
impression about sharks;

00:11:46.758 --> 00:11:48.844
they're actually not
very dangerous animals.

00:11:48.868 --> 00:11:51.602
That's why we weren't worried much
and were joking around.

00:11:51.626 --> 00:11:54.303
More people are killed
by pigs, by lightning strikes,

00:11:54.327 --> 00:11:56.662
more people are killed
at soccer games in England.

00:11:56.686 --> 00:11:58.733
There's a lot of other ways you can die.

00:11:58.757 --> 00:12:00.531
And I'm not making that stuff up.

00:12:00.555 --> 00:12:04.257
Coconuts! You can get killed by a coconut
more likely than killed by a shark.

00:12:04.281 --> 00:12:08.258
So sharks aren't quite as dangerous
as most people make them out to be.

00:12:08.282 --> 00:12:11.337
Now, I don't know if any of you get
US News and World Report --

00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:12.559
I got the recent issue.

00:12:12.583 --> 00:12:15.400
There's a cover story
about the great explorers of our time.

00:12:15.424 --> 00:12:19.124
The last article is entitled,
"No New Frontiers."

00:12:19.148 --> 00:12:22.593
It questions whether or not there
really are any new frontiers out there,

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:26.021
whether there are any true, hardcore
discoveries that can still be made.

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:27.670
My favorite line from the article:

00:12:27.694 --> 00:12:31.563
[... 'discovery' can mean finding a guppy
with an extra spine in its dorsal fin."]

00:12:31.587 --> 00:12:34.354
I have to laugh; they don't call us
fish nerds for nothing.

00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:37.718
We actually do get excited about finding
a new dorsal spine in a guppy.

00:12:37.742 --> 00:12:39.139
But it's much more than that.

00:12:39.163 --> 00:12:42.739
I want to show you a few of the guppies
we've found over the years.

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:44.889
This one -- you can see how ugly it is.

00:12:44.913 --> 00:12:45.938
(Laughter)

00:12:45.962 --> 00:12:49.011
Even if you ignore
the scientific value of this thing,

00:12:49.035 --> 00:12:51.012
look at the monetary value of this thing.

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:54.089
A couple of these were sold
through the aquarium trade to Japan,

00:12:54.113 --> 00:12:56.226
where they sold for 15,000 dollars apiece.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.882
That's half a million dollars a pound.

00:12:59.485 --> 00:13:01.508
Here's another new angelfish
we discovered.

00:13:01.532 --> 00:13:05.018
This one we first discovered back
in the air days -- the bad old air days,

00:13:05.042 --> 00:13:07.431
when we were doing
these kind of dives with air.

00:13:07.455 --> 00:13:08.613
We were at 360 feet.

00:13:08.637 --> 00:13:11.895
I remember coming up from one
of these deep dives and I had this fog,

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:16.156
and the narcosis takes a little while
to fade away, sort of like sobering up.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.886
I had this vague recollection of seeing
this yellow fish with a black spot,

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.257
and thought, "Damn,
I should have caught one --

00:13:22.281 --> 00:13:23.723
I think that's a new species."

00:13:23.747 --> 00:13:25.374
Eventually, I looked in my bucket.

00:13:25.398 --> 00:13:28.379
Sure enough, I had caught one,
I just completely forgot.

00:13:28.403 --> 00:13:32.257
So this one, we decided to give
the name Centropyge narcosis to.

00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:34.244
That's its official scientific name,

00:13:34.268 --> 00:13:36.230
in reference to its deep-dwelling habits.

00:13:36.254 --> 00:13:37.447
This is another neat one.

00:13:37.471 --> 00:13:38.630
When we first found it,

00:13:38.654 --> 00:13:40.913
we weren't even sure
what family it belonged to,

00:13:40.937 --> 00:13:42.850
so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish,

00:13:42.874 --> 00:13:45.452
since it looked like something
from one of those books.

00:13:45.476 --> 00:13:46.826
Now, this one's pretty cool.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.292
If you go to Papua, New Guinea
and go down 300 feet,

00:13:49.316 --> 00:13:50.672
you'll see these big mounds.

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:53.943
This may be hard to see,
but they're a couple meters in diameter.

00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:57.304
If you look closely, you'll see
there's a little white and gray fish

00:13:57.328 --> 00:13:58.535
that hangs out near them.

00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:01.570
It turns out this little white fish
builds these giant mounds,

00:14:01.594 --> 00:14:03.118
one pebble at a time.

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:05.336
It's extraordinary
to find something like this.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.131
It's not just new species,
it's new behaviors, new ecology,

00:14:08.155 --> 00:14:09.306
all kind of new things.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.255
What I'm going to show you now, quickly,

00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:13.676
is a sampling of the new species
we've discovered.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.057
What's extraordinary is not just
the number of species we're finding --

00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:19.227
though as you can see,
that's pretty amazing;

00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:21.164
this is only half of what we've found --

00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:24.084
what's extraordinary
is how quickly we find them.

00:14:24.108 --> 00:14:27.443
We're up to seven new species per hour
of time we spend at that depth.

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:31.787
If you go to an Amazon jungle and fog
a tree, you may get a lot of bugs,

00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:33.908
but for fishes,
there's nowhere in the world

00:14:33.932 --> 00:14:36.789
you can get seven new species
per hour of time.

00:14:36.813 --> 00:14:39.400
Now, we've done some
back-of-the-envelope calculations,

00:14:39.424 --> 00:14:42.848
and we're predicting there are probably
about 2,000 to 2,500 new species

00:14:42.872 --> 00:14:44.221
in the Indo-Pacific alone.

00:14:44.245 --> 00:14:46.899
There are only five
to six thousand known species,

00:14:46.923 --> 00:14:50.495
so a very large percentage
of what is out there isn't really known.

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:54.099
We thought we had a handle on all the reef
fish diversity -- evidently not.

00:14:54.123 --> 00:14:56.345
I'm going to just close
on a very somber note.

00:14:56.369 --> 00:15:00.329
At the beginning, I said I'd show you
two extraordinary photographs.

00:15:00.353 --> 00:15:03.512
This is the second extraordinary
photograph I'm going to show you.

00:15:03.536 --> 00:15:07.724
This one was taken at the exact moment
I was down there filming those sharks.

00:15:07.748 --> 00:15:10.072
This was taken exactly
300 feet above my head.

00:15:11.236 --> 00:15:13.336
The reason this photograph
is extraordinary

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.878
is because it captures a moment

00:15:14.902 --> 00:15:17.336
in the very last minute
of a person's life.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.929
Less than 60 seconds after this picture
was taken, this guy was dead.

00:15:21.778 --> 00:15:24.941
When we recovered his body,
we figured out what had gone wrong.

00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:26.605
He had made a very simple mistake;

00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:29.161
he turned the wrong valve
when he filled his cylinder.

00:15:29.185 --> 00:15:32.190
he had 80 percent oxygen in his tank
when he should have had 40.

00:15:32.214 --> 00:15:34.870
He had an oxygen toxicity
seizure and he drowned.

00:15:34.894 --> 00:15:37.818
The reason I show this --
not to put a downer on everything --

00:15:37.842 --> 00:15:41.731
but I just want to use it to key off
my philosophy of life in general,

00:15:41.755 --> 00:15:43.493
which is that we all have two goals.

00:15:43.517 --> 00:15:46.761
The first goal we share with every other
living thing on this planet,

00:15:46.785 --> 00:15:47.945
which is to survive.

00:15:47.969 --> 00:15:51.849
I call it perpetuation: the survival
of the species and survival of ourselves,

00:15:51.873 --> 00:15:54.339
And those are both
about perpetuating the genome.

00:15:54.363 --> 00:15:57.607
The second goal, for those of us
who have mastered the first goal --

00:15:57.631 --> 00:16:02.010
call it spiritual fulfillment,
call it financial success,

00:16:02.034 --> 00:16:04.361
you can call it any number
of different things.

00:16:04.385 --> 00:16:07.070
I call it seeking joy,
this pursuit of happiness.

00:16:07.094 --> 00:16:10.733
So, I guess my theme on this
is this guy lived his life to the fullest,

00:16:10.757 --> 00:16:11.927
he absolutely did.

00:16:11.951 --> 00:16:13.737
You have to balance those two goals.

00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:15.628
If you live your whole life in fear --

00:16:15.652 --> 00:16:20.201
I mean, life is a sexually transmitted
disease with 100 percent mortality.

00:16:20.225 --> 00:16:22.385
So you can't live your life in fear.

00:16:22.409 --> 00:16:24.629
(Laughter)

00:16:24.653 --> 00:16:26.897
I thought that was an old one!

00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:27.972
(Applause)

00:16:27.996 --> 00:16:32.137
But at the same time, you don't want
to get so focused on rule number two,

00:16:32.161 --> 00:16:33.613
goal number two,

00:16:33.637 --> 00:16:35.336
that you neglect goal number one.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.605
Because once you're dead, you really can't
enjoy anything after that.

00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:41.605
So I wish you all the best of luck
in maintaining that balance

00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:42.821
in your future endeavors.

00:16:42.845 --> 00:16:43.995
Thanks.
