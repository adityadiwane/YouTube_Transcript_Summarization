00:00:15.873 --> 00:00:17.901
I worked on a film called "Apollo 13,"

00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:19.781
and when I worked on this film, I discovered something

00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:22.244
about how our brains work, and how our brains work

00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:24.523
is that, when we're sort of infused with

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:28.769
either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.177
it changes and alters our perception of things.

00:00:31.177 --> 00:00:33.354
It changes what we see. It changes what we remember.

00:00:33.354 --> 00:00:36.862
And as an experiment, because I dauntingly create

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:40.782
a task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch

00:00:40.782 --> 00:00:44.204
for this particular movie, because I put it out there,

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:46.261
I felt a little nervous about it, so I need to do an experiment

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:49.869
and bring a group of people like this in a projection room

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:52.549
and play this stock footage, and when I played this

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.350
stock footage, I simply wanted to find out

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.765
what people remembered, what was memorable about it?

00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:00.768
What should I actually try to replicate?

00:01:00.768 --> 00:01:04.539
What should I try to emulate to some degree?

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.628
So this is the footage that I was showing everybody.

00:01:07.628 --> 00:01:10.310
And what I discovered is, because of the nature

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.508
of the footage and the fact that we're doing this film,

00:01:12.508 --> 00:01:14.461
there was an emotion that was built into it

00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:17.539
and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.213
and all these various things.

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:21.245
When I showed it, and I asked, immediately after

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:24.036
the screening was over, what they thought of it,

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:26.502
what was your memorable shots, they changed them.

00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:28.880
They were -- had camera moves on them.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.556
They had all kinds of things. Shots were combined,

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:34.538
and I was just really curious, I mean, what the hell

00:01:34.538 --> 00:01:35.905
were you looking at just a few minutes ago

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:39.749
and how come, how'd you come up with this sort of description?

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:43.597
And what I discovered is, what I should do is not actually

00:01:43.597 --> 00:01:47.287
replicate what they saw, is replicate what they remembered.

00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:51.269
So this is our footage of the launch, based on, basically,

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:53.977
taking notes, asking people what they thought, and then

00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:56.419
the combination of all the different shots and all

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:58.347
the different things put together created their sort of

00:01:58.347 --> 00:02:00.386
collective consciousness of what they remembered

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.036
it looked like, but not what it really looked like.

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:05.034
So this is what we created for "Apollo 13."

00:02:05.034 --> 00:02:09.501
(Launch noises)

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:12.267
So literally what you're seeing now is the confluence

00:02:12.267 --> 00:02:14.328
of a bunch of different people, a bunch of different memories,

00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:17.626
including my own, of taking a little bit of liberty

00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:19.350
with the subject matter.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.987
I basically shot everything with short lenses,

00:02:21.987 --> 00:02:23.904
which means that you're very close to the action,

00:02:23.904 --> 00:02:26.194
but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots

00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:28.834
which gives you a sense of distance, so I was basically

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:30.818
was setting up something that would remind you

00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:34.290
of something you haven't really quite seen before. (Music)

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.821
And then I'm going to show you exactly what it is

00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:40.422
that you were reacting to when you were reacting to it.

00:02:40.422 --> 00:02:53.317
(Music)

00:02:53.332 --> 00:02:55.447
Tom Hanks: Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.

00:02:55.447 --> 00:02:58.238
It's good to see you again. (Cheers) (Music)

00:02:58.238 --> 00:03:00.678
Rob Legato: I pretend they're clapping for me.

00:03:00.678 --> 00:03:02.836
(Laughter)

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:06.241
So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can,

00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:08.066
and I'm basically recreating the launch with

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:12.405
fire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw

00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:15.750
in front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.567
if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you,

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:21.748
what you were reacting to, what you're emoting to,

00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:24.183
is something that's a total falsehood, and I found that

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:25.577
really kind of fascinating.

00:03:25.577 --> 00:03:28.553
And in this particular case, this is the climax of the movie,

00:03:28.553 --> 00:03:31.762
and, you know, the weight of achieving it was simply

00:03:31.762 --> 00:03:35.332
take a model, throw it out of a helicopter, and shoot it.

00:03:35.332 --> 00:03:37.335
And that's simply what I did.

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:39.812
That's me shooting, and I'm a fairly mediocre operator,

00:03:39.812 --> 00:03:43.351
so I got that nice sense of verisimilitude, of a kind of,

00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:46.183
you know, following the rocket all the way down,

00:03:46.183 --> 00:03:47.862
and giving that little sort of edge, I was desperately

00:03:47.862 --> 00:03:51.362
trying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing.

00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:53.959
We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut,

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.964
who was actually on some of the missions, of Apollo 15,

00:03:56.964 --> 00:04:00.483
and he was there to basically double check my science.

00:04:00.483 --> 00:04:04.004
And, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that.

00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:05.736
(Laughter)

00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:08.324
I don't know why, but they thought they did.

00:04:08.324 --> 00:04:12.466
So we were, he's a hero, he's an astronaut, and

00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:15.272
we're all sort of excited, and, you know, I gave myself

00:04:15.272 --> 00:04:17.743
the liberty of saying, you know, some of the shots I did

00:04:17.743 --> 00:04:20.152
didn't really suck that bad.

00:04:20.152 --> 00:04:23.412
And so maybe, you know, we were feeling kind of a little

00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:25.869
good about it, so I brought him in here, and he needed

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:28.406
to really check and see what we were doing,

00:04:28.406 --> 00:04:31.392
and basically give us our A plus report card,

00:04:31.392 --> 00:04:33.357
and so I showed him some shots we were working on,

00:04:33.357 --> 00:04:36.467
and waiting for the reaction that you hope for,

00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:39.556
which is what I got. (Music) (Launch noises)

00:04:39.556 --> 00:04:41.595
So I showed him these two shots,

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:45.012
and then he basically told me what he thought.

00:04:45.012 --> 00:04:47.549
("That's wrong") (Laughter)

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:50.508
Okay. (Laughter)

00:04:50.508 --> 00:04:52.432
It's what you dream about.

00:04:52.432 --> 00:04:55.432
(Laughter)

00:04:55.432 --> 00:04:58.939
So what I got from him is, he turned to me and said,

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.393
"You would never, ever design a rocket like that.

00:05:02.393 --> 00:05:03.642
You would never have a rocket go up

00:05:03.642 --> 00:05:05.703
while the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine

00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:07.758
the tragedy that could possibly happen with that?

00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:10.600
You would never, ever design a rocket like that."

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.747
And he was looking at me. It's like, Yeah, I don't know

00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:14.757
if you noticed, but I'm the guy out in the parking lot

00:05:14.757 --> 00:05:16.685
recreating one of America's finest moments with

00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:18.344
fire extinguishers.

00:05:18.344 --> 00:05:20.703
(Laughter)

00:05:20.703 --> 00:05:23.631
And I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut,

00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:25.908
a hero, and I'm from New Jersey, so --

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:27.607
(Laughter)

00:05:27.607 --> 00:05:29.644
I'm just going to show you some footage.

00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:32.254
I'm just going to show you some footage, and tell me what you think.

00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:34.677
And then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for.

00:05:34.677 --> 00:05:36.716
So I showed him this, and this is actual footage

00:05:36.716 --> 00:05:40.261
that he was on. This is Apollo 15. This was his mission.

00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:45.537
So I showed him this, and the reaction I got was interesting.

00:05:45.537 --> 00:05:48.321
("That's wrong too.") (Laughter)

00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:51.555
So, and what happened was, I mean, what I sort of intuned

00:05:51.555 --> 00:05:54.037
in that is that he remembered it differently.

00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:56.381
He remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry

00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:59.084
system, perfectly safe rocket launch, because he's sitting

00:05:59.084 --> 00:06:01.307
in a rocket that has, like, a hundred thousand pounds

00:06:01.307 --> 00:06:03.581
of thrust, built by the lowest bidder.

00:06:03.581 --> 00:06:05.836
He was hoping it was going to work out okay.

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:08.605
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:06:08.605 --> 00:06:10.749
So he twisted his memory around.

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:13.823
Now, Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin, who was not

00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:16.138
on the movie, so he had no idea that we were faking

00:06:16.138 --> 00:06:18.364
any of this footage, and he just responded

00:06:18.364 --> 00:06:21.194
as he would respond, and I'll run this.

00:06:21.194 --> 00:06:23.628
Ron Howard: Buzz Aldrin came up to me

00:06:23.628 --> 00:06:28.066
and said, "Hey, that launch footage, I saw some shots

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:33.064
I'd never seen before. Did you guys, what vault did you find

00:06:33.064 --> 00:06:35.525
that stuff in?" And I said, "Well, no vault, Buzz,

00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:38.943
we generated all that from scratch."

00:06:38.943 --> 00:06:42.847
And he said, "Huh, that's pretty good. Can we use it?"

00:06:42.847 --> 00:06:46.303
(Explosion) ("Sure") (Laughter)

00:06:46.303 --> 00:06:48.230
RL: I think he's a great American.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.011
(Laughter)

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.314
So, "Titanic" was, if you don't know the story,

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.054
doesn't end well.

00:06:57.054 --> 00:06:59.835
(Laughter)

00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:02.986
Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic.

00:07:02.986 --> 00:07:05.267
So he basically set up, or basically shattered

00:07:05.267 --> 00:07:07.670
the suspension of disbelief, because what he photographed

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.097
was the real thing, a Mir sub going down, or actually

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.440
two Mir subs going down to the real wreck,

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.477
and he created this very haunting footage.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.350
It's really beautiful, and it conjures up all these

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.544
various different emotions, but he couldn't photograph

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:23.273
everything, and to tell the story,

00:07:23.273 --> 00:07:25.123
I had to fill in the gaps, which is now rather daunting,

00:07:25.123 --> 00:07:27.684
because now I have to recreate back to back

00:07:27.684 --> 00:07:30.739
what really happened and I had, I'm the only one

00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:35.014
who could really blow it at that point.

00:07:35.014 --> 00:07:37.054
So this is the footage he photographed,

00:07:37.054 --> 00:07:41.698
and it was pretty moving and pretty awe-inspiring.

00:07:41.698 --> 00:07:44.195
So I'm going to just let it run, so you kind of absorb

00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:47.396
this sort of thing, and I'll describe my sort of reactions

00:07:47.396 --> 00:07:50.073
when I was looking at it for the very first time.

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:54.639
I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.024
see it come back to life.

00:07:56.024 --> 00:07:58.745
I automatically wanted to see this ship,

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:01.408
this magnificent ship, basically in all its glory,

00:08:01.408 --> 00:08:04.484
and conversely, I wanted to see it not in all its glory,

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.932
basically go back to what it looks like.

00:08:06.932 --> 00:08:10.392
So I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show you

00:08:10.392 --> 00:08:12.797
what I tried to do, which is kind of the heart of the movie,

00:08:12.797 --> 00:08:16.396
for me, and so that's why I wanted to do the movie,

00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:19.992
that's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created.

00:08:19.992 --> 00:08:21.973
And I'll show you, you know, another thing that I found

00:08:21.973 --> 00:08:24.260
interesting is what we really were emoting to

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.678
when you take a look at it.

00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:28.584
So here's the behind the scenes, a couple of little shots here.

00:08:28.584 --> 00:08:30.547
So, when you saw my footage,

00:08:30.547 --> 00:08:33.190
you were seeing this: basically, a bunch of guys

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.187
flipping a ship upside down, and the little Mir subs

00:08:36.187 --> 00:08:38.792
are actually about the size of small footballs,

00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:40.825
and shot in smoke.

00:08:40.825 --> 00:08:43.035
Jim went three miles went down, and I went about

00:08:43.035 --> 00:08:44.633
three miles away from the studio

00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:47.233
and photographed this in a garage.

00:08:47.233 --> 00:08:49.464
And so, but what you're emoting to, or what you're looking

00:08:49.464 --> 00:08:52.576
at, had the same feeling, the same haunting quality,

00:08:52.576 --> 00:08:55.817
that Jim's footage had, so I found it so fascinating

00:08:55.817 --> 00:09:00.309
that our brains sort of, once you believe something's real,

00:09:00.309 --> 00:09:03.116
you transfer everything that you feel about it,

00:09:03.116 --> 00:09:05.508
this quality you have, and it's totally artificial.

00:09:05.508 --> 00:09:09.240
It's totally make-believe, yet it's not to you,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.240
and I found that that was a very interesting thing

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.035
to explore and use, and it caused me to create the next

00:09:14.035 --> 00:09:15.830
effect that I'll show you, which is

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.045
this sort of magic transition, and all I was really attempting

00:09:19.045 --> 00:09:22.998
to do is basically have the audience cue the effect,

00:09:22.998 --> 00:09:25.650
so it became a seamless experience for them,

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.980
that I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation,

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.901
I was showing you what you wanted to see.

00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:37.684
And the very next shot, right after this --

00:09:37.684 --> 00:09:39.249
So you can see what I was doing.

00:09:39.249 --> 00:09:41.043
So basically, if there's two subs in the same shot,

00:09:41.043 --> 00:09:43.951
I shot it, because where's the camera coming from?

00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:45.512
And when Jim shot it, it was only one sub,

00:09:45.512 --> 00:09:46.783
because he was photographing from the other,

00:09:46.783 --> 00:09:48.487
and I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this.

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:51.857
I'll give it to Jim, because he could use the pat on the back.

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:58.175
(Laughter)

00:09:58.175 --> 00:10:00.514
Okay. So now the Titanic transition.

00:10:00.514 --> 00:10:03.665
So this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:06.582
magically transplant from one state of the Titanic

00:10:06.582 --> 00:10:10.530
to the other. So I'll just play the shot once. (Music)

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.970
(Music)

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:19.722
And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you.

00:10:25.014 --> 00:10:29.555
Gloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.

00:10:29.555 --> 00:10:32.344
RL: So, what I did is basically I had another

00:10:32.344 --> 00:10:35.182
screening room experience where I was basically tracking

00:10:35.182 --> 00:10:37.484
where I was looking, or where we were looking,

00:10:37.484 --> 00:10:39.902
and of course you're looking at the two people on the bow

00:10:39.902 --> 00:10:42.095
of the ship, and then at some point,

00:10:42.095 --> 00:10:44.113
I'm changing the periphery of the shot,

00:10:44.113 --> 00:10:46.435
I'm changing, it's becoming the rusted wreck,

00:10:46.435 --> 00:10:49.444
and then I would run it every day, and then I would find

00:10:49.444 --> 00:10:52.511
exactly the moment that I stopped looking at them

00:10:52.511 --> 00:10:54.701
and start noticing the rest of it, and the moment

00:10:54.701 --> 00:10:57.259
my eye shifted, we just marked it to the frame.

00:10:57.259 --> 00:10:59.635
The moment my eye shifted, I immediately started

00:10:59.635 --> 00:11:01.974
to change them, so now somehow you missed

00:11:01.974 --> 00:11:04.314
where it started and where it stopped.

00:11:04.314 --> 00:11:06.467
And so I'll just show it one more time.

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:09.664
(Music) And it's literally done by using what our brains

00:11:09.664 --> 00:11:13.399
naturally do for us, which is, as soon as you shift

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:15.351
your attention, something changes, and then I left

00:11:15.351 --> 00:11:17.494
the little scarf going, because it really wanted to be

00:11:17.494 --> 00:11:21.347
a ghostly shot, really wanted to feel like they were still

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:24.677
on the wreck, essentially. That's where they were buried forever.

00:11:24.677 --> 00:11:26.686
Or something like that. I just made that up.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:29.155
(Laughter)

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:31.039
It was, incidentally, the last time I ever saw daylight.

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:34.510
It was a long film to work on. (Laughter)

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.792
Now, "Hugo" was another interesting movie, because

00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:38.902
the movie itself is about film illusions.

00:11:38.902 --> 00:11:41.767
It's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:44.585
of vision that creates a motion picture,

00:11:44.585 --> 00:11:48.259
and one of the things I had to do is, we —

00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:51.586
Sasha Baron Cohen is a very clever, very smart guy,

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.737
comedian, wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of

00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:55.965
the Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things, and he wanted

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:59.273
his leg brace to get caught on a moving train.

00:11:59.273 --> 00:12:01.394
Very dangerous, very impossible to do, and particularly

00:12:01.394 --> 00:12:04.719
on our stage, because there literally is no way to actually

00:12:04.719 --> 00:12:09.583
move this train, because it fits so snugly into our set.

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:12.046
So let me show you the scene, and then I basically

00:12:12.046 --> 00:12:15.729
used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein,

00:12:15.729 --> 00:12:18.903
which is, if you have a camera that's moving with a moving

00:12:18.903 --> 00:12:21.672
object, what is not moving appears to be moving,

00:12:21.672 --> 00:12:24.271
and what is moving appears to be stopped,

00:12:24.271 --> 00:12:27.186
so what you're actually seeing now is the train is not

00:12:27.186 --> 00:12:32.266
moving at all, and what is actually moving is the floor.

00:12:32.266 --> 00:12:35.297
So this is the shot. That's a little video of

00:12:35.297 --> 00:12:38.579
what you're looking at there, which is our little test,

00:12:38.579 --> 00:12:41.158
so that's actually what you're seeing, and I thought it was

00:12:41.158 --> 00:12:43.315
sort of an interesting thing, because it was, part

00:12:43.315 --> 00:12:46.640
of the homage of the movie itself is coming up with this

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.158
sort of genius trick which I can't take credit for.

00:12:49.158 --> 00:12:51.823
I'd love to but I can't, because it was invented

00:12:51.823 --> 00:12:56.468
like in 1910 or something like that, is I told Marty,

00:12:56.468 --> 00:12:58.124
and it's kind of one of those mind things that it's

00:12:58.124 --> 00:13:00.505
really hard to really get until you actually see it work,

00:13:00.505 --> 00:13:03.385
and I said, you know, what I was going to do, and he said,

00:13:03.385 --> 00:13:05.607
"So, let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels?

00:13:05.607 --> 00:13:07.560
That doesn't move."

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.978
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:13:10.978 --> 00:13:14.954
"And the thing without the wheels, that moves."

00:13:14.954 --> 00:13:17.429
Precisely. (Laughter)

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:20.224
Brings me to the next, and final --

00:13:20.224 --> 00:13:24.293
Marty's not going to see this, is he? (Laughter)

00:13:24.293 --> 00:13:28.083
This isn't viewed outside of -- (Laughter)

00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:32.510
The next illustration is something that, there's like

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.572
all one shot theory. It's a very elegant way of telling a story,

00:13:35.572 --> 00:13:37.629
especially if you're following somebody on a journey,

00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:39.937
and that journey basically tells something about

00:13:39.937 --> 00:13:42.178
their personality in a very concise way,

00:13:42.178 --> 00:13:44.561
and what we wanted to do based on the shot in "Goodfellas,"

00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:46.445
which is one of the great shots ever,

00:13:46.445 --> 00:13:49.822
a Martin Scorsese film, of basically following Henry Hill

00:13:49.822 --> 00:13:51.958
through what it feels like to be a gangster walk

00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.521
going through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way.

00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:58.028
He was the master of his universe, and we wanted Hugo

00:13:58.028 --> 00:14:00.684
to feel the same way, so we created this shot.

00:14:00.684 --> 00:14:04.001
(Music)

00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:09.027
That's Hugo. (Music)

00:14:09.027 --> 00:14:12.104
And we felt that if we could basically move the camera

00:14:12.104 --> 00:14:14.794
with him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boy

00:14:14.794 --> 00:14:17.585
who is basically the master of his universe,

00:14:17.585 --> 00:14:20.044
and his universe is, you know, behind the scenes

00:14:20.044 --> 00:14:22.685
in the bowels of this particular train station

00:14:22.685 --> 00:14:24.989
that only he can actually navigate through

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:27.288
and do it this way, and we had to make it feel that

00:14:27.288 --> 00:14:29.595
this is his normal, everyday sort of life,

00:14:29.595 --> 00:14:32.161
so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important,

00:14:32.161 --> 00:14:34.777
and of course, in shooting in 3D, which is basically

00:14:34.777 --> 00:14:38.788
it's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick,

00:14:38.788 --> 00:14:42.310
so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task,

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.576
and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got

00:14:45.576 --> 00:14:47.138
when you saw the "Goodfellas" shot.

00:14:47.138 --> 00:14:50.939
So what you're now going to see is how we actually did it.

00:14:50.939 --> 00:14:54.124
It's actually five separate sets shot at five different times

00:14:54.124 --> 00:14:55.311
with two different boys.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.473
The one on the left is where the shot ends,

00:14:57.473 --> 00:15:02.899
and the shot on the right is where it takes over,

00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:06.404
and now we switch boys, so it went from Asa Butterfield,

00:15:06.404 --> 00:15:10.278
who's the star of the show, to his stand-in. (Music)

00:15:10.278 --> 00:15:12.127
I wouldn't say his stunt double. There's a crazy rig

00:15:12.127 --> 00:15:14.591
that we built for this. (Music)

00:15:14.591 --> 00:15:18.142
And so this is, and now this is set number three

00:15:18.142 --> 00:15:22.522
we're into, and then we're going to go into, basically

00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:25.186
the very last moment of the shot is actually

00:15:25.186 --> 00:15:27.468
the steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranes

00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:29.513
and various things like that, and it literally was done

00:15:29.513 --> 00:15:32.810
over five different sets, two different boys, different times,

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.640
and it all had to feel like it was all one shot, and what was

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.335
sort of great for me was it was probably

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:42.852
the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on,

00:15:42.852 --> 00:15:45.440
and, you know, I was kind of proud of it when I was done,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.338
which is, you should never really be proud of stuff, I guess.

00:15:50.338 --> 00:15:53.148
So I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine,

00:15:53.148 --> 00:15:55.072
and said, "You know, this is, you know, kind of

00:15:55.072 --> 00:15:56.944
the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on.

00:15:56.944 --> 00:15:59.855
What do you think was the reason?"

00:15:59.855 --> 00:16:01.265
And he said, "Because no one knows

00:16:01.265 --> 00:16:03.231
you had anything to do with it."

00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:06.037
(Laughter)

00:16:06.037 --> 00:16:09.951
So, all I can say is, thank you,

00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:15.151
and that's my presentation for you. (Applause)

00:16:15.151 --> 00:16:20.495
(Applause)
