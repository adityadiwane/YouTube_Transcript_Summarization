00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:25.726
Narrator: Many of the tests are conducted

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.536
while Yves is strapped onto the wing,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.317
because Yves' body
is an integral part of the aircraft.

[Wind tunnel tests]

00:01:33.603 --> 00:01:37.236
Narrator: The wing has no steering
controls, no flaps, no rudder.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.236
Yves uses his body to steer the wing.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.236
Stefan Von Bergen: Well, he turns

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.641
by just putting his head
on one or the other side.

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:47.236
And sometimes he assists that
with his hands,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.677
sometimes even with the leg.

00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:53.800
He's acting as a human
fuselage, so to say.

00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:55.569
And that's quite unique.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.174
Narrator: When he arches his back,
he gains altitude.

00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:13.545
When he pushes his shoulders forward,
he goes into a dive.

Commentator One: There he goes.

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:53.236
There is Yves Rossy.

00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:56.236
And I think the wing is open.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.236
So our first critical moment, it's open.

00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:01.644
He is down. Is he flying?

00:04:02.092 --> 00:04:04.286
Commentator Two:
It looks like he's stabilized.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.835
He's starting to make his climb.

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.074
Commentator One:
There's that 90 degree turn.

00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:09.353
He's out over the channel.

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:11.698
There is Yves Rossy.

00:04:11.722 --> 00:04:13.637
There is no turning back now.

00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:16.692
He is over the English Channel
and under way.

Ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.856

And as he approaches the ground,

00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:45.155
he's going to pull down
on those toggles to flare,

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:47.236
slow himself down just a little bit,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.952
and then come in for a nice landing.

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.903
Commentator One: There he is.

00:04:57.927 --> 00:05:00.461

00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:16.513
And his equipment as well.

00:05:16.537 --> 00:05:18.967
Yves, welcome. It is quite amazing.

00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:22.218
Those sequences were shot
over the last three years

00:05:22.242 --> 00:05:24.102
in various moments of your activities.

00:05:24.126 --> 00:05:26.236
And there were many, many others.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.601
So it's possible to fly
almost like a bird.

00:05:32.606 --> 00:05:34.613

00:05:34.637 --> 00:05:36.980
I don't have feathers.

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:40.303
But I feel like a bird sometimes.

00:05:40.327 --> 00:05:43.646
It's really an unreal feeling,

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.345
because normally you have a big thing,

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:48.236
a plane, around you.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.786
And when I strap just this little harness,

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.366
this little wing,

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.642
I really have the feeling of being a bird.

00:05:57.666 --> 00:05:59.782
BG: How did you start to become Jetman?

00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:02.541
YR: It was about 20 years ago,

00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:04.858
when I discovered free falling.

00:06:04.882 --> 00:06:09.275
When you go out of an airplane,
you are almost naked.

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:10.898
You take a position like that.

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:15.196
And especially when you take
a tracking position,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.236
you have the feeling that you are flying.

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:22.930
And that's the nearest thing to the dream.

00:06:22.954 --> 00:06:25.442
You have no machine around you.

00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:27.236
You are just in the element.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.259
It's very short and only in one direction.

00:06:30.283 --> 00:06:31.319
(Laughter)

00:06:31.343 --> 00:06:34.265
So the idea was, okay,

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.628
keep that feeling of freedom,

00:06:37.652 --> 00:06:41.025
but change the vector
and increase the time.

00:06:41.049 --> 00:06:43.418
BG: So I'm kind of curious,
what's your top speed?

00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:47.236
YR: It's about 300 km per hour
before looping.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.441
That means about 190 miles per hour.

00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:53.070
BG: What's the weight
of the equipment you're carrying?

00:06:53.094 --> 00:06:55.714
YR: When I exit full of kerosene,

00:06:55.738 --> 00:06:58.471
I'm about 55 kilos.

00:06:58.495 --> 00:07:00.236
I have 55 kilos on my back.

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:02.373
BG: And you're not piloting?

00:07:02.397 --> 00:07:04.875
There is no handle, no steering, nothing?

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:06.437
It is purely your body,

00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:08.938
and the wings become part
of the body and vice versa?

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:10.390
YR: That's really the goal,

00:07:10.414 --> 00:07:13.150
because if you put in steering,

00:07:13.174 --> 00:07:15.815
then you reinvent the airplane.

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:20.426
And I wanted to keep this
freedom of movement.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.434
And it's really like the kid
playing the airplane.

00:07:23.458 --> 00:07:25.108
I want to go down like that.

00:07:25.132 --> 00:07:27.585
And up I climb, I turn.

00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:30.958
It's really pure flying.

00:07:30.982 --> 00:07:33.835
It's not steering, it's flight.

00:07:33.859 --> 00:07:38.236
BG: What kind of training do you do,
you personally, for that?

00:07:38.874 --> 00:07:42.236
YR: Actually, I try to stay just fit.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.327
I don't do special physical training.

00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:54.328
I just try to keep my mobility
through new activities.

00:07:55.123 --> 00:08:00.083
For example, last winter
I began with kite surfing.

00:08:00.107 --> 00:08:01.236
So, new things.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.236
So you have to adapt.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.815
I'm quite an experienced
manager of systems as a pilot,

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:10.236
but this is, really --

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.624
You need fluidity,

00:08:12.648 --> 00:08:15.116
you need to be agile

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.616
and also to adapt really fast.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.450
BG: Somebody in the audience asked me,

00:08:19.474 --> 00:08:21.236
"How does he breathe up there?"

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.237
Because you're going fast
and you're up at 3,000 meters or so.

00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:26.513
YR: Okay, up to 3,000 meters,

00:08:26.537 --> 00:08:30.203
it's not such a big problem with oxygen.

00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:32.789
But for example, bikers,

00:08:32.813 --> 00:08:34.784
they have the same speed.

00:08:34.808 --> 00:08:37.198
Just with the helmet, integral helmet,

00:08:37.222 --> 00:08:39.174
it's really no problem to breathe.

00:08:39.198 --> 00:08:41.965
BG: Describe for me the equipment,
since you have it here.

00:08:41.989 --> 00:08:44.080
So Breitling's four engines.

00:08:44.104 --> 00:08:45.941
YR: Yeah, two-meter span.

00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:48.236
Ultra-stable profile.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.101
Four little engines,

00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:52.672
22 kilos thrust each,

00:08:52.696 --> 00:08:56.036
turbines, working with kerosene.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.918
Harness, parachute.

00:08:58.942 --> 00:09:02.125
My only instruments
are an altimeter and time.

00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:05.304
I know I have about eight minutes fuel.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.236
So I just check before it's finished.

00:09:08.597 --> 00:09:10.740
(Laughter)

00:09:11.629 --> 00:09:13.236
And yeah, that's all.

00:09:13.915 --> 00:09:15.963
Two parachutes.

00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:21.378
That means, if I have a problem
with the first one I pull,

00:09:21.402 --> 00:09:25.020
I still have the possibility
to open the second one.

00:09:25.044 --> 00:09:26.440
And this is my life.

00:09:26.464 --> 00:09:29.480
That's the real important
thing about safety.

00:09:30.067 --> 00:09:33.639
I did use that during these last 15 years

00:09:33.663 --> 00:09:35.502
about 20 times.

00:09:35.526 --> 00:09:38.804
Never with that type of wing,
but at the beginning.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.867
I can release my wing

00:09:41.891 --> 00:09:45.017
when I am in a spin or unstable.

00:09:45.041 --> 00:09:47.734
BG: We saw the 2009 crossing
of the Gibraltar Strait

00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:49.236
where you lost control

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.045
and then you dived down into the clouds

00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:53.236
and in the ocean.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.057
So that was one of those cases
where you let the wings go, right?

00:09:57.081 --> 00:09:59.506
YR: Yeah. I did try in the clouds,

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.236
but you lose orientation completely.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.816
So I did try to take, again,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.768
a climb altitude.

00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:09.840
I thought, okay, I will go out.

00:10:09.864 --> 00:10:12.655
But most probably,
I did something like that.

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:13.749
(Laughter)

00:10:13.773 --> 00:10:16.236
BG: Something that is not
very safe, the image.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.305
YR: You feel great, but --

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:21.583
(Laughter)

00:10:21.607 --> 00:10:23.551
But you have not the right altitude.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.768
So the next thing I saw was just blue.

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.236
It was the sea.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.246
I have also an audible altimeter.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.572
So I was at my minimum altitude

00:10:33.596 --> 00:10:36.904
in that vector -- fast --

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.781
so I pulled that.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.203
And then I did open my chute.

00:10:40.227 --> 00:10:43.799
BG: So the wings have their own parachute,
and you have your two parachutes.

00:10:43.823 --> 00:10:46.434
YR: Exactly. There is a rescue
parachute for the wing

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:48.236
for two reasons:

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.975
so I can repair it afterward

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:55.345
and especially so nobody takes
that, just on his head.

00:10:55.369 --> 00:10:57.600
BG: I see. Maybe come back here.

00:10:57.624 --> 00:11:00.053
This is risky stuff indeed.

00:11:00.077 --> 00:11:03.002
People have died trying
to do this kind of thing.

00:11:03.026 --> 00:11:06.122
And you don't look like a crazy guy;
you're a Swiss airline pilot,

00:11:06.146 --> 00:11:08.912
so you're rather a checklist kind of guy.

00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:10.706
I assume you have standards.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.437
YR: Yeah. I have no checklist for that.

00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:14.559
(Laughter)

00:11:14.583 --> 00:11:16.234
BG: Let's not tell your employer.

00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:17.350
(Laughter)

00:11:17.374 --> 00:11:19.260
YR: No, that's really two worlds.

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:24.042
Civil aviation is something
that we know very well.

00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:26.962
We have a hundred years of experience.

00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:31.220
And you can adapt really precisely.

00:11:31.244 --> 00:11:34.236
With that, I have to adapt
to something new.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.823
That means improvise.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.490
So it's really a play
between these two approaches.

00:11:39.514 --> 00:11:42.729
Something that I know
very well, these principles.

00:11:42.753 --> 00:11:46.014
For example, we have
two engines on an Airbus;

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:48.393
with only one engine, you can fly it.

00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:51.004
So plan B, always a plan B.

00:11:51.028 --> 00:11:52.934
In a fighter, you have an ejection seat.

00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.985
That's my ejection seat.

00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:57.985
So I have the approach
of a professional pilot

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:03.254
with the respect of a pioneer

00:12:03.278 --> 00:12:04.982
in front of Mother Nature.

00:12:05.761 --> 00:12:08.236
BG: It's well said.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.392
What happens if one of the engines stops?

00:12:11.404 --> 00:12:15.033
YR: I do a roll.

00:12:15.057 --> 00:12:18.341
And then I stabilize,

00:12:18.365 --> 00:12:22.337
and according to my altitude,
I continue on two or three engines.

00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:23.918
It's sometimes possible.

00:12:23.942 --> 00:12:27.119
It's quite complicated to explain,

00:12:27.143 --> 00:12:30.513
but according to which regime I was,

00:12:30.537 --> 00:12:32.236
I can continue on two

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.879
and try to get a nice place to land,
and then I open my parachute.

00:12:35.903 --> 00:12:37.524
BG: So the beginning of the flight

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.920
is actually you jump
off a plane or a helicopter,

00:12:39.944 --> 00:12:42.663
and you go on a dive
and accelerate the engines,

00:12:42.687 --> 00:12:45.236
and then you basically take off
mid-air somewhere.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.236
And then the landing, as we have seen,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.102
arriving on this side of the Channel,

00:12:50.126 --> 00:12:51.821
is through a parachute.

00:12:51.845 --> 00:12:53.710
So just as a curiosity,

00:12:53.734 --> 00:12:56.591
where did you land when you flew
over the Grand Canyon?

00:12:57.156 --> 00:12:59.236
Did you land on the rim,
down at the bottom?

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.530
YR: It was down on the bottom.

00:13:01.554 --> 00:13:05.906
And I came back afterward
on the sled of the helicopter back.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.339
But it was too stony
and full of cactus on top.

00:13:10.363 --> 00:13:11.379
(Laughter)

00:13:11.403 --> 00:13:13.545
BG: That's exactly
why I asked the question.

00:13:13.569 --> 00:13:17.394
YR: And also, the currents
are quite funny there.

00:13:17.418 --> 00:13:19.624
There is big thermal activity,

00:13:19.648 --> 00:13:21.680
big difference in altitude also.

00:13:21.704 --> 00:13:25.613
So it was much safer for me
to land at the bottom.

00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:28.954
BG: I think that right now,
many people are asking,

00:13:28.978 --> 00:13:30.946
"When are you developing a double-seater

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.236
so they can fly with you?"

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.442
YR: I have a standard answer.

00:13:34.466 --> 00:13:37.942
Have you ever seen tandem birds?

00:13:38.464 --> 00:13:39.467
(Laughter)

00:13:39.491 --> 00:13:40.632
BG: Perfect answer.

00:13:40.656 --> 00:13:43.706
(Applause)

00:13:49.063 --> 00:13:50.236
(Applause ends)

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.957
BG: Yves, one last question.

00:13:52.981 --> 00:13:55.236
What's next for you?
What's next for Jetman?

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.571
YR: First, to instruct a younger guy.

00:13:59.595 --> 00:14:02.614
I want to share it,
to do formation flights.

00:14:03.164 --> 00:14:05.678
And I plan to start from a cliff,

00:14:05.702 --> 00:14:07.583
like catapulted from a cliff.

00:14:07.607 --> 00:14:09.608
BG: So instead of jumping
off a plane, yes?

00:14:09.632 --> 00:14:13.536
YR: Yes, with the final goal to take off,
but with initial speed.

00:14:13.865 --> 00:14:15.872
Really, I go step by step.

00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:18.980
It seems a little bit crazy, but it's not.

00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:22.559
It's possible to start already now,
it's just too dangerous.

00:14:22.583 --> 00:14:24.543
(Laughter)

00:14:24.567 --> 00:14:29.955
Thanks to the increasing technology,
better technology,

00:14:29.979 --> 00:14:31.262
it will be safe.

00:14:31.286 --> 00:14:33.236
And I hope it will be for everybody.

00:14:34.071 --> 00:14:36.073
BG: Yves, thank you very much. Yves Rossy.

00:14:36.097 --> 00:14:39.157
(Applause)
