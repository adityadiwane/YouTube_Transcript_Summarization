00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:15.104
I want you to look
around the room for a minute

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:17.847
and try to find the most
paranoid person here --

00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:18.935
(Laughter)

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:21.411
And then I want you to point
at that person for me.

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:22.470
(Laughter)

00:00:22.494 --> 00:00:23.853
OK, don't actually do it.

00:00:23.877 --> 00:00:24.996
(Laughter)

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.889
But, as an organizational psychologist,

00:00:26.913 --> 00:00:28.795
I spend a lot of time in workplaces,

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.979
and I find paranoia everywhere.

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.941
Paranoia is caused by people
that I call "takers."

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:36.148
Takers are self-serving
in their interactions.

00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.433
It's all about what can you do for me.

00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:40.233
The opposite is a giver.

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:43.017
It's somebody who approaches
most interactions by asking,

00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:44.641
"What can I do for you?"

00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:48.036
I wanted to give you a chance
to think about your own style.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.013
We all have moments of giving and taking.

00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:53.053
Your style is how you treat
most of the people most of the time,

00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:54.235
your default.

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:55.801
I have a short test you can take

00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:58.324
to figure out if you're more
of a giver or a taker,

00:00:58.348 --> 00:00:59.826
and you can take it right now.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.289
[The Narcissist Test]

00:01:01.313 --> 00:01:03.625
[Step 1: Take a moment
to think about yourself.]

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:04.752
(Laughter)

00:01:04.776 --> 00:01:07.634
[Step 2: If you made it to Step 2,
you are not a narcissist.]

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:09.217
(Laughter)

00:01:10.082 --> 00:01:13.915
This is the only thing I will say today
that has no data behind it,

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.371
but I am convinced the longer it takes
for you to laugh at this cartoon,

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:19.822
the more worried we should be
that you're a taker.

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:20.911
(Laughter)

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:22.967
Of course, not all takers are narcissists.

00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:25.879
Some are just givers who got burned
one too many times.

00:01:25.903 --> 00:01:29.227
Then there's another kind of taker
that we won't be addressing today,

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.104
and that's called a psychopath.

00:01:31.128 --> 00:01:32.279
(Laughter)

00:01:32.303 --> 00:01:35.175
I was curious, though, about how
common these extremes are,

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:38.008
and so I surveyed over 30,000
people across industries

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:39.644
around the world's cultures.

00:01:39.668 --> 00:01:42.146
And I found that most people
are right in the middle

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.636
between giving and taking.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.005
They choose this third style
called "matching."

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:49.374
If you're a matcher, you try to keep
an even balance of give and take:

00:01:49.398 --> 00:01:52.716
quid pro quo -- I'll do something
for you if you do something for me.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.121
And that seems like a safe way
to live your life.

00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:58.329
But is it the most effective
and productive way to live your life?

00:01:58.353 --> 00:02:00.817
The answer to that question
is a very definitive ...

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:01.999
maybe.

00:02:02.023 --> 00:02:03.249
(Laughter)

00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:05.452
I studied dozens of organizations,

00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:06.651
thousands of people.

00:02:06.675 --> 00:02:10.227
I had engineers measuring
their productivity.

00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:12.606
(Laughter)

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.599
I looked at medical students' grades --

00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:17.598
even salespeople's revenue.

00:02:17.622 --> 00:02:19.068
(Laughter)

00:02:19.092 --> 00:02:20.744
And, unexpectedly,

00:02:20.768 --> 00:02:24.437
the worst performers in each
of these jobs were the givers.

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.793
The engineers who got the least work done

00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:29.323
were the ones who did more favors
than they got back.

00:02:29.347 --> 00:02:31.483
They were so busy doing
other people's jobs,

00:02:31.507 --> 00:02:35.057
they literally ran out of time and energy
to get their own work completed.

00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:37.886
In medical school, the lowest grades
belong to the students

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.017
who agree most strongly
with statements like,

00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:42.249
"I love helping others,"

00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:45.292
which suggests the doctor
you ought to trust

00:02:45.316 --> 00:02:48.395
is the one who came to med school
with no desire to help anybody.

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:49.446
(Laughter)

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.828
And then in sales, too,
the lowest revenue accrued

00:02:51.852 --> 00:02:53.547
in the most generous salespeople.

00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:56.001
I actually reached out
to one of those salespeople

00:02:56.025 --> 00:02:57.632
who had a very high giver score.

00:02:57.656 --> 00:03:00.214
And I asked him, "Why do
you suck at your job --"

00:03:00.238 --> 00:03:01.779
I didn't ask it that way, but --

00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:02.847
(Laughter)

00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:05.223
"What's the cost of generosity in sales?"

00:03:05.247 --> 00:03:08.513
And he said, "Well, I just care
so deeply about my customers

00:03:08.537 --> 00:03:11.299
that I would never sell them
one of our crappy products."

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:12.724
(Laughter)

00:03:12.748 --> 00:03:13.976
So just out of curiosity,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.284
how many of you self-identify more
as givers than takers or matchers?

00:03:17.308 --> 00:03:18.458
Raise your hands.

00:03:18.962 --> 00:03:21.911
OK, it would have been more
before we talked about these data.

00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:26.152
But actually, it turns out
there's a twist here,

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:29.472
because givers are often
sacrificing themselves,

00:03:29.496 --> 00:03:31.675
but they make their organizations better.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:35.112
We have a huge body of evidence --

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:38.869
many, many studies looking
at the frequency of giving behavior

00:03:38.893 --> 00:03:41.030
that exists in a team
or an organization --

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.140
and the more often people are helping
and sharing their knowledge

00:03:44.164 --> 00:03:45.317
and providing mentoring,

00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:48.118
the better organizations do
on every metric we can measure:

00:03:48.142 --> 00:03:50.973
higher profits, customer satisfaction,
employee retention --

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:52.842
even lower operating expenses.

00:03:53.407 --> 00:03:56.275
So givers spend a lot of time
trying to help other people

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.506
and improve the team,

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.006
and then, unfortunately,
they suffer along the way.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.698
I want to talk about what it takes

00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:05.043
to build cultures where givers
actually get to succeed.

00:04:05.564 --> 00:04:08.584
So I wondered, then, if givers
are the worst performers,

00:04:08.608 --> 00:04:10.436
who are the best performers?

00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:14.088
Let me start with the good news:
it's not the takers.

00:04:14.112 --> 00:04:17.767
Takers tend to rise quickly
but also fall quickly in most jobs.

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:19.888
And they fall at the hands of matchers.

00:04:19.912 --> 00:04:23.332
If you're a matcher, you believe
in "An eye for an eye" -- a just world.

00:04:23.356 --> 00:04:24.776
And so when you meet a taker,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.669
you feel like it's your mission in life

00:04:26.693 --> 00:04:28.735
to just punish the hell
out of that person.

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:29.773
(Laughter)

00:04:29.797 --> 00:04:31.422
And that way justice gets served.

00:04:32.108 --> 00:04:34.078
Well, most people are matchers.

00:04:34.102 --> 00:04:35.686
And that means if you're a taker,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.690
it tends to catch up with you eventually;

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:39.352
what goes around will come around.

00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:40.982
And so the logical conclusion is:

00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:43.871
it must be the matchers
who are the best performers.

00:04:43.895 --> 00:04:45.413
But they're not.

00:04:45.437 --> 00:04:48.287
In every job, in every organization
I've ever studied,

00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:50.473
the best results belong
to the givers again.

00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:54.809
Take a look at some data I gathered
from hundreds of salespeople,

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:55.986
tracking their revenue.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.665
What you can see is that the givers
go to both extremes.

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.907
They make up the majority of people
who bring in the lowest revenue,

00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:03.397
but also the highest revenue.

00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:06.025
The same patterns were true
for engineers' productivity

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:07.440
and medical students' grades.

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:10.071
Givers are overrepresented
at the bottom and at the top

00:05:10.095 --> 00:05:12.177
of every success metric that I can track.

00:05:12.201 --> 00:05:13.503
Which raises the question:

00:05:13.527 --> 00:05:16.936
How do we create a world
where more of these givers get to excel?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.783
I want to talk about how to do that,
not just in businesses,

00:05:19.807 --> 00:05:21.638
but also in nonprofits, schools --

00:05:21.662 --> 00:05:22.955
even governments.

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.185
Are you ready?

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:25.395
(Cheers)

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.411
I was going to do it anyway,
but I appreciate the enthusiasm.

00:05:28.435 --> 00:05:29.458
(Laughter)

00:05:29.482 --> 00:05:31.326
The first thing that's really critical

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.097
is to recognize that givers
are your most valuable people,

00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:36.555
but if they're not careful, they burn out.

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:39.069
So you have to protect
the givers in your midst.

00:05:39.093 --> 00:05:43.233
And I learned a great lesson about this
from Fortune's best networker.

00:05:44.993 --> 00:05:46.343
It's the guy, not the cat.

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:47.527
(Laughter)

00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:49.307
His name is Adam Rifkin.

00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:51.543
He's a very successful serial entrepreneur

00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:54.361
who spends a huge amount
of his time helping other people.

00:05:54.385 --> 00:05:56.721
And his secret weapon
is the five-minute favor.

00:05:57.261 --> 00:05:59.920
Adam said, "You don't have to be
Mother Teresa or Gandhi

00:05:59.944 --> 00:06:01.127
to be a giver.

00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:03.654
You just have to find small ways
to add large value

00:06:03.678 --> 00:06:05.035
to other people's lives."

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:07.402
That could be as simple
as making an introduction

00:06:07.426 --> 00:06:10.357
between two people who could
benefit from knowing each other.

00:06:10.381 --> 00:06:13.718
It could be sharing your knowledge
or giving a little bit of feedback.

00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:16.054
Or It might be even something
as basic as saying,

00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:17.307
"You know,

00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:18.831
I'm going to try and figure out

00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:21.884
if I can recognize somebody
whose work has gone unnoticed."

00:06:22.462 --> 00:06:24.756
And those five-minute favors
are really critical

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.502
to helping givers set boundaries
and protect themselves.

00:06:27.962 --> 00:06:29.407
The second thing that matters

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.899
if you want to build a culture
where givers succeed,

00:06:31.923 --> 00:06:34.848
is you actually need a culture
where help-seeking is the norm;

00:06:34.872 --> 00:06:36.052
where people ask a lot.

00:06:36.536 --> 00:06:39.205
This may hit a little too close
to home for some of you.

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.268
[So in all your relationships,
you always have to be the giver?]

00:06:42.292 --> 00:06:43.316
(Laughter)

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.071
What you see with successful givers

00:06:45.095 --> 00:06:48.215
is they recognize that it's OK
to be a receiver, too.

00:06:48.754 --> 00:06:51.617
If you run an organization,
we can actually make this easier.

00:06:51.641 --> 00:06:53.938
We can make it easier
for people to ask for help.

00:06:53.962 --> 00:06:56.034
A couple colleagues and I
studied hospitals.

00:06:56.058 --> 00:06:59.260
We found that on certain floors,
nurses did a lot of help-seeking,

00:06:59.284 --> 00:07:01.535
and on other floors,
they did very little of it.

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:04.905
The factor that stood out on the floors
where help-seeking was common,

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:06.080
where it was the norm,

00:07:06.104 --> 00:07:08.479
was there was just one nurse
whose sole job it was

00:07:08.503 --> 00:07:10.534
to help other nurses on the unit.

00:07:10.558 --> 00:07:11.939
When that role was available,

00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:15.620
nurses said, "It's not embarrassing,
it's not vulnerable to ask for help --

00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:17.024
it's actually encouraged."

00:07:18.263 --> 00:07:21.089
Help-seeking isn't important
just for protecting the success

00:07:21.113 --> 00:07:22.512
and the well-being of givers.

00:07:22.536 --> 00:07:25.468
It's also critical to getting
more people to act like givers,

00:07:25.492 --> 00:07:26.681
because the data say

00:07:26.705 --> 00:07:30.105
that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent
of all giving in organizations

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:31.407
starts with a request.

00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:33.444
But a lot of people don't ask.

00:07:33.468 --> 00:07:35.216
They don't want to look incompetent,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.267
they don't know where to turn,
they don't want to burden others.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.000
Yet if nobody ever asks for help,

00:07:40.024 --> 00:07:42.699
you have a lot of frustrated givers
in your organization

00:07:42.723 --> 00:07:44.706
who would love to step up and contribute,

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.896
if they only knew
who could benefit and how.

00:07:47.413 --> 00:07:49.211
But I think the most important thing,

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:51.711
if you want to build a culture
of successful givers,

00:07:51.735 --> 00:07:54.537
is to be thoughtful about who
you let onto your team.

00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:57.577
I figured, you want a culture
of productive generosity,

00:07:57.601 --> 00:07:59.573
you should hire a bunch of givers.

00:07:59.597 --> 00:08:03.267
But I was surprised to discover, actually,
that that was not right --

00:08:03.715 --> 00:08:06.190
that the negative impact
of a taker on a culture

00:08:06.214 --> 00:08:09.083
is usually double to triple
the positive impact of a giver.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.680
Think about it this way:

00:08:10.704 --> 00:08:12.368
one bad apple can spoil a barrel,

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:15.218
but one good egg
just does not make a dozen.

00:08:15.942 --> 00:08:17.494
I don't know what that means --

00:08:17.518 --> 00:08:18.637
(Laughter)

00:08:18.661 --> 00:08:20.034
But I hope you do.

00:08:20.058 --> 00:08:23.380
No -- let even one taker into a team,

00:08:23.404 --> 00:08:26.258
and you will see that the givers
will stop helping.

00:08:26.648 --> 00:08:29.578
They'll say, "I'm surrounded
by a bunch of snakes and sharks.

00:08:29.602 --> 00:08:30.968
Why should I contribute?"

00:08:30.992 --> 00:08:32.968
Whereas if you let one giver into a team,

00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:35.114
you don't get an explosion of generosity.

00:08:35.138 --> 00:08:36.559
More often, people are like,

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:38.721
"Great! That person can do all our work."

00:08:39.077 --> 00:08:41.823
So, effective hiring and screening
and team building

00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:43.983
is not about bringing in the givers;

00:08:44.007 --> 00:08:46.221
it's about weeding out the takers.

00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:48.187
If you can do that well,

00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:50.153
you'll be left with givers and matchers.

00:08:50.177 --> 00:08:51.542
The givers will be generous

00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:54.200
because they don't have to worry
about the consequences.

00:08:54.224 --> 00:08:57.337
And the beauty of the matchers
is that they follow the norm.

00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:00.129
So how do you catch a taker
before it's too late?

00:09:00.745 --> 00:09:03.632
We're actually pretty bad
at figuring out who's a taker,

00:09:03.656 --> 00:09:05.482
especially on first impressions.

00:09:05.506 --> 00:09:07.814
There's a personality trait
that throws us off.

00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:09.143
It's called agreeableness,

00:09:09.167 --> 00:09:11.788
one the major dimensions
of personality across cultures.

00:09:11.812 --> 00:09:15.297
Agreeable people are warm and friendly,
they're nice, they're polite.

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.112
You find a lot of them in Canada --

00:09:17.136 --> 00:09:18.739
(Laughter)

00:09:18.763 --> 00:09:22.260
Where there was actually
a national contest

00:09:22.284 --> 00:09:25.314
to come up with a new Canadian slogan
and fill in the blank,

00:09:25.338 --> 00:09:26.913
"As Canadian as ..."

00:09:26.937 --> 00:09:29.021
I thought the winning entry
was going to be,

00:09:29.045 --> 00:09:31.516
"As Canadian as maple syrup,"
or, "... ice hockey."

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.525
But no, Canadians voted
for their new national slogan to be --

00:09:34.549 --> 00:09:35.710
I kid you not --

00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:38.165
"As Canadian as possible
under the circumstances."

00:09:38.189 --> 00:09:41.402
(Laughter)

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.391
Now for those of you
who are highly agreeable,

00:09:44.415 --> 00:09:45.808
or maybe slightly Canadian,

00:09:45.832 --> 00:09:47.205
you get this right away.

00:09:47.229 --> 00:09:49.046
How could I ever say I'm any one thing

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.896
when I'm constantly adapting
to try to please other people?

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.223
Disagreeable people do less of it.

00:09:54.247 --> 00:09:57.184
They're more critical,
skeptical, challenging,

00:09:57.208 --> 00:10:00.262
and far more likely than their peers
to go to law school.

00:10:00.286 --> 00:10:01.429
(Laughter)

00:10:01.453 --> 00:10:04.108
That's not a joke,
that's actually an empirical fact.

00:10:04.132 --> 00:10:05.191
(Laughter)

00:10:05.215 --> 00:10:07.764
So I always assumed
that agreeable people were givers

00:10:07.788 --> 00:10:09.735
and disagreeable people were takers.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:11.189
But then I gathered the data,

00:10:11.213 --> 00:10:14.326
and I was stunned to find
no correlation between those traits,

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.009
because it turns out
that agreeableness-disagreeableness

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.196
is your outer veneer:

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.161
How pleasant is it to interact with you?

00:10:20.185 --> 00:10:22.877
Whereas giving and taking
are more of your inner motives:

00:10:22.901 --> 00:10:25.793
What are your values?
What are your intentions toward others?

00:10:25.817 --> 00:10:28.009
If you really want to judge
people accurately,

00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:31.550
you have to get to the moment every
consultant in the room is waiting for,

00:10:31.574 --> 00:10:32.739
and draw a two-by-two.

00:10:32.763 --> 00:10:34.861
(Laughter)

00:10:37.648 --> 00:10:39.655
The agreeable givers are easy to spot:

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:42.313
they say yes to everything.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.613
The disagreeable takers
are also recognized quickly,

00:10:46.637 --> 00:10:50.544
although you might call them
by a slightly different name.

00:10:50.568 --> 00:10:52.432
(Laughter)

00:10:53.828 --> 00:10:55.900
We forget about the other
two combinations.

00:10:55.924 --> 00:10:59.259
There are disagreeable givers
in our organizations.

00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:01.924
There are people who are gruff
and tough on the surface

00:11:01.948 --> 00:11:04.486
but underneath have
others' best interests at heart.

00:11:05.089 --> 00:11:06.452
Or as an engineer put it,

00:11:06.476 --> 00:11:08.082
"Oh, disagreeable givers --

00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:11.982
like somebody with a bad user interface
but a great operating system."

00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:13.292
(Laughter)

00:11:13.316 --> 00:11:14.687
If that helps you.

00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:15.861
(Laughter)

00:11:16.424 --> 00:11:19.927
Disagreeable givers are the most
undervalued people in our organizations,

00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:22.543
because they're the ones
who give the critical feedback

00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:25.173
that no one wants to hear
but everyone needs to hear.

00:11:25.197 --> 00:11:27.685
We need to do a much better job
valuing these people

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:29.497
as opposed to writing them off early,

00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:31.265
and saying, "Eh, kind of prickly,

00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:32.786
must be a selfish taker."

00:11:33.849 --> 00:11:36.608
The other combination we forget about
is the deadly one --

00:11:36.632 --> 00:11:39.314
the agreeable taker,
also known as the faker.

00:11:40.444 --> 00:11:42.509
This is the person
who's nice to your face,

00:11:42.533 --> 00:11:44.513
and then will stab you right in the back.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.869
(Laughter)

00:11:46.537 --> 00:11:49.771
And my favorite way to catch
these people in the interview process

00:11:49.795 --> 00:11:51.067
is to ask the question,

00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:53.053
"Can you give me the names of four people

00:11:53.077 --> 00:11:55.446
whose careers you have
fundamentally improved?"

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.317
The takers will give you four names,

00:11:58.341 --> 00:12:01.038
and they will all be more
influential than them,

00:12:01.062 --> 00:12:04.264
because takers are great at kissing up
and then kicking down.

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:08.357
Givers are more likely to name people
who are below them in a hierarchy,

00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:09.927
who don't have as much power,

00:12:09.951 --> 00:12:11.323
who can do them no good.

00:12:11.723 --> 00:12:14.897
And let's face it, you all know
you can learn a lot about character

00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:17.476
by watching how someone
treats their restaurant server

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.663
or their Uber driver.

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:20.585
So if we do all this well,

00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:22.693
if we can weed takers
out of organizations,

00:12:22.717 --> 00:12:24.629
if we can make it safe to ask for help,

00:12:24.653 --> 00:12:26.667
if we can protect givers from burnout

00:12:26.691 --> 00:12:29.918
and make it OK for them to be ambitious
in pursuing their own goals

00:12:29.942 --> 00:12:32.098
as well as trying to help other people,

00:12:32.122 --> 00:12:35.029
we can actually change the way
that people define success.

00:12:35.053 --> 00:12:38.405
Instead of saying it's all about
winning a competition,

00:12:38.429 --> 00:12:41.969
people will realize success
is really more about contribution.

00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:45.122
I believe that the most
meaningful way to succeed

00:12:45.146 --> 00:12:47.016
is to help other people succeed.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.711
And if we can spread that belief,

00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:51.386
we can actually turn paranoia upside down.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.573
There's a name for that.

00:12:52.597 --> 00:12:54.033
It's called "pronoia."

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:56.722
Pronoia is the delusional belief

00:12:56.746 --> 00:12:59.346
that other people
are plotting your well-being.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.893
(Laughter)

00:13:02.908 --> 00:13:05.461
That they're going around behind your back

00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:08.401
and saying exceptionally
glowing things about you.

00:13:09.647 --> 00:13:13.456
The great thing about a culture of givers
is that's not a delusion --

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.714
it's reality.

00:13:15.697 --> 00:13:18.273
I want to live in a world
where givers succeed,

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.619
and I hope you will help me
create that world.

00:13:20.643 --> 00:13:21.864
Thank you.

00:13:21.888 --> 00:13:27.174
(Applause)
