00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
In 1962, Buckminster Fuller

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.330
presented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
It was a 200-foot diameter geodesic sphere

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.330
to be suspended over the East River in New York City, in full view of the United Nations.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.330
It was a big idea, for sure, and it was one that he felt could truly inform

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.330
and deeply affect the decision making of this body

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.330
through animations of global data, trends

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.330
and other information regarding the globe, on this sphere.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
And today, 45 years later,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
but what we do have is improved technology.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
Today we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
We can use LEDs.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.330
LEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
Most importantly for this, they're faster.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330
And this speed, combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
allows us to actually simulate, in this piece,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.330
over 17,000 LEDs -- using just 64.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.330
And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.330
But as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm -- that's 28 times per second.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
The equator's speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
There are four on-board micro-controllers

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
that, each time this ring rotates

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
it, as it passes the rear of the display,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
it picks up a position signal.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
And from that, the on-board micro-controllers

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.330
can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
But this is really just the beginning.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
In addition to higher resolution versions of this display,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
my father and I are working on a new patent-pending design

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
So as you can see here, this is a, eleven-inch diameter circuit board.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
These blocks represent LEDs.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.330
And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
it will create a disc of light that we can control.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
That's nothing new: that's a propeller clock;

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
that's the rims that you can buy for your car.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.330
But what is new is that, when we rotate this disc about this axis,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
And so we can control that with micro-controllers

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.330
and create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
Now this piece is currently in process --

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.330
due out in May -- but what we've done is we've put together a small demo,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.330
just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
I've got a little video to show you,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.330
but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
and this is also with only four LEDs.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
This is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final display will be in May.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
So, take a look.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.330
And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only, creating circles.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
And then, as the other axis kicks in,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
those actually blur into a volume.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
And the shutter speed of the camera

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
actually makes it slightly less effective in this case.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
But this piece is due out in May.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
in Greenwich Village in New York City -- that's open to the public,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.330
definitely invite you all to come and attend -- it's a fantastic show.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.330
There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
This piece, actually, will be on display

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
down in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
in the breaks between now and the end of the show.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
So I'd love to talk to you all, and invite you

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
to come down and take a closer look.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
It's an honor to be here. Thanks very much.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.330
