00:00:12.544 --> 00:00:15.571
By 2010, Detroit had become the poster child

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.712
for an American city in crisis.

00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:19.584
There was a housing collapse,

00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:21.542
an auto industry collapse,

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:24.094
and the population had plummeted by 25 percent

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:26.516
between 2000 and 2010,

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:28.733
and many people were beginning to write it off,

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:32.459
as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities.

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:34.846
By 2010, I had also been asked by

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:37.046
the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:40.300
to join them in leading a citywide planning process

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.774
for the city to create a shared vision for its future.

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:45.245
I come to this work

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.062
as an architect and an urban planner,

00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:49.668
and I've spent my career working
in other contested cities,

00:00:49.668 --> 00:00:51.524
like Chicago, my hometown;

00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:53.530
Harlem, which is my current home;

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.556
Washington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.936
All of these cities, to me, still had a number

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:01.772
of unresolved issues related to urban justice,

00:01:01.772 --> 00:01:06.124
issues of equity, inclusion and access.

00:01:06.124 --> 00:01:08.187
Now by 2010, as well,

00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:10.202
popular design magazines were also beginning

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.915
to take a closer look at cities like Detroit,

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:16.552
and devoting whole issues to "fixing the city."

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:18.928
I was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein,

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:20.903
to do an interview for the October issue

00:01:20.903 --> 00:01:22.554
of Architect magazine,

00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:24.209
and he and I kind of had a good chuckle

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.425
when we saw the magazine released with the title,

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:30.311
"Can This Planner Save Detroit?"

00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:33.186
So I'm smiling with a little bit
of embarrassment right now,

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:35.593
because obviously, it's completely absurd

00:01:35.593 --> 00:01:37.565
that a single person, let alone a planner,

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:39.023
could save a city.

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:41.524
But I'm also smiling because I thought it represented

00:01:41.524 --> 00:01:44.158
a sense of hopefulness that our profession

00:01:44.158 --> 00:01:47.076
could play a role in helping the city to think about

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:51.140
how it would recover from its severe crisis.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.412
So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.093
and tell you a little bit about our process

00:01:55.093 --> 00:01:57.769
for fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit,

00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:00.883
and I want to do that through
the voices of Detroiters.

00:02:00.883 --> 00:02:03.951
So we began our process in September of 2010.

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:06.880
It's just after a special mayoral election,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.921
and word has gotten out that there is going to be

00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:10.465
this citywide planning process,

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:12.814
which brings a lot of anxiety and fears

00:02:12.814 --> 00:02:14.597
among Detroiters.

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:18.842
We had planned to hold a number
of community meetings in rooms like this

00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:21.226
to introduce the planning process,

00:02:21.226 --> 00:02:23.222
and people came out from all over the city,

00:02:23.222 --> 00:02:26.073
including areas that were stable neighborhoods,

00:02:26.073 --> 00:02:27.849
as well as areas that were beginning to see

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.843
a lot of vacancy.

00:02:29.843 --> 00:02:31.941
And most of our audience was representative

00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:34.494
of the 82 percent African-American population

00:02:34.494 --> 00:02:36.759
in the city at that time.

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:40.247
So obviously, we have a Q&amp;A portion of our program,

00:02:40.247 --> 00:02:43.144
and people line up to mics to ask questions.

00:02:43.144 --> 00:02:45.903
Many of them step very firmly to the mic,

00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:48.751
put their hands across their chest, and go,

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:52.230
"I know you people are trying to
move me out of my house, right?"

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.549
So that question is really powerful,

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.762
and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment,

00:02:57.762 --> 00:02:59.871
when you connect it to the stories

00:02:59.871 --> 00:03:01.258
that some Detroiters had,

00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:03.464
and actually a lot of African-Americans'

00:03:03.464 --> 00:03:04.921
families have had

00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:08.652
that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit.

00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:10.987
Many of them told us the stories about

00:03:10.987 --> 00:03:12.447
how they came to own their home

00:03:12.447 --> 00:03:14.611
through their grandparents or great-grandparents,

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.485
who were one of 1.6 million people who migrated

00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:20.178
from the rural South to the industrial North,

00:03:20.178 --> 00:03:22.526
as depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence,

00:03:22.526 --> 00:03:24.152
"The Great Migration."

00:03:24.152 --> 00:03:27.395
They came to Detroit for a better way of life.

00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:29.999
Many found work in the automobile industry,

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.400
the Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.455
by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art.

00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:39.430
The fruits of their labors would afford them a home,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.311
for many the first piece of property
that they would ever know,

00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.174
and a community with other first-time

00:03:44.174 --> 00:03:46.303
African-American home buyers.

00:03:46.303 --> 00:03:48.683
The first couple of decades of their life in the North

00:03:48.683 --> 00:03:51.727
is quite well, up until about 1950,

00:03:51.727 --> 00:03:54.335
which coincides with the city's peak population

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:56.642
at 1.8 million people.

00:03:56.642 --> 00:03:59.020
Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.238
a second kind of migration,

00:04:01.238 --> 00:04:03.571
a migration to the suburbs.

00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:06.408
Between 1950 and 2000,

00:04:06.408 --> 00:04:09.343
the region grows by 30 percent.

00:04:09.343 --> 00:04:11.242
But this time, the migration leaves

00:04:11.242 --> 00:04:13.347
African-Americans in place,

00:04:13.347 --> 00:04:16.293
as families and businesses flee the city,

00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:18.655
leaving the city pretty desolate of people

00:04:18.655 --> 00:04:20.409
as well as jobs.

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:25.209
During that same period, between
1950 and 2000, 2010,

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:28.074
the city loses 60 percent of its population,

00:04:28.074 --> 00:04:31.998
and today it hovers at above 700,000.

00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:34.484
The audience members who come
and talk to us that night

00:04:34.484 --> 00:04:37.269
tell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:39.986
with such depleted population.

00:04:39.986 --> 00:04:42.336
Many tell us that they're one of only a few homes

00:04:42.336 --> 00:04:44.879
on their block that are occupied,

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.486
and that they can see several abandoned homes

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:49.733
from where they sit on their porches.

00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:54.072
Citywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes.

00:04:54.072 --> 00:04:57.087
They can also see vacant property.

00:04:57.087 --> 00:04:58.944
They're beginning to see illegal activities

00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:01.168
on these properties, like illegal dumping,

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:05.473
and they know that because the city
has lost so much population,

00:05:05.473 --> 00:05:10.640
their costs for water, electricity, gas are rising,

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.472
because there are not enough people
to pay property taxes

00:05:13.482 --> 00:05:16.816
to help support the services that they need.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:21.069
Citywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels.

00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:23.067
Now, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale,

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:24.417
because I know that sounds like a big number,

00:05:24.417 --> 00:05:26.955
but I don't think you quite understand
until you look at the city map.

00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:29.661
So the city is 139 square miles.

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:31.707
You can fit Boston, San Francisco,

00:05:31.707 --> 00:05:33.267
and the island of Manhattan

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:34.943
within its footprint.

00:05:34.943 --> 00:05:37.333
So if we take all of that vacant
and abandoned property

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:39.529
and we smush it together,

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:41.365
it looks like about 20 square miles,

00:05:41.365 --> 00:05:43.333
and that's roughly equivalent to the size

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:45.040
of the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.490
at 22 square miles.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.090
So it's a lot of vacancy.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.266
Now some of our audience members

00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:54.384
also tell us about some of the positive things

00:05:54.384 --> 00:05:56.429
that are happening in their communities,

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:58.016
and many of them are banding together

00:05:58.016 --> 00:06:00.122
to take control of some of the vacant lots,

00:06:00.122 --> 00:06:01.991
and they're starting community gardens,

00:06:01.991 --> 00:06:04.666
which are creating a great sense
of community stewardship,

00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:06.661
but they're very, very clear to tell us

00:06:06.661 --> 00:06:08.452
that this is not enough,

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:09.958
that they want to see their neighborhoods

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.311
return to the way that their
grandparents had found them.

00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.754
Now there's been a lot of speculation since 2010

00:06:15.754 --> 00:06:18.430
about what to do with the vacant property,

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.150
and a lot of that speculation has
been around community gardening,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.382
or what we call urban agriculture.

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:24.960
So many people would say to us,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.668
"What if you just take all that vacant land
and you could make it farmland?

00:06:27.668 --> 00:06:29.771
It can provide fresh foods,

00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:32.476
and it can put Detroiters back to work too."

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:33.921
When I hear that story,

00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:36.537
I always imagine the folks from the Great Migration

00:06:36.537 --> 00:06:38.791
rolling over in their graves,

00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:42.108
because you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice

00:06:42.108 --> 00:06:44.185
moving from the South to the North

00:06:44.185 --> 00:06:46.297
to create a better life for their families,

00:06:46.297 --> 00:06:50.543
only to see their great-grandchildren
return to an agrarian lifestyle,

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.751
especially in a city where they came

00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:54.805
with little less than a high school education

00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:56.772
or even a grammar school education

00:06:56.772 --> 00:06:58.797
and were able to afford the basic elements

00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:00.086
of the American dream:

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:04.121
steady work and a home that they owned.

00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:06.352
Now, there's a third wave of migration

00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:07.912
happening in Detroit:

00:07:07.912 --> 00:07:11.056
a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs.

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:13.472
These folks see that same vacant land

00:07:13.472 --> 00:07:14.967
and those same abandoned homes

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.362
as opportunity for new,

00:07:16.362 --> 00:07:19.033
entrepreneurial ideas and profit,

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:21.020
so much so that former models

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.441
can move to Detroit,

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:24.762
buy property, start successful

00:07:24.762 --> 00:07:26.439
businesses and restaurants,

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:29.419
and become successful community
activists in their neighborhood,

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:32.441
bringing about very positive change.

00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:35.345
Similarly, we have small manufacturing companies

00:07:35.345 --> 00:07:38.614
making conscious decisions to relocate to the city.

00:07:38.614 --> 00:07:41.399
This company, Shinola, which is a luxury watch

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:43.111
and bicycle company,

00:07:43.111 --> 00:07:45.004
deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit,

00:07:45.004 --> 00:07:47.641
and they quote themselves by saying

00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:51.899
they were drawn to the global brand 
of Detroit's innovation.

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:54.471
And they also knew that 
they can tap into a workforce

00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:57.997
that was still very skilled in how to make things.

00:07:57.997 --> 00:08:00.566
Now we have community stewardship

00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:02.126
happening in neighborhoods,

00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:04.925
we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions

00:08:04.925 --> 00:08:07.973
to move to the city and create enterprises,

00:08:07.973 --> 00:08:09.708
and we have businesses relocating,

00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:11.094
and this is all in the context

00:08:11.094 --> 00:08:13.366
of what is no secret to us all,

00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:15.167
a city that's under the control

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:16.789
of an emergency manager,

00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:21.063
and just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.

00:08:21.063 --> 00:08:24.305
So 2010, we started this process, and by 2013,

00:08:24.305 --> 00:08:26.389
we released Detroit Future City,

00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:29.227
which was our strategic plan to guide the city

00:08:29.227 --> 00:08:31.046
into a better and more prosperous

00:08:31.046 --> 00:08:33.323
and more sustainable existence --

00:08:33.323 --> 00:08:36.988
not what it was, but what it could be,

00:08:36.988 --> 00:08:40.303
looking at new ways of economic growth,

00:08:40.303 --> 00:08:42.284
new forms of land use,

00:08:42.284 --> 00:08:45.392
more sustainable and denser neighborhoods,

00:08:45.392 --> 00:08:48.808
a reconfigured infrastructure
and city service system,

00:08:48.808 --> 00:08:51.676
and a heightened capacity for civic leaders

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:54.938
to take action and implement change.

00:08:54.938 --> 00:08:57.536
Three key imperatives were really important

00:08:57.536 --> 00:08:58.817
to our work.

00:08:58.817 --> 00:09:02.695
One was that the city itself
wasn't necessarily too large,

00:09:02.695 --> 00:09:04.383
but the economy was too small.

00:09:04.383 --> 00:09:07.643
There are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit,

00:09:07.643 --> 00:09:11.041
very different from a Denver
or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia

00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:15.961
that are anywhere between 
35 to 70 jobs per 100 people.

00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:18.383
Secondly, there had to be an acceptance

00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:20.339
that we were not going to be able to use

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:23.203
all of this vacant land in the way that we had before

00:09:23.203 --> 00:09:25.212
and maybe for some time to come.

00:09:25.212 --> 00:09:27.777
It wasn't going to be our traditional
residential neighborhoods

00:09:27.777 --> 00:09:29.394
as we had before,

00:09:29.394 --> 00:09:32.152
and urban agriculture, while a very productive

00:09:32.152 --> 00:09:34.844
and successful intervention happening in Detroit,

00:09:34.844 --> 00:09:36.947
was not the only answer,

00:09:36.947 --> 00:09:39.383
that what we had to do is look at these areas

00:09:39.383 --> 00:09:41.191
where we had significant vacancy

00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:44.426
but still had a significant number of population

00:09:44.426 --> 00:09:47.324
of what could be new, productive, innovative,

00:09:47.324 --> 00:09:48.858
and entrepreneurial uses

00:09:48.858 --> 00:09:50.813
that could stabilize those communities,

00:09:50.813 --> 00:09:54.181
where still nearly 300,000 residents lived.

00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:56.997
So we came up with one neighborhood typology --

00:09:56.997 --> 00:09:59.970
there are several --
called a live-make neighborhood,

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.929
where folks could reappropriate

00:10:01.929 --> 00:10:03.667
abandoned structures

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:05.957
and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises,

00:10:05.957 --> 00:10:09.040
with a specific emphasis on looking at the, again,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.225
majority 82 percent African-American population.

00:10:12.225 --> 00:10:14.326
So they, too, could take businesses

00:10:14.326 --> 00:10:16.725
that they maybe were doing out of their home

00:10:16.725 --> 00:10:19.436
and grow them to more prosperous industries

00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:22.146
and actually acquire property so they were actually

00:10:22.146 --> 00:10:24.595
property owners as well as business owners

00:10:24.595 --> 00:10:27.121
in the communities with which they resided.

00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:29.199
Then we also wanted to look at other ways

00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:32.533
of using land in addition to growing food

00:10:32.533 --> 00:10:34.357
and transforming landscape into

00:10:34.357 --> 00:10:36.217
much more productive uses,

00:10:36.217 --> 00:10:39.507
so that it could be used for storm
water management, for example,

00:10:39.507 --> 00:10:42.523
by using surface lakes and retention ponds,

00:10:42.523 --> 00:10:44.283
that created neighborhood amenities,

00:10:44.283 --> 00:10:45.975
places of recreation,

00:10:45.975 --> 00:10:47.792
and actually helped to elevate

00:10:47.792 --> 00:10:49.479
adjacent property levels.

00:10:49.479 --> 00:10:51.339
Or we could use it as research plots,

00:10:51.339 --> 00:10:54.647
where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils,

00:10:54.647 --> 00:10:58.613
or we could use it to generate energy.

00:10:58.613 --> 00:11:01.811
So the descendants of the Great Migration

00:11:01.811 --> 00:11:05.055
could either become precision
watchmakers at Shinola,

00:11:05.055 --> 00:11:08.366
like Willie H., who was featured
in one of their ads last year,

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:10.758
or they can actually grow a business

00:11:10.758 --> 00:11:13.483
that would service companies like Shinola.

00:11:13.483 --> 00:11:15.485
The good news is, there is a future

00:11:15.485 --> 00:11:18.044
for the next generation of Detroiters,

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:21.208
both those there now and those that want to come.

00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:23.339
So no thank you, Mayor Menino,

00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:24.982
who recently was quoted as saying,

00:11:24.982 --> 00:11:27.597
"I'd blow up the place and start over."

00:11:27.597 --> 00:11:29.948
There are very important people,

00:11:29.948 --> 00:11:32.349
business and land assets in Detroit,

00:11:32.349 --> 00:11:34.145
and there are real opportunities there.

00:11:34.145 --> 00:11:36.768
So while Detroit might not be what it was,

00:11:36.768 --> 00:11:38.387
Detroit will not die.

00:11:38.387 --> 00:11:40.410
Thank you.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.838
(Applause)
