00:00:12.392 --> 00:00:14.586
I'm almost like a crazy evangelical.

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:17.331
I've always known that the age of design is upon us,

00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:19.412
almost like a rapture.

00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:20.947
If the day is sunny, I think,

00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:23.472
"Oh, the gods have had a good design day."

00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:27.788
Or, I go to a show and I see a beautiful piece by an artist,

00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:29.090
particularly beautiful, I say

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.090
he's so good because he clearly looked to design

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.813
to understand what he needed to do.

00:00:33.813 --> 00:00:36.514
So I really do believe that design

00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:39.276
is the highest form of creative expression.

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:42.986
That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design,

00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:45.181
and the age of design is the age in which design

00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:49.020
is still cute furniture, is still posters,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.878
is still fast cars, what you see at MoMA today.

00:00:51.878 --> 00:00:55.703
But in truth, what I really would like to explain

00:00:55.703 --> 00:00:58.005
to the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:00.668
the most interesting chairs are the ones

00:01:00.668 --> 00:01:03.545
that are actually made by a robot,

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:06.326
like this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij,

00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:10.058
where a robot deposits a toothpaste-like slur

00:01:10.058 --> 00:01:12.914
of recycled refrigerator parts,

00:01:12.914 --> 00:01:17.382
as if he were a big candy, and makes a chair out of it.

00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:21.017
Or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time

00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:23.146
and that become part of our identity.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:24.866
I want people to understand

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:28.081
that design is so much more than cute chairs,

00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:31.548
that it is first and foremost everything that is around us

00:01:31.548 --> 00:01:33.137
in our life.

00:01:33.137 --> 00:01:35.970
And it's interesting how so much of what we're talking about

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.146
tonight is not simply design but interaction design.

00:01:39.146 --> 00:01:43.023
And in fact, interaction design is what I've been trying

00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:45.401
to insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:48.365
for a few years, starting not very timidly

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:51.139
but just pointedly with works, for instance,

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:53.700
by Martin Wattenberg -- the way a machine

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.644
plays chess with itself, that you see here,

00:01:56.644 --> 00:02:00.108
or Lisa Strausfeld and her partners, the Sugar interface

00:02:00.108 --> 00:02:02.218
for One Laptop Per Child,

00:02:02.218 --> 00:02:06.072
Toshio Iwai's Tenori-On musical instruments,

00:02:06.072 --> 00:02:09.284
and Philip Worthington's Shadow Monsters,

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:11.740
and John Maeda's Reactive Books,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.905
and also Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's I Want You To Want Me.

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:18.596
These were some of the first acquisitions that really

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:21.780
introduced the idea of interaction design to the public.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.019
But more recently, I've been trying really to go even deeper

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.252
into interaction design with examples

00:02:28.252 --> 00:02:30.995
that are emotionally really suggestive

00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:33.700
and that really explain interaction design at a level

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.771
that is almost undeniable.

00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:38.851
The Wind Map, by Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas,

00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:41.267
I don't know if you've ever seen it -- it's really fantastic.

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:43.789
It looks at the territory of the United States

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:49.514
as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds

00:02:49.514 --> 00:02:52.687
and that is really giving you a pictorial image

00:02:52.687 --> 00:02:55.911
of what's going on with the winds in the United States.

00:02:55.911 --> 00:03:00.530
But also, more recently, we started acquiring video games,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.073
and that's where all hell broke loose

00:03:03.073 --> 00:03:05.241
in a really interesting way. (Laughter)

00:03:05.241 --> 00:03:07.921
There are still people that believe that there's a high and there's a low.

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.895
And that's really what I find so intriguing

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:15.444
about the reactions that we've had to the anointment

00:03:15.444 --> 00:03:17.680
of video games in the MoMA collection.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.967
We've -- No, first of all, New York Magazine always gets it.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:23.112
I love them. So we are in the right quadrant.

00:03:23.112 --> 00:03:27.346
We are in the Highbrow -- that's daring, that's courageous --

00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:28.769
and Brilliant, which is great.

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.105
Timidly, we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations,

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:35.472
but it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good. (Laughter)

00:03:35.472 --> 00:03:38.600
But here comes the art critic. Oh, that was fantastic.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.816
So the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian.

00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:43.484
"Sorry, MoMA, video games are not art."

00:03:43.484 --> 00:03:47.769
Did I ever say they were art? I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.576
"Exhibiting Pac-Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh" --

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:54.736
They're two floors away. (Laughter) —

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:59.404
"will mean game over for any real understanding of art."

00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:03.379
I'm bringing in the end of the world. You know?

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.216
We were talking about the rapture? It's coming.

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:07.953
And Jonathan Jones is making it happen.

00:04:07.953 --> 00:04:10.727
So the same Guardian rebuts,

00:04:10.727 --> 00:04:13.466
"Are video games art: the debate that shouldn't be.

00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:16.055
Last week, Guardian art critic blah blah suggested

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:19.369
that games cannot qualify as art. But is he right?

00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:21.844
And does it matter?" Thank you. Does it matter?

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:24.585
You know, it's like once again there's this whole problem

00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:27.537
of design being often misunderstood for art,

00:04:27.537 --> 00:04:31.404
or the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:34.729
aspire to, would like to be called, artists.

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.041
No. Designers aspire to be really great designers.

00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:39.954
Thank you very much. And that's more than enough.

00:04:39.954 --> 00:04:43.441
So my knight in shining armor, John Maeda,

00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:46.943
without any prompt, came out with this big declaration

00:04:46.943 --> 00:04:49.313
on why video games belong in the MoMA.

00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:51.473
And that was fantastic. And I thought that was it.

00:04:51.473 --> 00:04:55.129
But then there was another wonderfully pretentious article

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.177
that came out in The New Republic, so pretentious,

00:04:58.177 --> 00:05:02.137
by Liel Leibovitz, and it said, "MoMA has mistaken video games for art." Again.

00:05:02.137 --> 00:05:05.557
"The museum is putting Pac-Man alongside Picasso." Again.

00:05:05.557 --> 00:05:06.676
"That misses the point."

00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:08.534
Excuse me. You're missing the point.

00:05:08.534 --> 00:05:12.582
And here, look, the above question is put bluntly:

00:05:12.582 --> 00:05:15.932
"Are video games art? No. Video games aren't art

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:20.453
because they are quite thoroughly something else: code."

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:24.004
Oh, so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right?

00:05:24.004 --> 00:05:26.234
So it's so fantastic to see

00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:29.430
how these feathers that were ruffled,

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.496
and these reactions, were so vehement.

00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:32.555
And you know what?

00:05:32.555 --> 00:05:35.072
The International Cat Video Film Festival

00:05:35.072 --> 00:05:37.505
didn't have that much of a reaction. (Laughter)

00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:39.244
I think this was truly fantastic.

00:05:39.244 --> 00:05:42.219
We were talking about dancing ponies, but I was really jealous

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:45.535
of the Walker Arts Center for putting up this festival,

00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:47.919
because it's very, very wonderful.

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.859
And there's this Flaubert quote that I love:

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:52.804
"I have always tried to live in an ivory tower,

00:05:52.804 --> 00:05:55.164
but a tide of shit is beating at its walls,

00:05:55.164 --> 00:05:57.110
threatening to undermine it."

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.255
I consider myself the tide of shit.

00:05:59.255 --> 00:06:04.899
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:06.589
You know, we have to go through that.

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:09.365
Even in the 1930s, my colleagues

00:06:09.365 --> 00:06:11.890
that were trying to put together an abstract art show

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.887
had all of these works stopped by the customs officers

00:06:14.887 --> 00:06:16.891
that decided they were not art.

00:06:16.891 --> 00:06:19.459
So it's happened before, and it will happen in the future,

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:23.739
but right now I can tell you that I am so, so proud

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:27.963
to be able to call Pac-Man part of the MoMA collection.

00:06:27.963 --> 00:06:33.356
And the same with, for instance, Tetris, original version, the Soviet one.

00:06:33.356 --> 00:06:35.882
And you know, the amount of work --

00:06:35.882 --> 00:06:39.471
yeah, Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government

00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:41.325
and that's how he developed Tetris,

00:06:41.325 --> 00:06:45.211
and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game

00:06:45.211 --> 00:06:48.949
and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.460
that makes it look slightly bombed.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.964
And it's fantastic.

00:06:53.964 --> 00:06:57.128
So behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work,

00:06:57.128 --> 00:06:58.531
because we're still the Museum of Modern Art,

00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:00.238
so even when we tackle popular culture,

00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:03.367
we tackle it as a form of interaction design

00:07:03.367 --> 00:07:05.517
and as something that has to go into the collection at MoMA,

00:07:05.517 --> 00:07:07.581
therefore, has to be researched.

00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:10.531
So to get to choosing Eric Chahi's

00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:13.179
wonderful Another World, amongst others,

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:14.859
we put together a panel of experts,

00:07:14.859 --> 00:07:16.369
and we worked on this acquisition,

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:19.876
and it's mostly myself and Kate Carmody and Paul Galloway.

00:07:19.876 --> 00:07:22.125
We worked on it for a year and a half.

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:25.098
So many people helped us — designers of games,

00:07:25.098 --> 00:07:27.268
you might know Jamin Warren

00:07:27.268 --> 00:07:29.756
and his collaborators at Kill Screen magazine,

00:07:29.756 --> 00:07:31.488
and you know, Kevin Slavin. You name it.

00:07:31.488 --> 00:07:34.752
We bugged everybody, because we knew that we were ignorant.

00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:36.898
We were not real gamers enough,

00:07:36.898 --> 00:07:38.954
so we had to really talk to them.

00:07:38.954 --> 00:07:42.515
And so we decided, of course, to have Sim City 2000,

00:07:42.515 --> 00:07:45.443
not the other Sim City, that one in particular,

00:07:45.443 --> 00:07:48.442
so the criteria that we developed along the way

00:07:48.442 --> 00:07:51.691
were really strong, and were not only criteria of selection.

00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:55.875
They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:59.178
That's what makes this acquisition more than a little game

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:03.069
or a little joke. It's truly a way to think of how to preserve

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:05.884
and show artifacts that will more and more

00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:07.847
become part of our lives in the future.

00:08:07.847 --> 00:08:10.899
We live today, as you know very well, not in the digital,

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:14.115
not in the physical, but in the kind of minestrone

00:08:14.115 --> 00:08:16.155
that our mind makes of the two.

00:08:16.155 --> 00:08:19.284
And that's really where interaction lies,

00:08:19.284 --> 00:08:21.539
and that's the importance of interaction.

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:24.683
And in order to explain interaction, we need to really

00:08:24.683 --> 00:08:27.324
bring people in and make them realize

00:08:27.324 --> 00:08:29.030
how interaction is part of their lives.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.859
So when I talk about it, I don't talk only about video games,

00:08:31.859 --> 00:08:34.372
which are in a way the purest form of interaction,

00:08:34.372 --> 00:08:37.844
unadulterated by any kind of function or finality.

00:08:37.844 --> 00:08:40.991
I also talk about the MetroCard vending machine,

00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:43.117
which I consider a masterpiece of interaction.

00:08:43.117 --> 00:08:45.428
I mean, that interface is beautiful.

00:08:45.428 --> 00:08:49.005
It looks like a burly MTA guy coming out of the tunnel.

00:08:49.005 --> 00:08:52.564
You know, with your mitt you can actually paw

00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:55.833
the MetroCard, and I talk about how bad

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:58.894
ATM machines usually are.

00:08:58.894 --> 00:09:01.723
So I let people understand that it's up to them

00:09:01.723 --> 00:09:03.965
to know how to judge interaction

00:09:03.965 --> 00:09:05.992
so as to know when it's good or when it's bad.

00:09:05.992 --> 00:09:07.645
So when I show The Sims,

00:09:07.645 --> 00:09:11.122
I try to make people really feel what it meant

00:09:11.122 --> 00:09:13.021
to have an interaction with The Sims,

00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:15.378
not only the fun but also the responsibility

00:09:15.378 --> 00:09:17.253
that came with the Tamagotchi.

00:09:17.253 --> 00:09:19.133
You know, video games can be truly deep

00:09:19.133 --> 00:09:20.877
even when they're completely mindless.

00:09:20.877 --> 00:09:23.405
I'm sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy.

00:09:23.405 --> 00:09:27.126
It's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can

00:09:27.126 --> 00:09:28.957
in a finite amount of time

00:09:28.957 --> 00:09:31.320
and hopefully you'll be able to make it into a planet.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.565
I've never made it into a planet, but that's it.

00:09:33.565 --> 00:09:36.733
Or, you know, Vib-Ribbon was not distributed here in the United States.

00:09:36.733 --> 00:09:38.925
It was a PlayStation game, but mostly for Japan.

00:09:38.925 --> 00:09:40.594
And it was one of the first video games

00:09:40.594 --> 00:09:42.295
in which you could choose your own music.

00:09:42.295 --> 00:09:44.617
So you would put into the PlayStation,

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:46.422
you would put your own CD,

00:09:46.422 --> 00:09:51.184
and then the game would change alongside your music. So really fantastic.

00:09:51.184 --> 00:09:52.595
Not to mention Eve Online.

00:09:52.595 --> 00:09:55.676
Eve Online is an artificial universe, if you wish,

00:09:55.676 --> 00:09:58.229
but one of the diplomats that was killed in Benghazi,

00:09:58.229 --> 00:10:00.837
not Ambassador Stevens, but one of his collaborators,

00:10:00.837 --> 00:10:02.705
was a really big shot in Eve Online,

00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:05.325
so here you have a diplomat in the real world

00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:07.813
that spends his time in Eve Online

00:10:07.813 --> 00:10:11.982
to kind of test, maybe, all of his ideas about diplomacy

00:10:11.982 --> 00:10:14.939
and about universe-building, and to the point that

00:10:14.939 --> 00:10:16.949
the first announcement of the bombing

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:19.365
was actually given on Eve Online,

00:10:19.365 --> 00:10:21.749
and after his death, several parts of the universe

00:10:21.749 --> 00:10:23.209
were named after him.

00:10:23.209 --> 00:10:27.043
And I was just recently at the Eve Online fan festival

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.181
in Reykjavík that was quite amazing.

00:10:29.181 --> 00:10:31.733
I mean, we're talking about an experience

00:10:31.733 --> 00:10:34.525
that of course can seem weird to many,

00:10:34.525 --> 00:10:36.423
but that is very educational.

00:10:36.423 --> 00:10:39.296
Of course, there are games that are even more educational.

00:10:39.296 --> 00:10:41.988
Dwarf Fortress is like the holy grail

00:10:41.988 --> 00:10:44.377
of this kind of massive multiplayer online game,

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:46.923
and in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjavík,

00:10:46.923 --> 00:10:49.557
and they were greeted

00:10:49.557 --> 00:10:52.765
by a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans.

00:10:52.765 --> 00:10:55.357
It was amazing to see. And it's a beautiful game.

00:10:55.357 --> 00:10:57.901
So you start seeing here that

00:10:57.901 --> 00:10:59.661
the aesthetics that are so important

00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:01.504
to a museum collection like MoMA's

00:11:01.504 --> 00:11:05.165
are kept alive also by the selection of these games.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.125
And you know, Valve -- you know, Portal --

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.248
is an example of a video game in which

00:11:09.248 --> 00:11:11.562
you have a certain type of violence

00:11:11.562 --> 00:11:13.661
which also leads me to talk about

00:11:13.661 --> 00:11:16.007
one of the biggest issues that we had to discuss

00:11:16.007 --> 00:11:18.267
when we acquired the video games, what to do with violence.

00:11:18.267 --> 00:11:20.671
Right? We had to make decisions.

00:11:20.671 --> 00:11:24.229
At MoMA, interestingly, there's a lot of violence

00:11:24.229 --> 00:11:27.133
depicted in the art part of the collection,

00:11:27.133 --> 00:11:30.349
but when I came to MoMA 19 years ago, and as an Italian,

00:11:30.349 --> 00:11:31.900
I said, "You know what, we need a Beretta."

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.013
And I was told, "No. No guns in the design collection."

00:11:35.013 --> 00:11:35.945
And I was like, "Why?"

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:39.461
Interestingly, I learned that it's considered

00:11:39.461 --> 00:11:41.211
that in design and in the design collection,

00:11:41.211 --> 00:11:42.448
what you see is what you get.

00:11:42.448 --> 00:11:46.338
So when you see a gun, it's an instrument for killing in the design collection.

00:11:46.338 --> 00:11:47.951
If it's in the art collection,

00:11:47.951 --> 00:11:51.695
it might be a critique of the killing instrument.

00:11:51.695 --> 00:11:53.401
So it's very interesting.

00:11:53.401 --> 00:11:56.040
But we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design,

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.531
so maybe one day we'll be able to acquire also the guns.

00:11:58.531 --> 00:12:01.795
But here, in this particular case, we decided,

00:12:01.795 --> 00:12:03.078
you know, with Kate and Paul,

00:12:03.078 --> 00:12:05.337
that we would have no gratuitous violence.

00:12:05.337 --> 00:12:08.089
So we have Portal because you shoot walls

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:09.409
in order to create new spaces.

00:12:09.409 --> 00:12:12.514
We have Street Fighter II, because martial arts are good.

00:12:12.514 --> 00:12:14.030
(Laughter)

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:18.132
But we don't have GTA because,

00:12:18.132 --> 00:12:19.739
maybe it's my own reflection,

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.122
I've never been able to do anything but crashing cars

00:12:22.122 --> 00:12:24.082
and shooting prostitutes and pimps.

00:12:24.082 --> 00:12:27.623
So it was not very constructive. (Laughter)

00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:31.869
So, I'm making fun of it, but we discussed this

00:12:31.869 --> 00:12:34.956
for so many days. You have no idea.

00:12:34.956 --> 00:12:37.283
And to this day, I am ambivalent,

00:12:37.283 --> 00:12:40.699
but when you have instead games like Flow, there's no doubt.

00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:43.899
It's like, it's about serenity and it's about sublime.

00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:48.185
It's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature.

00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:52.010
Then we have a few also side-scrollers -- classical ones.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.844
So it's quite a hefty collection.

00:12:53.844 --> 00:12:56.102
And right now, we started with the first 14,

00:12:56.102 --> 00:12:57.995
but we have several that are coming up,

00:12:57.995 --> 00:12:59.907
and the reason why we haven't acquired them yet

00:12:59.907 --> 00:13:02.335
is because you don't acquire just the game.

00:13:02.335 --> 00:13:04.409
You acquire the relationship with the company.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:07.507
What we want, what we aspire to, is the code.

00:13:07.507 --> 00:13:08.904
It's very hard to get, of course.

00:13:08.904 --> 00:13:10.777
But that's what would enable us to preserve

00:13:10.777 --> 00:13:12.766
the video games for a really long time,

00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:14.039
and that's what museums do.

00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:16.640
They also preserve artifacts for posterity.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.260
In absence of the code, because, you know,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.027
video game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases,

00:13:23.027 --> 00:13:26.523
in absence of that, we acquire the relationship with the company.

00:13:26.523 --> 00:13:27.803
We're going to stay with them forever.

00:13:27.803 --> 00:13:29.036
They're not going to get rid of us.

00:13:29.036 --> 00:13:32.507
And one day, we'll get that code. (Laughter)

00:13:32.507 --> 00:13:35.675
But I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose

00:13:35.675 --> 00:13:38.697
for interaction design. Aesthetics are really important.

00:13:38.697 --> 00:13:40.738
And I'm showing you Core War here,

00:13:40.738 --> 00:13:44.053
which is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically

00:13:44.053 --> 00:13:45.874
of the limitations of the processor.

00:13:45.874 --> 00:13:49.123
So the kind of interferences that you see here

00:13:49.123 --> 00:13:51.767
that look like beautiful barriers in the game

00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:56.114
are actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness,

00:13:56.114 --> 00:13:59.194
which is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important.

00:13:59.194 --> 00:14:03.198
And so is space, the spatial aspect of games.

00:14:03.198 --> 00:14:05.342
You know, I feel that the best video games

00:14:05.342 --> 00:14:08.878
are the ones that have really savvy architects

00:14:08.878 --> 00:14:11.501
that are behind them, and if they're not architects,

00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:14.139
bona fide trained in architecture, they have that feeling.

00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:18.227
But the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important.

00:14:18.227 --> 00:14:21.187
Time. The way we experience time in video games,

00:14:21.187 --> 00:14:23.969
as in other forms of interaction design,

00:14:23.969 --> 00:14:25.228
is really quite amazing.

00:14:25.228 --> 00:14:28.233
It can be real time or it can be the time within the game,

00:14:28.233 --> 00:14:30.449
as is in Animal Crossing, where seasons

00:14:30.449 --> 00:14:33.041
follow each other at their own pace.

00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:36.320
So time, space, aesthetics,

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.689
and then, most important, behavior.

00:14:38.689 --> 00:14:42.809
The real core issue of interaction design is behavior.

00:14:42.809 --> 00:14:46.286
Designers that deal with interaction design behaviors

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:48.601
that go to influence the rest of our lives.

00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:51.136
They're not just limited to our interaction with the screen.

00:14:51.136 --> 00:14:53.185
In this case, I'm showing you Marble Madness,

00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:54.386
which is a beautiful game

00:14:54.386 --> 00:14:57.657
in which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you,

00:14:57.657 --> 00:15:00.090
so you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape,

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.622
and the sphere, the controller itself, gives you a sense of the movement.

00:15:04.622 --> 00:15:06.977
In a way, you can see how video games

00:15:06.977 --> 00:15:09.689
are the purest aspect of interaction design

00:15:09.689 --> 00:15:14.308
and are very useful to explain what interaction is.

00:15:14.308 --> 00:15:16.393
We don't want to show the video games

00:15:16.393 --> 00:15:19.335
with the paraphernalia. No arcade nostalgia.

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:21.017
If anything, we want to show the code,

00:15:21.017 --> 00:15:24.031
and here you see Ben Fry's distellamap of Pac-Man,

00:15:24.031 --> 00:15:25.520
of the Pac-Man code.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.859
So the way we acquired the games is very interesting

00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:32.055
and very unorthodox. You see them here

00:15:32.055 --> 00:15:36.063
displayed alongside other examples of design,

00:15:36.063 --> 00:15:37.673
furniture and other parts,

00:15:37.673 --> 00:15:40.901
but there's no paraphernalia, no nostalagia,

00:15:40.901 --> 00:15:43.850
only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.994
The controllers are, of course, part of the experience,

00:15:45.994 --> 00:15:48.443
so you cannot do away with it.

00:15:48.443 --> 00:15:52.941
But interestingly, this choice was not condemned

00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:54.286
too vehemently by gamers.

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:55.593
I was afraid that they would kill us,

00:15:55.593 --> 00:15:57.659
and instead they understood, especially

00:15:57.659 --> 00:16:00.363
when I told them that I was trying to apply the same stratagem

00:16:00.363 --> 00:16:03.505
that Philip Johnson applied in 1934

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.547
when he wanted to make people understand

00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:07.859
the importance of design, and he took propeller blades

00:16:07.859 --> 00:16:10.139
and pieces of machinery and

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:13.266
in the MoMA galleries he put them on white pedestals

00:16:13.266 --> 00:16:16.483
against white walls, as if they were Brancusi sculptures.

00:16:16.483 --> 00:16:20.211
He created this strange distance, this shock,

00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:23.869
that made people realize how gorgeous formally,

00:16:23.869 --> 00:16:27.637
and also important functionally, design pieces were.

00:16:27.637 --> 00:16:29.891
I would like to do the same with video games.

00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:32.971
By getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts

00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:35.579
and everything else that we might remember from our childhood,

00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:40.150
I want people to understand

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.019
that those are important forms of design.

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:45.197
And in a way, the video games, the fonts and everything else

00:16:45.197 --> 00:16:47.881
lead us to make people understand

00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:50.223
a wider meaning for design.

00:16:50.223 --> 00:16:52.276
One of my dream acquisitions,

00:16:52.276 --> 00:16:54.191
which has been on hold for a few years

00:16:54.191 --> 00:16:57.193
but now will come back on the front burner,

00:16:57.193 --> 00:16:58.625
is a 747.

00:16:58.625 --> 00:17:01.563
I would like to acquire it, but without owning it.

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:04.874
I don't want it to be at MoMA and possessed by MoMA.

00:17:04.874 --> 00:17:06.258
I want it to keep flying.

00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:09.798
So it's an acquisition where MoMA makes an arrangement

00:17:09.798 --> 00:17:14.565
with an airline and keeps the Boeing 747 flying.

00:17:14.565 --> 00:17:17.683
And the same with the "@" sign that we acquired a few years ago.

00:17:17.683 --> 00:17:19.865
It was the first example of an acquisition of something

00:17:19.865 --> 00:17:21.270
that is in the public domain.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.030
And what I say to people, it's almost as if

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.004
a butterfly were flying by

00:17:25.004 --> 00:17:28.153
and we captured the shadow on the wall,

00:17:28.153 --> 00:17:29.610
and just we're showing the shadow.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.818
So in a way, we're showing a manifestation

00:17:31.818 --> 00:17:34.331
of something that is truly important

00:17:34.331 --> 00:17:37.962
and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have.

00:17:37.962 --> 00:17:39.898
And it's too long to explain the acquisition,

00:17:39.898 --> 00:17:42.404
but if you want to go on the MoMA blog,

00:17:42.404 --> 00:17:44.498
there's a long post where I explain why

00:17:44.498 --> 00:17:46.786
it's such a great example of design.

00:17:46.786 --> 00:17:50.147
Along the way, I've had to burn a few chairs. You know?

00:17:50.147 --> 00:17:54.466
I've had to do away with a few concepts of design past.

00:17:54.466 --> 00:17:57.282
But I see that people are coming along,

00:17:57.282 --> 00:17:59.032
that the audiences, paradoxically,

00:17:59.032 --> 00:18:01.858
are much more responsive and much more understanding

00:18:01.858 --> 00:18:05.916
of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are.

00:18:05.916 --> 00:18:07.443
Design is truly everywhere,

00:18:07.443 --> 00:18:10.411
and design is as important as anything,

00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:12.871
and I'm so glad that, because of its diversity

00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:15.186
and because of its centrality to our lives,

00:18:15.186 --> 00:18:16.899
many more people are coming to it

00:18:16.914 --> 00:18:19.003
as a profession, as a passion,

00:18:19.003 --> 00:18:21.977
and as, very simply, part of their own culture.

00:18:21.977 --> 00:18:23.120
Thank you very much.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.215
