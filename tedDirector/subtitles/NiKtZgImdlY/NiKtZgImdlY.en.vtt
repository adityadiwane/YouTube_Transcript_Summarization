00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.750
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.636
in a 1968 speech where he reflects
upon the Civil Rights Movement,

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:21.330
states, "In the end,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.413
we will remember not the words of our enemies

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:27.280
but the silence of our friends."

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.800
As a teacher, I've internalized this message.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.780
Every day, all around us,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.456
we see the consequences of silence

00:00:33.456 --> 00:00:35.893
manifest themselves in the form of discrimination,

00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:39.701
violence, genocide and war.

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:41.897
In the classroom, I challenge my students

00:00:41.897 --> 00:00:44.328
to explore the silences in their own lives

00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:46.178
through poetry.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.030
We work together to fill those spaces,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.308
to recognize them, to name them,

00:00:51.308 --> 00:00:54.740
to understand that they don't
have to be sources of shame.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.203
In an effort to create a culture within my classroom

00:00:57.203 --> 00:00:59.301
where students feel safe sharing the intimacies

00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:01.135
of their own silences,

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:03.216
I have four core principles posted on the board

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:05.309
that sits in the front of my class,

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.370
which every student signs
at the beginning of the year:

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.543
read critically, write consciously,

00:01:10.543 --> 00:01:14.408
speak clearly, tell your truth.

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:16.972
And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point,

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:18.871
tell your truth.

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:20.665
And I realized that

00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:22.876
if I was going to ask my students to speak up,

00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:25.014
I was going to have to tell my truth

00:01:25.014 --> 00:01:27.280
and be honest with them about the times

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.848
where I failed to do so.

00:01:28.848 --> 00:01:30.908
So I tell them that growing up,

00:01:30.908 --> 00:01:33.576
as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans,

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:36.438
during Lent I was always taught

00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:38.246
that the most meaningful thing one could do

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:39.788
was to give something up,

00:01:39.788 --> 00:01:42.080
sacrifice something you typically indulge in

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.479
to prove to God you understand his sanctity.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.281
I've given up soda, McDonald's, French fries,

00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:50.183
French kisses, and everything in between.

00:01:50.183 --> 00:01:54.071
But one year, I gave up speaking.

00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:56.674
I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice

00:01:56.674 --> 00:02:00.375
was my own voice, but it was like I hadn't realized

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:03.286
that I had given that up a long time ago.

00:02:03.286 --> 00:02:05.105
I spent so much of my life

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:07.282
telling people the things they wanted to hear

00:02:07.282 --> 00:02:08.758
instead of the things they needed to,

00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:11.174
told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience

00:02:11.174 --> 00:02:13.469
because I still had to figure out being my own,

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.701
so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything,

00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:19.150
appeasing ignorance with my silence,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.547
unaware that validation doesn't need words

00:02:21.547 --> 00:02:23.167
to endorse its existence.

00:02:23.167 --> 00:02:24.955
When Christian was beat up for being gay,

00:02:24.955 --> 00:02:26.223
I put my hands in my pocket

00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:29.000
and walked with my head
down as if I didn't even notice.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.535
I couldn't use my locker for weeks
because the bolt on the lock

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:33.796
reminded me of the one I had put on my lips

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:35.540
when the homeless man on the corner

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.320
looked at me with eyes up merely searching

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.502
for an affirmation that he was worth seeing.

00:02:39.502 --> 00:02:41.607
I was more concerned with
touching the screen on my Apple

00:02:41.607 --> 00:02:43.170
than actually feeding him one.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.857
When the woman at the fundraising gala

00:02:44.857 --> 00:02:46.049
said "I'm so proud of you.

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.120
It must be so hard teaching
those poor, unintelligent kids,"

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.719
I bit my lip, because apparently
we needed her money

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.699
more than my students needed their dignity.

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:55.640
We spend so much time

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.540
listening to the things people are saying

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.878
that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't.

00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:06.139
Silence is the residue of fear.

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.689
It is feeling your flaws

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.615
gut-wrench guillotine your tongue.

00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:11.437
It is the air retreating from your chest

00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:13.429
because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs.

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.553
Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina.

00:03:16.553 --> 00:03:19.661
It is what you hear when there
aren't enough body bags left.

00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.062
It is the sound after the noose is already tied.

00:03:22.062 --> 00:03:25.409
It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.164
There is no time to pick your battles

00:03:27.164 --> 00:03:28.897
when your battles have already picked you.

00:03:28.897 --> 00:03:31.960
I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.927
I will tell Christian that he is a lion,

00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:36.287
a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance.

00:03:36.287 --> 00:03:38.683
I will ask that homeless man what his name is

00:03:38.683 --> 00:03:40.393
and how his day was, because sometimes

00:03:40.393 --> 00:03:42.340
all people want to be is human.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.826
I will tell that woman that my students can talk about

00:03:44.826 --> 00:03:47.391
transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau,

00:03:47.391 --> 00:03:49.426
and just because you watched
one episode of "The Wire"

00:03:49.426 --> 00:03:51.665
doesn't mean you know anything about my kids.

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:53.338
So this year,

00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:55.485
instead of giving something up,

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.897
I will live every day as if there were a microphone

00:03:57.897 --> 00:03:59.820
tucked under my tongue,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.825
a stage on the underside of my inhibition.

00:04:03.825 --> 00:04:05.968
Because who has to have a soapbox

00:04:05.968 --> 00:04:10.207
when all you've ever needed is your voice?

00:04:10.207 --> 00:04:12.712
Thank you.

00:04:12.712 --> 00:04:16.712
(Applause)
