00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
We're here today to announce

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
the first synthetic cell,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
a cell made by

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
starting with the digital code in the computer,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
building the chromosome

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
from four bottles of chemicals,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
assembling that chromosome in yeast,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
transplanting it into

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
a recipient bacterial cell

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and transforming that cell

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
into a new bacterial species.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
So this is the first self-replicating species

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
that we've had on the planet

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
whose parent is a computer.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
It also is the first species

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
to have its own website

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
encoded in its genetic code.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
But we'll talk more about

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
the watermarks in a minute.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
This is a project that had its inception

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
15 years ago

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
when our team then --

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
we called the institute TIGR --

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
was involved in sequencing

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
the first two genomes in history.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
We did Haemophilus influenzae

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
that of Mycoplasma genitalium.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And as soon as

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
we had these two sequences

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
we thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
of a self-replicating species,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
could there be even a smaller genome?

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Could we understand the basis of cellular life

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
at the genetic level?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
It's been a 15-year quest

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
just to get to the starting point now

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
to be able to answer those questions,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
because it's very difficult to eliminate

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
multiple genes from a cell.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
You can only do them one at a time.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
We decided early on

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
that we had to take a synthetic route,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
even though nobody had been there before,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
to see if we could synthesize

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
a bacterial chromosome

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
so we could actually vary the gene content

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
to understand the essential genes for life.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
That started our 15-year quest

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
to get here.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
But before we did the first experiments,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
we actually asked

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
to undertake a review

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
of what the risks, the challenges,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
the ethics around creating new

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
species in the laboratory were

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
because it hadn't been done before.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
They spent about two years

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
reviewing that independently

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and published their results in Science in 1999.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Ham and I took two years off

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
as a side project to sequence the human genome,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
but as soon as that was done

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
we got back to the task at hand.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
In 2002, we started

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
a new institute,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
where we set out two goals:

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
One, to understand

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
the impact of our technology on the environment,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
and how to understand the environment better,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and two, to start down this process

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
of making synthetic life

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
to understand basic life.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
In 2003,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
we published our first success.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
developed some new methods

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
for making error-free DNA

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
at a small level.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Our first task was

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
a virus that attacks only E. coli.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
So that was

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
the phage phi X 174,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
which was chosen for historical reasons.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
It was the first DNA phage,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
DNA virus, DNA genome

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
that was actually sequenced.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
So once we realized

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
that we could make 5,000-base pair

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
viral-sized pieces,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
we thought, we at least have the means

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
then to try and make serially lots of these pieces

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
to be able to eventually assemble them together

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
to make this mega base chromosome.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
So, substantially larger than

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
we even thought we would go initially.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
There were several steps to this. There were two sides:

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
We had to solve the chemistry

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
for making large DNA molecules,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and we had to solve the biological side

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
of how, if we had this new chemical entity,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
how would we boot it up, activate it

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
in a recipient cell.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
We had two teams working in parallel:

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
one team on the chemistry,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
and the other on trying to

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
be able to transplant

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
entire chromosomes

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
to get new cells.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
When we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
which is why we chose the smallest genome.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
to a much larger one.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
And we can walk through the reasons for that,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
but basically the small cell

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
took on the order of

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
one to two months to get results from,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
whereas the larger, faster-growing cell

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
takes only two days.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
So there's only so many cycles we could go through

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
in a year at six weeks per cycle.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
And you should know that basically

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
99, probably 99 percent plus

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
of our experiments failed.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
So this was a debugging,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
problem-solving scenario from the beginning

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
because there was no recipe

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
of how to get there.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
So, one of the most important publications we had

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
was in 2007.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Carole Lartigue led the effort

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
from one bacteria to another.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
I think philosophically, that was one of the most important papers

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
that we've ever done

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
because it showed how dynamic life was.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And we knew, once that worked,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
that we actually had a chance

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
if we could make the synthetic chromosomes

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
to do the same with those.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
We didn't know that it was going to take us

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
several years more to get there.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
In 2008,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
we reported the complete synthesis

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
We think in part, because of its slow growth

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
and, in part,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
to keep these events from happening.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
had a nuclease, an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and was happy to eat

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
the synthetic DNA that we gave it

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and never got transplantations.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
But at the time, that was the largest

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
molecule of a defined structure

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
that had been made.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And so both sides were progressing,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
but part of the synthesis

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
using yeast, putting the fragments in yeast

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and yeast would assemble these for us.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
It's an amazing step forward,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
but we had a problem because now we had

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
So in addition to doing the transplant,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
out of the eukaryotic yeast

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
into a form where we could transplant it

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
into a recipient cell.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
So our team developed new techniques

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
for actually growing, cloning

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
So we took the same mycoides genome

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
that Carole had initially transplanted,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
and we grew that in yeast

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
as an artificial chromosome.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And we thought this would be a great test bed

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and transplant them.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
When we did these experiments, though,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
we could get the chromosome out of yeast

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
That little issue took the team two years to solve.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
It turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cell

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
was actually methylated,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
from digesting the DNA.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
So what we found is if we took the chromosome

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
out of yeast and methylated it,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
we could then transplant it.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
Further advances came

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
from the recipient capricolum cell.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
And once we had done that, now we can take

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
So last fall

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
when we published the results of that work in Science,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
we all became overconfident

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
and were sure we were only

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
a few weeks away

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
from being able to now boot up

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
a chromosome out of yeast.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
Because of the problems with

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
about a year and a half ago,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
we decided to synthesize

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
the much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
knowing that we had the biology worked out on that

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
for transplantation.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
And Dan led the team for the synthesis

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
of this over one-million-base pair chromosome.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
and it set us back three months

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
because we had one error

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
out of over a million base pairs in that sequence.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
So the team developed new debugging software,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
where we could test each synthetic fragment

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
to see if it would grow in a background

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
of wild type DNA.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
And we found that 10 out of the 11

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
were completely accurate

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
and compatible with

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
a life-forming sequence.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
We narrowed it down to one fragment;

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
we sequenced it

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
and found just one base pair had been deleted

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
in an essential gene.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
So accuracy is essential.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
There's parts of the genome

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
where it cannot tolerate even a single error,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
and then there's parts of the genome

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
where we can put in large blocks of DNA,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
as we did with the watermarks,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
So it took about three months to find that error

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
and repair it.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
And then early one morning, at 6 a.m.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
we got a text from Dan

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
saying that, now, the first blue colonies existed.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
So, it's been a long route to get here:

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
15 years from the beginning.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
We felt

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
one of the tenets of this field

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
was to make absolutely certain

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
we could distinguish synthetic DNA

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
from natural DNA.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
Early on, when you're working in a new area of science,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
you have to think about all the pitfalls

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
and things that could lead you

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
to believe that you had done something when you hadn't,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
and, even worse, leading others to believe it.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
So, we thought the worst problem would be

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
a single molecule contamination

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
of the native chromosome,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
leading us to believe that we actually had

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
created a synthetic cell,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
when it would have been just a contaminant.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
So early on, we developed the notion

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
of putting in watermarks in the DNA

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
to absolutely make clear

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
that the DNA was synthetic.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
And the first chromosome we built

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
in 2008 --

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
the 500,000-base pair one --

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
we simply assigned

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
the names of the authors of the chromosome

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
into the genetic code,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
but it was using just amino acid

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
single letter translations,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
So the team actually developed a new code

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
within the code within the code.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
So it's a new code

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
for interpreting and writing messages in DNA.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
Now, mathematicians have been hiding and writing

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
messages in the genetic code for a long time,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
because, if you write long messages

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
with the code that the mathematicians developed,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
it would more than likely lead to

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
new proteins being synthesized

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
with unknown functions.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
actually puts frequent stop codons,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
so it's a different alphabet

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
but allows us to use

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
the entire English alphabet

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
with punctuation and numbers.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
So, there are four major watermarks

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
The first one actually contains within it

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
this code for interpreting

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
the rest of the genetic code.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
So in the remaining information,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
in the watermarks,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
contain the names of, I think it's

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
46 different authors

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
and key contributors

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
to getting the project to this stage.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
And we also built in

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
a website address

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
so that if somebody decodes the code

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
within the code within the code,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
they can send an email to that address.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
So it's clearly distinguishable

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
from any other species,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
having 46 names in it,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
its own web address.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
And we added three quotations,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
because with the first genome

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
than just signing the work.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
So we won't give the rest of the code,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
but we will give the three quotations.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
The first is,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
"To live, to err,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
to fall, to triumph

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
and to recreate life out of life."

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
It's a James Joyce quote.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
The second quotation is, "See things not as they are,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
but as they might be."

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
It's a quote from the "American Prometheus"

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
book on Robert Oppenheimer.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote:

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
"What I cannot build,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
I cannot understand."

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
So, because this is as much a philosophical advance

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
as a technical advance in science,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
we tried to deal with both the philosophical

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
and the technical side.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
is that the extensive work

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
that we've done --

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
asking for ethical review,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
pushing the envelope

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
on that side as well as the technical side --

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
in the policy community

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and at the highest levels of the federal government.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Even with this announcement,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
as we did in 2003 --

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
that work was funded by the Department of Energy,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
so the work was reviewed

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
at the level of the White House,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
And they came down on the side of open publication,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
which is the right approach --

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
we've briefed the White House,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
we've briefed members of Congress,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
we've tried to take and push

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
the policy issues

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
in parallel with the scientific advances.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
So with that, I would like

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
to open it first to the floor for questions.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
Yes, in the back.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
Reporter: Could you explain, in layman's terms,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
how significant a breakthrough this is please?

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
Craig Venter: Can we explain how significant this is?

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
It's significant to us.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
in how we view life.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
We actually view it as a baby step in terms of,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
it's taken us 15 years to be able

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
to do the experiment

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
we wanted to do 15 years ago

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
on understanding life at its basic level.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
But we actually believe

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
this is going to be a very powerful set of tools

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
and we're already starting

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
in numerous avenues

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
to use this tool.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
We have, at the Institute,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
ongoing funding now from NIH

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
in a program with Novartis

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
to try and use these new

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
synthetic DNA tools

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
to perhaps make the flu vaccine

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
that you might get next year.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
Dan's team can now make these

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
in less than 24 hours.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
we think we can shorten that process

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
quite substantially.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
In the vaccine area,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
Synthetic Genomics and the Institute

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
are forming a new vaccine company

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
because we think these tools can affect vaccines

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
to diseases that haven't been possible to date,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
things where the viruses rapidly evolve,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
such with rhinovirus.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds?

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
Or, more importantly, HIV,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
where the virus evolves so quickly

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
the vaccines that are made today

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
can't keep up

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
with those evolutionary changes.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
Also, at Synthetic Genomics,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
we've been working

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
on major environmental issues.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
is a reminder.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
We can't see CO2 --

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
we depend on scientific measurements for it

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
and we see the beginning results

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
of having too much of it --

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
but we can see pre-CO2 now

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
floating on the waters

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.260
We need some alternatives

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
for oil.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
We have a program with Exxon Mobile

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
to try and develop new strains of algae

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.260
from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.260
make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
to make normal gasoline

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
and diesel fuel out of CO2.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
Those are just a couple of the approaches

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
and directions that we're taking.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.260
