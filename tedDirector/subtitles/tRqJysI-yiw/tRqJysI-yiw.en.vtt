00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:15.568
By raising your hand,

00:00:15.592 --> 00:00:19.207
how many of you know
at least one person on the screen?

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:22.234
Wow, it's almost a full house.

00:00:22.258 --> 00:00:24.815
It's true, they are very famous
in their fields.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.834
And do you know what
all of them have in common?

00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:30.778
They all died of pancreatic cancer.

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:33.310
However, although it's very,
very sad this news,

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:36.098
it's also thanks to their personal stories

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:40.243
that we have raised awareness
of how lethal this disease can be.

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:43.643
It's become the third cause
of cancer deaths,

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:49.193
and only eight percent of the patients
will survive beyond five years.

00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:51.136
That's a very tiny number,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.916
especially if you compare it
with breast cancer,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.380
where the survival rate
is almost 90 percent.

00:00:57.946 --> 00:01:00.313
So it doesn't really come as a surprise

00:01:00.337 --> 00:01:02.802
that being diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer

00:01:02.826 --> 00:01:06.077
means facing an almost
certain death sentence.

00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:09.747
What's shocking, though,
is that in the last 40 years,

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.149
this number hasn't changed a bit,

00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:14.277
while much more progress has been made

00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:15.988
with other types of tumors.

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:20.212
So how can we make pancreatic cancer
treatment more effective?

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.565
As a biomedical entrepreneur,

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:25.608
I like to work on problems
that seem impossible,

00:01:25.632 --> 00:01:27.693
understanding their limitations

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:30.789
and trying to find new,
innovative solutions

00:01:30.813 --> 00:01:32.644
that can change their outcome.

00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:35.612
The first piece of bad news
with pancreatic cancer

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:39.107
is that your pancreas is in the middle
of your belly, literally.

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.966
It's depicted in orange on the screen.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.637
But you can barely see it

00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:46.621
until I remove all the other
organs in front.

00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:50.089
It's also surrounded
by many other vital organs,

00:01:50.113 --> 00:01:53.225
like the liver, the stomach,
the bile duct.

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:56.662
And the ability of the tumor
to grow into those organs

00:01:56.686 --> 00:01:58.708
is the reason why pancreatic cancer

00:01:58.732 --> 00:02:01.664
is one of the most painful tumor types.

00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:05.457
The hard-to-reach location
also prevents the doctor

00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:07.200
from surgically removing it,

00:02:07.224 --> 00:02:10.259
as is routinely done
for breast cancer, for example.

00:02:10.716 --> 00:02:14.100
So all of these reasons leave
chemotherapy as the only option

00:02:14.124 --> 00:02:16.267
for the pancreatic cancer patient.

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:19.198
This brings us to the second
piece of bad news.

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.187
Pancreatic cancer tumors have
very few blood vessels.

00:02:23.624 --> 00:02:27.410
Why should we care
about the blood vessel of a tumor?

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:30.900
Let's think for a second
how chemotherapy works.

00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:32.813
The drug is injected in the vein

00:02:32.837 --> 00:02:37.481
and it navigates throughout the body
until it reaches the tumor site.

00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:41.680
It's like driving on a highway,
trying to reach a destination.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.965
But what if your destination
doesn't have an exit on the highway?

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.618
You will never get there.

00:02:47.642 --> 00:02:49.764
And that's exactly the same problem

00:02:49.788 --> 00:02:52.481
for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:55.964
The drugs navigate
throughout all of your body.

00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:58.401
They will reach healthy organs,

00:02:58.425 --> 00:03:02.232
resulting in high toxic effect
for the patients overall,

00:03:02.256 --> 00:03:04.771
but very little will go to the tumor.

00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:07.223
Therefore, the efficacy is very limited.

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.333
To me, it seems very counterintuitive
to have a whole-body treatment

00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:15.621
to target a specific organ.

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:18.097
However, in the last 40 years,

00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:22.445
a lot of money, research
and effort have gone towards

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.552
finding new, powerful drugs
to treat pancreatic cancer,

00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:28.987
but nothing has been done
in changing the way

00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:31.074
we deliver them to the patient.

00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:34.023
So after two pieces of bad news,

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:37.076
I'm going to give you
good news, hopefully.

00:03:37.806 --> 00:03:39.276
With a collaborator at MIT

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.196
and the Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.133
we have revolutionized
the way we treat cancer

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:48.500
by making localized
drug delivery a reality.

00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:52.960
We are basically parachuting you
on top of your destination,

00:03:52.984 --> 00:03:55.886
avoiding your having to drive
all around the highway.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.200
We have embedded the drug
into devices that look like this one.

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:06.413
They are flexible enough
that they can be folded

00:04:06.437 --> 00:04:08.359
to fit into the catheter,

00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:12.179
so the doctor can implant it
directly on top of the tumor

00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:14.268
with minimally invasive surgery.

00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:18.373
But they are solid enough
that once they are positioned

00:04:18.397 --> 00:04:20.088
on top of the tumor,

00:04:20.112 --> 00:04:21.881
they will act as a cage.

00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:25.056
They will actually
physically prevent the tumor

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.755
from entering other organs,

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:29.214
controlling the metastasis.

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:32.743
The devices are also biodegradable.

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:34.517
That means that once in the body,

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:36.426
they start dissolving,

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.813
delivering the drug only locally,
slowly and more effectively

00:04:41.837 --> 00:04:45.320
than what is done with the current
whole-body treatment.

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:48.149
In pre-clinical study,
we have demonstrated

00:04:48.173 --> 00:04:50.172
that this localized approach

00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:54.415
is able to improve by 12 times
the response to treatment.

00:04:54.758 --> 00:04:57.535
So we took a drug that is already known

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:01.390
and by just delivering it locally
where it's needed the most,

00:05:01.414 --> 00:05:05.063
we allow a response
that is 12 times more powerful,

00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:07.848
reducing the systemic toxic effect.

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.233
We are working relentlessly to bring
this technology to the next level.

00:05:13.257 --> 00:05:16.104
We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing

00:05:16.128 --> 00:05:20.207
and the animal model required
prior to asking the FDA for approval

00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:21.838
for clinical trials.

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:28.100
Currently, the majority of patients
will die from pancreatic cancer.

00:05:28.124 --> 00:05:29.959
We are hoping that one day,

00:05:29.983 --> 00:05:33.254
we can reduce their pain,
extend their life

00:05:33.278 --> 00:05:36.311
and potentially make pancreatic cancer

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:37.873
a curable disease.

00:05:38.257 --> 00:05:40.977
By rethinking the way we deliver the drug,

00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:44.758
we don't only make it
more powerful and less toxic,

00:05:44.782 --> 00:05:49.567
we are also opening the door
to finding new innovative solutions

00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:52.306
for almost all other impossible problems

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.604
in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.

00:05:55.628 --> 00:05:56.789
Thank you very much.

00:05:56.813 --> 00:06:02.250
(Applause)
