00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:17.272
There is something about physics

00:00:17.296 --> 00:00:21.296
that has been really bothering me
since I was a little kid.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.819
And it's related to a question

00:00:24.843 --> 00:00:28.087
that scientists have been asking
for almost 100 years,

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.280
with no answer.

00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:34.118
How do the smallest things in nature,

00:00:34.142 --> 00:00:36.295
the particles of the quantum world,

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:39.350
match up with the largest
things in nature --

00:00:39.374 --> 00:00:42.621
planets and stars and galaxies
held together by gravity?

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.023
As a kid, I would puzzle
over questions just like this.

00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:48.939
I would fiddle around
with microscopes and electromagnets,

00:00:48.963 --> 00:00:51.158
and I would read
about the forces of the small

00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:52.516
and about quantum mechanics

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.104
and I would marvel at how well
that description matched up

00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:57.298
to our observation.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.803
Then I would look at the stars,

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:02.351
and I would read about how well
we understand gravity,

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.725
and I would think surely,
there must be some elegant way

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:08.394
that these two systems match up.

00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:10.422
But there's not.

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:12.833
And the books would say,

00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:16.040
yeah, we understand a lot
about these two realms separately,

00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:18.674
but when we try to link
them mathematically,

00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:20.028
everything breaks.

00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:21.984
And for 100 years,

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:27.036
none of our ideas as to how to solve
this basically physics disaster,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.874
has ever been supported by evidence.

00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:31.925
And to little old me --

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:33.759
little, curious, skeptical James --

00:01:33.783 --> 00:01:36.651
this was a supremely unsatisfying answer.

00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:40.244
So, I'm still a skeptical little kid.

00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:44.078
Flash-forward now
to December of 2015,

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:47.503
when I found myself smack in the middle

00:01:47.527 --> 00:01:50.467
of the physics world
being flipped on its head.

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.319
It all started when we at CERN
saw something intriguing in our data:

00:01:55.343 --> 00:01:57.617
a hint of a new particle,

00:01:57.641 --> 00:02:01.857
an inkling of a possibly extraordinary
answer to this question.

00:02:03.777 --> 00:02:05.904
So I'm still a skeptical
little kid, I think,

00:02:05.928 --> 00:02:08.061
but I'm also now a particle hunter.

00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:11.548
I am a physicist at CERN's
Large Hadron Collider,

00:02:11.572 --> 00:02:15.043
the largest science
experiment ever mounted.

00:02:15.877 --> 00:02:19.412
It's a 27-kilometer tunnel
on the border of France and Switzerland

00:02:19.436 --> 00:02:21.286
buried 100 meters underground.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.464
And in this tunnel,

00:02:22.488 --> 00:02:26.441
we use superconducting magnets
colder than outer space

00:02:26.465 --> 00:02:29.526
to accelerate protons
to almost the speed of light

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.427
and slam them into each other
millions of times per second,

00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.277
collecting the debris of these collisions

00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:40.272
to search for new, undiscovered
fundamental particles.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:43.191
Its design and construction
took decades of work

00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:46.247
by thousands of physicists
from around the globe,

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:48.812
and in the summer of 2015,

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:52.260
we had been working tirelessly
to switch on the LHC

00:02:52.284 --> 00:02:56.751
at the highest energy that humans
have ever used in a collider experiment.

00:02:57.735 --> 00:03:00.258
Now, higher energy is important

00:03:00.282 --> 00:03:02.469
because for particles,
there is an equivalence

00:03:02.493 --> 00:03:04.694
between energy and particle mass,

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:07.179
and mass is just a number
put there by nature.

00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:09.386
To discover new particles,

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.532
we need to reach these bigger numbers.

00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:14.810
And to do that, we have to build
a bigger, higher energy collider,

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:17.399
and the biggest, highest
energy collider in the world

00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:18.889
is the Large Hadron Collider.

00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:25.170
And then, we collide protons
quadrillions of times,

00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:29.478
and we collect this data very slowly,
over months and months.

00:03:30.813 --> 00:03:35.148
And then new particles might show up
in our data as bumps --

00:03:35.172 --> 00:03:37.617
slight deviations from what you expect,

00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:41.608
little clusters of data points
that make a smooth line not so smooth.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.100
For example, this bump,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.543
after months of data-taking in 2012,

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:49.696
led to the discovery
of the Higgs particle --

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.925
the Higgs boson --

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.314
and to a Nobel Prize
for the confirmation of its existence.

00:03:55.972 --> 00:03:59.530
This jump up in energy in 2015

00:04:00.628 --> 00:04:03.920
represented the best chance
that we as a species had ever had

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:05.421
of discovering new particles --

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.557
new answers to these
long-standing questions,

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:10.678
because it was almost
twice as much energy as we used

00:04:10.702 --> 00:04:12.624
when we discovered the Higgs boson.

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:16.389
Many of my colleagues had been working
their entire careers for this moment,

00:04:16.413 --> 00:04:18.489
and frankly, to little curious me,

00:04:18.513 --> 00:04:21.423
this was the moment
I'd been waiting for my entire life.

00:04:21.447 --> 00:04:23.178
So 2015 was go time.

00:04:24.654 --> 00:04:26.864
So June 2015,

00:04:27.722 --> 00:04:30.381
the LHC is switched back on.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.917
My colleagues and I held our breath
and bit our fingernails,

00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:36.452
and then finally we saw
the first proton collisions

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:38.432
at this highest energy ever.

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:40.532
Applause, champagne, celebration.

00:04:40.556 --> 00:04:44.152
This was a milestone for science,

00:04:44.176 --> 00:04:48.798
and we had no idea what we would find
in this brand-new data.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.168
And then a few weeks later,
we found a bump.

00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:57.868
It wasn't a very big bump,

00:04:58.952 --> 00:05:01.464
but it was big enough to make
you raise your eyebrow.

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:03.739
But on a scale of one to 10
for eyebrow raises,

00:05:03.763 --> 00:05:06.373
if 10 indicates that you've
discovered a new particle,

00:05:06.397 --> 00:05:08.124
this eyebrow raise is about a four.

00:05:08.148 --> 00:05:09.298
(Laughter)

00:05:10.432 --> 00:05:15.643
I spent hours, days, weeks
in secret meetings,

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:18.027
arguing with my colleagues
over this little bump,

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:21.287
poking and prodding it with our most
ruthless experimental sticks

00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:23.288
to see if it would withstand scrutiny.

00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:27.449
But even after months
of working feverishly --

00:05:27.473 --> 00:05:29.905
sleeping in our offices
and not going home,

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.006
candy bars for dinner,

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.600
coffee by the bucketful --

00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:37.867
physicists are machines
for turning coffee into diagrams --

00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:39.290
(Laughter)

00:05:39.314 --> 00:05:41.850
This little bump would not go away.

00:05:42.704 --> 00:05:44.842
So after a few months,

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:48.576
we presented our little bump to the world
with a very clear message:

00:05:49.457 --> 00:05:52.168
this little bump is interesting
but it's not definitive,

00:05:52.192 --> 00:05:55.521
so let's keep an eye on it
as we take more data.

00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:58.163
So we were trying to be
extremely cool about it.

00:05:59.463 --> 00:06:01.651
And the world ran with it anyway.

00:06:02.383 --> 00:06:04.015
The news loved it.

00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:07.290
People said it reminded
them of the little bump

00:06:07.314 --> 00:06:10.737
that was shown on the way
toward the Higgs boson discovery.

00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:13.889
Better than that,
my theorist colleagues --

00:06:14.548 --> 00:06:16.865
I love my theorist colleagues --

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.501
my theorist colleagues wrote
500 papers about this little bump.

00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:21.980
(Laughter)

00:06:22.574 --> 00:06:26.540
The world of particle physics
had been flipped on its head.

00:06:27.745 --> 00:06:31.987
But what was it about this particular bump

00:06:32.011 --> 00:06:36.101
that caused thousands of physicists
to collectively lose their cool?

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:39.032
This little bump was unique.

00:06:40.198 --> 00:06:41.567
This little bump indicated

00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:44.613
that we were seeing an unexpectedly
large number of collisions

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:47.968
whose debris consisted
of only two photons,

00:06:47.992 --> 00:06:49.236
two particles of light.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.497
And that's rare.

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:53.689
Particle collisions are not
like automobile collisions.

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:55.232
They have different rules.

00:06:55.256 --> 00:06:57.906
When two particles collide
at almost the speed of light,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.351
the quantum world takes over.

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:00.635
And in the quantum world,

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:03.852
these two particles
can briefly create a new particle

00:07:03.876 --> 00:07:06.656
that lives for a tiny fraction of a second

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.561
before splitting into other particles
that hit our detector.

00:07:09.585 --> 00:07:12.990
Imagine a car collision
where the two cars vanish upon impact,

00:07:13.014 --> 00:07:15.283
a bicycle appears in their place --

00:07:15.307 --> 00:07:16.378
(Laughter)

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:18.863
And then that bicycle explodes
into two skateboards,

00:07:18.887 --> 00:07:20.068
which hit our detector.

00:07:20.092 --> 00:07:21.471
(Laughter)

00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:23.448
Hopefully, not literally.

00:07:23.472 --> 00:07:24.814
They're very expensive.

00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:29.939
Events where only two photons
hit out detector are very rare.

00:07:29.963 --> 00:07:33.685
And because of the special
quantum properties of photons,

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:37.497
there's a very small number
of possible new particles --

00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:39.018
these mythical bicycles --

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.285
that can give birth to only two photons.

00:07:41.812 --> 00:07:44.648
But one of these options is huge,

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:47.508
and it has to do with
that long-standing question

00:07:47.532 --> 00:07:50.054
that bothered me as a tiny little kid,

00:07:50.078 --> 00:07:51.438
about gravity.

00:07:53.946 --> 00:07:56.618
Gravity may seem super strong to you,

00:07:56.642 --> 00:08:00.742
but it's actually crazily weak
compared to the other forces of nature.

00:08:00.766 --> 00:08:03.397
I can briefly beat gravity when I jump,

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.233
but I can't pick a proton out of my hand.

00:08:08.463 --> 00:08:11.679
The strength of gravity compared
to the other forces of nature?

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.670
It's 10 to the minus 39.

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:17.231
That's a decimal with 39 zeros after it.

00:08:17.255 --> 00:08:18.412
Worse than that,

00:08:18.436 --> 00:08:21.463
all of the other known forces of nature
are perfectly described

00:08:21.487 --> 00:08:23.524
by this thing we call the Standard Model,

00:08:23.548 --> 00:08:26.983
which is our current best description
of nature at its smallest scales,

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.163
and quite frankly,

00:08:28.187 --> 00:08:32.364
one of the most successful
achievements of humankind --

00:08:32.388 --> 00:08:36.400
except for gravity, which is absent
from the Standard Model.

00:08:36.424 --> 00:08:37.574
It's crazy.

00:08:38.046 --> 00:08:41.146
It's almost as though most
of gravity has gone missing.

00:08:42.394 --> 00:08:44.061
We feel a little bit of it,

00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:45.761
but where's the rest of it?

00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:47.067
No one knows.

00:08:48.003 --> 00:08:52.406
But one theoretical explanation
proposes a wild solution.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.459
You and I --

00:08:55.483 --> 00:08:57.061
even you in the back --

00:08:57.085 --> 00:08:59.230
we live in three dimensions of space.

00:08:59.254 --> 00:09:01.811
I hope that's a
non-controversial statement.

00:09:01.835 --> 00:09:03.664
(Laughter)

00:09:03.688 --> 00:09:07.126
All of the known particles also live
in three dimensions of space.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.340
In fact, a particle is just another name

00:09:09.364 --> 00:09:12.373
for an excitation
in a three-dimensional field;

00:09:12.397 --> 00:09:14.317
a localized wobbling in space.

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:18.817
More importantly, all the math
that we use to describe all this stuff

00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:21.914
assumes that there are only
three dimensions of space.

00:09:21.938 --> 00:09:25.319
But math is math, and we can play
around with our math however we want.

00:09:25.343 --> 00:09:28.509
And people have been playing around
with extra dimensions of space

00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:29.688
for a very long time,

00:09:29.712 --> 00:09:32.297
but it's always been an abstract
mathematical concept.

00:09:32.321 --> 00:09:35.493
I mean, just look around you --
you at the back, look around --

00:09:35.517 --> 00:09:37.798
there's clearly only
three dimensions of space.

00:09:38.954 --> 00:09:40.513
But what if that's not true?

00:09:42.109 --> 00:09:48.364
What if the missing gravity is leaking
into an extra-spatial dimension

00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:50.344
that's invisible to you and I?

00:09:51.355 --> 00:09:54.449
What if gravity is just as strong
as the other forces

00:09:54.473 --> 00:09:57.614
if you were to view it in this
extra-spatial dimension,

00:09:57.638 --> 00:10:00.538
and what you and I experience
is a tiny slice of gravity

00:10:00.562 --> 00:10:02.459
make it seem very weak?

00:10:04.158 --> 00:10:05.333
If this were true,

00:10:05.357 --> 00:10:08.105
we would have to expand
our Standard Model of particles

00:10:08.129 --> 00:10:12.215
to include an extra particle,
a hyperdimensional particle of gravity,

00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:15.234
a special graviton that lives
in extra-spatial dimensions.

00:10:15.258 --> 00:10:16.723
I see the looks on your faces.

00:10:16.747 --> 00:10:18.566
You should be asking me the question,

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.234
"How in the world are we going to test
this crazy, science fiction idea,

00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:24.749
stuck as we are in three dimensions?"

00:10:24.773 --> 00:10:26.055
The way we always do,

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:28.218
by slamming together two protons --

00:10:28.242 --> 00:10:29.394
(Laughter)

00:10:29.418 --> 00:10:31.982
Hard enough that
the collision reverberates

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:34.697
into any extra-spatial dimensions
that might be there,

00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:37.320
momentarily creating
this hyperdimensional graviton

00:10:37.344 --> 00:10:41.724
that then snaps back
into the three dimensions of the LHC

00:10:41.748 --> 00:10:43.570
and spits off two photons,

00:10:44.278 --> 00:10:45.616
two particles of light.

00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:50.327
And this hypothetical,
extra-dimensional graviton

00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:54.058
is one of the only possible,
hypothetical new particles

00:10:54.082 --> 00:10:56.217
that has the special quantum properties

00:10:56.241 --> 00:11:00.477
that could give birth to our little,
two-photon bump.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.820
So, the possibility of explaining
the mysteries of gravity

00:11:07.844 --> 00:11:11.342
and of discovering extra
dimensions of space --

00:11:11.366 --> 00:11:12.958
perhaps now you get a sense

00:11:12.982 --> 00:11:17.106
as to why thousands of physics geeks
collectively lost their cool

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.012
over our little, two-photon bump.

00:11:19.036 --> 00:11:21.936
A discovery of this type
would rewrite the textbooks.

00:11:22.739 --> 00:11:23.891
But remember,

00:11:23.915 --> 00:11:25.639
the message from us experimentalists

00:11:25.663 --> 00:11:27.902
that actually were doing
this work at the time,

00:11:27.926 --> 00:11:29.080
was very clear:

00:11:29.104 --> 00:11:30.278
we need more data.

00:11:30.302 --> 00:11:31.821
With more data,

00:11:31.845 --> 00:11:35.869
the little bump will either turn into
a nice, crisp Nobel Prize --

00:11:35.893 --> 00:11:37.653
(Laughter)

00:11:37.677 --> 00:11:40.641
Or the extra data will fill in
the space around the bump

00:11:40.665 --> 00:11:42.531
and turn it into a nice, smooth line.

00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:44.733
So we took more data,

00:11:44.757 --> 00:11:47.334
and with five times the data,
several months later,

00:11:47.358 --> 00:11:49.048
our little bump

00:11:49.072 --> 00:11:51.420
turned into a smooth line.

00:11:55.217 --> 00:11:58.701
The news reported on a "huge
disappointment," on "faded hopes,"

00:11:58.725 --> 00:12:01.235
and on particle physicists "being sad."

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:03.070
Given the tone of the coverage,

00:12:03.094 --> 00:12:06.582
you'd think that we had decided
to shut down the LHC and go home.

00:12:06.606 --> 00:12:07.756
(Laughter)

00:12:08.628 --> 00:12:10.231
But that's not what we did.

00:12:13.057 --> 00:12:15.071
But why not?

00:12:16.475 --> 00:12:19.320
I mean, if I didn't discover
a particle -- and I didn't --

00:12:20.209 --> 00:12:23.238
if I didn't discover a particle,
why am I here talking to you?

00:12:23.262 --> 00:12:25.699
Why didn't I just hang my head in shame

00:12:25.723 --> 00:12:26.947
and go home?

00:12:31.169 --> 00:12:34.520
Particle physicists are explorers.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:38.373
And very much of what we do
is cartography.

00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:42.320
Let me put it this way: forget
about the LHC for a second.

00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:45.726
Imagine you are a space explorer
arriving at a distant planet,

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.075
searching for aliens.

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:48.621
What is your first task?

00:12:49.931 --> 00:12:53.007
To immediately orbit the planet,
land, take a quick look around

00:12:53.031 --> 00:12:54.917
for any big, obvious signs of life,

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.760
and report back to home base.

00:12:56.784 --> 00:12:58.408
That's the stage we're at now.

00:12:59.269 --> 00:13:00.756
We took a first look at the LHC

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.064
for any new, big,
obvious-to-spot particles,

00:13:03.088 --> 00:13:05.038
and we can report that there are none.

00:13:05.631 --> 00:13:08.304
We saw a weird-looking alien bump
on a distant mountain,

00:13:08.328 --> 00:13:10.498
but once we got closer,
we saw it was a rock.

00:13:10.816 --> 00:13:13.456
But then what do we do?
Do we just give up and fly away?

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.767
Absolutely not;

00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:17.096
we would be terrible scientists if we did.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.733
No, we spend the next couple
of decades exploring,

00:13:20.757 --> 00:13:22.237
mapping out the territory,

00:13:22.261 --> 00:13:24.626
sifting through the sand
with a fine instrument,

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.108
peeking under every stone,

00:13:26.132 --> 00:13:27.686
drilling under the surface.

00:13:28.106 --> 00:13:30.699
New particles can either
show up immediately

00:13:30.723 --> 00:13:32.856
as big, obvious-to-spot bumps,

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.821
or they can only reveal themselves
after years of data taking.

00:13:38.103 --> 00:13:42.513
Humanity has just begun its exploration
at the LHC at this big high energy,

00:13:42.537 --> 00:13:44.328
and we have much searching to do.

00:13:44.352 --> 00:13:50.177
But what if, even after 10 or 20 years,
we still find no new particles?

00:13:51.053 --> 00:13:52.748
We build a bigger machine.

00:13:52.772 --> 00:13:54.346
(Laughter)

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.060
We search at higher energies.

00:13:56.476 --> 00:13:58.046
We search at higher energies.

00:13:58.946 --> 00:14:01.999
Planning is already underway
for a 100-kilometer tunnel

00:14:02.612 --> 00:14:05.588
that will collide particles
at 10 times the energy of the LHC.

00:14:05.612 --> 00:14:07.949
We don't decide where
nature places new particles.

00:14:08.366 --> 00:14:10.012
We only decide to keep exploring.

00:14:10.036 --> 00:14:12.594
But what if, even after
a 100-kilometer tunnel

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:14.478
or a 500-kilometer tunnel

00:14:14.502 --> 00:14:17.343
or a 10,000-kilometer
collider floating in space

00:14:17.367 --> 00:14:18.945
between the Earth and the Moon,

00:14:18.969 --> 00:14:22.031
we still find no new particles?

00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:26.291
Then perhaps we're doing
particle physics wrong.

00:14:26.315 --> 00:14:28.106
(Laughter)

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.087
Perhaps we need to rethink things.

00:14:31.127 --> 00:14:34.389
Maybe we need more resources,
technology, expertise

00:14:34.413 --> 00:14:35.921
than what we currently have.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.951
We already use artificial intelligence
and machine learning techniques

00:14:39.975 --> 00:14:41.128
in parts of the LHC,

00:14:41.152 --> 00:14:43.558
but imagine designing
a particle physics experiment

00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:45.251
using such sophisticated algorithms

00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:48.443
that it could teach itself to discover
a hyperdimensional graviton.

00:14:48.467 --> 00:14:49.624
But what if?

00:14:49.648 --> 00:14:51.093
What if the ultimate question:

00:14:51.117 --> 00:14:54.590
What if even artificial intelligence
can't help us answer our questions?

00:14:54.614 --> 00:14:56.725
What if these open questions,
for centuries,

00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:59.418
are destined to be unanswered
for the foreseeable future?

00:14:59.442 --> 00:15:02.371
What if the stuff that's bothered me
since I was a little kid

00:15:02.395 --> 00:15:04.918
is destined to be unanswered
in my lifetime?

00:15:06.395 --> 00:15:07.551
Then that ...

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:10.376
will be even more fascinating.

00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:15.369
We will be forced to think
in completely new ways.

00:15:16.361 --> 00:15:18.419
We'll have to go back to our assumptions,

00:15:18.443 --> 00:15:20.782
and determine if there was
a flaw somewhere.

00:15:21.401 --> 00:15:24.796
And we'll need to encourage more people
to join us in studying science

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.882
since we need fresh eyes
on these century-old problems.

00:15:27.906 --> 00:15:31.040
I don't have the answers,
and I'm still searching for them.

00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:33.393
But someone -- maybe
she's in school right now,

00:15:33.417 --> 00:15:35.101
maybe she's not even born yet --

00:15:35.783 --> 00:15:38.916
could eventually guide us to see physics
in a completely new way,

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.208
and to point out that perhaps
we're just asking the wrong questions.

00:15:44.112 --> 00:15:46.522
Which would not be the end of physics,

00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:47.952
but a novel beginning.

00:15:49.204 --> 00:15:50.354
Thank you.

00:15:50.378 --> 00:15:52.919
(Applause)
