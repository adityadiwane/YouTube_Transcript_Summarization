00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:17.126
The two most likely largest inventions

00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:19.373
of our generation

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:22.566
are the Internet and the mobile phone.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.701
They've changed the world.

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:28.216
However, largely to our surprise,

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:32.614
they also turned out to be the perfect tools

00:00:32.614 --> 00:00:35.764
for the surveillance state.

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:38.661
It turned out that the capability

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:42.705
to collect data, information and connections

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:46.923
about basically any of us and all of us

00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:48.736
is exactly what we've been hearing

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:53.343
throughout of the summer
through revelations and leaks

00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:56.434
about Western intelligence agencies,

00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:59.460
mostly U.S. intelligence agencies,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.633
watching over the rest of the world.

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:05.831
We've heard about these starting with the

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:09.517
revelations from June 6.

00:01:09.517 --> 00:01:12.586
Edward Snowden started leaking information,

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:14.890
top secret classified information,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.357
from the U.S. intelligence agencies,

00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:18.826
and we started learning about things like PRISM

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:22.093
and XKeyscore and others.

00:01:22.093 --> 00:01:25.198
And these are examples of the kinds of programs

00:01:25.198 --> 00:01:29.477
U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now,

00:01:29.477 --> 00:01:32.993
against the whole rest of the world.

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:36.701
And if you look back about the forecasts

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:40.802
on surveillance by George Orwell,

00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:42.935
well it turns out that

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.439
George Orwell was an optimist.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.919
(Laughter)

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:50.619
We are right now seeing a much larger scale

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.517
of tracking of individual citizens

00:01:52.517 --> 00:01:56.149
than he could have ever imagined.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.684
And this here is the infamous

00:01:59.684 --> 00:02:03.528
NSA data center in Utah.

00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:06.684
Due to be opened very soon,

00:02:06.684 --> 00:02:09.475
it will be both a supercomputing center

00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:11.612
and a data storage center.

00:02:11.612 --> 00:02:14.505
You could basically imagine it has a large hall

00:02:14.505 --> 00:02:16.961
filled with hard drives storing data

00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:19.235
they are collecting.

00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:21.392
And it's a pretty big building.

00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:23.243
How big? Well, I can give you the numbers --

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:25.265
140,000 square meters --

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:27.871
but that doesn't really tell you very much.

00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:31.047
Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison.

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:33.503
You think about the largest IKEA store

00:02:33.503 --> 00:02:35.250
you've ever been in.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.719
This is five times larger.

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.795
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.802
Right? It's pretty big.

00:02:43.802 --> 00:02:46.648
We estimate that just the electricity bill

00:02:46.648 --> 00:02:48.524
for running this data center

00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:51.922
is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:54.431
And this kind of wholesale surveillance

00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:57.167
means that they can collect our data

00:02:57.167 --> 00:02:59.170
and keep it basically forever,

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.679
keep it for extended periods of time,

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.925
keep it for years, keep it for decades.

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:08.304
And this opens up completely new kinds of risks

00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:10.250
to us all.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.878
And what this is is that it is wholesale

00:03:13.878 --> 00:03:18.735
blanket surveillance on everyone.

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:20.289
Well, not exactly everyone,

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:24.317
because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right

00:03:24.317 --> 00:03:26.287
to monitor foreigners.

00:03:26.287 --> 00:03:28.037
They can monitor foreigners

00:03:28.037 --> 00:03:30.847
when foreigners' data connections

00:03:30.847 --> 00:03:34.337
end up in the United States or pass
through the United States.

00:03:34.337 --> 00:03:37.121
And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad

00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:39.488
until you realize

00:03:39.488 --> 00:03:42.489
that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner.

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.275
In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.

00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:47.945
(Laughter)

00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:49.832
Right?

00:03:49.832 --> 00:03:54.281
So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us,

00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:58.383
all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.

00:03:58.383 --> 00:04:00.274
But don't get me wrong:

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:05.500
There are actually types
of surveillance that are okay.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.529
I love freedom, but even I agree

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:10.808
that some surveillance is fine.

00:04:10.808 --> 00:04:14.711
If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer,

00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:17.813
or they're trying to catch a drug lord

00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:21.417
or trying to prevent a school shooting,

00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:23.094
and they have leads and they have suspects,

00:04:23.094 --> 00:04:26.811
then it's perfectly fine for them
to tap the suspect's phone,

00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:30.167
and to intercept his Internet communications.

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:32.105
I'm not arguing that at all,

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.929
but that's not what programs like PRISM are about.

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:37.814
They are not about doing surveillance on people

00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:41.018
that they have reason
to suspect of some wrongdoings.

00:04:41.018 --> 00:04:42.695
They're about doing surveillance on people

00:04:42.695 --> 00:04:46.455
they know are innocent.

00:04:46.455 --> 00:04:48.700
So the four main arguments

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.852
supporting surveillance like this,

00:04:50.852 --> 00:04:53.087
well, the first of all is that whenever you start

00:04:53.087 --> 00:04:54.982
discussing about these revelations,

00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:57.275
there will be naysayers trying to minimize

00:04:57.275 --> 00:04:59.463
the importance of these revelations, saying that

00:04:59.463 --> 00:05:01.076
we knew all this already,

00:05:01.076 --> 00:05:04.656
we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here.

00:05:04.656 --> 00:05:07.871
And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you

00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:13.583
that we knew this already,
because we did not know this already.

00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:17.356
Our worst fears might have been something like this,

00:05:17.356 --> 00:05:19.307
but we didn't know this was happening.

00:05:19.307 --> 00:05:22.084
Now we know for a fact it's happening.

00:05:22.084 --> 00:05:24.663
We didn't know about this.
We didn't know about PRISM.

00:05:24.663 --> 00:05:27.569
We didn't know about XKeyscore.
We didn't know about Cybertrans.

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.519
We didn't know about DoubleArrow.

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:31.667
We did not know about Skywriter --

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:33.362
all these different programs

00:05:33.362 --> 00:05:36.603
run by U.S. intelligence agencies.

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:39.632
But now we do.

00:05:39.632 --> 00:05:41.798
And we did not know

00:05:41.798 --> 00:05:44.873
that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes

00:05:44.873 --> 00:05:48.710
such as infiltrating standardization bodies

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.458
to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.

00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:55.495
And what that means

00:05:55.495 --> 00:05:57.315
is that you take something which is secure,

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.736
an encryption algorithm which is so secure

00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:02.843
that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,

00:06:02.843 --> 00:06:04.585
nobody can decrypt that file.

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:08.998
Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file,

00:06:08.998 --> 00:06:11.058
it's going to take millions of years.

00:06:11.058 --> 00:06:13.305
So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.

00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:15.379
You take something which is that good

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:17.863
and then you weaken it on purpose,

00:06:17.863 --> 00:06:23.473
making all of us less secure as an end result.

00:06:23.473 --> 00:06:25.604
A real-world equivalent would be that

00:06:25.604 --> 00:06:28.256
intelligence agencies would force

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:31.083
some secret pin code into every single house alarm

00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:32.876
so they could get into every single house

00:06:32.876 --> 00:06:35.122
because, you know, bad people
might have house alarms,

00:06:35.122 --> 00:06:37.561
but it will also make all of us

00:06:37.561 --> 00:06:39.790
less secure as an end result.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.530
Backdooring encryption algorithms

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.626
just boggles the mind.

00:06:46.626 --> 00:06:50.401
But of course, these intelligence agencies
are doing their job.

00:06:50.401 --> 00:06:52.158
This is what they have been told to do:

00:06:52.158 --> 00:06:54.388
do signals intelligence,

00:06:54.388 --> 00:06:56.400
monitor telecommunications,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.822
monitor Internet traffic.

00:06:57.822 --> 00:06:59.530
That's what they're trying to do,

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.612
and since most, a very big part
of the Internet traffic today is encrypted,

00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:04.569
they're trying to find ways around the encryption.

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:07.626
One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:09.511
which is a great example

00:07:09.511 --> 00:07:11.732
about how U.S. intelligence agencies

00:07:11.732 --> 00:07:13.481
are running loose.

00:07:13.481 --> 00:07:15.322
They are completely out of control,

00:07:15.322 --> 00:07:19.764
and they should be brought back under control.

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:24.579
So what do we actually know about the leaks?

00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:26.689
Everything is based on the files

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:29.187
leaked by Mr. Snowden.

00:07:29.187 --> 00:07:32.035
The very first PRISM slides

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:34.024
from the beginning of June

00:07:34.024 --> 00:07:36.118
detail a collection program where the data

00:07:36.118 --> 00:07:37.904
is collected from service providers,

00:07:37.904 --> 00:07:40.782
and they actually go and name the service providers

00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:42.113
they have access to.

00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:45.055
They even have a specific date

00:07:45.055 --> 00:07:47.719
on when the collection of data began

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:49.358
for each of the service providers.

00:07:49.358 --> 00:07:51.645
So for example, they name
the collection from Microsoft

00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:55.365
started on September 11, 2007,

00:07:55.365 --> 00:07:58.097
for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008,

00:07:58.097 --> 00:08:01.113
and then others: Google, Facebook,

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:04.357
Skype, Apple and so on.

00:08:04.357 --> 00:08:07.205
And every single one of these companies denies.

00:08:07.205 --> 00:08:11.600
They all say that this simply isn't true,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.208
that they are not giving
backdoor access to their data.

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:20.331
Yet we have these files.

00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:22.652
So is one of the parties lying,

00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:25.975
or is there some other alternative explanation?

00:08:25.975 --> 00:08:28.897
And one explanation would be

00:08:28.897 --> 00:08:31.784
that these parties, these service providers,

00:08:31.784 --> 00:08:33.700
are not cooperating.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.721
Instead, they've been hacked.

00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:39.938
That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.

00:08:39.938 --> 00:08:44.116
In this case, they've been hacked
by their own government.

00:08:44.116 --> 00:08:46.537
That might sound outlandish,

00:08:46.537 --> 00:08:48.751
but we already have cases where this has happened,

00:08:48.751 --> 00:08:51.797
for example, the case of the Flame malware

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:53.830
which we strongly believe was authored

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.727
by the U.S. government,

00:08:55.727 --> 00:08:59.626
and which, to spread, subverted the security

00:08:59.626 --> 00:09:02.512
of the Windows Update network,

00:09:02.512 --> 00:09:06.605
meaning here, the company was hacked

00:09:06.605 --> 00:09:08.963
by their own government.

00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:10.562
And there's more evidence

00:09:10.562 --> 00:09:13.113
supporting this theory as well.

00:09:13.113 --> 00:09:17.118
Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information

00:09:17.118 --> 00:09:21.383
about the operations run by the elite hacker units

00:09:21.383 --> 00:09:24.418
operating inside these intelligence agencies.

00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:27.044
Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO,

00:09:27.044 --> 00:09:28.889
Tailored Access Operations,

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:32.453
and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent,

00:09:32.453 --> 00:09:36.452
it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.

00:09:36.452 --> 00:09:40.296
And these recent leaks of these three slides

00:09:40.296 --> 00:09:42.500
detail an operation

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.658
run by this GCHQ intelligence agency

00:09:45.658 --> 00:09:47.467
from the United Kingdom

00:09:47.467 --> 00:09:51.700
targeting a telecom here in Belgium.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.976
And what this really means

00:09:53.976 --> 00:09:57.864
is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency

00:09:57.864 --> 00:10:00.079
is breaching the security

00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:04.892
of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose,

00:10:04.892 --> 00:10:08.727
and they discuss it in their slides completely casually,

00:10:08.727 --> 00:10:10.328
business as usual.

00:10:10.328 --> 00:10:11.996
Here's the primary target,

00:10:11.996 --> 00:10:13.374
here's the secondary target,

00:10:13.374 --> 00:10:14.798
here's the teaming.

00:10:14.798 --> 00:10:18.654
They probably have a team building
on Thursday evening in a pub.

00:10:18.654 --> 00:10:21.695
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art

00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:23.402
like, you know, "Success,"

00:10:23.402 --> 00:10:26.666
when they gain access to services like this.

00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:29.492
What the hell?

00:10:31.685 --> 00:10:33.518
And then there's the argument

00:10:33.518 --> 00:10:35.178
that okay, yes, this might be going on,

00:10:35.178 --> 00:10:37.815
but then again, other countries are doing it as well.

00:10:37.815 --> 00:10:40.238
All countries spy.

00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:41.976
And maybe that's true.

00:10:41.976 --> 00:10:44.414
Many countries spy, not all of them,
but let's take an example.

00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:46.525
Let's take, for example, Sweden.

00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:47.901
I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden

00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:50.180
has a little bit of a similar law to the United States.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.303
When your data traffic goes through Sweden,

00:10:52.303 --> 00:10:55.113
their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.114
to intercept that traffic.

00:10:57.114 --> 00:11:00.319
All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers

00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:03.191
and politicians and business leaders

00:11:03.191 --> 00:11:06.264
use, every day, U.S.-based services,

00:11:06.264 --> 00:11:09.532
like, you know, run Windows or OSX,

00:11:09.532 --> 00:11:11.742
or use Facebook or LinkedIn,

00:11:11.742 --> 00:11:15.142
or store their data in clouds like iCloud

00:11:15.142 --> 00:11:19.036
or Skydrive or DropBox,

00:11:19.036 --> 00:11:23.339
or maybe use online services like
Amazon web services or sales support?

00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:27.296
And the answer is, every single Swedish
business leader does that every single day.

00:11:27.296 --> 00:11:28.895
And then we turn it around.

00:11:28.895 --> 00:11:30.800
How many American leaders

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.093
use Swedish webmails and cloud services?

00:11:35.093 --> 00:11:37.133
And the answer is zero.

00:11:37.133 --> 00:11:39.402
So this is not balanced.

00:11:39.402 --> 00:11:44.027
It's not balanced by any means, not even close.

00:11:44.027 --> 00:11:46.468
And when we do have the occasional

00:11:46.468 --> 00:11:48.469
European success story,

00:11:48.469 --> 00:11:52.035
even those, then, typically end up being sold
to the United States.

00:11:52.035 --> 00:11:54.299
Like, Skype used to be secure.

00:11:54.299 --> 00:11:57.032
It used to be end-to-end encrypted.

00:11:57.032 --> 00:11:59.073
Then it was sold to the United States.

00:11:59.073 --> 00:12:01.722
Today, it no longer is secure.

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:04.943
So once again, we take something which is secure

00:12:04.943 --> 00:12:06.813
and then we make it less secure on purpose,

00:12:06.813 --> 00:12:11.297
making all of us less secure as an outcome.

00:12:12.855 --> 00:12:15.102
And then the argument that the United States

00:12:15.102 --> 00:12:17.120
is only fighting terrorists.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.286
It's the war on terror.

00:12:18.286 --> 00:12:20.833
You shouldn't worry about it.

00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:23.063
Well, it's not the war on terror.

00:12:23.063 --> 00:12:25.236
Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes,

00:12:25.236 --> 00:12:28.212
there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim,

00:12:28.212 --> 00:12:29.763
and we should fight them,

00:12:29.763 --> 00:12:31.369
but we know through these leaks

00:12:31.369 --> 00:12:33.951
that they have used the same techniques

00:12:33.951 --> 00:12:37.287
to listen to phone calls of European leaders,

00:12:37.287 --> 00:12:40.742
to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil,

00:12:40.742 --> 00:12:45.548
to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament,

00:12:45.548 --> 00:12:48.702
and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:51.720
from inside the E.U. Parliament, right?

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.668
It's not the war on terror.

00:12:53.668 --> 00:12:57.810
Part of it might be, and there are terrorists,

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.237
but are we really thinking about terrorists

00:13:00.237 --> 00:13:02.406
as such an existential threat

00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:06.082
that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?

00:13:06.082 --> 00:13:09.573
Are the Americans ready
to throw away the Constituion

00:13:09.573 --> 00:13:13.814
and throw it in the trash
just because there are terrorists?

00:13:13.814 --> 00:13:16.338
And the same thing with the Bill of Rights
and all the amendments

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:18.655
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

00:13:18.655 --> 00:13:23.806
and the E.U. conventions on human rights
and fundamental freedoms

00:13:23.806 --> 00:13:25.323
and the press freedom?

00:13:25.323 --> 00:13:29.138
Do we really think terrorism
is such an existential threat,

00:13:29.138 --> 00:13:32.264
we are ready to do anything at all?

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.154
But people are scared about terrorists,

00:13:37.154 --> 00:13:39.568
and then they think that
maybe that surveillance is okay

00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:41.612
because they have nothing to hide.

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:44.319
Feel free to survey me if that helps.

00:13:44.319 --> 00:13:47.207
And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide

00:13:47.207 --> 00:13:51.920
simply hasn't thought about this long enough.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:00.385
(Applause)

00:14:00.385 --> 00:14:03.157
Because we have this thing called privacy,

00:14:03.157 --> 00:14:05.502
and if you really think that you have nothing to hide,

00:14:05.502 --> 00:14:07.718
please make sure that's the first thing you tell me,

00:14:07.718 --> 00:14:09.268
because then I know

00:14:09.268 --> 00:14:10.908
that I should not trust you with any secrets,

00:14:10.908 --> 00:14:14.206
because obviously you can't keep a secret.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:20.894
But people are brutally honest with the Internet,

00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:23.590
and when these leaks started,

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.468
many people were asking me about this.

00:14:25.468 --> 00:14:27.042
And I have nothing to hide.

00:14:27.042 --> 00:14:30.332
I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.

00:14:30.332 --> 00:14:33.117
Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular

00:14:33.117 --> 00:14:35.910
like to share with an intelligence agency,

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:40.047
especially a foreign intelligence agency.

00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:42.902
And if we indeed need a Big Brother,

00:14:42.902 --> 00:14:46.380
I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.540
than a foreign Big Brother.

00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:54.604
And when the leaks started,
the very first thing I tweeted about this

00:14:54.604 --> 00:14:56.678
was a comment about how,

00:14:56.678 --> 00:14:58.366
when you've been using search engines,

00:14:58.366 --> 00:15:02.015
you've been potentially leaking all that
to U.S. intelligence.

00:15:02.015 --> 00:15:03.987
And two minutes later, I got a reply

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:06.323
by somebody called Kimberly from the United States

00:15:06.323 --> 00:15:08.490
challenging me, like, why am I worried about this?

00:15:08.503 --> 00:15:12.535
What am I sending to worry about this?
Am I sending naked pictures or something?

00:15:12.535 --> 00:15:14.503
And my answer to Kimberly was

00:15:14.503 --> 00:15:17.532
that what I'm sending is none of your business,

00:15:17.532 --> 00:15:21.797
and it should be none
of your government's business either.

00:15:21.797 --> 00:15:24.049
Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy.

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:25.963
Privacy is nonnegotiable.

00:15:25.963 --> 00:15:29.923
It should be built in to all the systems we use.

00:15:31.968 --> 00:15:35.546
(Applause)

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.449
And one thing we should all understand

00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:46.048
is that we are brutally honest with search engines.

00:15:46.048 --> 00:15:48.799
You show me your search history,

00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:51.165
and I'll find something incriminating

00:15:51.165 --> 00:15:54.602
or something embarrassing there in five minutes.

00:15:54.602 --> 00:15:56.390
We are more honest with search engines

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.152
than we are with our families.

00:15:58.152 --> 00:16:00.243
Search engines know more about you

00:16:00.243 --> 00:16:03.009
than your family members know about you.

00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:06.097
And this is all the kind
of information we are giving away,

00:16:06.097 --> 00:16:10.472
we are giving away to the United States.

00:16:10.472 --> 00:16:12.950
And surveillance changes history.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.159
We know this through examples
of corrupt presidents like Nixon.

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:20.631
Imagine if he would have had the kind
of surveillance tools that are available today.

00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:22.940
And let me actually quote

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.073
the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff.

00:16:26.073 --> 00:16:29.359
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance.

00:16:29.359 --> 00:16:31.635
Her email was read, and she spoke

00:16:31.635 --> 00:16:34.658
at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said,

00:16:34.658 --> 00:16:36.671
"If there is no right to privacy,

00:16:36.671 --> 00:16:39.498
there can be no true freedom
of expression and opinion,

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:44.609
and therefore, there can be no effective democracy."

00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:46.954
That's what it's about.

00:16:46.954 --> 00:16:50.822
Privacy is the building block of our democracies.

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:56.076
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum,

00:16:56.076 --> 00:16:59.903
he said that the United States
is right now treating the Internet

00:16:59.903 --> 00:17:02.996
as it would be treating one of its colonies.

00:17:02.996 --> 00:17:05.561
So we are back to the age of colonization,

00:17:05.561 --> 00:17:08.623
and we, the foreign users of the Internet,

00:17:08.623 --> 00:17:12.328
we should think about Americans as our masters.

00:17:15.005 --> 00:17:18.980
So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.634
Some are blaming him for causing problems

00:17:21.634 --> 00:17:24.825
for the U.S. cloud industry
and software companies with these revelations --

00:17:24.825 --> 00:17:29.121
and blaming Snowden for causing problems
for the U.S. cloud industry

00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:31.580
would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.897
for causing global warming.

00:17:33.897 --> 00:17:36.151
(Laughter)

00:17:36.151 --> 00:17:41.222
(Applause)

00:17:43.853 --> 00:17:50.061
So, what is there to be done?

00:17:50.061 --> 00:17:51.841
Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry.

00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:54.277
We should be angry, because this is wrong,

00:17:54.277 --> 00:17:57.016
and it's rude, and it should not be done.

00:17:57.016 --> 00:17:59.284
But that's not going to really change the situation.

00:17:59.284 --> 00:18:02.505
What's going to change the situation
for the rest of the world

00:18:02.505 --> 00:18:04.787
is to try to steer away

00:18:04.787 --> 00:18:07.420
from systems built in the United States.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.050
And that's much easier said than done.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.759
How do you do that?

00:18:11.759 --> 00:18:13.558
A single country, any single country in Europe

00:18:13.558 --> 00:18:16.351
cannot replace and build replacements

00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:19.113
for the U.S.-made operating systems
and cloud services.

00:18:19.113 --> 00:18:21.006
But maybe you don't have to do it alone.

00:18:21.006 --> 00:18:22.775
Maybe you can do it together with other countries.

00:18:22.775 --> 00:18:26.271
The solution is open source.

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:31.884
By building together open, free, secure systems,

00:18:31.884 --> 00:18:34.992
we can go around such surveillance,

00:18:34.992 --> 00:18:38.215
and then one country doesn't have
to solve the problem by itself.

00:18:38.215 --> 00:18:40.687
It only has to solve one little problem.

00:18:40.687 --> 00:18:46.210
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer,

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.179
one country only has to make a small wave,

00:18:49.179 --> 00:18:52.646
but those small waves together become a tide,

00:18:52.646 --> 00:18:56.266
and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time,

00:18:56.266 --> 00:18:57.917
and the tide we will build

00:18:57.917 --> 00:19:01.358
with secure, free, open-source systems,

00:19:01.358 --> 00:19:03.757
will become the tide that will lift all of us

00:19:03.757 --> 00:19:09.339
up and above the surveillance state.

00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:11.451
Thank you very much.

00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:13.849
(Applause)
