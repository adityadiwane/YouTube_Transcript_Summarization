00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:19.079
I don't know why, but I'm continually amazed to think

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.677
that two and a half billion of us around the world

00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:24.093
are connected to each other through the Internet

00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:26.218
and that at any point in time

00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:28.968
more than 30 percent of the world's population

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:34.083
can go online to learn, to create and to share.

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:37.646
And the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this

00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:39.427
is also continuing to go grow.

00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:40.885
A recent study showed

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:42.385
that the young generation alone

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:45.656
is spending over eight hours a day online.

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:47.822
As the parent of a nine-year-old girl,

00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:50.035
that number seems awfully low.

00:00:50.035 --> 00:00:51.385
(Laughter)

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:55.458
But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us,

00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:59.133
it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.989
And increasingly, the price we're being asked to pay

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.240
for all of this connectedness

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.254
is our privacy.

00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:09.250
Today, what many of us would love to believe

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.255
is that the Internet is a private place; it's not.

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:15.340
And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.690
we are like Hansel and Gretel

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.260
leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.702
everywhere we travel through the digital woods.

00:01:22.702 --> 00:01:27.552
We are leaving our birthdays, our places of residence,

00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:29.914
our interests and preferences,

00:01:29.914 --> 00:01:32.003
our relationships,

00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:35.764
our financial histories, and on and on it goes.

00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:37.760
Now don't get me wrong,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.247
I'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing.

00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:43.625
In fact, when I know the data that's being shared

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:46.385
and I'm asked explicitly for my consent,

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:48.802
I want some sites to understand my habits.

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:51.200
It helps them suggest books for me to read

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.535
or movies for my family to watch

00:01:53.535 --> 00:01:55.991
or friends for us to connect with.

00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:59.072
But when I don't know and when I haven't been asked,

00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:01.668
that's when the problem arises.

00:02:01.668 --> 00:02:03.385
It's a phenomenon on the Internet today

00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:05.135
called behavioral tracking,

00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:06.802
and it is very big business.

00:02:06.802 --> 00:02:09.260
In fact, there's an entire industry formed

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.597
around following us through the digital woods

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:13.941
and compiling a profile on each of us.

00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:15.856
And when all of that data is held,

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:19.308
they can do almost whatever they want with it.

00:02:19.308 --> 00:02:22.677
This is an area today that has very few regulations

00:02:22.677 --> 00:02:24.427
and even fewer rules.

00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:28.010
Except for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.135
it's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked.

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.539
So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further.

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:39.245
The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:42.718
and it's an experimental browser add-on

00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:44.885
that you can install in your Firefox browser

00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:49.581
that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you.

00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:52.177
The red dots you see up there

00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:54.093
are sites that are behavioral tracking

00:02:54.093 --> 00:02:57.302
that I have not navigated to, but are following me.

00:02:57.302 --> 00:03:00.450
The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.816
And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me,

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.916
but I have no idea who they are.

00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:08.010
All of them are connected, as you can see,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.260
to form a picture of me on the Web.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.802
And this is my profile.

00:03:11.802 --> 00:03:15.212
So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal.

00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:18.635
I installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:21.645
and I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day.

00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:23.943
Now like most of you,

00:03:23.943 --> 00:03:27.564
I actually start my day going online and checking email.

00:03:27.564 --> 00:03:30.403
I then go to a news site, look for some headlines.

00:03:30.403 --> 00:03:33.927
And in this particular case I happened to like one of them

00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:37.343
on the merits of music literacy in schools

00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:39.593
and I shared it over a social network.

00:03:39.593 --> 00:03:42.260
Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.510
and I asked her, "Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school?"

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.510
And she, of course, naturally as a nine-year-old,

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.629
looked at me and said quizzically, "What's literacy?"

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.385
So I sent her online, of course, to look it up.

00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:56.510
Now let me stop here.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.290
We are not even two bites into breakfast

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.606
and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me.

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:06.864
I have navigated to a total of four.

00:04:06.864 --> 00:04:10.154
So let me fast-forward through the rest of my day.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.451
I go to work, I check email,

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:15.141
I log onto a few more social sites, I blog,

00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:18.635
I check more news reports, I share some of those news reports,

00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:20.697
I go look at some videos,

00:04:20.697 --> 00:04:25.260
pretty typical day -- in this case, actually fairly pedantic --

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.302
and at the end of the day, as my day winds down,

00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:31.343
look at my profile.

00:04:31.343 --> 00:04:33.433
The red dots have exploded.

00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:36.039
The gray dots have grown exponentially.

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.579
All in all, there's over 150 sites

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.510
that are now tracking my personal information,

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.352
most all of them without my consent.

00:04:44.352 --> 00:04:47.599
I look at this picture and it freaks me out.

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.081
This is nothing. I am being stalked across the Web.

00:04:52.081 --> 00:04:54.398
And why is this happening?

00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:56.768
Pretty simple -- it's huge business.

00:04:56.768 --> 00:04:59.343
The revenue of the top handful of companies in this space

00:04:59.343 --> 00:05:01.718
is over 39 billion dollars today.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.641
And as adults, we're certainly not alone.

00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:07.635
At the same time I installed my own Collusion profile,

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:10.968
I installed one for my daughter.

00:05:10.968 --> 00:05:14.343
And on one single Saturday morning, over two hours on the Internet,

00:05:14.343 --> 00:05:17.485
here's her Collusion profile.

00:05:17.485 --> 00:05:20.380
This is a nine-year-old girl

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.205
navigating to principally children's sites.

00:05:24.205 --> 00:05:27.677
I move from this, from freaked out to enraged.

00:05:27.677 --> 00:05:32.387
This is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate;

00:05:32.387 --> 00:05:33.987
this is me being a parent.

00:05:33.987 --> 00:05:35.552
Imagine in the physical world

00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:38.839
if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.865
and recorded their every movement.

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:44.385
I can tell you, there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by.

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:47.810
We'd take action. It may not be good action, but we would take action.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.156
(Laughter)

00:05:49.156 --> 00:05:51.221
We can't sit idly by here either.

00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:53.279
This is happening today.

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:55.481
Privacy is not an option,

00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:57.322
and it shouldn't be the price we accept

00:05:57.322 --> 00:05:59.028
for just getting on the Internet.

00:05:59.028 --> 00:06:02.645
Our voices matter and our actions matter even more.

00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:05.718
Today we've launched Collusion.

00:06:05.718 --> 00:06:07.885
You can download it, install it in Firefox,

00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:10.427
to see who is tracking you across the Web

00:06:10.427 --> 00:06:12.808
and following you through the digital woods.

00:06:12.808 --> 00:06:15.870
Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.010
Because what we don't know can actually hurt us.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.635
Because the memory of the Internet is forever.

00:06:21.635 --> 00:06:23.314
We are being watched.

00:06:23.314 --> 00:06:26.029
It's now time for us to watch the watchers.

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:27.126
Thank you.

00:06:27.126 --> 00:06:31.177
(Applause)
