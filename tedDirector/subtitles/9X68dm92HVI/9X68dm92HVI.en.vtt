00:00:16.477 --> 00:00:19.136
I'll tell you a little bit
about irrational behavior.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.041
Not yours, of course -- other people's.

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:22.247
(Laughter)

00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:26.136
So after being at MIT for a few years,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.817
I realized that writing academic papers
is not that exciting.

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.199
You know, I don't know
how many of those you read,

00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:35.758
but it's not fun to read
and often not fun to write --

00:00:35.782 --> 00:00:37.136
even worse to write.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.136
So I decided to try and write
something more fun.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.607
And I came up with an idea
that I would write a cookbook.

00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:47.123
And the title for my cookbook
was going to be,

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:50.007
"Dining Without Crumbs:
The Art of Eating Over the Sink."

00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:51.753
(Laughter)

00:00:51.777 --> 00:00:54.682
And it was going to be a look
at life through the kitchen.

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:56.261
I was quite excited about this.

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:58.554
I was going to talk
a little bit about research,

00:00:58.578 --> 00:01:00.075
a little bit about the kitchen.

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:03.218
We do so much in the kitchen,
I thought this would be interesting.

00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:07.134
I wrote a couple of chapters,
and took it to MIT Press and they said,

00:01:07.158 --> 00:01:10.252
"Cute, but not for us.
Go and find somebody else."

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:13.157
I tried other people,
and everybody said the same thing,

00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.252
"Cute. Not for us."

00:01:15.276 --> 00:01:18.136
Until somebody said,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.986
"Look, if you're serious about this,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.541
you have to write about your research
first; you have to publish something,

00:01:23.565 --> 00:01:26.263
then you'll get the opportunity
to write something else.

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:28.558
If you really want to do it,
you have to do it."

00:01:28.582 --> 00:01:30.927
I said, "I don't want to write
about my research.

00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:32.168
I do it all day long,

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:35.684
I want to write something
a bit more free, less constrained."

00:01:35.708 --> 00:01:38.136
And this person
was very forceful and said,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.736
"Look, that's the only way
you'll ever do it."

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.070
So I said, "Okay, if I have to do it --"

00:01:43.094 --> 00:01:44.253
I had a sabbatical.

00:01:44.277 --> 00:01:47.236
I said, "I'll write about my research,
if there's no other way.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.062
And then I'll get to do my cookbook."

00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:52.322
So, I wrote a book on my research.

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:54.917
And it turned out to be
quite fun in two ways.

00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:57.465
First of all, I enjoyed writing.

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:01.243
But the more interesting thing
was that I started learning from people.

00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:02.852
It's a fantastic time to write,

00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:05.581
because there's so much feedback
you can get from people.

00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:08.136
People write to me
about their personal experience,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.494
and about their examples,
and where they disagree,

00:02:10.518 --> 00:02:12.136
and their nuances.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.446
And even being here --
I mean, the last few days,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.136
I've known heights of obsessive behavior

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.136
I never thought about.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.792
(Laughter)

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:22.708
Which I think is just fascinating.

00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:25.327
I will tell you a little bit
about irrational behavior,

00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:28.529
and I want to start by giving you
some examples of visual illusion

00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:30.486
as a metaphor for rationality.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.328
So think about these two tables.

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.136
And you must have seen this illusion.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.981
If I asked you what's longer, the vertical
line on the table on the left,

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:40.798
or the horizontal line
on the table on the right,

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:43.136
which one seems longer?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.135
Can anybody see anything
but the left one being longer?

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.006
No, right? It's impossible.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.922
But the nice thing about visual illusion
is we can easily demonstrate mistakes.

00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:54.409
So I can put some lines
on; it doesn't help.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:56.135
I can animate the lines.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.827
And to the extent you believe
I didn't shrink the lines,

00:02:58.851 --> 00:03:03.639
which I didn't, I've proven to you
that your eyes were deceiving you.

00:03:03.663 --> 00:03:07.136
Now, the interesting thing about this
is when I take the lines away,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.970
it's as if you haven't learned
anything in the last minute.

00:03:09.994 --> 00:03:12.214
(Laughter)

00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:15.929
You can't look at this and say,
"Now I see reality as it is."

00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:19.993
Right? It's impossible to overcome
this sense that this is indeed longer.

00:03:20.017 --> 00:03:21.644
Our intuition is really fooling us

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:23.815
in a repeatable,
predictable, consistent way.

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.136
and there is almost nothing
we can do about it,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.136
aside from taking a ruler
and starting to measure it.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.334
Here's another one.
It's one of my favorite illusions.

00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:35.047
What color is the top arrow pointing to?

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:38.291
Audience: Brown.
Dan Ariely: Brown. Thank you.

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:40.284
The bottom one? Yellow.

00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:41.649
Turns out they're identical.

00:03:41.673 --> 00:03:43.584
Can anybody see them as identical?

00:03:43.608 --> 00:03:44.982
Very, very hard.

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:47.136
I can cover the rest of the cube up.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.566
If I cover the rest of the cube,
you can see that they are identical.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.027
If you don't believe me,
you can get the slide later

00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:55.867
and do some arts and crafts
and see that they're identical.

00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:59.224
But again, it's the same story,
that if we take the background away,

00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:01.453
the illusion comes back.

00:04:01.477 --> 00:04:04.454
There is no way for us not
to see this illusion.

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:07.795
I guess maybe if you're colorblind,
I don't think you can see that.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.136
I want you to think
about illusion as a metaphor.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.295
Vision is one of the best things we do.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.915
We have a huge part of our brain
dedicated to vision --

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.834
bigger than dedicated to anything else.

00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:20.706
We use our vision more hours
of the day than anything else.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.800
We're evolutionarily
designed to use vision.

00:04:22.824 --> 00:04:25.800
And if we have these predictable
repeatable mistakes in vision,

00:04:25.824 --> 00:04:27.330
which we're so good at,

00:04:27.354 --> 00:04:29.918
what are the chances we won't make
even more mistakes

00:04:29.942 --> 00:04:33.493
in something we're not as good at,
for example, financial decision-making.

00:04:33.517 --> 00:04:35.136
(Laughter)

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.810
Something we don't have
an evolutionary reason to do,

00:04:37.834 --> 00:04:40.184
we don't have a specialized
part of the brain for,

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:42.223
and we don't do that many
hours of the day.

00:04:42.247 --> 00:04:44.215
The argument is in those cases,

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:48.136
it might be that we actually
make many more mistakes.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.933
And worse -- not having
an easy way to see them,

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:54.186
because in visual illusions, we can
easily demonstrate the mistakes;

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.297
in cognitive illusion
it's much, much harder

00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:58.136
to demonstrate the mistakes to people.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.136
So I want to show you
some cognitive illusions,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.242
or decision-making illusions,
in the same way.

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:07.742
And this is one of my favorite
plots in social sciences.

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:11.604
It's from a paper
by Johnson and Goldstein.

00:05:11.628 --> 00:05:15.326
It basically shows the percentage
of people who indicated

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.080
they would be interested
in donating their organs.

00:05:19.104 --> 00:05:21.029
These are different countries in Europe.

00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:23.014
You basically see two types of countries:

00:05:23.038 --> 00:05:25.640
countries on the right,
that seem to be giving a lot;

00:05:25.664 --> 00:05:28.623
and countries on the left
that seem to giving very little,

00:05:28.647 --> 00:05:30.250
or much less.

00:05:30.274 --> 00:05:31.426
The question is, why?

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.774
Why do some countries give a lot
and some countries give a little?

00:05:34.798 --> 00:05:36.426
When you ask people this question,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.982
they usually think that it has
to be about culture.

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:40.632
How much do you care about people?

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:42.136
Giving organs to somebody else

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.494
is probably about how much you care
about society, how linked you are.

00:05:45.518 --> 00:05:47.136
Or maybe it's about religion.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.115
But if you look at this plot,

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.566
you can see that countries
that we think about as very similar,

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.732
actually exhibit very different behavior.

00:05:55.368 --> 00:05:57.629
For example, Sweden
is all the way on the right,

00:05:57.653 --> 00:06:00.312
and Denmark, which we think
is culturally very similar,

00:06:00.336 --> 00:06:02.136
is all the way on the left.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.136
Germany is on the left,
and Austria is on the right.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.476
The Netherlands is on the left,
and Belgium is on the right.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.136
And finally, depending
on your particular version

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.136
of European similarity,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.326
you can think about the U.K. and France
as either similar culturally or not,

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.174
but it turns out that with organ
donation, they are very different.

00:06:23.198 --> 00:06:25.637
By the way, the Netherlands
is an interesting story.

00:06:25.661 --> 00:06:29.280
You see, the Netherlands is kind
of the biggest of the small group.

00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:33.136
It turns out that they got to 28 percent

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.439
after mailing every household
in the country a letter,

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:39.136
begging people to join
this organ donation program.

00:06:39.672 --> 00:06:42.640
You know the expression,
"Begging only gets you so far."

00:06:42.664 --> 00:06:45.136
It's 28 percent in organ donation.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.029
(Laughter)

00:06:47.433 --> 00:06:49.783
But whatever the countries
on the right are doing,

00:06:49.807 --> 00:06:51.918
they're doing a much
better job than begging.

00:06:51.942 --> 00:06:53.250
So what are they doing?

00:06:53.274 --> 00:06:56.742
Turns out the secret has to do
with a form at the DMV.

00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:58.136
And here is the story.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.667
The countries on the left
have a form at the DMV

00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:02.382
that looks something like this.

00:07:02.406 --> 00:07:06.691
"Check the box below if you want to
participate in the organ donor program."

00:07:06.715 --> 00:07:08.136
And what happens?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.469
People don't check, and they don't join.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.662
The countries on the right,
the ones that give a lot,

00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:15.288
have a slightly different form.

00:07:15.312 --> 00:07:18.812
It says, "Check the box below
if you don't want to participate ..."

00:07:18.836 --> 00:07:21.026
Interestingly enough,
when people get this,

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.136
they again don't check, but now they join.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.136
(Laughter)

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.072
Now, think about what this means.

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:33.136
You know, we wake up in the morning
and we feel we make decisions.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.470
We wake up in the morning
and we open the closet;

00:07:35.494 --> 00:07:37.278
we feel that we decide what to wear.

00:07:37.302 --> 00:07:40.374
we open the refrigerator and we feel
that we decide what to eat.

00:07:40.398 --> 00:07:41.897
What this is actually saying,

00:07:41.921 --> 00:07:44.731
is that many of these decisions
are not residing within us.

00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:47.532
They are residing in the person
who is designing that form.

00:07:47.881 --> 00:07:49.827
When you walk into the DMV,

00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:52.850
the person who designed the form
will have a huge influence

00:07:52.874 --> 00:07:54.683
on what you'll end up doing.

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:57.486
Now, it's also very hard
to intuit these results.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.851
Think about it for yourself.

00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:00.136
How many of you believe

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.446
that if you went to renew
your license tomorrow,

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.136
and you went to the DMV,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.427
and you encountered one of these forms,

00:08:06.451 --> 00:08:08.912
that it would actually
change your own behavior?

00:08:08.936 --> 00:08:11.243
Very hard to think
that it would influence us.

00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:14.806
We can say, "Oh, these funny Europeans,
of course it would influence them."

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.593
But when it comes to us,

00:08:16.617 --> 00:08:19.255
we have such a feeling
that we're in the driver's seat,

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:22.568
such a feeling that we're in control
and we are making the decision,

00:08:22.592 --> 00:08:25.191
that it's very hard
to even accept the idea

00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:27.890
that we actually have an illusion
of making a decision,

00:08:27.914 --> 00:08:29.978
rather than an actual decision.

00:08:30.002 --> 00:08:32.470
Now, you might say,

00:08:32.494 --> 00:08:34.911
"These are decisions we don't care about."

00:08:34.935 --> 00:08:37.208
In fact, by definition,
these are decisions

00:08:37.232 --> 00:08:39.815
about something that will happen
to us after we die.

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:41.959
How could we care about something less

00:08:41.983 --> 00:08:44.272
than about something
that happens after we die?

00:08:44.296 --> 00:08:47.218
So a standard economist,
somebody who believes in rationality,

00:08:47.242 --> 00:08:48.495
would say, "You know what?

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:51.971
The cost of lifting the pencil
and marking a "V" is higher

00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:54.136
than the possible benefit of the decision,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.958
so that's why we get this effect."

00:08:55.982 --> 00:08:56.991
(Laughter)

00:08:57.015 --> 00:08:59.513
But, in fact, it's not because it's easy.

00:08:59.537 --> 00:09:02.553
It's not because it's trivial.
It's not because we don't care.

00:09:02.577 --> 00:09:04.998
It's the opposite. It's because we care.

00:09:05.022 --> 00:09:06.966
It's difficult and it's complex.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.541
And it's so complex
that we don't know what to do.

00:09:09.565 --> 00:09:11.541
And because we have no idea what to do,

00:09:11.565 --> 00:09:15.136
we just pick whatever it was
that was chosen for us.

00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:17.310
I'll give you one more example.

00:09:17.334 --> 00:09:19.921
This is from a paper
by Redelmeier and Shafir.

00:09:19.945 --> 00:09:23.451
And they said, "Would this
effect also happens to experts?

00:09:23.475 --> 00:09:26.603
People who are well-paid,
experts in their decisions,

00:09:26.627 --> 00:09:27.983
and who make a lot of them?"

00:09:28.007 --> 00:09:30.192
And they took a group of physicians.

00:09:30.216 --> 00:09:32.668
They presented to them
a case study of a patient.

00:09:32.692 --> 00:09:36.136
They said, "Here is a patient.
He is a 67-year-old farmer.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.890
He's been suffering from
right hip pain for a while."

00:09:38.914 --> 00:09:40.748
And then, they said to the physicians,

00:09:40.772 --> 00:09:42.136
"You decided a few weeks ago

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.136
that nothing is working for this patient.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.589
All these medications,
nothing seems to be working.

00:09:46.613 --> 00:09:49.385
So you refer the patient
for hip replacement therapy.

00:09:49.409 --> 00:09:51.136
Hip replacement. Okay?"

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.135
So the patient is on a path
to have his hip replaced.

00:09:54.616 --> 00:09:56.585
Then they said to half of the physicians,

00:09:56.609 --> 00:09:58.948
"Yesterday, you reviewed
the patient's case,

00:09:58.972 --> 00:10:01.582
and you realized that you forgot
to try one medication.

00:10:01.606 --> 00:10:03.202
You did not try ibuprofen.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.485
What do you do? Do you pull
the patient back and try ibuprofen?

00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:10.279
Or do you let him go
and have hip replacement?"

00:10:10.303 --> 00:10:12.954
Well, the good news is
that most physicians in this case

00:10:12.978 --> 00:10:15.787
decided to pull the patient
and try ibuprofen.

00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:17.551
Very good for the physicians.

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.642
To the other group
of physicians, they said,

00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:23.515
"Yesterday when you reviewed the case,
you discovered there were two medications

00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:26.055
you didn't try out yet --
ibuprofen and piroxicam."

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:28.330
You have two medications
you didn't try out yet.

00:10:28.354 --> 00:10:30.997
What do you do? You let him go,
or you pull him back?

00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:34.465
And if you pull him back, do you try
ibuprofen or piroxicam? Which one?"

00:10:34.489 --> 00:10:35.645
Now, think of it:

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:39.541
This decision makes it as easy to let
the patient continue with hip replacement,

00:10:39.565 --> 00:10:42.691
but pulling him back, all of the sudden
it becomes more complex.

00:10:42.715 --> 00:10:44.533
There is one more decision.

00:10:44.557 --> 00:10:45.883
What happens now?

00:10:45.907 --> 00:10:49.526
The majority of the physicians
now choose to let the patient go

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.067
for a hip replacement.

00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:53.136
I hope this worries you, by the way --

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.393
(Laughter)

00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:56.136
when you go to see your physician.

00:10:56.782 --> 00:10:59.504
The thing is that
no physician would ever say,

00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:03.321
"Piroxicam, ibuprofen, hip replacement.
Let's go for hip replacement."

00:11:03.345 --> 00:11:06.136
But the moment you set this
as the default,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.136
it has a huge power over whatever
people end up doing.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.494
I'll give you a couple of more examples
on irrational decision-making.

00:11:13.518 --> 00:11:15.336
Imagine I give you a choice:

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.973
Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome,
all expenses paid --

00:11:18.997 --> 00:11:23.559
hotel, transportation, food,
a continental breakfast, everything --

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:25.136
or a weekend in Paris?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.414
Now, weekend in Paris, weekend
in Rome -- these are different things.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:31.216
They have different food,
different culture, different art.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.596
Imagine I added a choice to the set
that nobody wanted.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.372
Imagine I said, "A weekend in Rome,

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:37.764
a weekend in Paris,

00:11:37.788 --> 00:11:39.380
or having your car stolen?"

00:11:39.404 --> 00:11:42.437
(Laughter)

00:11:42.461 --> 00:11:45.707
It's a funny idea, because why
would having your car stolen,

00:11:45.731 --> 00:11:47.327
in this set, influence anything?

00:11:47.351 --> 00:11:49.465
(Laughter)

00:11:49.489 --> 00:11:53.938
But what if the option to have your car
stolen was not exactly like this?

00:11:53.962 --> 00:11:56.494
What if it was a trip to Rome,
all expenses paid,

00:11:56.518 --> 00:11:58.796
transportation, breakfast,

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.136
but it doesn't include
coffee in the morning?

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.533
If you want coffee, you have to pay
for it yourself, it's two euros 50.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:05.564
(Laughter)

00:12:05.588 --> 00:12:07.136
Now in some ways,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.459
given that you can have Rome with coffee,

00:12:09.483 --> 00:12:11.864
why would you possibly
want Rome without coffee?

00:12:11.888 --> 00:12:14.832
It's like having your car stolen.
It's an inferior option.

00:12:15.474 --> 00:12:16.626
But guess what happened?

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.961
The moment you add Rome without coffee,

00:12:18.985 --> 00:12:22.603
Rome with coffee becomes more popular,
and people choose it.

00:12:22.627 --> 00:12:25.136
The fact that you have Rome without coffee

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.136
makes Rome with coffee look superior,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.136
and not just to Rome without coffee --
even superior to Paris.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.237
(Laughter)

00:12:34.261 --> 00:12:36.713
Here are two examples of this principle.

00:12:36.737 --> 00:12:39.389
This was an ad in The Economist
a few years ago

00:12:39.413 --> 00:12:41.493
that gave us three choices:

00:12:41.517 --> 00:12:44.350
an online subscription for 59 dollars,

00:12:44.374 --> 00:12:47.859
a print subscription for 125 dollars,

00:12:47.883 --> 00:12:50.136
or you could get both for 125.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.136
(Laughter)

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.745
Now I looked at this,
and I called up The Economist,

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:57.332
and I tried to figure out
what they were thinking.

00:12:57.356 --> 00:13:00.498
And they passed me from one person
to another to another,

00:13:00.522 --> 00:13:04.245
until eventually I got to the person
who was in charge of the website,

00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:07.864
and I called them up, and they went
to check what was going on.

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:11.735
The next thing I know,
the ad is gone, no explanation.

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:13.646
So I decided to do the experiment

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.312
that I would have loved
The Economist to do with me.

00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:18.735
I took this and I gave it
to 100 MIT students.

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:20.323
I said, "What would you choose?"

00:13:20.347 --> 00:13:24.333
These are the market shares --
most people wanted the combo deal.

00:13:24.357 --> 00:13:26.565
Thankfully, nobody wanted
the dominant option.

00:13:26.589 --> 00:13:28.229
That means our students can read.

00:13:28.253 --> 00:13:29.635
(Laughter)

00:13:29.659 --> 00:13:32.548
But now, if you have an option
that nobody wants,

00:13:32.572 --> 00:13:34.271
you can take it off, right?

00:13:34.295 --> 00:13:36.136
So I printed another version of this,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.977
where I eliminated the middle option.

00:13:38.001 --> 00:13:41.484
I gave it to another 100 students.
Here is what happened:

00:13:41.508 --> 00:13:44.245
Now the most popular option
became the least popular,

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:46.912
and the least popular
became the most popular.

00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:51.136
What was happening
was the option that was useless,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.011
in the middle, was useless
in the sense that nobody wanted it.

00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:58.201
But it wasn't useless in the sense
that it helped people figure out

00:13:58.225 --> 00:13:59.376
what they wanted.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.136
In fact, relative
to the option in the middle,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.659
which was get only the print for 125,

00:14:06.683 --> 00:14:10.436
the print and web for 125
looked like a fantastic deal.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.563
And as a consequence, people chose it.

00:14:12.587 --> 00:14:14.214
The general idea here, by the way,

00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:16.929
is that we actually don't know
our preferences that well.

00:14:16.953 --> 00:14:19.423
And because we don't know
our preferences that well,

00:14:19.447 --> 00:14:22.736
we're susceptible to all of these
influences from the external forces:

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.436
the defaults, the particular options
that are presented to us, and so on.

00:14:26.792 --> 00:14:28.136
One more example of this.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.517
People believe that when we deal
with physical attraction,

00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:34.804
we see somebody, and we know immediately
whether we like them or not,

00:14:34.828 --> 00:14:36.136
if we're attracted or not.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.592
This is why we have
these four-minute dates.

00:14:38.616 --> 00:14:41.136
So I decided to do
this experiment with people.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.136
I'll show you images here, no real people,
but the experiment was with people.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.136
I showed some people a picture
of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.229
and I said, "Who do you want to date?

00:14:50.253 --> 00:14:51.728
Tom or Jerry?"

00:14:51.752 --> 00:14:55.031
But for half the people,
I added an ugly version of Jerry.

00:14:55.055 --> 00:15:00.136
I took Photoshop and I made
Jerry slightly less attractive.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.573
(Laughter)

00:15:01.597 --> 00:15:05.136
For the other people, I added
an ugly version of Tom.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.136
And the question was,
will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.928
help their respective,
more attractive brothers?

00:15:11.952 --> 00:15:14.181
The answer was absolutely yes.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.351
When ugly Jerry was around,
Jerry was popular.

00:15:16.375 --> 00:15:18.515
When ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular.

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:20.136
(Laughter)

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.672
This of course has two
very clear implications

00:15:22.696 --> 00:15:25.005
for life in general.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.136
If you ever go bar-hopping,
who do you want to take with you?

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.889
(Laughter)

00:15:34.913 --> 00:15:38.690
You want a slightly uglier
version of yourself.

00:15:38.714 --> 00:15:40.136
(Laughter)

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.397
Similar, but slightly uglier.

00:15:42.421 --> 00:15:43.864
(Laughter)

00:15:43.888 --> 00:15:47.657
The second point, or course, is that
if somebody invites you to bar hop,

00:15:47.681 --> 00:15:49.428
you know what they think about you.

00:15:49.452 --> 00:15:52.136
(Laughter)

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.442
Now you get it.

00:15:54.466 --> 00:15:56.136
What is the general point?

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.418
The general point is that,

00:15:57.442 --> 00:16:01.136
when we think about economics, we have
this beautiful view of human nature.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.697
"What a piece of work is a man!
How noble in reason!"

00:16:03.721 --> 00:16:06.299
We have this view of ourselves, of others.

00:16:06.323 --> 00:16:11.537
The behavioral economics perspective
is slightly less "generous" to people;

00:16:11.561 --> 00:16:13.660
in fact, in medical terms,

00:16:13.684 --> 00:16:14.876
that's our view.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:20.027
(Laughter)

00:16:20.051 --> 00:16:22.136
But there is a silver lining.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.034
The silver lining is, I think,

00:16:24.058 --> 00:16:28.136
kind of the reason that behavioral
economics is interesting and exciting.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.025
Are we Superman, or are we Homer Simpson?

00:16:31.446 --> 00:16:34.437
When it comes to building
the physical world,

00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:36.493
we kind of understand our limitations.

00:16:36.517 --> 00:16:37.688
We build steps.

00:16:37.712 --> 00:16:40.855
And we build these things
that not everybody can use, obviously.

00:16:40.879 --> 00:16:42.775
(Laughter)

00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:44.346
We understand our limitations,

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.020
and we build around them.

00:16:46.044 --> 00:16:48.623
But for some reason, when it comes
to the mental world,

00:16:48.647 --> 00:16:52.004
when we design things like healthcare
and retirement and stock markets,

00:16:52.028 --> 00:16:54.376
we somehow forget the idea
that we are limited.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.307
I think that if we understood
our cognitive limitations

00:16:57.331 --> 00:16:59.943
in the same way we understand
our physical limitations,

00:16:59.967 --> 00:17:02.777
even though they don't stare us
in the face the same way,

00:17:02.801 --> 00:17:05.281
we could design a better world,
and that, I think,

00:17:05.305 --> 00:17:06.698
is the hope of this thing.

00:17:06.722 --> 00:17:08.136
Thank you very much.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.802
