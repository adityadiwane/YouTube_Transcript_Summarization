00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:16.733
These are some photos of me
volunteering in a Cambodian orphanage

00:00:16.757 --> 00:00:17.949
in 2006.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.563
When these photos were taken,

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.889
I thought I was doing a really good thing

00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:25.421
and that I was really helping those kids.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.245
I had a lot to learn.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.835
It all started for me
when I was 19 years old

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.221
and went backpacking
through Southeast Asia.

00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:36.538
When I reached Cambodia,

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:40.836
I felt uncomfortable being on holiday
surrounded by so much poverty

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.942
and wanted to do something to give back.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:47.413
So I visited some orphanages
and donated some clothes and books

00:00:47.437 --> 00:00:48.731
and some money

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:50.534
to help the kids that I met.

00:00:51.535 --> 00:00:55.687
But one of the orphanages I visited
was desperately poor.

00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:59.447
I had never encountered poverty
like that before in my life.

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:02.395
They didn't have funds for enough food,

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:03.729
clean water

00:01:03.753 --> 00:01:05.079
or medical treatment,

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:08.667
and the sad little faces on those kids

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:09.893
were heartbreaking.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.221
So I was compelled
to do something more to help.

00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:17.742
I fund-raised in Australia and returned
to Cambodia the following year

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.243
to volunteer at the orphanage
for a few months.

00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:24.344
I taught English and bought
water filters and food

00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:28.307
and took all of the kids to the dentist
for the first time in their lives.

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:31.220
But over the course of the next year,

00:01:31.244 --> 00:01:34.828
I came to discover that this orphanage
that I had been supporting

00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:36.285
was terribly corrupt.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:41.691
The director had been embezzling
every cent donated to the orphanage,

00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:46.065
and in my absence, the children
were suffering such gross neglect

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:49.138
that they were forced to catch mice
to feed themselves.

00:01:50.306 --> 00:01:51.709
I also found out later

00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:55.467
that the director had been physically
and sexually abusing the kids.

00:01:56.703 --> 00:01:59.319
I couldn't bring myself
to turn my back on children

00:01:59.343 --> 00:02:02.005
who I had come to know and care about

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:04.309
and return to my life in Australia.

00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:08.518
So I worked with a local team
and the local authorities

00:02:08.542 --> 00:02:11.921
to set up a new orphanage
and rescue the kids

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:14.335
to give them a safe new home.

00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:19.743
But this is where my story takes
another unexpected turn.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.825
As I adjusted to my new life
running an orphanage in Cambodia,

00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:29.389
(Khmer) I learned
to speak Khmer fluently,

00:02:30.797 --> 00:02:34.320
which means that I learned
to speak the Khmer language fluently.

00:02:34.344 --> 00:02:37.395
And when I could communicate
properly with the kids,

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.650
I began to uncover some strange things.

00:02:41.517 --> 00:02:45.182
Most of the children we had removed
from the orphanage

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:48.716
were not, in fact, orphans at all.

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.310
They had parents,

00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:55.738
and the few that were orphaned
had other living relatives,

00:02:55.762 --> 00:02:58.282
like grandparents and aunties and uncles

00:02:58.306 --> 00:02:59.882
and other siblings.

00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:05.137
So why were these children
living in an orphanage

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:07.507
when they weren't orphans?

00:03:09.097 --> 00:03:12.331
Since 2005, the number
of orphanages in Cambodia

00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:14.778
has risen by 75 percent,

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:18.691
and the number of children
living in Cambodian orphanages

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:20.861
has nearly doubled,

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:22.397
despite the fact

00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:25.544
that the vast majority of children
living in these orphanages

00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:28.550
are not orphans in the traditional sense.

00:03:29.097 --> 00:03:31.356
They're children from poor families.

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:35.641
So if the vast majority of children
living in orphanages

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:37.088
are not orphans,

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:38.974
then the term "orphanage"

00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:43.657
is really just a euphemistic name
for a residential care institution.

00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:47.314
These institutions go
by other names as well,

00:03:47.338 --> 00:03:52.823
like "shelters," "safe houses,"
"children's homes," "children's villages,"

00:03:52.847 --> 00:03:54.413
even "boarding schools."

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.271
And this problem is not just
confined to Cambodia.

00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:04.062
This map shows some of the countries
that have seen a dramatic increase

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:06.921
in the numbers of residential
care institutions

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:10.604
and the numbers of children
being institutionalized.

00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:13.034
In Uganda, for example,

00:04:13.058 --> 00:04:15.647
the number of children
living in institutions

00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:21.004
has increased by more than
1,600 percent since 1992.

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.829
And the problems posed
by putting kids into institutions

00:04:26.853 --> 00:04:31.528
don't just pertain to the corrupt
and abusive institutions

00:04:31.552 --> 00:04:34.207
like the one that I rescued the kids from.

00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:38.368
The problems are with all forms
of residential care.

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:43.755
Over 60 years of international
research has shown us

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:47.095
that children who grow up in institutions,

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:50.063
even the very best institutions,

00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:53.591
are at serious risk
of developing mental illnesses,

00:04:53.615 --> 00:04:55.398
attachment disorders,

00:04:55.422 --> 00:04:57.653
growth and speech delays,

00:04:57.677 --> 00:05:00.641
and many will struggle
with an inability to reintegrate

00:05:00.665 --> 00:05:02.877
back into society later in life

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:05.568
and form healthy relationships as adults.

00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:09.834
These kids grow up
without any model of family

00:05:09.858 --> 00:05:12.305
or of what good parenting looks like,

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:15.468
so they then can struggle
to parent their own children.

00:05:16.604 --> 00:05:20.721
So if you institutionalize
large numbers of children,

00:05:20.745 --> 00:05:24.282
it will affect not only this generation,

00:05:24.306 --> 00:05:26.761
but also the generations to come.

00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:31.350
We've learned these lessons
before in Australia.

00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:35.706
It's what happened
to our "Stolen Generations,"

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.388
the indigenous children
who were removed from their families

00:05:39.412 --> 00:05:41.833
with the belief
that we could do a better job

00:05:41.857 --> 00:05:44.001
of raising their children.

00:05:45.782 --> 00:05:47.305
Just imagine for a moment

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:50.087
what residential care
would be like for a child.

00:05:50.843 --> 00:05:54.001
Firstly, you have a constant
rotation of caregivers,

00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:57.179
with somebody new coming on
to the shift every eight hours.

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:00.942
And then on top of that
you have a steady stream of visitors

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:02.728
and volunteers coming in,

00:06:02.752 --> 00:06:05.945
showering you in the love
and affection you're craving

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.555
and then leaving again,

00:06:09.157 --> 00:06:12.059
evoking all of those feelings
of abandonment,

00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:15.355
and proving again and again

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:17.818
that you are not worthy of being loved.

00:06:19.475 --> 00:06:25.273
We don't have orphanages
in Australia, the USA, the UK anymore,

00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:27.253
and for a very good reason:

00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:31.744
one study has shown that young adults
raised in institutions

00:06:31.768 --> 00:06:35.687
are 10 times more likely
to fall into sex work than their peers,

00:06:36.298 --> 00:06:39.546
40 times more likely
to have a criminal record,

00:06:40.586 --> 00:06:44.688
and 500 times more likely

00:06:44.712 --> 00:06:46.591
to take their own lives.

00:06:48.623 --> 00:06:53.327
There are an estimated
eight million children around the world

00:06:53.351 --> 00:06:56.375
living in institutions like orphanages,

00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:00.864
despite the fact that around
80 percent of them are not orphans.

00:07:01.623 --> 00:07:04.604
Most have families
who could be caring for them

00:07:04.628 --> 00:07:06.378
if they had the right support.

00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:09.312
But for me,

00:07:09.975 --> 00:07:12.770
the most shocking thing of all to realize

00:07:13.325 --> 00:07:15.977
is what's contributing to this boom

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:21.026
in the unnecessary institutionalization
of so many children:

00:07:23.184 --> 00:07:24.428
it's us --

00:07:25.576 --> 00:07:28.720
the tourists, the volunteers

00:07:29.334 --> 00:07:30.689
and the donors.

00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:37.254
It's the well-meaning support
from people like me back in 2006,

00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:41.147
who visit these children
and volunteer and donate,

00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:46.270
who are unwittingly fueling an industry
that exploits children

00:07:46.294 --> 00:07:48.390
and tears families apart.

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.539
It's really no coincidence
that these institutions are largely set up

00:07:53.563 --> 00:07:56.475
in areas where tourists
can most easily be lured in

00:07:56.499 --> 00:08:00.872
to visit and volunteer
in exchange for donations.

00:08:01.744 --> 00:08:05.178
Of the 600 so-called orphanages in Nepal,

00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:10.649
over 90 percent of them are located
in the most popular tourist hotspots.

00:08:12.222 --> 00:08:14.435
The cold, hard truth is,

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:18.802
the more money that floods in
in support of these institutions,

00:08:18.826 --> 00:08:21.150
the more institutions open

00:08:21.715 --> 00:08:24.861
and the more children
are removed from their families

00:08:24.885 --> 00:08:26.398
to fill their beds.

00:08:27.055 --> 00:08:30.477
It's just the laws of supply and demand.

00:08:32.434 --> 00:08:35.571
I had to learn all of these
lessons the hard way,

00:08:35.595 --> 00:08:39.281
after I had already set up
an orphanage in Cambodia.

00:08:40.297 --> 00:08:43.503
I had to eat a big piece
of humble pie to admit

00:08:44.289 --> 00:08:46.694
that I had made a mistake

00:08:46.718 --> 00:08:49.559
and inadvertently become
a part of the problem.

00:08:50.634 --> 00:08:52.962
I had been an orphanage tourist,

00:08:52.986 --> 00:08:54.847
a voluntourist.

00:08:54.871 --> 00:08:59.854
I then set up my own orphanage
and facilitated orphanage tourism

00:08:59.878 --> 00:09:02.527
in order to generate funds
for my orphanage,

00:09:03.281 --> 00:09:04.885
before I knew better.

00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:08.203
What I came to learn

00:09:08.227 --> 00:09:11.637
is that no matter how good
my orphanage was,

00:09:11.661 --> 00:09:16.316
it was never going to give those kids
what they really needed:

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:19.269
their families.

00:09:21.118 --> 00:09:24.137
I know that it can feel
incredibly depressing

00:09:24.161 --> 00:09:27.916
to learn that helping vulnerable children
and overcoming poverty

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.479
is not as simple as we've all
been led to believe it should be.

00:09:32.741 --> 00:09:35.763
But thankfully, there is a solution.

00:09:36.484 --> 00:09:40.282
These problems are reversible
and preventable,

00:09:40.306 --> 00:09:42.320
and when we know better,

00:09:42.344 --> 00:09:43.739
we can do better.

00:09:44.913 --> 00:09:47.261
The organization that I run today,

00:09:47.285 --> 00:09:49.557
the Cambodian Children's Trust,

00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:51.609
is no longer an orphanage.

00:09:52.255 --> 00:09:57.978
In 2012, we changed the model
in favor of family-based care.

00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:02.682
I now lead an amazing team
of Cambodian social workers,

00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:04.266
nurses and teachers.

00:10:04.803 --> 00:10:07.208
Together, we work within communities

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:10.546
to untangle a complex web of social issues

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.575
and help Cambodian
families escape poverty.

00:10:14.595 --> 00:10:18.753
Our primary focus is on preventing
some of the most vulnerable families

00:10:18.777 --> 00:10:19.938
in our community

00:10:19.962 --> 00:10:22.349
from being separated in the first place.

00:10:23.314 --> 00:10:25.347
But in cases where it's not possible

00:10:25.371 --> 00:10:28.625
for a child to live
with its biological family,

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:30.791
we support them in foster care.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.657
Family-based care is always better

00:10:35.681 --> 00:10:38.775
than placing a child in an institution.

00:10:40.293 --> 00:10:43.070
Do you remember that first photo
that I showed you before?

00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:47.018
See that girl who is just about
to catch the ball?

00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:48.579
Her name is Torn

00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:52.586
She's a strong, brave
and fiercely intelligent girl.

00:10:53.157 --> 00:10:56.052
But in 2006, when I first met her

00:10:56.076 --> 00:10:59.107
living in that corrupt
and abusive orphanage,

00:10:59.869 --> 00:11:01.569
she had never been to school.

00:11:02.193 --> 00:11:04.260
She was suffering terrible neglect,

00:11:04.957 --> 00:11:07.793
and she yearned desperately

00:11:07.817 --> 00:11:10.533
for the warmth and love of her mother.

00:11:12.354 --> 00:11:16.438
But this is a photo of Torn today
with her family.

00:11:16.462 --> 00:11:18.876
Her mother now has a secure job,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.424
her siblings are doing well in high school

00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:25.356
and she is just about to finish
her nursing degree at university.

00:11:25.928 --> 00:11:27.499
For Torn's family --

00:11:27.523 --> 00:11:34.521

00:11:36.057 --> 00:11:37.462
for Torn's family,

00:11:37.486 --> 00:11:40.076
the cycle of poverty has been broken.

00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:44.763
The family-based care model
that we have developed at CCT

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:46.596
has been so successful,

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.998
that it's now being put forward
by UNICEF Cambodia

00:11:50.022 --> 00:11:51.538
and the Cambodian government

00:11:51.562 --> 00:11:55.635
as a national solution
to keep children in families.

00:11:56.936 --> 00:11:58.293
And one of the best --

00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:02.706
(Applause)

00:12:04.484 --> 00:12:08.826
And one of the best ways
that you can help to solve this problem

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.646
is by giving these eight million
children a voice

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.562
and become an advocate
for family-based care.

00:12:16.358 --> 00:12:19.460
If we work together to raise awareness,

00:12:19.484 --> 00:12:22.320
we can make sure the world knows

00:12:22.344 --> 00:12:27.452
that we need to put an end
to the unnecessary institutionalization

00:12:27.476 --> 00:12:29.136
of vulnerable children.

00:12:29.973 --> 00:12:31.541
How do we achieve that?

00:12:32.014 --> 00:12:35.841
By redirecting our support
and our donations

00:12:35.865 --> 00:12:40.191
away from orphanages
and residential care institutions

00:12:40.215 --> 00:12:46.293
towards organizations that are committed
to keeping children in families.

00:12:47.384 --> 00:12:50.803
I believe we can make this happen
in our lifetime,

00:12:50.827 --> 00:12:54.470
and as a result, we will see
developing communities thrive

00:12:54.494 --> 00:12:57.687
and ensure that vulnerable
children everywhere

00:12:57.711 --> 00:13:01.687
have what all children need and deserve:

00:13:02.468 --> 00:13:03.855
a family.

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:05.059
Thank you.

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:09.042
(Applause)
