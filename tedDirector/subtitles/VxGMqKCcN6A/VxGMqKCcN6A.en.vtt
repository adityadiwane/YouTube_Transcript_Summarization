00:00:27.063 --> 00:00:29.976
That splendid music, the coming-in music,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.881
"The Elephant March" from "Aida,"
is the music I've chosen for my funeral.

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:36.976
(Laughter)

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.976
And you can see why. It's triumphal.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.976
I won't feel anything, but if I could,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.976
I would feel triumphal
at having lived at all,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.096
and at having lived
on this splendid planet,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.233
and having been given
the opportunity to understand

00:00:55.257 --> 00:01:01.448
something about why I was here
in the first place, before not being here.

00:01:02.448 --> 00:01:06.867
Can you understand
my quaint English accent?

00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:08.762
(Laughter)

00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:14.726
Like everybody else, I was entranced
yesterday by the animal session.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.189
Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others;

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.439
the beauty of the things that they showed.

00:01:22.463 --> 00:01:27.976
The only slight jarring note was when
Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.831
"the most splendid creatures
that God put on this earth."

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:35.456
Now of course, we know
that he didn't really mean that,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.633
but in this country at the moment,
you can't be too careful.

00:01:38.657 --> 00:01:39.976
(Laughter)

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.976
I'm a biologist, and the central theorem
of our subject: the theory of design,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.699
Darwin's theory of evolution
by natural selection.

00:01:51.723 --> 00:01:55.976
In professional circles everywhere,
it's of course universally accepted.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.976
In non-professional circles
outside America, it's largely ignored.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.976
But in non-professional
circles within America,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.976
it arouses so much hostility --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.076
(Laughter)

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.730
it's fair to say that American biologists
are in a state of war.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.975
The war is so worrying at present,

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.572
with court cases coming
up in one state after another,

00:02:20.596 --> 00:02:22.976
that I felt I had to say
something about it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.976
If you want to know what I have
to say about Darwinism itself,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.976
I'm afraid you're going
to have to look at my books,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.976
which you won't find
in the bookstore outside.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.976
(Laughter)

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:37.976
Contemporary court cases

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.976
often concern an allegedly
new version of creationism,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.299
called "Intelligent Design," or ID.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.792
Don't be fooled.
There's nothing new about ID.

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.499
It's just creationism under another name,

00:02:53.523 --> 00:02:56.881
rechristened --
I choose the word advisedly --

00:02:56.905 --> 00:02:57.976
(Laughter)

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.976
for tactical, political reasons.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.976
The arguments of so-called ID theorists

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.372
are the same old arguments
that had been refuted again and again,

00:03:05.396 --> 00:03:07.829
since Darwin down to the present day.

00:03:08.908 --> 00:03:11.976
There is an effective evolution lobby

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.096
coordinating the fight
on behalf of science,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.976
and I try to do all I can to help them,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.976
but they get quite upset
when people like me dare to mention

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.579
that we happen to be atheists
as well as evolutionists.

00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:29.976
They see us as rocking the boat,
and you can understand why.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.418
Creationists, lacking any coherent
scientific argument for their case,

00:03:35.442 --> 00:03:40.396
fall back on the popular
phobia against atheism:

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.976
Teach your children
evolution in biology class,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.976
and they'll soon move on to drugs,
grand larceny and sexual "pre-version."

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.789
(Laughter)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.976
In fact, of course, educated
theologians from the Pope down

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.124
are firm in their support of evolution.

00:03:59.886 --> 00:04:02.805
This book, "Finding
Darwin's God," by Kenneth Miller,

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.892
is one of the most effective attacks
on Intelligent Design that I know

00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:10.976
and it's all the more effective because
it's written by a devout Christian.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.582
People like Kenneth Miller could be called
a "godsend" to the evolution lobby,

00:04:15.606 --> 00:04:16.976
(Laughter)

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.727
because they expose the lie
that evolutionism is, as a matter of fact,

00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:23.374
tantamount to atheism.

00:04:23.398 --> 00:04:26.532
People like me, on the other
hand, rock the boat.

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:30.976
But here, I want to say something
nice about creationists.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.676
It's not a thing I often do,
so listen carefully.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.976
(Laughter)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.976
I think they're right about one thing.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.976
I think they're right that evolution

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.643
is fundamentally hostile to religion.

00:04:43.643 --> 00:04:46.857
I've already said that many individual
evolutionists, like the Pope,

00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:49.976
are also religious, but I think
they're deluding themselves.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.404
I believe a true
understanding of Darwinism

00:04:53.428 --> 00:04:56.968
is deeply corrosive to religious faith.

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.572
Now, it may sound as though
I'm about to preach atheism,

00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:07.428
and I want to reassure you
that that's not what I'm going to do.

00:05:07.452 --> 00:05:10.976
In an audience
as sophisticated as this one,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.353
that would be preaching to the choir.

00:05:13.853 --> 00:05:16.473
No, what I want to urge upon you --

00:05:16.497 --> 00:05:20.240
(Laughter)

00:05:20.264 --> 00:05:24.976
Instead, what I want to urge
upon you is militant atheism.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.976
(Laughter)

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.198
(Applause)

00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:32.977
But that's putting it too negatively.

00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:37.650
If I was a person who were interested
in preserving religious faith,

00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:42.823
I would be very afraid of the positive
power of evolutionary science,

00:05:42.847 --> 00:05:45.696
and indeed science generally,
but evolution in particular,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.582
to inspire and enthrall,
precisely because it is atheistic.

00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:57.090
Now, the difficult problem
for any theory of biological design

00:05:57.114 --> 00:06:02.376
is to explain the massive statistical
improbability of living things.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.772
Statistical improbability
in the direction of good design --

00:06:07.796 --> 00:06:09.684
"complexity" is another word for this.

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:12.016
The standard creationist argument --

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.976
there is only one;
they're all reduced to this one --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.380
takes off from
a statistical improbability.

00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:20.690
Living creatures are too complex
to have come about by chance;

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.976
therefore, they must have had a designer.

00:06:23.594 --> 00:06:26.038
This argument of course,
shoots itself in the foot.

00:06:26.062 --> 00:06:29.377
Any designer capable of designing
something really complex

00:06:29.401 --> 00:06:31.982
has to be even more complex himself,

00:06:32.006 --> 00:06:35.976
and that's before we even start
on the other things he's expected to do,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.914
like forgive sins, bless
marriages, listen to prayers --

00:06:39.938 --> 00:06:41.976
favor our side in a war --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.386
(Laughter)

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.976
disapprove of our sex lives, and so on.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.976
(Laughter)

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.976
Complexity is the problem
that any theory of biology has to solve,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.707
and you can't solve it by postulating
an agent that is even more complex,

00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:01.341
thereby simply compounding the problem.

00:07:01.928 --> 00:07:06.325
Darwinian natural selection
is so stunningly elegant

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:10.174
because it solves the problem
of explaining complexity

00:07:10.198 --> 00:07:13.253
in terms of nothing but simplicity.

00:07:14.094 --> 00:07:17.363
Essentially, it does it
by providing a smooth ramp

00:07:17.387 --> 00:07:20.702
of gradual, step-by-step increment.

00:07:21.757 --> 00:07:23.630
But here, I only want to make the point

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:27.344
that the elegance of Darwinism
is corrosive to religion,

00:07:27.368 --> 00:07:31.976
precisely because it is so elegant,
so parsimonious, so powerful,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.714
so economically powerful.

00:07:36.285 --> 00:07:42.182
It has the sinewy economy
of a beautiful suspension bridge.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.591
The God theory is not just a bad theory.

00:07:45.615 --> 00:07:47.385
It turns out to be -- in principle --

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:50.976
incapable of doing the job required of it.

00:07:51.464 --> 00:07:54.575
So, returning to tactics
and the evolution lobby,

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.721
I want to argue that rocking the boat

00:07:57.745 --> 00:08:02.452
may be just the right thing to do.

00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:06.048
My approach to attacking creationism is --

00:08:06.072 --> 00:08:08.555
unlike the evolution lobby --

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:13.309
my approach to attacking creationism
is to attack religion as a whole.

00:08:14.356 --> 00:08:18.618
And at this point I need
to acknowledge the remarkable taboo

00:08:18.642 --> 00:08:21.128
against speaking ill of religion,

00:08:21.152 --> 00:08:24.501
and I'm going to do so in the words
of the late Douglas Adams,

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:26.764
a dear friend who,
if he never came to TED,

00:08:26.788 --> 00:08:28.770
certainly should have been invited.

00:08:28.794 --> 00:08:30.261
(Richard Saul Wurman: He was.)

00:08:30.285 --> 00:08:33.308
Richard Dawkins: He was. Good.
I thought he must have been.

00:08:33.332 --> 00:08:36.176
He begins this speech,
which was tape recorded in Cambridge

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.976
shortly before he died --

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.573
he begins by explaining how science
works through the testing of hypotheses

00:08:42.597 --> 00:08:46.200
that are framed to be vulnerable
to disproof, and then he goes on.

00:08:46.224 --> 00:08:49.976
I quote, "Religion doesn't
seem to work like that.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.976
It has certain ideas at the heart of it,
which we call 'sacred' or 'holy.'

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.976
What it means is:
here is an idea or a notion

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.655
that you're not allowed
to say anything bad about.

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:04.976
You're just not. Why not?
Because you're not."

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.904
(Laughter)

00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:11.349
"Why should it be
that it's perfectly legitimate

00:09:11.373 --> 00:09:13.362
to support the Republicans or Democrats,

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.746
this model of economics versus that,

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.735
Macintosh instead of Windows,

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:20.720
but to have an opinion
about how the universe began,

00:09:20.744 --> 00:09:22.380
about who created the universe --

00:09:22.404 --> 00:09:24.053
no, that's holy.

00:09:24.784 --> 00:09:28.150
So, we're used to not
challenging religious ideas,

00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:31.364
and it's very interesting how much
of a furor Richard creates

00:09:31.388 --> 00:09:32.547
when he does it." --

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:34.371
He meant me, not that one.

00:09:35.578 --> 00:09:37.976
"Everybody gets absolutely
frantic about it,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.588
because you're not allowed
to say these things.

00:09:40.612 --> 00:09:42.309
Yet when you look at it rationally,

00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:44.429
there's no reason why those ideas

00:09:44.453 --> 00:09:47.128
shouldn't be as open
to debate as any other,

00:09:47.152 --> 00:09:50.221
except that we've agreed
somehow between us

00:09:50.245 --> 00:09:51.619
that they shouldn't be."

00:09:51.983 --> 00:09:54.300
And that's the end
of the quote from Douglas.

00:09:56.864 --> 00:10:00.976
In my view, not only is science
corrosive to religion;

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.151
religion is corrosive to science.

00:10:04.698 --> 00:10:08.571
It teaches people
to be satisfied with trivial,

00:10:08.595 --> 00:10:11.618
supernatural non-explanations,

00:10:11.642 --> 00:10:15.373
and blinds them to the wonderful,
real explanations

00:10:15.397 --> 00:10:16.976
that we have within our grasp.

00:10:17.595 --> 00:10:23.636
It teaches them to accept
authority, revelation and faith,

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.129
instead of always insisting on evidence.

00:10:29.081 --> 00:10:33.620
There's Douglas Adams, magnificent picture
from his book, "Last Chance to See."

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.660
Now, there's a typical scientific journal,

00:10:37.684 --> 00:10:39.317
The Quarterly Review of Biology.

00:10:39.341 --> 00:10:42.197
And I'm going to put
together, as guest editor,

00:10:42.221 --> 00:10:47.466
a special issue on the question,
"Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?"

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.587
And the first paper
is a standard scientific paper,

00:10:51.611 --> 00:10:53.486
presenting evidence,

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.245
"Iridium layer at the K-T boundary,

00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:57.690
and potassium argon dated
crater in Yucatan,

00:10:57.714 --> 00:11:00.325
indicate that an asteroid
killed the dinosaurs."

00:11:00.349 --> 00:11:02.976
Perfectly ordinary scientific paper.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.533
Now, the next one.

00:11:04.557 --> 00:11:07.222
"The President of the Royal Society

00:11:07.246 --> 00:11:11.734
has been vouchsafed
a strong inner conviction

00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:14.261
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

00:11:14.285 --> 00:11:16.238
(Laughter)

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:24.332
"It has been privately
revealed to Professor Huxtane

00:11:24.356 --> 00:11:26.277
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:27.689
(Laughter)

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.261
"Professor Hordley was brought up

00:11:32.285 --> 00:11:34.976
to have total and unquestioning faith" --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.032
(Laughter) --

00:11:36.056 --> 00:11:40.852
"that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

00:11:43.459 --> 00:11:47.976
"Professor Hawkins has
promulgated an official dogma

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.444
binding on all loyal Hawkinsians

00:11:51.468 --> 00:11:54.337
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

00:11:54.361 --> 00:11:56.301
(Laughter)

00:11:57.523 --> 00:12:00.824
That's inconceivable, of course.

00:12:01.848 --> 00:12:03.078
But suppose --

00:12:03.102 --> 00:12:06.148
[Supporters of the Asteroid Theory
cannot be patriotic citizens]

00:12:06.172 --> 00:12:07.887
(Laughter)

00:12:07.911 --> 00:12:10.530
(Applause)

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.976
In 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.818
whether he recognized
the equal citizenship and patriotism

00:12:19.842 --> 00:12:21.976
of Americans who are atheists.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.976
Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.976
"No, I don't know that atheists
should be considered citizens,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.976
nor should they be considered patriots.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.634
This is one nation under God."

00:12:34.571 --> 00:12:37.190
Bush's bigotry
was not an isolated mistake,

00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:40.499
blurted out in the heat
of the moment and later retracted.

00:12:40.523 --> 00:12:45.370
He stood by it in the face of repeated
calls for clarification or withdrawal.

00:12:45.394 --> 00:12:46.624
He really meant it.

00:12:46.648 --> 00:12:51.203
More to the point, he knew
it posed no threat to his election --

00:12:51.227 --> 00:12:52.409
quite the contrary.

00:12:52.433 --> 00:12:56.163
Democrats as well as Republicans
parade their religiousness

00:12:56.187 --> 00:12:57.911
if they want to get elected.

00:12:57.935 --> 00:13:02.095
Both parties invoke
"one nation under God."

00:13:02.119 --> 00:13:04.431
What would Thomas Jefferson have said?

00:13:04.455 --> 00:13:08.081
[In every country and in every age,
the priest has been hostile to liberty]

00:13:08.105 --> 00:13:11.976
Incidentally, I'm not usually
very proud of being British,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.976
but you can't help making the comparison.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.969
(Applause)

00:13:24.485 --> 00:13:26.976
In practice, what is an atheist?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.308
An atheist is just somebody
who feels about Yahweh

00:13:31.332 --> 00:13:37.595
the way any decent Christian feels
about Thor or Baal or the golden calf.

00:13:37.619 --> 00:13:41.976
As has been said before, we are
all atheists about most of the gods

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.305
that humanity has ever believed in.

00:13:44.329 --> 00:13:46.976
Some of us just go one god further.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.976
(Laughter)

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.976
(Applause)

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.334
And however we define atheism,
it's surely the kind of academic belief

00:14:00.358 --> 00:14:03.976
that a person is entitled
to hold without being vilified

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.156
as an unpatriotic,
unelectable non-citizen.

00:14:09.045 --> 00:14:12.429
Nevertheless, it's an undeniable fact
that to own up to being an atheist

00:14:12.453 --> 00:14:16.993
is tantamount to introducing yourself
as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub.

00:14:17.583 --> 00:14:21.285
And that all stems
from the perception of atheists

00:14:21.309 --> 00:14:25.214
as some kind of weird, way-out minority.

00:14:25.889 --> 00:14:28.976
Natalie Angier wrote a rather
sad piece in the New Yorker,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.063
saying how lonely she felt as an atheist.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.858
She clearly feels
in a beleaguered minority.

00:14:33.882 --> 00:14:39.137
But actually, how do American atheists
stack up numerically?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.899
The latest survey makes
surprisingly encouraging reading.

00:14:43.296 --> 00:14:46.726
Christianity, of course, takes a massive
lion's share of the population,

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.344
with nearly 160 million.

00:14:49.256 --> 00:14:52.733
But what would you think
was the second largest group,

00:14:52.757 --> 00:14:58.193
convincingly outnumbering Jews
with 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million,

00:14:58.217 --> 00:15:01.867
Hindus, Buddhists and all other
religions put together?

00:15:01.891 --> 00:15:04.534
The second largest group,
with nearly 30 million,

00:15:04.558 --> 00:15:07.748
is the one described
as non-religious or secular.

00:15:08.701 --> 00:15:11.976
You can't help wondering
why vote-seeking politicians

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.182
are so proverbially overawed by the power
of, for example, the Jewish lobby --

00:15:17.206 --> 00:15:21.523
the state of Israel seems to owe its very
existence to the American Jewish vote --

00:15:21.547 --> 00:15:22.976
while at the same time,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.090
consigning the non-religious
to political oblivion.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:31.976
This secular non-religious vote,
if properly mobilized,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.913
is nine times as numerous
as the Jewish vote.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.976
Why does this far more
substantial minority

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.207
not make a move to exercise
its political muscle?

00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:46.055
Well, so much for quantity.
How about quality?

00:15:46.539 --> 00:15:49.642
Is there any correlation,
positive or negative,

00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:53.677
between intelligence
and tendency to be religious?

00:15:53.701 --> 00:15:55.938
[Them folks misunderestimated me]

00:15:55.962 --> 00:16:00.050
(Laughter)

00:16:00.582 --> 00:16:03.976
The survey that I quoted,
which is the ARIS survey,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.048
didn't break down its data
by socio-economic class or education,

00:16:07.072 --> 00:16:08.794
IQ or anything else.

00:16:08.818 --> 00:16:12.976
But a recent article by Paul G. Bell
in the Mensa magazine

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.976
provides some straws in the wind.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.477
Mensa, as you know,
is an international organization

00:16:17.501 --> 00:16:20.811
for people with very high IQ.

00:16:20.835 --> 00:16:25.770
And from a meta-analysis
of the literature,

00:16:25.794 --> 00:16:30.976
Bell concludes that, I quote --
"Of 43 studies carried out since 1927

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.295
on the relationship
between religious belief,

00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:35.785
and one's intelligence
or educational level,

00:16:35.809 --> 00:16:39.976
all but four found an inverse connection.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.617
That is, the higher one's intelligence
or educational level,

00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:45.976
the less one is likely to be religious."

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.175
Well, I haven't seen
the original 42 studies,

00:16:48.199 --> 00:16:51.207
and I can't comment on that meta-analysis,

00:16:51.231 --> 00:16:54.944
but I would like to see more
studies done along those lines.

00:16:54.968 --> 00:16:58.031
And I know that there are --
if I could put a little plug here --

00:16:58.055 --> 00:16:59.651
there are people in this audience

00:16:59.675 --> 00:17:04.976
easily capable of financing a massive
research survey to settle the question,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.585
and I put the suggestion up,
for what it's worth.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.259
But let me know show you some data

00:17:09.283 --> 00:17:11.512
that have been properly
published and analyzed,

00:17:11.536 --> 00:17:15.528
on one special group --
namely, top scientists.

00:17:16.444 --> 00:17:21.976
In 1998, Larson and Witham
polled the cream of American scientists,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.691
those who'd been honored by election
to the National Academy of Sciences,

00:17:25.715 --> 00:17:28.346
and among this select group,

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:33.817
belief in a personal God dropped
to a shattering seven percent.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.747
About 20 percent are agnostic;
the rest could fairly be called atheists.

00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:42.976
Similar figures obtained
for belief in personal immortality.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.976
Among biological scientists,
the figure is even lower:

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.755
5.5 percent, only, believe in God.

00:17:49.779 --> 00:17:52.976
Physical scientists, it's 7.5 percent.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.976
I've not seen corresponding
figures for elite scholars

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.976
in other fields,
such as history or philosophy,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.174
but I'd be surprised
if they were different.

00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:05.714
So, we've reached a truly
remarkable situation,

00:18:05.738 --> 00:18:10.753
a grotesque mismatch
between the American intelligentsia

00:18:10.777 --> 00:18:12.546
and the American electorate.

00:18:13.364 --> 00:18:16.976
A philosophical opinion
about the nature of the universe,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.976
which is held by the vast majority
of top American scientists

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.856
and probably the majority
of the intelligentsia generally,

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.680
is so abhorrent to the American electorate

00:18:27.704 --> 00:18:32.608
that no candidate for popular election
dare affirm it in public.

00:18:33.077 --> 00:18:35.976
If I'm right, this means that high office

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.646
in the greatest country in the world

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.757
is barred to the very people
best qualified to hold it --

00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:43.976
the intelligentsia --

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.976
unless they are prepared
to lie about their beliefs.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.494
To put it bluntly:
American political opportunities

00:18:50.518 --> 00:18:52.976
are heavily loaded against those

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.785
who are simultaneously
intelligent and honest.

00:18:55.809 --> 00:18:57.015
(Laughter)

00:18:57.039 --> 00:19:03.350
(Applause)

00:19:03.374 --> 00:19:06.976
I'm not a citizen of this country,
so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.976
if I suggest that something
needs to be done.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.500
(Laughter)

00:19:12.524 --> 00:19:14.976
And I've already hinted
what that something is.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.757
From what I've seen of TED, I think this
may be the ideal place to launch it.

00:19:19.479 --> 00:19:21.630
Again, I fear it will cost money.

00:19:21.654 --> 00:19:24.201
We need a consciousness-raising,

00:19:24.225 --> 00:19:27.976
coming-out campaign for American atheists.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.976
(Laughter)

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.720
This could be similar to the campaign
organized by homosexuals

00:19:33.744 --> 00:19:34.976
a few years ago,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.333
although heaven forbid
that we should stoop to public outing

00:19:38.357 --> 00:19:39.976
of people against their will.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.976
In most cases, people who out themselves

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.976
will help to destroy the myth that
there is something wrong with atheists.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.153
On the contrary,

00:19:48.177 --> 00:19:51.247
they'll demonstrate that atheists
are often the kinds of people

00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:53.976
who could serve as decent
role models for your children,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.767
the kinds of people an advertising agent
could use to recommend a product,

00:19:58.791 --> 00:20:01.623
the kinds of people
who are sitting in this room.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.976
There should be a snowball effect,
a positive feedback,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.976
such that the more names
we have, the more we get.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.359
There could be non-linearities,
threshold effects.

00:20:12.383 --> 00:20:14.462
When a critical mass has been obtained,

00:20:14.486 --> 00:20:17.391
there's an abrupt
acceleration in recruitment.

00:20:17.415 --> 00:20:19.129
And again, it will need money.

00:20:20.494 --> 00:20:23.976
I suspect that the word "atheist" itself

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.467
contains or remains a stumbling block

00:20:27.491 --> 00:20:30.167
far out of proportion
to what it actually means,

00:20:30.191 --> 00:20:31.764
and a stumbling block to people

00:20:31.788 --> 00:20:34.845
who otherwise might be
happy to out themselves.

00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:37.594
So, what other words might
be used to smooth the path,

00:20:37.618 --> 00:20:40.166
oil the wheels, sugar the pill?

00:20:41.382 --> 00:20:44.380
Darwin himself preferred "agnostic" --

00:20:44.404 --> 00:20:47.508
and not only out of loyalty
to his friend Huxley,

00:20:47.532 --> 00:20:49.059
who coined the term.

00:20:49.733 --> 00:20:52.566
Darwin said, "I have never been an atheist

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.288
in the same sense of denying
the existence of a God.

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:57.976
I think that generally an 'agnostic'

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.108
would be the most correct
description of my state of mind."

00:21:01.846 --> 00:21:06.664
He even became uncharacteristically
tetchy with Edward Aveling.

00:21:07.259 --> 00:21:08.976
Aveling was a militant atheist

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.976
who failed to persuade Darwin

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.976
to accept the dedication
of his book on atheism --

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.690
incidentally, giving rise
to a fascinating myth

00:21:16.714 --> 00:21:20.111
that Karl Marx tried to dedicate
"Das Kapital" to Darwin,

00:21:20.135 --> 00:21:22.503
which he didn't, it was
actually Edward Aveling.

00:21:22.527 --> 00:21:26.976
What happened was that Aveling's
mistress was Marx's daughter,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.281
and when both Darwin and Marx were dead,

00:21:30.305 --> 00:21:34.519
Marx's papers became muddled
up with Aveling's papers,

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:38.850
and a letter from Darwin saying,
"My dear sir, thank you very much

00:21:38.874 --> 00:21:41.237
but I don't want you
to dedicate your book to me,"

00:21:41.261 --> 00:21:44.514
was mistakenly supposed
to be addressed to Marx,

00:21:44.538 --> 00:21:47.855
and that gave rise to this whole
myth, which you've probably heard.

00:21:47.879 --> 00:21:52.418
It's a sort of urban myth, that Marx
tried to dedicate "Kapital" to Darwin.

00:21:52.442 --> 00:21:58.809
Anyway, it was Aveling, and when
they met, Darwin challenged Aveling.

00:21:59.682 --> 00:22:03.521
"Why do you call yourselves atheists?"

00:22:07.148 --> 00:22:11.435
"'Agnostic, '" retorted Aveling, "was
simply 'atheist' writ respectable,

00:22:11.459 --> 00:22:15.268
and 'atheist' was simply
'agnostic' writ aggressive."

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:18.514
Darwin complained, "But why
should you be so aggressive?"

00:22:19.141 --> 00:22:22.737
Darwin thought that atheism might be
well and good for the intelligentsia,

00:22:22.761 --> 00:22:25.999
but that ordinary people were
not, quote, "ripe for it."

00:22:26.857 --> 00:22:30.261
Which is, of course, our old friend,
the "don't rock the boat" argument.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.976
It's not recorded whether Aveling told
Darwin to come down off his high horse.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.827
(Laughter)

00:22:37.851 --> 00:22:40.201
But in any case,
that was more than 100 years ago.

00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:42.613
You'd think we might have
grown up since then.

00:22:43.129 --> 00:22:48.393
Now, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew,

00:22:48.417 --> 00:22:52.542
who, incidentally, observes the Sabbath
for reasons of cultural solidarity,

00:22:52.566 --> 00:22:56.158
describes himself
as a "tooth-fairy agnostic."

00:22:57.066 --> 00:22:58.629
He won't call himself an atheist

00:22:58.653 --> 00:23:01.976
because it's, in principle,
impossible to prove a negative,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.976
but "agnostic" on its own might
suggest that God's existence

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.142
was therefore on equal terms
of likelihood as his non-existence.

00:23:10.166 --> 00:23:14.483
So, my friend is strictly
agnostic about the tooth fairy,

00:23:14.507 --> 00:23:17.500
but it isn't very likely, is it?

00:23:17.524 --> 00:23:18.976
Like God.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.007
Hence the phrase, "tooth-fairy agnostic."

00:23:21.329 --> 00:23:23.091
Bertrand Russell made the same point

00:23:23.115 --> 00:23:26.678
using a hypothetical teapot
in orbit about Mars.

00:23:27.138 --> 00:23:28.976
You would strictly have to be agnostic

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.429
about whether there is a teapot
in orbit about Mars,

00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:34.453
but that doesn't mean you treat
the likelihood of its existence

00:23:34.477 --> 00:23:37.281
as on all fours with its non-existence.

00:23:37.305 --> 00:23:40.610
The list of things which we strictly
have to be agnostic about

00:23:40.634 --> 00:23:43.976
doesn't stop at tooth fairies
and teapots; it's infinite.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.477
If you want to believe
one particular one of them --

00:23:46.501 --> 00:23:50.581
unicorns or tooth fairies
or teapots or Yahweh --

00:23:50.605 --> 00:23:52.976
the onus is on you to say why.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.358
The onus is not on the rest
of us to say why not.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.382
We, who are atheists,

00:23:58.406 --> 00:24:01.797
are also a-fairyists and a-teapotists.

00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:04.462
(Laughter)

00:24:04.486 --> 00:24:06.074
But we don't bother to say so.

00:24:06.843 --> 00:24:10.669
And this is why my friend
uses "tooth-fairy agnostic"

00:24:10.693 --> 00:24:13.268
as a label for what most people
would call atheist.

00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:19.098
Nonetheless, if we want to attract
deep-down atheists to come out publicly,

00:24:19.122 --> 00:24:22.211
we're going to have find
something better to stick on our banner

00:24:22.235 --> 00:24:24.733
than "tooth-fairy" or "teapot agnostic."

00:24:25.643 --> 00:24:27.175
So, how about "humanist"?

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.976
This has the advantage of a worldwide
network of well-organized associations

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.976
and journals and things already in place.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.948
My problem with it is only
its apparent anthropocentrism.

00:24:38.972 --> 00:24:40.978
One of the things
we've learned from Darwin

00:24:41.002 --> 00:24:43.478
is that the human species is only one

00:24:43.502 --> 00:24:47.306
among millions of cousins,
some close, some distant.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.863
And there are other possibilities,
like "naturalist,"

00:24:49.887 --> 00:24:52.322
but that also has problems of confusion,

00:24:52.346 --> 00:24:54.552
because Darwin would have
thought naturalist --

00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:57.711
"Naturalist" means, of course,
as opposed to "supernaturalist" --

00:24:57.735 --> 00:24:59.099
and it is used sometimes --

00:24:59.123 --> 00:25:02.517
Darwin would have been confused
by the other sense of "naturalist,"

00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:03.732
which he was, of course,

00:25:03.756 --> 00:25:08.748
and I suppose there might be others
who would confuse it with "nudism".

00:25:08.772 --> 00:25:09.990
(Laughter)

00:25:10.014 --> 00:25:16.912
Such people might be those
belonging to the British lynch mob,

00:25:16.936 --> 00:25:21.976
which last year attacked a pediatrician
in mistake for a pedophile.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.525
(Laughter)

00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:30.709
I think the best of the available
alternatives for "atheist"

00:25:30.733 --> 00:25:31.976
is simply "non-theist."

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
It lacks the strong connotation
that there's definitely no God,

00:25:35.024 --> 00:25:40.883
and it could therefore easily be embraced
by teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics.

00:25:40.907 --> 00:25:46.438
It's completely compatible
with the God of the physicists.

00:25:46.462 --> 00:25:52.976
When atheists like Stephen Hawking
and Albert Einstein use the word "God,"

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.713
they use it of course
as a metaphorical shorthand

00:25:56.737 --> 00:26:01.308
for that deep, mysterious part of physics
which we don't yet understand.

00:26:02.221 --> 00:26:07.237
"Non-theist" will do for all that,
yet unlike "atheist,"

00:26:07.261 --> 00:26:14.110
it doesn't have the same
phobic, hysterical responses.

00:26:14.558 --> 00:26:16.412
But I think, actually, the alternative

00:26:16.436 --> 00:26:19.285
is to grasp the nettle
of the word "atheism" itself,

00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:21.976
precisely because it is a taboo word,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.278
carrying frissons of hysterical phobia.

00:26:26.214 --> 00:26:29.646
Critical mass may be harder
to achieve with the word "atheist"

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.225
than with the word "non-theist,"

00:26:31.249 --> 00:26:33.209
or some other non-confrontational word.

00:26:33.685 --> 00:26:37.447
But if we did achieve it
with that dread word "atheist" itself,

00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:40.264
the political impact
would be even greater.

00:26:41.343 --> 00:26:44.748
Now, I said that if I were religious,
I'd be very afraid of evolution --

00:26:44.772 --> 00:26:48.406
I'd go further: I would fear science
in general, if properly understood.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.643
And this is because
the scientific worldview

00:26:51.667 --> 00:26:54.732
is so much more exciting, more poetic,

00:26:54.756 --> 00:26:57.233
more filled with sheer wonder

00:26:57.257 --> 00:27:02.293
than anything in the poverty-stricken
arsenals of the religious imagination.

00:27:04.237 --> 00:27:08.976
As Carl Sagan, another recently
dead hero, put it,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.566
"How is it that hardly any major
religion has looked at science

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.885
and concluded, 'This
is better than we thought!

00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:20.381
The universe is much bigger
than our prophet said,

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:23.612
grander, more subtle, more elegant'?

00:27:23.636 --> 00:27:25.976
Instead they say, 'No, no, no!

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.634
My god is a little god,
and I want him to stay that way.'

00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:33.309
A religion, old or new,

00:27:33.333 --> 00:27:35.976
that stressed the magnificence
of the universe

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.976
as revealed by modern science,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.664
might be able to draw forth
reserves of reverence and awe

00:27:41.688 --> 00:27:44.625
hardly tapped by the conventional faiths."

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.356
Now, this is an elite audience,

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.134
and I would therefore expect
about 10 percent of you to be religious.

00:27:55.904 --> 00:28:00.383
Many of you probably subscribe
to our polite cultural belief

00:28:00.407 --> 00:28:02.596
that we should respect religion.

00:28:03.303 --> 00:28:06.976
But I also suspect
that a fair number of those

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.357
secretly despise religion as much as I do.

00:28:10.769 --> 00:28:12.028
(Laughter)

00:28:12.052 --> 00:28:14.905
If you're one of them, and of course
many of you may not be,

00:28:14.929 --> 00:28:16.237
but if you are one of them,

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:18.329
I'm asking you to stop being polite,

00:28:18.353 --> 00:28:20.162
come out, and say so.

00:28:21.113 --> 00:28:23.112
And if you happen to be rich,

00:28:23.136 --> 00:28:26.718
give some thought to ways
in which you might make a difference.

00:28:27.369 --> 00:28:29.739
The religious lobby in this country

00:28:29.763 --> 00:28:35.293
is massively financed by foundations --
to say nothing of all the tax benefits --

00:28:35.317 --> 00:28:39.841
by foundations, such as the Templeton
Foundation and the Discovery Institute.

00:28:40.515 --> 00:28:44.182
We need an anti-Templeton to step forward.

00:28:45.793 --> 00:28:48.976
If my books sold as well
as Stephen Hawking's books,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.946
instead of only as well as
Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself.

00:28:56.454 --> 00:29:02.752
People are always going on about,
"How did September the 11th change you?"

00:29:03.871 --> 00:29:05.493
Well, here's how it changed me.

00:29:06.469 --> 00:29:10.134
Let's all stop being so damned respectful.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.976
Thank you very much.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
(Applause)
