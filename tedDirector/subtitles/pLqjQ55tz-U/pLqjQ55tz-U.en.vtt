00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
It feels like we're all suffering

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
from information overload or data glut.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and that's using our eyes more.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
So, visualizing information, so that we can see

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
the patterns and connections that matter

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and then designing that information so it makes more sense,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
or it tells a story,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
or allows us to focus only on the information that's important.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Failing that, visualized information can just look really cool.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
So, let's see.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
This is the $Billion Dollar o-Gram,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and this image arose

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
out of frustration I had

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
with the reporting of billion-dollar amounts in the press.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
That is, they're meaningless without context:

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
500 billion for this pipeline,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
20 billion for this war.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
It doesn't make any sense, so the only way to understand it

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
is visually and relatively.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
So I scraped a load of reported figures

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
from various news outlets

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And the colors here represent the motivation behind the money.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
So purple is "fighting,"

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and red is "giving money away," and green is "profiteering."

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And what you can see straight away

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
You can literally see them.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
But more importantly, you start to see

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
patterns and connections between numbers

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
that would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Let me point out some that I really like.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
This is OPEC's revenue, this green box here --

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
780 billion a year.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
And this little pixel in the corner -- three billion --

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
that's their climate change fund.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Americans, incredibly generous people --

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
over 300 billion a year, donated to charity every year,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
compared with the amount of foreign aid

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
given by the top 17 industrialized nations

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
at 120 billion.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Then of course,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
the Iraq War, predicted to cost just 60 billion

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
back in 2003.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
to 3,000 billion.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
So now it's great

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
because now we have this texture, and we can add numbers to it as well.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
So we could say, well, a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
by the debt that Africa owes to the West?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Let's take a look.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
So there it is:

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
227 billion is what Africa owes.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And the recent financial crisis,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
how much of this diagram might that figure take up?

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
What has that cost the world? Let's take a look at that.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Dooosh -- Which I think is the appropriate sound effect

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
for that much money:

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.260
11,900 billion.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
So, by visualizing this information,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
we turned it into a landscape

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
that you can explore with your eyes,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
a kind of map really, a sort of information map.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And when you're lost in information,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
an information map is kind of useful.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
So I want to show you another landscape now.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
We need to imagine what a landscape

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
of the world's fears might look like.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Let's take a look.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
This is Mountains Out of Molehills,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
a timeline of global media panic.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
(Laughter)

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
So, I'll label this for you in a second.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
But the height here, I want to point out,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
is the intensity of certain fears

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
as reported in the media.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Let me point them out.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.260
So this, swine flu -- pink.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Bird flu.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
SARS -- brownish here. Remember that one?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
The millennium bug,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
terrible disaster.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
These little green peaks

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
are asteroid collisions.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
(Laughter)

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And in summer, here, killer wasps.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.260
(Laughter)

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So these are what our fears look like

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
over time in our media.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
But what I love -- and I'm a journalist --

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and what I love is finding hidden patterns; I love being a data detective.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
that you can only see when you visualize it.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
Let me highlight it for you.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
See this line, this is a landscape for violent video games.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
As you can see, there's a kind of odd, regular pattern in the data,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
twin peaks every year.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
If we look closer, we see those peaks occur

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
at the same month every year.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Why?

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Well, November, Christmas video games come out,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
But April isn't a particularly massive month

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
for video games.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Why April?

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Well, in April 1999 was the Columbine shooting,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and since then, that fear

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
has been remembered by the media

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
You have retrospectives, anniversaries,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
court cases, even copy-cat shootings,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
all pushing that fear into the agenda.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
See that gap there? There's a gap,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and it affects all the other stories.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Why is there a gap there?

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
You see where it starts? September 2001,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
when we had something very real

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
to be scared about.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
So, I've been working as a data journalist for about a year,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and I keep hearing a phrase

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
all the time, which is this:

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
"Data is the new oil."

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and it's all around us, and it can be mined very easily.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
but I would, perhaps, adapt this metaphor slightly,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and I would say that data is the new soil.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Because for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Over the years, online,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
we've laid down

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
a huge amount of information and data,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
And, all right, I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
But it's a really fertile medium,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
they feel like flowers blooming from this medium.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
But if you look at it directly,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Let me show you this.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Can you guess what this data set is?

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
What rises twice a year,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
once in Easter

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
and then two weeks before Christmas,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
has a mini peak every Monday,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and then flattens out over the summer?

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
I'll take answers.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
(Audience: Chocolate.) David McCandless: Chocolate.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
You might want to get some chocolate in.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
Any other guesses?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
(Audience: Shopping.) DM: Shopping.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Yeah, retail therapy might help.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
(Audience: Sick leave.)

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
DM: Sick leave. Yeah, you'll definitely want to take some time off.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Shall we see?

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:01.260
(Laughter)

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
(Applause)

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
So, the information guru Lee Byron and myself,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
we scraped 10,000 status Facebook updates

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
for the phrase "break-up" and "broken-up"

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and this is the pattern we found --

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
people clearing out for Spring Break,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.260
(Laughter)

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
coming out of very bad weekends on a Monday,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
being single over the summer,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and then the lowest day of the year, of course: Christmas Day.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Who would do that?

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
So there's a titanic amount of data out there now,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
unprecedented.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
But if you ask the right kind of question,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
or you work it in the right kind of way,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
interesting things can emerge.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
So information is beautiful. Data is beautiful.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
I wonder if I could make my life beautiful.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And here's my visual C.V.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
I'm not quite sure I've succeeded.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Pretty blocky, the colors aren't that great.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
But I wanted to convey something to you.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
I started as a programmer,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
and then I worked as a writer for many years, about 20 years,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
in print, online and then in advertising,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and only recently have I started designing.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And I've never been to design school.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
I've never studied art or anything.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
I just kind of learned through doing.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And when I started designing,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
I discovered an odd thing about myself.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
I already knew how to design,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
but it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
but more like I was sensitive

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
to the ideas of grids and space

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and alignment and typography.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
It's almost like being exposed

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
to all this media over the years

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
And I don't feel like I'm unique.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
I feel that everyday, all of us now

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
are being blasted by information design.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
It's being poured into our eyes through the Web,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
and we're all visualizers now;

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
we're all demanding a visual aspect

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
to our information.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
There's something almost quite magical about visual information.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
It's effortless, it literally pours in.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
And if you're navigating a dense information jungle,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
coming across a beautiful graphic

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
or a lovely data visualization,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
it's a relief, it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
I was curious about this, so it led me

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
to the work of a Danish physicist

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
called Tor Norretranders,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
So here we go. This is your senses,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
pouring into your senses every second.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Your sense of sight is the fastest.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
It has the same bandwidth as a computer network.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
Then you have touch, which is about the speed of a USB key.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
And then you have hearing and smell,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
which has the throughput of a hard disk.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
And then you have poor old taste,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And that little square in the corner, a naught .7 percent,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
that's the amount we're actually aware of.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
So a lot of your vision --

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
the bulk of it is visual, and it's pouring in.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
It's unconscious.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
The eye is exquisitely sensitive

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
to patterns in variations in color, shape and pattern.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
It loves them, and it calls them beautiful.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
It's the language of the eye.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
If you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
which is about words and numbers and concepts,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
you start speaking two languages simultaneously,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
each enhancing the other.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
So, you have the eye, and then you drop in the concepts.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
And that whole thing -- it's two languages

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
both working at the same time.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
So we can use this new kind of language, if you like,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
to alter our perspective or change our views.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Let me ask you a simple question

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
with a really simple answer:

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
Who has the biggest military budget?

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
It's got to be America, right?

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Massive. 609 billion in 2008 --

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
607, rather.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
So massive, in fact, that it can contain

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
all the other military budgets in the world inside itself.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
Now, you can see Africa's total debt there

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and the U.K. budget deficit for reference.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
So that might well chime

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
with your view that America

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
is a sort of warmongering military machine,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
out to overpower the world

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
with its huge industrial-military complex.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
But is it true that America has the biggest military budget?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Because America is an incredibly rich country.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
In fact, it's so massively rich

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
that it can contain the four other

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
top industrialized nations' economies

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
inside itself, it's so vastly rich.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
So its military budget is bound to be enormous.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
So, to be fair and to alter our perspective,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
we have to bring in another data set,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
and that data set is GDP, or the country's earnings.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
Who has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Let's have a look.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
That changes the picture considerably.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
Other countries pop into view that you, perhaps, weren't considering,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
and American drops into eighth.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
Now you can also do this with soldiers.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Who has the most soldiers? It's got to be China.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Of course, 2.1 million.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Again, chiming with your view

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
that China has a militarized regime

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
ready to, you know, mobilize its enormous forces.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
But of course, China has an enormous population.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
So if we do the same,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
we see a radically different picture.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
China drops to 124th.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
It actually has a tiny army

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
when you take other data into consideration.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
So, absolute figures, like the military budget,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
in a connected world,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
don't give you the whole picture.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
They're not as true as they could be.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
We need relative figures that are connected to other data

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
so that we can see a fuller picture,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
and then that can lead to us changing our perspective.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
As Hans Rosling, the master,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
my master, said,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
"Let the dataset change your mindset."

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
And if it can do that, maybe it can also change your behavior.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Take a look at this one.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
I'm a bit of a health nut.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
I love taking supplements and being fit,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
but I can never understand what's going on in terms of evidence.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
There's always conflicting evidence.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
Should I take vitamin C? Should I be taking wheatgrass?

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
This is a visualization of all the evidence

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
for nutritional supplements.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
This kind of diagram is called a balloon race.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
So the higher up the image,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
the more evidence there is for each supplement.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
And the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
So you can immediately apprehend

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
the relationship between efficacy and popularity,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
but you can also, if you grade the evidence,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
do a "worth it" line.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
So supplements above this line are worth investigating,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
but only for the conditions listed below,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
and then the supplements below the line

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
are perhaps not worth investigating.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
Now this image constitutes a huge amount of work.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
We scraped like 1,000 studies from PubMed,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
the biomedical database,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
and we compiled them and graded them all.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
And it was incredibly frustrating for me

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
because I had a book of 250 visualizations to do for my book,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
and I spent a month doing this,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
and I only filled two pages.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
But what it points to

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
is that visualizing information like this

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
is a form of knowledge compression.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
It's a way of squeezing an enormous amount

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
of information and understanding

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
into a small space.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
And once you've curated that data, and once you've cleaned that data,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and once it's there,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
you can do cool stuff like this.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
So I converted this into an interactive app,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
so I can now generate this application online --

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
this is the visualization online --

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
and I can say, "Yeah, brilliant."

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
So it spawns itself.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And then I can say, "Well, just show me the stuff

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
that affects heart health."

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
So let's filter that out.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
So heart is filtered out, so I can see if I'm curious about that.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
I think, "No, no. I don't want to take any synthetics,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
I just want to see plants and --

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients."

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
Now this app is spawning itself

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
from the data.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
The data is all stored in a Google Doc,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
and it's literally generating itself from that data.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
So the data is now alive; this is a living image,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
and I can update it in a second.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
New evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Doosh! Again, the image recreates itself.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
So it's cool.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
It's kind of living.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
But it can go beyond data,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
and it can go beyond numbers.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
I like to apply information visualization

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
to ideas and concepts.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
This is a visualization

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
of the political spectrum,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
an attempt for me to try

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
and understand how it works

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
and how the ideas percolate down

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
from government into society and culture,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
into families, into individuals, into their beliefs

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
and back around again in a cycle.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
What I love about this image

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
is it's made up of concepts,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
it explores our worldviews

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
and it helps us -- it helps me anyway --

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
to see what others think,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
to see where they're coming from.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And it feels just incredibly cool to do that.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
What was most exciting for me

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
designing this

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
was that, when I was designing this image,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
I desperately wanted this side, the left side,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
to be better than the right side --

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
being a journalist, a Left-leaning person --

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
but I couldn't, because I would have created

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
a lopsided, biased diagram.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
So, in order to really create a full image,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
I had to honor the perspectives on the right-hand side

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
and at the same time, uncomfortably recognize

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
how many of those qualities were actually in me,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
which was very, very annoying and uncomfortable.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.260
(Laughter)

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
But not too uncomfortable,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
because there's something unthreatening

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
about seeing a political perspective,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
versus being told or forced to listen to one.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
You're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
joyously when you can see them.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
It's even fun to engage with them

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
because it's visual.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
So that's what's exciting to me,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
seeing how data can change my perspective

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
and change my mind midstream --

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
beautiful, lovely data.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
So, just to wrap up,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
I wanted to say

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
that it feels to me that design is about solving problems

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
and providing elegant solutions,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
and information design is about

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
solving information problems.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
It feels like we have a lot of information problems

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
in our society at the moment,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
from the overload and the saturation

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
to the breakdown of trust and reliability

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
or even just interestingness.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
I mean, I find information just too interesting.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
It has a magnetic quality that draws me in.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
So, visualizing information

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
Even when the information is terrible,

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
the visual can be quite beautiful.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
Often we can get clarity

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
or the answer to a simple question very quickly,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
like this one,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
the recent Icelandic volcano.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
Which was emitting the most CO2?

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
Was it the planes or the volcano,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
the grounded planes or the volcano?

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
So we can have a look.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
We look at the data and we see:

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
Yep, the volcano emitted 150,000 tons;

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
the grounded planes would have emitted

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
345,000 if they were in the sky.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
So essentially, we had our first carbon-neutral volcano.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
(Laughter)

00:17:51.260 --> 00:18:00.260
(Applause)

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.260
And that is beautiful. Thank you.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:11.260
(Applause)
