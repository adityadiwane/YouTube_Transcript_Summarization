00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
At the break, I was asked by several people

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
about my comments about the aging debate.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And this will be my only comment on it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And that is, I understand

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that optimists greatly outlive pessimists.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(Laughter)

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
to the first stages of beginning

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to write the code ourselves.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It's only 10 years ago this month

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
when we published the first sequence

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of a free-living organism,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that of haemophilus influenzae.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That took a genome project

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
from 13 years down to four months.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We can now do that same genome project

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in the order of

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
two to eight hours.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added:

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
most human pathogens,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a couple of plants,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
several insects and several mammals,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
including the human genome.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Genomics at this stage of the thinking

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
from a little over 10 years ago

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
was, by the end of this year, we might have

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
between three and five genomes sequenced;

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
it's on the order of several hundred.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to sequence 130 genomes this year,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
as a side project from environmental organisms.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But as we look, what's out there,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
we've barely scratched the surface

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
on what is available on this planet.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
whereas all animals only make up about

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
one one-thousandth of all the biomass.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
but if you ever make it to the sea,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and you swallow a mouthful of seawater,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
keep in mind that each milliliter

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
has about a million bacteria

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and on the order of 10 million viruses.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Less than 5,000 microbial species

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
have been characterized as of two years ago,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and so we decided to do something about it.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
We started in Bermuda for our test project,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
then moved up to Halifax,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
working down the U.S. East Coast,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and we're in the process now of working our way

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
across the Indian Ocean.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
in part to help excite young people

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
about going into science.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The experiments are incredibly simple.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We just take seawater and we filter it,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and we collect different size organisms on different filters,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
where we can sequence a hundred million letters

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
of the genetic code every 24 hours.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And with doing this,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
we've made some amazing discoveries.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
For example, it was thought that the visual pigments

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
in the environment that had these same pigments.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It turns out, almost every species

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
in the upper parts of the ocean

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
in warm parts of the world

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
have these same photoreceptors,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and use sunlight as the source of their energy

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and communication.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
From one site, from one barrel of seawater,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
we discovered 1.3 million new genes

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and as many as 50,000 new species.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
We've extended this to the air

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
all of us are breathing in and out every day,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
particularly on airplanes

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
or closed auditoriums.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
(Laughter)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We filter through some simple apparatuses;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
filtering on top of a building in New York City.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And we're in the process of sequencing all that

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
at the present time.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Just on the data collection side,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
just where we are through the Galapagos,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
we're finding that almost every 200 miles,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
we see tremendous diversity

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in the samples in the ocean.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Some of these make logical sense,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
in terms of different temperature gradients.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So this is a satellite photograph

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
based on temperatures -- red being warm,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
blue being cold --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and we found there's a tremendous difference between

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the warm water samples and the cold water samples,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
in terms of abundant species.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
The other thing that surprised us quite a bit

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And these vary tremendously from region to region.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Maybe not surprisingly,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
the photoreceptors tend to see blue light.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
When there's a lot of chlorophyll around,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
they see a lot of green light.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But they vary even more,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
in the extremes.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Just to try and get an assessment

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
of what our gene repertoire was,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
we assembled all the data --

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
including all of ours thus far from the expedition,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and it totaled around 29 million genes.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And we tried to put these into gene families

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to see what these discoveries are:

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Are we just discovering new members of known families,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
or are we discovering new families?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And it turns out we have about 50,000

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
major gene families,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
but every new sample we take in the environment

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
adds in a linear fashion to these new families.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So we're at the earliest stages of discovery

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
about basic genes,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
components and life on this planet.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Of those roughly 29 million genes,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
we only have around 24,000

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in our genome.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And if you take all animals together,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
we probably share less than 30,000

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and probably maybe a dozen

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
or more thousand different gene families.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I view that these genes are now

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
not only the design components of evolution.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And we think in a gene-centric view --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas --

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
than in a genome-centric view,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
which are different constructs of these gene components.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
has changed at sort of the same pace

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that DNA sequencing has

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
over the last decade or two,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and is getting very rapid and very cheap.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Our first thought about synthetic genomics came

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and that from mycoplasma genitalium.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And we have really nice T-shirts that say,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
you know, "I heart my genitalium."

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
This is actually just a microorganism.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But it has roughly 500 genes.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Haemophilus had 1,800 genes.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And we simply asked the question,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
if one species needs 800, another 500,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
is there a smaller set of genes

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that might comprise a minimal operating system?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So we started doing transposon mutagenesis.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
that randomly insert in the genetic code.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So we made a map of all the genes

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
that could take transposon insertions

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and we called those "non-essential genes."

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and you can only

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
define an essential or non-essential gene

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
based on exactly what's in the environment.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
with the genomes of 13 related organisms,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
common to all 13 organisms.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
one intracellular parasite;

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
it expanded even more

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
when we looked at core sets of genes

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
of around 310 or so.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
So we think that we can expand

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
to maybe 300 to 400 genes

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
from the minimal of 500.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The only way to prove these ideas

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
in large pieces was extremely difficult.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
developed an exciting new method

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
in only a two-week period

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that was 100 percent accurate,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
in terms of its sequence and its biology.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
that turned around and then killed the bacteria.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
This was not the first synthetic virus --

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
a polio virus had been made a year before --

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
but it was only one ten-thousandth as active

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and it took three years to do.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and that's the notions that we have with biology.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and a special committee the U.S. government has set up

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
to review this area.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And I think it's important to keep reality in mind,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
versus what happens with people's imaginations.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today --

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that genome can be made.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
but the DNA from this organism is not infective.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So even if somebody made the smallpox genome,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
that DNA itself would not cause infections.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
The real concern that security departments have

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
is designer viruses.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that had major efforts

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
on trying to create biological warfare agents.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
If that research is truly discontinued,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
there should be very little activity

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And possibly eukaryotic cells,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
those that we have,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
are possible within a decade.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So we're now making several dozen different constructs,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
because we can vary the cassettes and the genes

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
that go into this artificial chromosome.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
The key is, how do you put all of the others?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
We start with these fragments,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and then we have a homologous recombination system

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
that reassembles those into a chromosome.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
This is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
in about 12 to 24 hours,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
after its chromosomes are literally blown apart.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
This organism is ubiquitous on the planet,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and exists perhaps now

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
in outer space due to all our travel there.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
This is a glass beaker after

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
about half a million rads of radiation.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
The glass started to burn and crack,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
while the microbes sitting in the bottom

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
just got happier and happier.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Here's an actual picture of what happens:

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
the top of this shows the genome

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
after 1.7 million rads of radiation.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
The chromosome is literally blown apart.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
24 hours later.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and we probably have thousands,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
if not tens of thousands, of different species

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
on this planet that are capable of doing that.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
After these genomes are synthesized,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
the first step is just transplanting them

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
into a cell without a genome.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
not only for understanding the basis of biology

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
but for hopefully environmental and society issues.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
For example, from the third organism we sequenced,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures;

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
its energy source is hydrogen

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So we know lots of different pathways,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
thousands of different organisms now

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
that live off of CO2,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and can capture that back.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So instead of using carbon from oil

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
for synthetic processes,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
we have the chance of using carbon

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and capturing it back from the atmosphere,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
converting that into biopolymers

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
or other products.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and we use as a reducing power

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Also, there's numerous pathways

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
that can be engineered metabolizing methane.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
to capture and convert the methane

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
from the gas fields there into useful products.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
called "Combinatorial Genomics,"

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
because with these new synthesis capabilities,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
these vast gene array repertoires

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and the homologous recombination,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
we think we can design a robot to make

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
maybe a million different chromosomes a day.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And therefore, as with all biology,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
you get selection through screening,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
whether you're screening for hydrogen production,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
or chemical production, or just viability.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
To understand the role of these genes

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
is going to be well within reach.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
We're trying to modify photosynthesis

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that we think will totally change this process.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
We're also combining cellulases,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and fermentation in the same cell

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
for producing ethanol.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Pharmaceutical production is already under way

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
in major laboratories

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
using microbes.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
The chemistry from compounds in the environment

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
is orders of magnitude more complex

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
than our best chemists can produce.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I think future engineered species

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
could be the source of food,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
hopefully a source of energy,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
environmental remediation

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and perhaps

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
replacing the petrochemical industry.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Let me just close with ethical and policy studies.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
as to whether we should try and make an artificial species.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Every major religion participated in this.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
It was actually a very strange study,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
were biological warfare aspects of this,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
for the reasons we were doing them.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
a multi-institutional study on this,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
to work out what the risk and benefits to society are,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and the rules that scientific teams such as my own

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
should be using in this area,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
These are complex issues.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Except for the threat of bio-terrorism,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
they're very simple issues in terms of,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
can we design things to produce clean energy,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
perhaps revolutionizing

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
what developing countries can do

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
and provide through various simple processes.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Thank you very much.
