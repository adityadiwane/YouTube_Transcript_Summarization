00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:14.478
When you're a child,

00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:18.077
anything and everything is possible.

00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:22.186
The challenge, so often,
is hanging on to that as we grow up.

00:00:22.596 --> 00:00:24.181
And as a four-year-old,

00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:26.841
I had the opportunity
to sail for the first time.

00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:31.878
I will never forget
the excitement as we closed the coast.

00:00:31.878 --> 00:00:33.643
I will never forget

00:00:33.643 --> 00:00:36.638
the feeling of adventure
as I climbed on board the boat

00:00:36.638 --> 00:00:40.280
and stared into her tiny cabin
for the first time.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.488
But the most amazing feeling
was the feeling of freedom,

00:00:43.488 --> 00:00:47.226
the feeling that I felt
when we hoisted her sails.

00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:49.600
As a four-year-old child,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.449
it was the greatest sense of freedom
that I could ever imagine.

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.792
I made my mind up there and then
that one day, somehow,

00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:59.850
I was going to sail around the world.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.360
So I did what I could in my life
to get closer to that dream.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.426
Age 10, it was saving my school
dinner money change.

00:01:07.426 --> 00:01:11.344
Every single day for eight years,
I had mashed potato and baked beans,

00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:13.997
which cost 4p each, and gravy was free.

00:01:13.997 --> 00:01:17.014
Every day I would pile up the change
on the top of my money box,

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:19.604
and when that pile reached a pound,
I would drop it in

00:01:19.604 --> 00:01:24.167
and cross off one of the 100 squares
I'd drawn on a piece of paper.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:27.418
Finally, I bought a tiny dinghy.

00:01:27.418 --> 00:01:31.381
I spent hours sitting on it in the garden
dreaming of my goal.

00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:34.500
I read every book I could on sailing,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.495
and then eventually,
having been told by my school

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:39.771
I wasn't clever enough to be a vet,

00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:44.454
left school age 17 to begin
my apprenticeship in sailing.

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:48.830
So imagine how it felt
just four years later

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.506
to be sitting in a boardroom

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:54.515
in front of someone who I knew
could make that dream come true.

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:58.003
I felt like my life
depended on that moment,

00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:00.644
and incredibly, he said yes.

00:02:00.644 --> 00:02:04.754
And I could barely contain my excitement
as I sat in that first design meeting

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:07.564
designing a boat
on which I was going to sail

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:10.443
solo nonstop around the world.

00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:13.299
From that first meeting
to the finish line of the race,

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.597
it was everything I'd ever imagined.

00:02:15.597 --> 00:02:19.498
Just like in my dreams, there were
amazing parts and tough parts.

00:02:19.498 --> 00:02:21.658
We missed an iceberg by 20 feet.

00:02:21.658 --> 00:02:24.931
Nine times, I climbed to the top
of her 90-foot mast.

00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:27.300
We were blown on our side
in the Southern Ocean.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.272
But the sunsets, the wildlife,
and the remoteness

00:02:30.272 --> 00:02:33.597
were absolutely breathtaking.

00:02:33.857 --> 00:02:36.504
After three months at sea, age just 24,

00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:38.799
I finished in second position.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.750
I'd loved it, so much so
that within six months

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.326
I decided to go around the world again,
but this time not in a race:

00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:52.214
to try to be the fastest person ever
to sail solo nonstop around the world.

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.650
Now for this, I needed a different craft:

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.244
bigger, wider, faster, more powerful.

00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:02.959
Just to give that boat some scale,
I could climb inside her mast

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.863
all the way to the top.

00:03:04.863 --> 00:03:07.973
Seventy-five foot long, 60 foot wide.

00:03:08.253 --> 00:03:10.372
I affectionately called her Moby.

00:03:10.552 --> 00:03:12.131
She was a multihull.

00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.892
When we built her, no one had ever
made it solo nonstop

00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:18.191
around the world in one,
though many had tried,

00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:23.063
but whilst we built her, a Frenchman
took a boat 25 percent bigger than her

00:03:23.063 --> 00:03:26.852
and not only did he make it,
but he took the record from 93 days

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:29.348
right down to 72.

00:03:29.568 --> 00:03:32.155
The bar was now much, much higher.

00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:34.105
And these boats were exciting to sail.

00:03:34.105 --> 00:03:37.472
This was a training sail
off the French coast.

00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:41.187
This I know well because I was one
of the five crew members on board.

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:45.538
Five seconds is all it took
from everything being fine

00:03:45.538 --> 00:03:48.617
to our world going black
as the windows were thrust underwater,

00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:50.776
and that five seconds goes quickly.

00:03:50.776 --> 00:03:53.679
Just see how far below
those guys the sea is.

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:57.792
Imagine that alone
in the Southern Ocean

00:03:57.792 --> 00:04:01.950
plunged into icy water,
thousands of miles away from land.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.560
It was Christmas Day.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.933
I was forging into the Southern Ocean
underneath Australia.

00:04:08.933 --> 00:04:11.550
The conditions were horrendous.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.531
I was approaching a part in the ocean

00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:17.432
which was 2,000 miles away
from the nearest town.

00:04:17.432 --> 00:04:20.311
The nearest land was Antarctica,
and the nearest people

00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:23.180
would be those manning
the European Space Station above me.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.560
(Laughter)

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.369
You really are in the middle of nowhere.

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:29.180
If you need help,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.736
and you're still alive,

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:33.731
it takes four days
for a ship to get to you

00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:37.145
and then four days for that ship
to get you back to port.

00:04:37.145 --> 00:04:39.466
No helicopter can reach you out there,

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:41.310
and no plane can land.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.584
We are forging ahead of a huge storm.

00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:47.370
Within it, there was 80 knots of wind,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.296
which was far too much wind
for the boat and I to cope with.

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:53.337
The waves were already 40 to 50 feet high,

00:04:53.337 --> 00:04:55.427
and the spray from the breaking crests

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:58.492
was blown horizontally
like snow in a blizzard.

00:04:58.492 --> 00:05:02.370
If we didn't sail fast enough,
we'd be engulfed by that storm,

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.527
and either capsized or smashed to pieces.

00:05:05.527 --> 00:05:08.314
We were quite literally
hanging on for our lives

00:05:08.314 --> 00:05:11.518
and doing so on a knife edge.

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:15.351
The speed I so desperately needed
brought with it danger.

00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:19.575
We all know what it's like driving a car
20 miles an hour, 30, 40.

00:05:19.575 --> 00:05:22.454
It's not too stressful.
We can concentrate.

00:05:22.454 --> 00:05:24.242
We can turn on the radio.

00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:28.700
Take that 50, 60, 70, accelerate through
to 80, 90, 100 miles an hour.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.974
Now you have white knuckles
and you're gripping the steering wheel.

00:05:31.974 --> 00:05:34.537
Now take that car off road at night

00:05:34.537 --> 00:05:36.873
and remove the windscreen wipers,
the windscreen,

00:05:36.873 --> 00:05:38.498
the headlights and the brakes.

00:05:38.498 --> 00:05:40.704
That's what it's like
in the Southern Ocean.

00:05:40.704 --> 00:05:44.192
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:46.041
You could imagine

00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:48.831
it would be quite difficult
to sleep in that situation,

00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:50.511
even as a passenger.

00:05:50.781 --> 00:05:52.306
But you're not a passenger.

00:05:52.306 --> 00:05:54.705
You're alone on a boat
you can barely stand up in,

00:05:54.705 --> 00:05:57.213
and you have to make
every single decision on board.

00:05:57.213 --> 00:06:00.487
I was absolutely exhausted,
physically and mentally.

00:06:00.487 --> 00:06:02.600
Eight sail changes in 12 hours.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.130
The mainsail weighed
three times my body weight,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.827
and after each change,

00:06:06.827 --> 00:06:09.124
I would collapse on the floor
soaked with sweat

00:06:09.124 --> 00:06:13.721
with this freezing Southern Ocean air
burning the back of my throat.

00:06:13.721 --> 00:06:16.276
But out there, those lowest of the lows

00:06:16.276 --> 00:06:19.596
are so often contrasted
with the highest of the highs.

00:06:19.596 --> 00:06:23.659
A few days later, we came out
of the back of the low.

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.397
Against all odds, we'd been able
to drive ahead of the record

00:06:27.397 --> 00:06:29.464
within that depression.

00:06:29.464 --> 00:06:32.250
The sky cleared, the rain stopped,

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.569
and our heartbeat, the monstrous
seas around us were transformed

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.168
into the most beautiful moonlit mountains.

00:06:40.168 --> 00:06:44.765
It's hard to explain, but you enter
a different mode when you head out there.

00:06:44.765 --> 00:06:46.750
Your boat is your entire world,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.595
and what you take with you
when you leave is all you have.

00:06:49.595 --> 00:06:52.612
If I said to you all now,
"Go off into Vancouver

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:56.348
and find everything you will need for
your survival for the next three months,"

00:06:56.348 --> 00:06:58.116
that's quite a task.

00:06:58.116 --> 00:07:00.554
That's food, fuel, clothes,

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:02.969
even toilet roll and toothpaste.

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:04.432
That's what we do,

00:07:04.432 --> 00:07:06.336
and when we leave we manage it

00:07:06.336 --> 00:07:10.000
down to the last drop of diesel
and the last packet of food.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.833
No experience in my life

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:15.740
could have given me a better understanding
of the definition of the word "finite."

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.852
What we have out there is all we have.

00:07:17.852 --> 00:07:19.571
There is no more.

00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:22.891
And never in my life had I ever
translated that definition of finite

00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:26.211
that I'd felt on board
to anything outside of sailing

00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:30.809
until I stepped off the boat at
the finish line having broken that record.

00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:33.955
(Applause)

00:07:36.265 --> 00:07:38.935
Suddenly I connected the dots.

00:07:38.935 --> 00:07:41.164
Our global economy is no different.

00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:44.276
It's entirely dependent
on finite materials

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:46.864
we only have once
in the history of humanity.

00:07:46.864 --> 00:07:50.638
And it was a bit like seeing something
you weren't expecting under a stone

00:07:50.638 --> 00:07:52.147
and having two choices:

00:07:52.147 --> 00:07:54.701
I either put that stone to one side

00:07:54.701 --> 00:07:58.114
and learn more about it,
or I put that stone back

00:07:58.114 --> 00:08:01.876
and I carry on with my dream job
of sailing around the world.

00:08:02.526 --> 00:08:04.128
I chose the first.

00:08:04.128 --> 00:08:07.611
I put it to one side and I began
a new journey of learning,

00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:11.117
speaking to chief executives,
experts, scientists, economists

00:08:11.117 --> 00:08:14.739
to try to understand just how
our global economy works.

00:08:14.739 --> 00:08:18.431
And my curiosity took me
to some extraordinary places.

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:21.983
This photo was taken in the burner
of a coal-fired power station.

00:08:23.183 --> 00:08:26.317
I was fascinated by coal,
fundamental to our global energy needs,

00:08:26.317 --> 00:08:29.274
but also very close to my family.

00:08:29.274 --> 00:08:31.280
My great-grandfather was a coal miner,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.600
and he spent 50 years
of his life underground.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.315
This is a photo of him,
and when you see that photo,

00:08:38.315 --> 00:08:40.480
you see someone from another era.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.818
No one wears trousers
with a waistband quite that high

00:08:43.818 --> 00:08:46.303
in this day and age. (Laughter)

00:08:46.303 --> 00:08:48.973
But yet, that's me
with my great-grandfather,

00:08:48.973 --> 00:08:53.106
and by the way, they are not
his real ears. (Laughter)

00:08:53.106 --> 00:08:57.564
We were close. I remember sitting on
his knee listening to his mining stories.

00:08:57.564 --> 00:08:59.816
He talked of the camaraderie underground,

00:08:59.816 --> 00:09:03.253
and the fact that the miners used to save
the crusts of their sandwiches

00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:06.341
to give to the ponies
they worked with underground.

00:09:06.341 --> 00:09:08.732
It was like it was yesterday.

00:09:08.732 --> 00:09:10.520
And on my journey of learning,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.842
I went to the World
Coal Association website,

00:09:12.842 --> 00:09:15.164
and there in the middle
of the homepage, it said,

00:09:15.164 --> 00:09:18.322
"We have about 118 years of coal left."

00:09:18.322 --> 00:09:21.456
And I thought to myself, well,
that's well outside my lifetime,

00:09:21.456 --> 00:09:24.335
and a much greater figure
than the predictions for oil.

00:09:24.335 --> 00:09:27.400
But I did the math, and I realized
that my great-grandfather

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.974
had been born exactly 118 years
before that year,

00:09:31.974 --> 00:09:34.737
and I sat on his knee
until I was 11 years old,

00:09:34.737 --> 00:09:36.641
and I realized it's nothing

00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:38.963
in time, nor in history.

00:09:38.963 --> 00:09:42.121
And it made me make a decision
I never thought I would make:

00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:44.466
to leave the sport
of solo sailing behind me

00:09:44.466 --> 00:09:47.531
and focus on the greatest challenge
I'd ever come across:

00:09:47.531 --> 00:09:49.861
the future of our global economy.

00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:52.570
And I quickly realized it wasn't
just about energy.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.613
It was also materials.

00:09:54.613 --> 00:09:56.772
In 2008, I picked up a scientific study

00:09:56.772 --> 00:09:58.816
looking at how many years we have

00:09:58.816 --> 00:10:01.532
of valuable materials
to extract from the ground:

00:10:01.532 --> 00:10:05.921
copper, 61; tin, zinc, 40; silver, 29.

00:10:05.921 --> 00:10:09.937
These figures couldn't be exact,
but we knew those materials were finite.

00:10:09.937 --> 00:10:11.674
We only have them once.

00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:15.208
And yet, our speed that we've used
these materials has increased rapidly,

00:10:15.208 --> 00:10:16.950
exponentially.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.806
With more people in the world
with more stuff,

00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:22.580
we've effectively seen
100 years of price declines

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.425
in those basic commodities
erased in just 10 years.

00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:27.212
And this affects all of us.

00:10:27.212 --> 00:10:29.232
It's brought huge volatility in prices,

00:10:29.232 --> 00:10:32.081
so much so that in 2011,

00:10:32.081 --> 00:10:34.619
your average European car manufacturer

00:10:34.619 --> 00:10:37.173
saw a raw material price increase

00:10:37.173 --> 00:10:39.379
of 500 million Euros,

00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:41.701
wiping away half their operating profits

00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:45.260
through something they have
absolutely no control over.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.390
And the more I learned, the more
I started to change my own life.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.849
I started traveling less,
doing less, using less.

00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:54.390
It felt like actually doing less
was what we had to do.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.740
But it sat uneasy with me.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.862
It didn't feel right.

00:10:57.862 --> 00:11:00.358
It felt like we were
buying ourselves time.

00:11:00.358 --> 00:11:02.250
We were eking things out a bit longer.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.477
Even if everybody changed,
it wouldn't solve the problem.

00:11:05.477 --> 00:11:07.521
It wouldn't fix the system.

00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:10.562
It was vital in the transition,
but what fascinated me was,

00:11:10.562 --> 00:11:14.951
in the transition to what?
What could actually work?

00:11:14.951 --> 00:11:19.246
It struck me that the system itself,
the framework within which we live,

00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:21.545
is fundamentally flawed,

00:11:21.545 --> 00:11:24.804
and I realized ultimately

00:11:24.804 --> 00:11:27.837
that our operating system,
the way our economy functions,

00:11:27.837 --> 00:11:31.320
the way our economy's been built,
is a system in itself.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.222
At sea, I had to understand
complex systems.

00:11:34.222 --> 00:11:36.100
I had to take multiple inputs,

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.612
I had to process them,

00:11:37.612 --> 00:11:40.500
and I had to understand the system to win.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.233
I had to make sense of it.

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:46.296
And as I looked at our global economy,
I realized it too is that system,

00:11:46.296 --> 00:11:50.708
but it's a system that effectively
can't run in the long term.

00:11:50.708 --> 00:11:54.469
And I realized we've been perfecting
what's effectively a linear economy

00:11:54.469 --> 00:11:56.339
for 150 years,

00:11:56.339 --> 00:11:58.370
where we take a material
out of the ground,

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.878
we make something out of it,
and then ultimately

00:12:00.878 --> 00:12:04.152
that product gets thrown away,
and yes, we do recycle some of it,

00:12:04.152 --> 00:12:07.147
but more an attempt to get out
what we can at the end,

00:12:07.147 --> 00:12:09.353
not by design.

00:12:09.353 --> 00:12:12.557
It's an economy that fundamentally
can't run in the long term,

00:12:12.557 --> 00:12:15.590
and if we know that we
have finite materials,

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.919
why would we build an economy
that would effectively use things up,

00:12:18.919 --> 00:12:20.777
that would create waste?

00:12:20.777 --> 00:12:23.702
Life itself has existed
for billions of years

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:27.324
and has continually adapted
to use materials effectively.

00:12:27.324 --> 00:12:30.645
It's a complex system,
but within it, there is no waste.

00:12:30.645 --> 00:12:32.874
Everything is metabolized.

00:12:33.244 --> 00:12:36.783
It's not a linear economy
at all, but circular.

00:12:37.934 --> 00:12:40.931
And I felt like the child in the garden.

00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:45.598
For the first time on this new journey,
I could see exactly where we were headed.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:49.382
If we could build an economy that would
use things rather than use them up,

00:12:49.382 --> 00:12:52.610
we could build a future that really
could work in the long term.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.514
I was excited.

00:12:54.514 --> 00:12:56.673
This was something to work towards.

00:12:56.673 --> 00:13:00.450
We knew exactly where we were headed.
We just had to work out how to get there,

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.380
and it was exactly with this in mind

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.095
that we created the Ellen MacArthur
Foundation in September 2010.

00:13:07.485 --> 00:13:11.348
Many schools of thought fed our thinking
and pointed to this model:

00:13:11.348 --> 00:13:15.968
industrial symbiosis, performance economy,
sharing economy, biomimicry,

00:13:15.968 --> 00:13:18.724
and of course, cradle-to-cradle design.

00:13:18.894 --> 00:13:22.579
Materials would be defined
as either technical or biological,

00:13:22.579 --> 00:13:25.600
waste would be designed out entirely,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.112
and we would have a system
that could function

00:13:28.112 --> 00:13:30.294
absolutely in the long term.

00:13:30.294 --> 00:13:32.361
So what could this economy look like?

00:13:33.151 --> 00:13:37.089
Maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings,
but we'd pay for the service of light,

00:13:37.089 --> 00:13:39.532
and the manufacturers
would recover the materials

00:13:39.532 --> 00:13:42.693
and change the light fittings
when we had more efficient products.

00:13:42.693 --> 00:13:45.990
What if packaging was so nontoxic
it could dissolve in water

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.102
and we could ultimately drink it?
It would never become waste.

00:13:49.102 --> 00:13:51.215
What if engines were re-manufacturable,

00:13:51.215 --> 00:13:53.490
and we could recover
the component materials

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.720
and significantly reduce energy demand.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.160
What if we could recover components
from circuit boards, reutilize them,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.823
and then fundamentally recover
the materials within them

00:14:01.823 --> 00:14:03.225
through a second stage?

00:14:03.225 --> 00:14:05.517
What if we could collect
food waste, human waste?

00:14:05.517 --> 00:14:08.698
What if we could turn that
into fertilizer, heat, energy,

00:14:08.698 --> 00:14:11.694
ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems

00:14:11.694 --> 00:14:14.805
and rebuilding natural capital?

00:14:14.805 --> 00:14:17.707
And cars -- what we want
is to move around.

00:14:17.707 --> 00:14:20.350
We don't need to own
the materials within them.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.989
Could cars become a service

00:14:21.989 --> 00:14:24.543
and provide us with
mobility in the future?

00:14:25.033 --> 00:14:29.230
All of this sounds amazing, but these
aren't just ideas, they're real today,

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.950
and these lie at the forefront
of the circular economy.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.454
What lies before us is to expand them
and scale them up.

00:14:36.454 --> 00:14:39.429
So how would you shift
from linear to circular?

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:43.195
Well, the team and I at the foundation
thought you might want to work

00:14:43.195 --> 00:14:45.069
with the top universities in the world,

00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:47.089
with leading businesses within the world,

00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:49.437
with the biggest convening
platforms in the world,

00:14:49.437 --> 00:14:50.439
and with governments.

00:14:50.439 --> 00:14:53.059
We thought you might want
to work with the best analysts

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.313
and ask them the question,

00:14:54.313 --> 00:14:57.514
"Can the circular economy decouple
growth from resource constraints?

00:14:57.514 --> 00:15:01.136
Is the circular economy able
to rebuild natural capital?

00:15:01.136 --> 00:15:04.781
Could the circular economy
replace current chemical fertilizer use?"

00:15:04.781 --> 00:15:07.127
Yes was the answer to the decoupling,

00:15:07.127 --> 00:15:10.145
but also yes, we could replace
current fertilizer use

00:15:10.145 --> 00:15:13.930
by a staggering 2.7 times.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.250
But what inspired me most
about the circular economy

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.239
was its ability to inspire young people.

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:23.914
When young people see the economy
through a circular lens,

00:15:23.914 --> 00:15:28.450
they see brand new opportunities
on exactly the same horizon.

00:15:28.488 --> 00:15:31.093
They can use their creativity
and knowledge

00:15:31.093 --> 00:15:33.480
to rebuild the entire system,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.593
and it's there for the taking right now,

00:15:35.593 --> 00:15:38.049
and the faster we do this, the better.

00:15:38.049 --> 00:15:41.119
So could we achieve this
in their lifetimes?

00:15:41.119 --> 00:15:43.255
Is it actually possible?

00:15:43.255 --> 00:15:44.765
I believe yes.

00:15:45.105 --> 00:15:48.944
When you look at the lifetime of
my great-grandfather, anything's possible.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:53.310
When he was born, there were only
25 cars in the world;

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.740
they had only just been invented.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.671
When he was 14, we flew
for the first time in history.

00:15:59.671 --> 00:16:02.160
Now there are 100,000 charter flights

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.106
every single day.

00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:08.100
When he was 45, we built
the first computer.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.257
Many said it wouldn't catch on,
but it did, and just 20 years later

00:16:11.257 --> 00:16:13.278
we turned it into a microchip

00:16:13.278 --> 00:16:17.480
of which there will be thousands
in this room here today.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.359
Ten years before he died,
we built the first mobile phone.

00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:22.333
It wasn't that mobile, to be fair,

00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:24.307
but now it really is,

00:16:24.307 --> 00:16:28.277
and as my great-grandfather
left this Earth, the Internet arrived.

00:16:28.277 --> 00:16:30.390
Now we can do anything,

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.670
but more importantly,

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.985
now we have a plan.

00:16:33.985 --> 00:16:35.990
Thank you.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:45.281
(Applause)
