00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
It's pretty simple. There are nine, sort of, rules

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.160
that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.160
Most of them are pretty basic.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
Number one: don't let go --

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
very sure success method.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
But really, truly -- often you think about

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
letting go way before your body does.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
So hang in there,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
Number two: hesitation is bad.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
This is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
in the Yosemite high country.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
Friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
The most friction you have is when you first put your hand

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
or your foot on the rock.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.160
And then from that point on, you're basically falling.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
So momentum is good. Don't stop.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
Rule number three: have a plan.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
This is a climb called the Naked Edge,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
in El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
This climber is on the last pitch of it.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
He's actually right about where I fell.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
There is about 1,000 feet of air below him.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
And all the hard pitches are actually below him.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
Often what happens is

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
you're planning so hard for like,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
"How do I get through the hardest part? How do I get through the hardest part?"

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
And then what happens?

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
You get to the last pitch. It's easy.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
And you're completely flamed out. Don't do it.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
You have to plan ahead to get to the top.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
But you also can't forget that each individual move

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
you have to be able to complete.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
This is a climb called the Dike Route,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
But if you're the leader on it,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160
at the hardest move, you're looking at about 100 foot fall,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
onto some low angle slabs.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
So you've got to focus.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
You don't want to stop in the middle like

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
Coleridge's Kubla Kahn.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
You've got to keep going.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
Rule number five: know how to rest.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
It's amazing. The best climbers

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
are the ones that in the most extreme situations

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
can get their bodies into some position

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
where they can rest,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
regroup, calm themselves, focus,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.160
and keep going.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
This is a climb in the Needles, again in California.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Fear really sucks because what it means is

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
you're not focusing on what you're doing.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
You're focusing on the consequences of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
failing at what you're doing

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
because any given move should require

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.160
all your concentration and thought processes

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
to execute it effectively.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
One of the things in climbing is, most people

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.160
sort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
which is a columnar basalt formation

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
that most of you probably know from "Close Encounters."

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
With this, typically crack climbers

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
would put their hands in and their toes in

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
and just start climbing.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
The cracks are too small to get your toes into

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
so the only way to climb is using your fingertips

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
in the cracks,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
and using opposing pressure

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
and forcing yourself up.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
Rule number eight: strength doesn't always equal success.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
In the 35 years I've been a climbing guide

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
and taught on indoor walls, and stuff like that,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
the most important thing I've learned

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
was, guys will always try to do pull-ups.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Beginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
they get 15 feet up --

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
and they can do about 15 pull-ups right --

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
And then they just flame out.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
Women are much more in balance

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
because they don't have that idea

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
They think about how to get the weight over their feet

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
So balance is really critical,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
and keeping your weight on your feet,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
which is your strongest muscle.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
And of course there is rule number nine.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
I came up with rule number nine after

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
I actually didn't plan for a fall,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
because that is the critical piece

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
of not getting hurt --

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160
how you're going to fall onto the rope,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
or if you're climbing without a rope,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.160
fall to a place where you can actually control the fall.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
So don't hang on till the bitter end.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
Thank you very much.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
(Applause)
