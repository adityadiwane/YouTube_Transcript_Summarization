00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:13.037
Is E.T. out there?

00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:16.016
Well, I work at the SETI Institute.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.251
That's almost my name. SETI:

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.658
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:21.277
In other words, I look for aliens,

00:00:21.277 --> 00:00:24.945
and when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:27.706
look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face.

00:00:27.706 --> 00:00:30.039
I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.799
Now, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic,

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.049
ridiculous, maybe even hopeless,

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:38.754
but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think

00:00:38.754 --> 00:00:42.568
that the job I have is actually a privilege, okay,

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:44.666
and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.021
this line of work, if that's what you call it.

00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:50.029
This thing — whoops, can we go back?

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:52.728
Hello, come in, Earth.

00:00:52.728 --> 00:00:54.079
There we go. All right.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.072
This is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory

00:00:56.072 --> 00:00:59.508
behind the Sierra Nevadas, and in 1968,

00:00:59.508 --> 00:01:02.417
I was working there collecting data for my thesis.

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:05.758
Now, it's kinda lonely, it's kinda tedious, just collecting data,

00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:08.291
so I would amuse myself by taking photos at night

00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:11.052
of the telescopes or even of myself,

00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:16.286
because, you know, at night, I would be the only hominid

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:18.034
within about 30 miles.

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:20.043
So here are pictures of myself.

00:01:20.043 --> 00:01:23.631
The observatory had just acquired a new book,

00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:25.381
written by a Russian cosmologist

00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:28.999
by the name of Joseph Shklovsky, and then expanded

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:31.452
and translated and edited by a little-known

00:01:31.452 --> 00:01:34.061
Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan.

00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:36.058
And I remember reading that book,

00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:38.066
and at 3 in the morning I was reading this book

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.759
and it was explaining how the antennas I was using

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.706
to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:48.018
to communicate, to send bits of information

00:01:48.018 --> 00:01:50.610
from one star system to another.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.078
Now, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone,

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:55.009
haven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea,

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.898
but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact

00:01:58.898 --> 00:02:00.382
prove that there's somebody out there

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:03.098
just using this same technology --

00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:05.328
that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:07.301
at the SETI Institute. Now, I have to say

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:11.751
that my memory is notoriously porous, and I've often

00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:13.584
wondered whether there was any truth in this story,

00:02:13.584 --> 00:02:15.088
or I was just, you know, misremembering something,

00:02:15.088 --> 00:02:17.836
but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine,

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:19.435
and sure enough, there you can see

00:02:19.435 --> 00:02:21.546
the Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that

00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:24.023
analog calculating device.

00:02:24.023 --> 00:02:24.926
So it was true.

00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:27.367
All right. Now, the idea for doing this, it wasn't very old

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:29.031
at the time that I made that photo.

00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:32.509
The idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.005
by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:38.615
in West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:42.004
in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T.

00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:43.600
Now, Frank didn't hear anything.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.009
Actually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force,

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.974
which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:51.740
But Drake's idea here became very popular

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.197
because it was very appealing — and I'll get back to that —

00:02:54.197 --> 00:02:57.613
and on the basis of this experiment, which didn't succeed,

00:02:57.613 --> 00:02:59.468
we have been doing SETI ever since,

00:02:59.468 --> 00:03:01.502
not continuously, but ever since.

00:03:01.502 --> 00:03:03.388
We still haven't heard anything.

00:03:03.388 --> 00:03:05.066
We still haven't heard anything.

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:06.859
In fact, we don't know about any life beyond Earth,

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.659
but I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.028
rather soon, and part of the reason, in fact,

00:03:12.028 --> 00:03:14.803
the majority of the reason why I think that's going to change

00:03:14.803 --> 00:03:16.068
is that the equipment's getting better.

00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:19.005
This is the Allen Telescope Array, about 350 miles

00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:21.021
from whatever seat you're in right now.

00:03:21.021 --> 00:03:23.026
This is something that we're using today

00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:25.030
to search for E.T., and the electronics have gotten

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.500
very much better too.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.026
This is Frank Drake's electronics in 1960.

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:31.047
This is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today.

00:03:31.047 --> 00:03:34.536
Some pundit with too much time on his hands

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:37.543
has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately

00:03:37.543 --> 00:03:42.038
100 trillion times better than they were in 1960,

00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:43.534
100 trillion times better.

00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:45.623
That's a degree of an improvement that would look good

00:03:45.623 --> 00:03:48.030
on your report card, okay?

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.664
But something that's not appreciated by the public is,

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:53.389
in fact, that the experiment continues to get better,

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.037
and, consequently, tends to get faster.

00:03:56.037 --> 00:03:57.726
This is a little plot, and every time you show a plot,

00:03:57.726 --> 00:03:59.364
you lose 10 percent of the audience.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.673
I have 12 of these. (Laughter)

00:04:01.673 --> 00:04:06.093
But what I plotted here is just some metric

00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:08.647
that shows how fast we're searching.

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:10.755
In other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.

00:04:10.755 --> 00:04:13.042
We know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy.

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:15.753
But we're going through the haystack no longer

00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:18.045
with a teaspoon but with a skip loader,

00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:20.016
because of this increase in speed.

00:04:20.016 --> 00:04:21.451
In fact, those of you who are still conscious

00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:24.011
and mathematically competent,

00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:26.089
will note that this is a semi-log plot.

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:30.481
In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.

00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:33.214
It's exponentially improving. Now, exponential is an

00:04:33.214 --> 00:04:35.533
overworked word. You hear it on the media all the time.

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:37.070
They don't really know what exponential means,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.081
but this is exponential.

00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:42.001
In fact, it's doubling every 18 months, and, of course,

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:44.005
every card-carrying member of the digerati knows

00:04:44.005 --> 00:04:45.497
that that's Moore's Law.

00:04:45.497 --> 00:04:48.098
So this means that over the course of the next

00:04:48.098 --> 00:04:52.010
two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.038
a million star systems, looking for signals

00:04:54.038 --> 00:04:55.547
that would prove somebody's out there.

00:04:55.547 --> 00:04:58.045
Well, a million star systems, is that interesting?

00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:01.059
I mean, how many of those star systems have planets?

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.204
And the facts are, we didn't know the answer to that

00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:05.978
even as recently as 15 years ago, and in fact, we really

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:08.501
didn't know it even as recently as six months ago.

00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:11.379
But now we do. Recent results suggest

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.018
that virtually every star has planets, and more than one.

00:05:15.018 --> 00:05:18.344
They're like, you know, kittens. You get a litter.

00:05:18.344 --> 00:05:20.084
You don't get one kitten. You get a bunch.

00:05:20.084 --> 00:05:23.018
So in fact, this is a pretty accurate estimate

00:05:23.018 --> 00:05:27.014
of the number of planets in our galaxy,

00:05:27.014 --> 00:05:29.041
just in our galaxy, by the way,

00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:31.811
and I remind the non-astronomy majors among you

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.056
that our galaxy is only one of 100 billion

00:05:34.056 --> 00:05:36.040
that we can see with our telescopes.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.563
That's a lot of real estate, but of course,

00:05:37.563 --> 00:05:39.472
most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless,

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:41.564
like, you know, Mercury, or Neptune.

00:05:41.564 --> 00:05:43.654
Neptune's probably not very big in your life.

00:05:43.654 --> 00:05:48.001
So the question is, what fraction of these planets

00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.683
are actually suitable for life?

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.088
We don't know the answer to that either,

00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:53.326
but we will learn that answer this year, thanks to

00:05:53.326 --> 00:05:55.082
NASA's Kepler Space Telescope,

00:05:55.082 --> 00:05:59.104
and in fact, the smart money, which is to say the people who work on this project,

00:05:59.104 --> 00:06:02.533
the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets

00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:06.569
that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand,

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.876
one in a hundred, something like that.

00:06:09.876 --> 00:06:12.016
Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's

00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:15.127
one in a thousand, that means that there are

00:06:15.127 --> 00:06:17.656
at least a billion cousins of the Earth

00:06:17.656 --> 00:06:19.383
just in our own galaxy.

00:06:19.383 --> 00:06:21.636
Okay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here,

00:06:21.636 --> 00:06:25.562
but they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know,

00:06:25.562 --> 00:06:28.041
keep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate,

00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:30.054
plenty of real estate in the universe,

00:06:30.054 --> 00:06:33.003
and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's

00:06:33.003 --> 00:06:36.038
some interesting occupants, that makes you a miracle,

00:06:36.038 --> 00:06:38.719
and I know you like to think you're a miracle,

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:40.629
but if you do science, you learn rather quickly that

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:42.512
every time you think you're a miracle, you're wrong,

00:06:42.512 --> 00:06:45.040
so probably not the case.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.091
All right, so the bottom line is this:

00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:50.054
Because of the increase in speed, and because of the

00:06:50.054 --> 00:06:55.005
vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos, I figure

00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:57.050
we're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.021
And I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you:

00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:02.458
Either we're going to find E.T. in the next two dozen years,

00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:06.076
or I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

00:07:06.076 --> 00:07:08.710
So that's not so bad. I mean, even with two dozen years,

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.569
you open up your browser and there's news of a signal,

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:12.320
or you get a cup of coffee.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.293
Now, let me tell you about some aspect of this that

00:07:16.293 --> 00:07:18.331
people don't think about, and that is,

00:07:18.331 --> 00:07:22.039
what happens? Suppose that what I say is true.

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:24.404
I mean, who knows, but suppose it happens.

00:07:24.404 --> 00:07:25.891
Suppose some time in the next two dozen years

00:07:25.891 --> 00:07:28.068
we pick up a faint line that tells us

00:07:28.068 --> 00:07:29.756
we have some cosmic company.

00:07:29.756 --> 00:07:32.051
What is the effect? What's the consequence?

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:34.015
Now, I might be at ground zero for this.

00:07:34.015 --> 00:07:35.836
I happen to know what the consequence for me would be,

00:07:35.836 --> 00:07:38.745
because we've had false alarms. This is 1997,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.044
and this is a photo I made at about 3 o'clock in the morning

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:43.053
in Mountain View here, when we were watching

00:07:43.053 --> 00:07:45.368
the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal

00:07:45.368 --> 00:07:48.446
that we thought, "This is the real deal." All right?

00:07:48.446 --> 00:07:51.814
And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right?

00:07:51.814 --> 00:07:56.017
I kept waiting for -- I kept waiting for my mom to call,

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:59.021
somebody to call, the government to call. Nobody called.

00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:02.191
Nobody called. I was so nervous

00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:04.015
that I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around

00:08:04.015 --> 00:08:07.005
taking photos like this one, just for something to do.

00:08:07.005 --> 00:08:09.039
Well, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:11.069
on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night,

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:13.406
the phone rings and it's The New York Times.

00:08:13.406 --> 00:08:16.032
And I think there's a lesson in that, and that lesson is

00:08:16.032 --> 00:08:19.012
that if we pick up a signal, the media, the media will be on it

00:08:19.012 --> 00:08:23.346
faster than a weasel on ball bearings. It's going to be fast.

00:08:23.346 --> 00:08:25.024
You can be sure of that. No secrecy.

00:08:25.024 --> 00:08:28.007
That's what happens to me. It kind of ruins my whole week,

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:30.630
because whatever I've got planned that week is kind of out the window.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.050
But what about you? What's it going to do to you?

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.057
And the answer is that we don't know the answer.

00:08:35.057 --> 00:08:35.942
We don't know what that's going to do to you,

00:08:35.942 --> 00:08:39.066
not in the long term, and not even very much in the short term.

00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:41.894
I mean, that would be a bit like

00:08:41.894 --> 00:08:45.000
asking Chris Columbus in 1491, "Hey Chris,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.014
you know, what happens if it turns out that there's a

00:08:47.014 --> 00:08:50.550
continent between here and Japan, where you're sailing to,

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.325
what will be the consequences for humanity

00:08:53.325 --> 00:08:55.071
if that turns out to be the case?"

00:08:55.071 --> 00:08:57.301
And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer

00:08:57.301 --> 00:09:00.012
that you might not have understood, but it probably

00:09:00.012 --> 00:09:02.846
wouldn't have been right, and I think that to predict

00:09:02.846 --> 00:09:04.605
what finding E.T.'s going to mean,

00:09:04.605 --> 00:09:05.685
we can't predict that either.

00:09:05.685 --> 00:09:07.307
But here are a couple things I can say.

00:09:07.307 --> 00:09:11.464
To begin with, it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own.

00:09:11.464 --> 00:09:13.088
You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals.

00:09:13.088 --> 00:09:14.378
They're not building transmitters.

00:09:14.378 --> 00:09:16.304
They're going to be ahead of us, maybe by a few thousand

00:09:16.304 --> 00:09:19.371
years, maybe by a few millions years, but substantially

00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:21.600
ahead of us, and that means, if you can understand

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.386
anything that they're going to say, then you might be able

00:09:25.386 --> 00:09:28.476
to short-circuit history by getting information from a society

00:09:28.476 --> 00:09:30.050
that's way beyond our own.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.001
Now, you might find that a bit hyperbolic, and maybe it is,

00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:35.654
but nonetheless, it's conceivable that this will happen,

00:09:35.654 --> 00:09:38.027
and, you know, you could consider this like, I don't know,

00:09:38.027 --> 00:09:40.496
giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:41.603
to the library of Congress.

00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:44.058
It would change his day, all right?

00:09:44.058 --> 00:09:46.053
That's one thing. Another thing that's for sure

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:49.553
going to happen is that it will calibrate us.

00:09:49.553 --> 00:09:53.491
We will know that we're not that miracle, right,

00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:55.053
that we're just another duck in a row,

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.048
we're not the only kids on the block, and I think that that's

00:09:57.048 --> 00:10:00.002
philosophically a very profound thing to learn.

00:10:00.002 --> 00:10:03.103
We're not a miracle, okay?

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:06.402
The third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague,

00:10:06.402 --> 00:10:08.525
but I think interesting and important,

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:10.630
and that is, if you find a signal coming from a more

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.861
advanced society, because they will be,

00:10:12.861 --> 00:10:15.513
that will tell you something about our own possibilities,

00:10:15.513 --> 00:10:20.295
that we're not inevitably doomed to self-destruction.

00:10:20.295 --> 00:10:22.091
Because they survived their technology,

00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:23.203
we could do it too.

00:10:23.203 --> 00:10:25.094
Normally when you look out into the universe,

00:10:25.094 --> 00:10:27.555
you're looking back in time. All right?

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:29.594
That's interesting to cosmologists.

00:10:29.594 --> 00:10:33.038
But in this sense, you actually can look into the future,

00:10:33.038 --> 00:10:35.053
hazily, but you can look into the future.

00:10:35.053 --> 00:10:40.590
So those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.022
Now, let me talk a little bit about something that happens

00:10:43.022 --> 00:10:47.234
even in the meantime, and that is,

00:10:47.234 --> 00:10:52.012
SETI, I think, is important, because it's exploration, and

00:10:52.012 --> 00:10:54.464
it's not only exploration, it's comprehensible exploration.

00:10:54.464 --> 00:10:57.329
Now, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about

00:10:57.329 --> 00:11:00.044
explorers. I find exploration very interesting,

00:11:00.044 --> 00:11:03.025
Arctic exploration, you know, people like Magellan,

00:11:03.025 --> 00:11:06.021
Amundsen, Shackleton, you see Franklin down there,

00:11:06.021 --> 00:11:09.345
Scott, all these guys. It's really nifty, exploration.

00:11:09.345 --> 00:11:11.584
And they're just doing it because they want to explore,

00:11:11.584 --> 00:11:13.700
and you might say, "Oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity,"

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.028
but that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity,

00:11:17.028 --> 00:11:19.059
because, I mean, think of ants.

00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:21.056
You know, most ants are programmed to follow one another

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.304
along in a long line, but there are a couple of ants,

00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:26.000
maybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.175
pioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off.

00:11:28.175 --> 00:11:30.076
They're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop.

00:11:30.076 --> 00:11:32.074
You gotta get them with your thumb before they

00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:33.658
find the sugar or something.

00:11:33.658 --> 00:11:36.063
But those ants, even though most of them get wiped out,

00:11:36.063 --> 00:11:39.355
those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival

00:11:39.355 --> 00:11:42.929
of the hive. So exploration is important.

00:11:42.929 --> 00:11:46.309
I also think that exploration is important in terms of

00:11:46.309 --> 00:11:51.179
being able to address what I think is a critical

00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:54.380
lack in our society, and that is the lack of science literacy,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.023
the lack of the ability to even understand science.

00:11:58.023 --> 00:12:00.065
Now, look, a lot has been written about the

00:12:00.065 --> 00:12:03.463
deplorable state of science literacy in this country.

00:12:03.463 --> 00:12:06.015
You've heard about it.

00:12:06.015 --> 00:12:08.067
Well, here's one example, in fact.

00:12:08.067 --> 00:12:10.386
Polls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago.

00:12:10.386 --> 00:12:12.515
It shows like roughly one third of the public thinks

00:12:12.515 --> 00:12:14.479
that aliens are not only out there, we're looking for them

00:12:14.479 --> 00:12:16.097
out there, but they're here, right?

00:12:16.097 --> 00:12:18.396
Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally

00:12:18.396 --> 00:12:21.512
abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of.

00:12:21.512 --> 00:12:24.685
Well, that would be interesting if it was true,

00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:26.564
and job security for me, but I don't think the evidence is

00:12:26.564 --> 00:12:30.036
very good. That's more, you know, sad than significant.

00:12:30.036 --> 00:12:32.055
But there are other things that people believe

00:12:32.055 --> 00:12:35.466
that are significant, like the efficacy of homeopathy,

00:12:35.466 --> 00:12:39.017
or that evolution is just, you know, sort of a crazy idea

00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:42.048
by scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution,

00:12:42.048 --> 00:12:44.604
all that sort of thing, or global warming.

00:12:44.604 --> 00:12:48.005
These sorts of ideas don't really have any validity,

00:12:48.005 --> 00:12:50.080
that you can't trust the scientists.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.323
Now, we've got to solve that problem, because that's

00:12:52.323 --> 00:12:56.401
a critically important problem, and you might say,

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.030
"Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?"

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.429
Well, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't

00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:03.092
solve the problem, but it can address the problem.

00:13:03.092 --> 00:13:06.035
It can address the problem by getting young people

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:09.033
interested in science. Look, science is hard, it

00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:12.086
has a reputation of being hard, and the facts are, it is hard,

00:13:12.086 --> 00:13:17.021
and that's the result of 400 years of science, right?

00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:19.500
I mean, in the 18th century, in the 18th century

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.090
you could become an expert on any field of science

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.004
in an afternoon by going to a library,

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:27.025
if you could find the library, right?

00:13:27.025 --> 00:13:30.641
In the 19th century, if you had a basement lab,

00:13:30.641 --> 00:13:33.388
you could make major scientific discoveries

00:13:33.388 --> 00:13:35.613
in your own home. Right? Because there was all this

00:13:35.613 --> 00:13:38.488
science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up.

00:13:38.488 --> 00:13:40.081
Now, that's not true anymore.

00:13:40.081 --> 00:13:42.509
Today, you've got to spend years in grad school

00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:46.007
and post-doc positions just to figure out what

00:13:46.007 --> 00:13:48.063
the important questions are.

00:13:48.063 --> 00:13:50.058
It's hard. There's no doubt about it.

00:13:50.058 --> 00:13:52.367
And in fact, here's an example: the Higgs boson,

00:13:52.367 --> 00:13:54.276
finding the Higgs boson.

00:13:54.276 --> 00:13:56.076
Ask the next 10 people you see on the streets,

00:13:56.076 --> 00:13:58.414
"Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions

00:13:58.414 --> 00:14:01.055
of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"

00:14:01.055 --> 00:14:03.376
And I bet the answer you're going to get, is,

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:05.033
"Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is,

00:14:05.033 --> 00:14:06.265
and I don't know if it's important."

00:14:06.265 --> 00:14:08.064
And probably most of the people wouldn't even know

00:14:08.064 --> 00:14:10.511
the value of a Swiss franc, okay?

00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:13.041
And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.

00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:15.194
Okay? So that doesn't get people interested in science

00:14:15.194 --> 00:14:17.070
because they can't comprehend what it's about.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.687
SETI, on the other hand, is really simple.

00:14:18.687 --> 00:14:20.303
We're going to use these big antennas and we're going to

00:14:20.303 --> 00:14:23.055
try to eavesdrop on signals. Everybody can understand that.

00:14:23.055 --> 00:14:25.064
Yes, technologically, it's very sophisticated,

00:14:25.064 --> 00:14:27.070
but everybody gets the idea.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:31.008
So that's one thing. The other thing is, it's exciting science.

00:14:31.008 --> 00:14:33.422
It's exciting because we're naturally interested

00:14:33.422 --> 00:14:35.647
in other intelligent beings, and I think that's

00:14:35.647 --> 00:14:37.071
part of our hardwiring.

00:14:37.071 --> 00:14:38.631
I mean, we're hardwired to be interested

00:14:38.631 --> 00:14:41.432
in beings that might be, if you will, competitors,

00:14:41.432 --> 00:14:45.015
or if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates. Okay?

00:14:45.015 --> 00:14:47.026
I mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that

00:14:47.026 --> 00:14:49.047
have big teeth. Right?

00:14:49.047 --> 00:14:50.521
We're interested in things that have big teeth, and you

00:14:50.521 --> 00:14:53.066
can see the evolutionary value of that, and you can also see

00:14:53.066 --> 00:14:56.754
the practical consequences by watching Animal Planet.

00:14:56.754 --> 00:14:59.088
You notice they make very few programs about gerbils.

00:14:59.088 --> 00:15:01.144
It's mostly about things that have big teeth.

00:15:01.144 --> 00:15:04.091
Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.

00:15:04.091 --> 00:15:08.026
And not just us. It's also kids.

00:15:08.026 --> 00:15:11.453
This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:14.685
hook to science, because SETI involves all kinds of science,

00:15:14.685 --> 00:15:16.675
obviously biology, obviously astronomy,

00:15:16.675 --> 00:15:20.009
but also geology, also chemistry, various scientific

00:15:20.009 --> 00:15:24.009
disciplines all can be presented in the guise of,

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:25.338
"We're looking for E.T."

00:15:25.338 --> 00:15:29.795
So to me this is interesting and important, and in fact,

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:33.033
it's my policy, even though I give a lot of talks to adults,

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:35.701
you give talks to adults, and two days later they're back where they were.

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:38.623
But if you give talks to kids, you know,

00:15:38.623 --> 00:15:42.775
one in 50 of them, some light bulb goes off, and they think,

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.576
"Gee, I'd never thought of that," and then they go,

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:46.368
you know, read a book or a magazine or whatever.

00:15:46.368 --> 00:15:48.050
They get interested in something.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:53.024
Now it's my theory, supported only by anecdotal,

00:15:53.024 --> 00:15:55.047
personal anecdotal evidence, but nonetheless,

00:15:55.047 --> 00:15:57.520
that kids get interested in something between the ages

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.056
of eight and 11. You've got to get them there.

00:16:00.056 --> 00:16:02.676
So, all right, I give talks to adults, that's fine, but I try

00:16:02.676 --> 00:16:05.001
and make 10 percent of the talks that I give,

00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:07.078
I try and make those for kids.

00:16:07.078 --> 00:16:10.054
I remember when a guy came to our high school, actually,

00:16:10.054 --> 00:16:13.030
it was actually my junior high school. I was in sixth grade.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.510
And he gave some talk. All I remember from it

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.085
was one word: electronics.

00:16:17.085 --> 00:16:19.646
It was like Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate," right,

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:22.044
when he said "plastics," whatever that means, plastics.

00:16:22.044 --> 00:16:24.039
All right, so the guy said electronics. I don't remember

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:26.043
anything else. In fact, I don't remember anything

00:16:26.043 --> 00:16:28.053
that my sixth grade teacher said all year,

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:30.067
but I remember electronics.

00:16:30.067 --> 00:16:32.719
And so I got interested in electronics, and you know,

00:16:32.719 --> 00:16:35.044
I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff.

00:16:35.044 --> 00:16:38.022
Here I am at about 15 or something, doing that sort of stuff.

00:16:38.022 --> 00:16:39.605
Okay? That had a big effect on me.

00:16:39.605 --> 00:16:41.317
So that's my point, that you can have a big effect

00:16:41.317 --> 00:16:44.033
on these kids.

00:16:44.033 --> 00:16:47.694
In fact, this reminds me, I don't know, a couple years ago

00:16:47.694 --> 00:16:51.020
I gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.033
where there were about a dozen 11-year-olds

00:16:53.033 --> 00:16:54.005
that had come to this talk.

00:16:54.005 --> 00:16:56.521
I had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour.

00:16:56.521 --> 00:16:58.795
Eleven-year-olds, they're all sitting in a little semi-circle

00:16:58.795 --> 00:17:01.039
looking up at me with big eyes, and I started,

00:17:01.039 --> 00:17:02.695
there was a white board behind me, and I started off

00:17:02.695 --> 00:17:05.533
by writing a one with 22 zeroes after it, and I said,

00:17:05.533 --> 00:17:07.896
"All right, now look, this is the number of stars

00:17:07.896 --> 00:17:10.768
in the visible universe, and this number is so big

00:17:10.768 --> 00:17:14.116
there's not even a name for it."

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.581
And one of these kids shot up his hand, and he said,

00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:18.086
"Well, actually there is a name for it.

00:17:18.086 --> 00:17:21.020
It's a sextra-quadra-hexa-something or other." Right?

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.016
Now, that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude,

00:17:25.016 --> 00:17:27.488
but there was no doubt about it, these kids were smart.

00:17:27.488 --> 00:17:29.456
Okay? So I stopped giving the lecture.

00:17:29.456 --> 00:17:32.039
All they wanted to do was ask questions.

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:36.031
In fact, my last comments to these kids, at the end I said,

00:17:36.031 --> 00:17:38.063
"You know, you kids are smarter

00:17:38.063 --> 00:17:43.005
than the people I work with." Now — (Laughter)

00:17:43.005 --> 00:17:44.334
They didn't even care about that.

00:17:44.334 --> 00:17:47.028
What they wanted was my email address

00:17:47.028 --> 00:17:51.013
so they could ask me more questions. (Laughter)

00:17:51.013 --> 00:17:54.172
Let me just say, look, my job is a privilege

00:17:54.172 --> 00:17:55.795
because we're in a special time.

00:17:55.795 --> 00:17:58.580
Previous generations couldn't do this experiment at all.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.405
In another generation down the line,

00:18:00.405 --> 00:18:02.021
I think we will have succeeded.

00:18:02.021 --> 00:18:05.502
So to me, it is a privilege, and when I look in the mirror,

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:08.309
the facts are that I really don't see myself.

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:10.073
What I see is the generation behind me.

00:18:10.073 --> 00:18:12.099
These are some kids from the Huff School, fourth graders.

00:18:12.099 --> 00:18:15.044
I talked there, what, two weeks ago, something like that.

00:18:15.044 --> 00:18:19.654
I think that if you can instill some interest in science

00:18:19.654 --> 00:18:22.613
and how it works, well, that's a payoff

00:18:22.613 --> 00:18:25.056
beyond easy measure. Thank you very much.

00:18:25.056 --> 00:18:31.047
(Applause)
