00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
This is very strange for me, because I’m not used to doing this:

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
I usually stand on the other side of the light,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.160
and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
The previous speaker has, I think,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.160
really painted a very good background as to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.160
the impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.160
and trying to find the answer to the big questions.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.160
But this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.160
feels like -- there’s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.160
who after many years of living in France -- and learning, you know,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.160
studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.160
What have you done with so many years of being away?

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
And obviously they were, "Is this what you spent years doing?

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.160
And we expected huge masterpieces!"

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.160
But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.160
was the culmination of a man’s life, search, thought, everything --

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
just in a reduced, small version.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
In a way, I feel like that.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
I feel like I’m coming home to talk about

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.160
what I’ve been away doing for 20 years.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.160
And I will start with a brief taster of what I’ve been about:

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
a handful of films -- nothing much,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
two feature films and a handful of short films.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
So, we’ll go with the first piece.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:15.160
(Video) Woman: "I destroy lives," mum said.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
I love her, you know.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
She’s not even my real mum.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160
My real mum and dad dumped me

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
and fucked off back to Nigeria.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.160
The devil is in me, Court.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
Court: Sleep.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
Woman: Have you ever been?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
Court: Where?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
Woman: Nigeria.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Court: Never.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
My mum wanted to,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
couldn’t afford it.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
Woman: Wish I could.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
I have this feeling I’d be happy there.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
Why does everyone get rid of me?

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
Court: I don't want to get rid of you.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.160
Woman: You don't need me.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
You’re just too blind to see it now.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
Boy: What do you do all day?

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
Marcus: Read.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
Boy: Don't you get bored?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
And how come you ain't got a job anyway?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
Marcus: I am retired.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
Boy: So?

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Marcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
Boy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
Marcus: Because I do what I like?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.160
Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.160
Boy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
Marcus: You’re a rapper, am I right?

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.160
Boy: Yeah.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Marcus: A modern day poet.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Boy: Yeah, you could say that.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
Marcus: So what do you talk about?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
Boy: What's that supposed to mean?

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about?

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
Boy: Reality, man.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.160
Marcus: Whose reality?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
Boy: My fuckin' reality.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
Marcus: Tell me about your reality.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.160
Boy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just --

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.160
Marcus: With an AK-47?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
Boy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
Marcus: When a man resorts to profanities,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160
it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
Boy: See man, you’re just taking the piss out of me now.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
Marcus: The Panthers.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160
Boy: Panthers?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.160
Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.160
Fuckin’ wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
Director 1: I saw his last film.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
Épuise, right?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.160
Woman 1: Yes.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.160
D1: Not to make a bad joke, but it was really épuisé.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.160
Epuisé -- tired, exhausted, fed up.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
Director 2: Can you not shut up?

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
Now, you talk straight to me, what’s wrong with my films?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
Let’s go.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.160
W1: They suck.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
Woman 2: They suck? What about yours?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
What, what, what, what about, what?

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
What do you think about your movie?

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
D1: My movies, they are OK, fine.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
What the fuck are you talking about?

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
to go and film something real?

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
You make people fuckin' sleep.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Dream about bullshit.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.160
(Applause)

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.160
Newton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.160
totally trying to capture what cinema is for me,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.160
The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
that she has a feeling she'll be happy there.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
I've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
I've been away 20 years in total.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
And so it’s really --

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.160
it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.160
which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.160
the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
So, for this girl to have these dreams

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.160
is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.160
How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.160
because you just need something to hold on to,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160
especially in a society where you feel alienated.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.160
talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.160
the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.160
and his reality.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
Again, this was my -- this was me talking about --

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.160
this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
And what would a child --

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.160
I mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
What happens with that?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
What, of course, happens with that is violence,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.160
which we see when we talk about the ghettos

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.160
and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
and which eventually, when channeled, becomes,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.160
you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots --

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.160
like the one in France two years ago, where I live,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
France is a liberal society."

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
But I lived in England for 18 years.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160
I've lived in France for about four, and I feel actually

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.160
thrown back 20 years, living in France.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question:

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:39.160
There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends --

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.160
I suppose that will take me to my last piece --

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
what cinema means for me.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.160
My life started as a -- I started life in 1966,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.160
a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
and it was three years of war.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
So that whole thing,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.160
that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
(Video) Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
Onicha: Yes, mama.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:16.160
Commander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
so you must get ready and willing to die.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160
You must get -- ?

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
Child Soldiers: Ready and willing to die.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:29.160
C: Success, the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
CS: The barrel of the gun!

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.160
C: This is the gun.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.160
CS: This is the gun.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
C: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.160
This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
Ezra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
Amphetamines.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
Soldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
I say rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
We went from one village to another -- three villages.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
I don’t remember how we got there.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
Witness: We walked and walked for two days.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
We didn't eat.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.160
There was no food, just little rice.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
Without food -- I was sick.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
The injection made us not to have mind.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
God will forgive us.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160
He knows we did not know. We did not know!

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160
Committee Chairman: Do you remember January 6th, 1999?

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
Ezra: I don’t remember.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
Various Voices: You will die! You will die! (Screaming)

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160
Onicha: Ezra! (Ezra: Onicha! Onicha!)

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:55.160
Various Voices: ♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
♫ No more trouble ♫

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
They killed my mother.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
The Mende sons of bastards.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
(Shouting)

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
Who is she?

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.160
Me.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160
Why you giving these to me?

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
So you can stop staring at me.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
My story is a little bit complicated.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
I’m interested.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
Mariam is pregnant.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
You know what you are? A crocodile.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
Big mouth. Short legs.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
In front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
He’s not taking care of his troops.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.160
Troop, pay your last honor. Salute.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
Open your eyes, Ezra.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:46.160
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
Get that idiot out!

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
I take you are preparing a major attack?

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.160
This must be the mine.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.160
Your girl is here.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.160
Well done, well done.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
That is what you are here for, no?

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.160
You are planning to go back to fight are you?

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:13.160
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
♫ No more trouble ♫

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:25.160
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.160
♫ No more trouble. ♫

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.160
Wake up! Everybody wake up. Road block!

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
♫ We don't need no more ... ♫

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.160
Committee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commission

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:10.160
will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
More than that, begin a healing process and finally to --

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.160
as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country’s history.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160
The beginning of hope.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.160
Mr. Ezra Gelehun, please stand.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.160
State your name and age for the commission.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
Ezra: My name is Ezra Gelehun.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.160
I am 15 or 16. I don’t remember.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.160
Ask my sister, she is the witch, she knows everything.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.160
(Sister: 16.)

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I’d like to remind you you’re not on trial here

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
for any crimes you committed.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
E: We were fighting for our freedom.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
If killing in a war is a crime,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.160
then you have to charge every soldier in the world.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.160
War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.160
You too are a retired General, not so?

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
CC: Yes, correct.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
E: So you too must stand trial then.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.160
Our government was corrupt.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.160
Lack of education was their way to control power.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.160
If I may ask, do you pay for school in your country?

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.160
CC: No, we don’t.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
E: You are richer than us.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
But we pay for school.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
Your country talks about democracy,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.160
but you support corrupt governments like my own.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
Why? Because you want our diamond.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.160
Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before?

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.160
No.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:02.160
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you, you're not on trial here today.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.160
You are not on trial.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.160
E: Then let me go.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.160
CC: I can't do that, son.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160
E: So you are a liar.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
(Applause)

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
NA: Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here,

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160
is that while we’re making all these huge advancements,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:24.160
what we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should --

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.160
Africa should move forward, but we should remember,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160
so we do not go back here again.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.160
Thank you.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
Emeka Okafor: Thank you, Newton.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
(Applause)

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.160
One of the themes that comes through very strongly

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:50.160
in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.160
that have to play this role of being child soldiers.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.160
And considering where you are coming from,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:05.160
and when we consider the extent to which it’s not taken as seriously

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.160
as it should be, what would you have to say about that?

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.160
NA: In the process of my research, I actually spent

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.160
a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.160
And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers --

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.160
ex-combatants, as they like to be called.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.160
I met psychosocial workers who worked with them.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.160
I met psychiatrists who spent time with them,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.160
aid workers, NGOs, the whole lot.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.160
But I remember on the flight back on my last trip,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.160
I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:51.160
if any kid in the West, in the western world,

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:56.160
went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:02.160
they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.160
So for me, the thought that we have all these children --

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
it’s a generation, we have a whole generation of children --

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:17.160
who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.160
and Africa has to live with that.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.160
But I’m just saying to factor that in,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.160
factor that in with all this great advancement,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.160
all this pronouncement of great achievement.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.160
That’s really my thinking.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.160
EO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.160
That was a very moving piece.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.160
NA: Thank you.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.160
EO: Thank you.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.160
(Applause)
