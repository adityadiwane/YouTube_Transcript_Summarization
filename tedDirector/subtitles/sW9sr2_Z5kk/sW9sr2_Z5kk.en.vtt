00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.914
In the 1600s, there were so many
right whales in Cape Cod Bay

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:18.741
off the east coast of the U.S.

00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:22.389
that apparently you could
walk across their backs

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.484
from one end of the bay to the other.

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:28.573
Today, they number in the hundreds,
and they're endangered.

00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:33.728
Like them, many species of whales
saw their numbers drastically reduced

00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:36.170
by 200 years of whaling,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.889
where they were hunted and killed
for their whale meat, oil and whale bone.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.412
We only have whales in our waters today

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:49.057
because of the Save the Whales
movement of the '70s.

00:00:49.057 --> 00:00:52.455
It was instrumental in stopping
commercial whaling,

00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:56.227
and was built on the idea that
if we couldn't save whales,

00:00:56.227 --> 00:00:58.154
what could we save?

00:00:58.154 --> 00:01:01.080
It was ultimately a test
of our political ability

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.683
to halt environmental destruction.

00:01:04.683 --> 00:01:08.236
So in the early '80s, there was
a ban on commercial whaling

00:01:08.236 --> 00:01:11.951
that came into force
as a result of this campaign.

00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:14.760
Whales in our waters are still
low in numbers, however,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.489
because they do face a range
of other human-induced threats.

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:27.130
Unfortunately, many people still think
that whale conservationists like myself

00:01:27.136 --> 00:01:32.509
do what we do only because these creatures
are charismatic and beautiful.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.025
This is actually a disservice,

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:40.499
because whales are ecosystem engineers.

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:44.872
They help maintain the stability
and health of the oceans,

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:49.299
and even provide services
to human society.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.275
So let's talk about why
saving whales is critical

00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:56.806
to the resiliency of the oceans.

00:01:56.806 --> 00:02:01.334
It boils down to two main things:

00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:04.546
whale poop and rotting carcasses.

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:10.012
As whales dive to the depths to feed
and come up to the surface to breathe,

00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:13.918
they actually release these
enormous fecal plumes.

00:02:13.918 --> 00:02:15.662
This whale pump, as it's called,

00:02:15.662 --> 00:02:18.955
actually brings essential limiting 
nutrients from the depths

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:22.975
to the surface waters where they 
stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:26.422
which forms the base
of all marine food chains.

00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:29.127
So really, having more whales
in the oceans pooping

00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:33.208
is really beneficial
to the entire ecosystem.

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:38.760
Whales are also known to undertake some 
of the longest migrations of all mammals.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.696
Gray whales off America
migrate 16,000 kilometers

00:02:44.707 --> 00:02:50.812
between productive feeding areas and less
productive calving, or birthing, areas

00:02:50.812 --> 00:02:53.902
and back every year.

00:02:53.902 --> 00:02:58.886
As they do so, they transport fertilizer
in the form of their feces

00:02:58.886 --> 00:03:02.676
from places that have it
to places that need it.

00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:06.115
So clearly, whales are really
important in nutrient cycling,

00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:09.807
both horizontally and vertically,
through the oceans.

00:03:09.807 --> 00:03:16.466
But what's really cool is that they're 
also really important after they're dead.

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:20.559
Whale carcasses are some of 
the largest form of detritus

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:24.769
to fall from the ocean's surface, 
and they're called whale fall.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.466
As these carcasses sink,

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:30.495
they provide a feast
to some 400-odd species,

00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:34.331
including the eel-shaped, slime-producing 
hagfish.

00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:37.154
So over the 200 years of whaling,

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:41.524
when we were busy killing and removing
these carcasses from the oceans,

00:03:41.524 --> 00:03:47.246
we likely altered the rate and geographic 
distribution of these whale falls

00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:49.563
that would descend into deep oceans,

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:53.254
and as a result, probably led
to a number of extinctions

00:03:53.254 --> 00:03:55.392
of species that were most specialized

00:03:55.392 --> 00:03:59.876
and dependent on these carcasses
for their survival.

00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:07.808
Whale carcasses are also known
to transport about 190,000 tons of carbon,

00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:10.106
which is the equivalent of that produced

00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:13.171
by 80,000 cars per year

00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:16.000
from the atmosphere to the deep oceans,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.510
and the deep oceans
are what we call "carbon sinks,"

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.573
because they trap and hold
excess carbon from the atmosphere,

00:04:23.573 --> 00:04:27.789
and therefore help
to delay global warming.

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.468
Sometimes these carcasses
also wash up on beaches

00:04:31.468 --> 00:04:36.540
and provide a meal to a number
of predatory species on land.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.464
The 200 years of whaling
was clearly detrimental

00:04:40.464 --> 00:04:43.356
and caused a reduction
in the populations of whales

00:04:43.356 --> 00:04:46.476
between 60 to 90 percent.

00:04:46.476 --> 00:04:48.302
Clearly, the Save the Whales movement

00:04:48.302 --> 00:04:52.713
was instrumental in preventing
commercial whaling from going on,

00:04:52.713 --> 00:04:55.854
but we need to revise this.

00:04:55.854 --> 00:05:00.608
We need to address the more modern,
pressing problems that these whales face

00:05:00.608 --> 00:05:02.349
in our waters today.

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.482
Amongst other things, we need to stop them

00:05:04.482 --> 00:05:09.187
from getting plowed down by container 
ships when they're in their feeding areas,

00:05:09.187 --> 00:05:11.985
and stop them from getting
entangled in fishing nets

00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:14.469
as they float around in the ocean.

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:18.839
We also need to learn to contextualize
our conservation messages,

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:25.225
so people really understand the true 
ecosystem value of these creatures.

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:30.142
So, let's save the whales again,

00:05:30.142 --> 00:05:34.275
but this time, let's not just 
do it for their sake.

00:05:34.275 --> 00:05:36.806
Let's also do it for ours.

00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:39.151
Thank you.

00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:43.981
