00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Someone once said that politics is, of course, "showbiz for ugly people."

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
So, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
The other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
to give a TED talk, particularly here in the U.K.,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.260
where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.260
There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.260
actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And someone asked,"Why?"

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and they said, "Well, there's no shortage of politicians,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
no one really minds what happens to them

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
(Laughter)

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
This, I think, is the most important fact to bear in mind

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
in British politics or American politics,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and that is: We have run out of money.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
We have vast budget deficits.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
This is my global public debt clock,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and, as you can see, it's 32 trillion and counting.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And I think what this leads to

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
is a very simple recognition,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
that there's one question in politics at the moment above all other,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and it's this one: How do we make things better without spending more money?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Because there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
or to improve government, or to improve so many of the things

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
that politicians talk about.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.260
So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money --

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
you can only measure success in public services

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
in health care and education and policing by spending more money,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
you can only measure progress by spending money --

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
you're going to have a pretty miserable time.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.260
But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being --

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
things like your family relationships, friendship, community, values --

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.260
then, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And the really simple argument I want to make tonight,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
the really straightforward argument is this:

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.260
That if we combine the right political philosophy, the right political thinking,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.260
with the incredible information revolution that has taken place,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and that all of you know so much more about than I do,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.260
I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
remake government, remake public services,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and achieve what's up on that slide, which is a big increase in our well-being.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
That's the argument I want to make tonight.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
So, starting with the political philosophy.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Now I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Of course we don't.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.260
But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
that are really relevant to this whole debate.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
The first is this: We believe that if you give people

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
more power and control over their lives,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
if you give people more choice,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
if you put them in the driving seat,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
then actually, you can create a stronger and better society.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
of information that we have in our world today,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
I think you can completely, as I've said,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.260
remake politics, remake government, remake your public services.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.260
The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Politics and politicians will only succeed

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.260
if they actually try and treat with people as they are,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
rather than as they would like them to be.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Now, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought --

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
go with the grain of human nature --

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
with all the advances in behavioral economics,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
some of which we were just hearing about,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
again, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
in happiness, in a stronger society

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.260
without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Now, why do I think now is the moment to make this argument?

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Well, I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short, condensed history lesson

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
about what I would say are the three passages of history:

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.260
the pre-bureaucratic age, the bureaucratic age

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
and what we now live in, which I think is a post-bureaucratic age.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
A simpler way of thinking of it

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.260
is that we have gone from a world of local control,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
then we went to a world of central control,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and now we're in a world of people control.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Local power, central power, now, people power.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Now, here is King Cnut, king a thousand years ago.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Thought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Couldn't actually turn back very much,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
because if you were king a thousand years ago,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.260
while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
there wasn't much you were in charge of.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
You weren't in charge of policing, justice, education, health, welfare.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.260
You could just about go to war and that was about it.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
This was the pre-bureaucratic age,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.260
an age in which everything had to be local.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.260
You had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
because travel was so restricted.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Next part of the cold history lesson,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Suddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Suddenly, you have the big, strong, central state.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.260
It was able -- but only it was able -- to organize

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
health care, education, policing, justice.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And it was a world of, as I say, not local power, but now central power.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
It had sucked all that power up from the localities.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
It was able to do that itself.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
The next great stage, which all of you are so familiar with:

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
the massive information revolution.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Just consider this one fact:

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.260
One hundred years ago, sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
Right now, here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.260
and we can send and receive huge quantities of information

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
without it costing anything.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.260
So we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.260
where genuine people power is possible.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
Now, what does this mean for our politics,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
for our public services, for our government?

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Well I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.260
but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And this is so obvious, in a way, because

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
you think about how all of you have changed

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.260
the way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
That is already happened; the information and Internet revolution

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.260
has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
but it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
So, how could this happen?

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.260
Well, I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference:

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.260
in transparency, in greater choice and in accountability,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
in giving us that genuine people power.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.260
If we take transparency, here is one of my favorite websites,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
the Missouri Accountability Portal.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
In the old days, only the government could hold the information,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and only a few elected people could try and grab that information

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
and question it and challenge it.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Now here, on one website, one state in America,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.260
every single dollar spent by that government

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
is searchable, is analyzable, is checkable.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
Think of the huge change that means:

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Any business that wants to bid for a government contract

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
can see what currently is being spent.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Anyone thinking, "I could do that service better, I could deliver it cheaper,"

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
it's all available there.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
We have only, in government and in politics,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.260
started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
with the information revolution.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
So, complete transparency will make a huge difference.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
In this country, if we win the election,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.260
we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.260
transparent and available online, searchable for anyone to see.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.260
We're going to make every contract -- we're announcing this today --

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
available on the Internet so anyone can see

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
what the terms are, what the conditions are,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
driving huge value for money,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.260
but also huge increases, I believe, in well-being as well.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Choice. Now you all shop online, compare online, do everything online,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.260
of public services like education, or health care or policing,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
and you're going to see this change massively.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
We should be making this change

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
with the information revolution in our country,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.260
with searchable health sites, so you can see what operations work out properly,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
what records doctors have, the cleanliness of hospitals,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
who does best at infection control --

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.260
all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
is now available for all of us to see.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.260
And the third of these big changes: accountability.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
This, I think, is a huge change.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.260
It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
So, instead of having a situation where only the police have the information

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
about which crimes are committed where,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and we have to employ people in government

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
to try and hold the police to account,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
suddenly, we've got this vast opportunity for people power,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
where we, as citizens, can see what crimes are being committed --

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
where, when and by whom --

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
and we can hold the police to account.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
but actually that's an assault, the one in blue.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
You can see what crime is committed where,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:55.260
So those three ways -- transparency, accountability and choice --

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
will make a huge difference.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
Now I also said the other principle

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
that I think we should work on is understanding of people,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
you can achieve so much more.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Now, we're got a huge revolution in understanding

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
of why people behave in the way that they do,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:17.260
and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
We're working with some of these people.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
We're being advised by some of these people, as was said,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.260
to try and bring all the experience to book.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.260
Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple, and I love.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
We want to get people to be more energy efficient.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Why? It cuts fuel poverty, it cuts their bills,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
How do you do it?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
Well, we've had government information campaigns over the years

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
We even had -- one government minister once told us to

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
brush our teeth in the dark.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
I don't think they lasted very long.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.260
Look at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
is to show them their own spending,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
to show them what their neighbors are spending,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
That sort of behavioral economics

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
can transform people's behavior

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
in a way that all the bullying and all the information

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
Other examples are recycling.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
We all know we need to recycle more.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
How do we make it happen?

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.260
All the proof from America is that actually, if you pay people to recycle,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
if you give them a carrot rather than a stick,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
you can transform their behavior.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
So what does all this add up to?

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Here are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last 50 years.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.260
Obviously, here we have JFK with that incredibly simple

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
and powerful formulation,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.260
"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,"

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
an incredibly noble sentiment.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
But when he made that speech, what could you do

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
to build the stronger, better society?

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
You could fight for your country, you could die for your country,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
you could serve in your country's civil service,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.260
but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.260
and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
And I think an even more wonderful speech,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.260
which I'm going to read a big chunk of,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
which sums up what I said at the beginning

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
about believing there is more to life than money,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
and more that we should try and measure than money.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
of why gross national product captures so little:

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
It "does not allow for the health of our children,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
the quality of their education, or the joy of their play.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.260
It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
the intelligence of our public debate.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
It measures neither our wit nor our courage,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
neither our wisdom nor our learning,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
It measures everything, in short,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
except that which makes life worthwhile."

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:06.260
Again, a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
and a beautiful dream 40 years ago,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.260
but now with the huge advances in information technology,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
with the massive changes in behavioral economics,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.260
with all that we know about how you advance well-being,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
that if we combine those insights

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.260
of giving power to people, and using information to make that possible,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.260
and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.260
while at the same time, understanding why people behave in the way they do,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.260
it is a dream more easy to realize today

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.260
than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
Thank you.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:51.260
(Applause)
