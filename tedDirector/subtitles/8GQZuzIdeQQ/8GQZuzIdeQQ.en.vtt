00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:16.031
Think of a hard choice
you'll face in the near future.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.212
It might be between two careers --

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:19.683
artist and accountant --

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.734
or places to live --
the city or the country --

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.997
or even between two people to marry --

00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:27.969
you could marry Betty
or you could marry Lolita.

00:00:28.572 --> 00:00:31.565
Or it might be a choice
about whether to have children,

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.936
to have an ailing parent move in with you,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.177
to raise your child in a religion
that your partner lives by

00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:38.593
but leaves you cold.

00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:42.073
Or whether to donate
your life savings to charity.

00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:45.536
Chances are, the hard choice
you thought of was something big,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.064
something momentous,
something that matters to you.

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:51.029
Hard choices seem to be occasions

00:00:51.053 --> 00:00:54.563
for agonizing, hand-wringing,
the gnashing of teeth.

00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:58.138
But I think we've
misunderstood hard choices

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:00.229
and the role they play in our lives.

00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:02.131
Understanding hard choices

00:01:02.155 --> 00:01:05.638
uncovers a hidden power
each of us possesses.

00:01:06.972 --> 00:01:10.321
What makes a choice hard
is the way the alternatives relate.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.359
In any easy choice,

00:01:12.383 --> 00:01:14.521
one alternative is better than the other.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.379
In a hard choice,

00:01:16.403 --> 00:01:18.931
one alternative is better in some ways,

00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:21.156
the other alternative
is better in other ways,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.851
and neither is better
than the other overall.

00:01:24.732 --> 00:01:28.979
You agonize over whether to stay
in your current job in the city

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:33.352
or uproot your life
for more challenging work in the country,

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.681
because staying is better in some ways,

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:37.305
moving is better in others,

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.067
and neither is better
than the other overall.

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:44.650
We shouldn't think
that all hard choices are big.

00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:47.630
Let's say you're deciding
what to have for breakfast.

00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:50.510
You could have high fiber bran cereal

00:01:50.534 --> 00:01:51.886
or a chocolate donut.

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:55.769
Suppose what matters in the choice
is tastiness and healthfulness.

00:01:56.563 --> 00:01:58.805
The cereal is better for you,

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.986
the donut tastes way better,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.212
but neither is better
than the other overall,

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:04.650
a hard choice.

00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:09.348
Realizing that small choices
can also be hard,

00:02:09.372 --> 00:02:12.698
may make big hard choices
seem less intractable.

00:02:13.563 --> 00:02:16.469
After all, we manage to figure out
what to have for breakfast,

00:02:16.493 --> 00:02:19.624
so maybe we can figure out
whether to stay in the city

00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:21.925
or uproot for the new job in the country.

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:28.341
We also shouldn't think
that hard choices are hard

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:29.942
because we are stupid.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.608
When I graduated from college,

00:02:32.632 --> 00:02:36.134
I couldn't decide between two careers,
philosophy and law.

00:02:36.158 --> 00:02:38.823
I really loved philosophy.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.552
There are amazing things
you can learn as a philosopher,

00:02:42.576 --> 00:02:45.051
and all from the comfort of an armchair.

00:02:46.106 --> 00:02:48.984
But I came from a modest immigrant family

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:50.457
where my idea of luxury

00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:52.966
was having a pork tongue
and jelly sandwich

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.533
in my school lunchbox,

00:02:55.232 --> 00:02:57.597
so the thought of spending my whole life

00:02:57.621 --> 00:03:00.580
sitting around in armchairs
just thinking ...

00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:04.516
Well, that struck me as the height
of extravagance and frivolity.

00:03:05.357 --> 00:03:07.103
So I got out my yellow pad,

00:03:07.127 --> 00:03:09.010
I drew a line down the middle,

00:03:09.034 --> 00:03:11.431
and I tried my best
to think of the reasons

00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:14.128
for and against each alternative.

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.389
I remember thinking to myself,

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:21.825
if only I knew what my life
in each career would be like.

00:03:22.428 --> 00:03:28.415
If only God or Netflix would send me a DVD
of my two possible future careers,

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:29.611
I'd be set.

00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:31.537
I'd compare them side by side,

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:33.468
I'd see that one was better,

00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:35.280
and the choice would be easy.

00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:37.476
But I got no DVD,

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:40.819
and because I couldn't
figure out which was better,

00:03:40.843 --> 00:03:43.556
I did what many of us do in hard choices:

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.569
I took the safest option.

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:50.731
Fear of being an unemployed philosopher
led me to become a lawyer,

00:03:52.256 --> 00:03:55.586
and as I discovered,
lawyering didn't quite fit.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.239
It wasn't who I was.

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.503
So now I'm a philosopher,

00:03:59.527 --> 00:04:01.465
and I study hard choices,

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.814
and I can tell you,
that fear of the unknown,

00:04:04.838 --> 00:04:09.264
while a common motivational default
in dealing with hard choices,

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.011
rests on a misconception of them.

00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:15.435
It's a mistake to think
that in hard choices,

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.453
one alternative
really is better than the other,

00:04:18.477 --> 00:04:20.436
but we're too stupid to know which,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.903
and since we don't know which,

00:04:21.927 --> 00:04:24.403
we might as well take
the least risky option.

00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:27.183
Even taking two alternatives side by side

00:04:27.207 --> 00:04:30.854
with full information,
a choice can still be hard.

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.155
Hard choices are hard
not because of us or our ignorance;

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:39.421
they're hard because there
is no best option.

00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:43.155
Now, if there's no best option,

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:47.600
if the scales don't tip in favor
of one alternative over another,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.746
then surely the alternatives
must be equally good.

00:04:51.797 --> 00:04:54.068
So maybe the right thing
to say in hard choices

00:04:54.092 --> 00:04:56.315
is that they're
between equally good options.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.931
But that can't be right.

00:04:57.955 --> 00:05:01.509
If alternatives are equally good,
you should just flip a coin between them,

00:05:01.898 --> 00:05:04.309
and it seems a mistake to think,

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:06.883
here's how you should
decide between careers,

00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:08.477
places to live, people to marry:

00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:09.680
Flip a coin.

00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:12.867
There's another reason for thinking

00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:16.978
that hard choices aren't choices
between equally good options.

00:05:18.063 --> 00:05:21.195
Suppose you have a choice
between two jobs:

00:05:21.744 --> 00:05:24.295
you could be an investment banker

00:05:24.708 --> 00:05:26.561
or a graphic artist.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.012
There are a variety of things
that matter in such a choice,

00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:32.591
like the excitement of the work,

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:34.352
achieving financial security,

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.726
having time to raise a family, and so on.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.185
Maybe the artist's career
puts you on the cutting edge

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:43.485
of new forms of pictorial expression.

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:46.845
Maybe the banking career
puts you on the cutting edge

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:49.881
of new forms of financial manipulation.

00:05:50.012 --> 00:05:51.464
(Laughter)

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.560
Imagine the two jobs however you like,

00:05:54.584 --> 00:05:56.545
so that neither is better than the other.

00:05:57.696 --> 00:06:00.649
Now suppose we improve one of them, a bit.

00:06:00.673 --> 00:06:02.657
Suppose the bank, wooing you,

00:06:03.612 --> 00:06:06.044
adds 500 dollars a month to your salary.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:07.782
Does the extra money

00:06:07.806 --> 00:06:11.812
now make the banking job
better than the artist one?

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.557
Not necessarily.

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:19.156
A higher salary makes the banking job
better than it was before,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.798
but it might not be enough

00:06:20.822 --> 00:06:24.410
to make being a banker
better than being an artist.

00:06:25.299 --> 00:06:29.766
But if an improvement in one of the jobs
doesn't make it better than the other,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.073
then the two original jobs
could not have been equally good.

00:06:33.812 --> 00:06:36.209
If you start with two things
that are equally good,

00:06:36.233 --> 00:06:37.574
and you improve one of them,

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:39.684
it now must be better than the other.

00:06:40.653 --> 00:06:43.593
That's not the case
with options in hard choices.

00:06:45.393 --> 00:06:46.953
So now we've got a puzzle.

00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:49.363
We've got two jobs.

00:06:49.387 --> 00:06:52.875
Neither is better than the other,
nor are they equally good.

00:06:53.526 --> 00:06:55.560
So how are we supposed to choose?

00:06:55.955 --> 00:06:58.527
Something seems to have gone wrong here.

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:04.915
Maybe the choice itself is problematic,
and comparison is impossible.

00:07:06.184 --> 00:07:07.724
But that can't be right.

00:07:07.748 --> 00:07:11.703
It's not like we're trying to choose
between two things that can't be compared.

00:07:12.234 --> 00:07:15.111
We're weighing the merits
of two jobs, after all,

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:18.268
not the merits of the number nine
and a plate of fried eggs.

00:07:20.052 --> 00:07:23.396
A comparison of the overall
merits of two jobs

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.307
is something we can make,

00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:27.468
and one we often do make.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.463
I think the puzzle arises

00:07:31.487 --> 00:07:35.265
because of an unreflective assumption
we make about value.

00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:41.433
We unwittingly assume that values
like justice, beauty, kindness,

00:07:42.006 --> 00:07:47.093
are akin to scientific quantities,
like length, mass and weight.

00:07:49.247 --> 00:07:52.338
Take any comparative question
not involving value,

00:07:52.362 --> 00:07:55.169
such as which of two suitcases is heavier.

00:07:55.907 --> 00:07:58.140
There are only three possibilities.

00:07:58.648 --> 00:08:03.690
The weight of one is greater, lesser
or equal to the weight of the other.

00:08:04.605 --> 00:08:07.779
Properties like weight can be
represented by real numbers --

00:08:07.803 --> 00:08:09.741
one, two, three and so on --

00:08:09.765 --> 00:08:12.504
and there are only
three possible comparisons

00:08:12.847 --> 00:08:14.693
between any two real numbers.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.765
One number is greater, lesser,
or equal to the other.

00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:22.197
Not so with values.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.267
As post-Enlightenment creatures,

00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:27.241
we tend to assume

00:08:27.265 --> 00:08:32.169
that scientific thinking holds the key
to everything of importance in our world,

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.616
but the world of value
is different from the world of science.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.228
The stuff of the one world
can be quantified by real numbers.

00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:42.572
The stuff of the other world can't.

00:08:43.712 --> 00:08:47.984
We shouldn't assume that the world of is,
of lengths and weights,

00:08:48.008 --> 00:08:50.915
has the same structure
as the world of ought,

00:08:50.939 --> 00:08:52.166
of what we should do.

00:08:52.904 --> 00:08:54.985
So if what matters to us --

00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:58.523
a child's delight, the love
you have for your partner —

00:08:58.547 --> 00:09:01.351
can't be represented by real numbers,

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:03.317
then there's no reason to believe

00:09:03.341 --> 00:09:07.157
that in choice, there are only
three possibilities --

00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:11.124
that one alternative is better,
worse or equal to the other.

00:09:12.464 --> 00:09:16.706
We need to introduce
a new, fourth relation

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.345
beyond being better, worse or equal,

00:09:20.369 --> 00:09:23.519
that describes what's going on
in hard choices.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.769
I like to say that
the alternatives are "on a par."

00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:29.051
When alternatives are on a par,

00:09:29.075 --> 00:09:32.441
it may matter very much which you choose,

00:09:32.465 --> 00:09:35.380
but one alternative
isn't better than the other.

00:09:35.404 --> 00:09:39.782
Rather, the alternatives are
in the same neighborhood of value,

00:09:39.806 --> 00:09:41.853
in the same league of value,

00:09:41.877 --> 00:09:46.034
while at the same time
being very different in kind of value.

00:09:46.444 --> 00:09:48.603
That's why the choice is hard.

00:09:49.754 --> 00:09:52.163
Understanding hard choices in this way

00:09:52.187 --> 00:09:55.460
uncovers something
about ourselves we didn't know.

00:09:56.266 --> 00:09:59.585
Each of us has the power
to create reasons.

00:10:02.172 --> 00:10:05.486
Imagine a world
in which every choice you face

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.883
is an easy choice,

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:09.183
that is, there's always
a best alternative.

00:10:09.207 --> 00:10:12.590
If there's a best alternative,
then that's the one you should choose,

00:10:12.614 --> 00:10:14.376
because part of being rational

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.115
is doing the better thing
rather than the worse thing,

00:10:17.139 --> 00:10:19.559
choosing what you have
most reason to choose.

00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:22.273
In such a world,

00:10:22.297 --> 00:10:24.698
we'd have most reason

00:10:24.722 --> 00:10:27.169
to wear black socks instead of pink socks,

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:29.129
to eat cereal instead of donuts,

00:10:29.153 --> 00:10:31.207
to live in the city
rather than the country,

00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:33.102
to marry Betty instead of Lolita.

00:10:33.126 --> 00:10:38.653
A world full of only easy choices
would enslave us to reasons.

00:10:39.963 --> 00:10:41.266
When you think about it,

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.480
(Laughter)

00:10:42.504 --> 00:10:47.507
it's nuts to believe
that the reasons given to you

00:10:48.235 --> 00:10:52.982
dictated that you had
most reason to pursue

00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:54.904
the exact hobbies you do,

00:10:55.952 --> 00:10:58.149
to live in the exact house you do,

00:10:58.173 --> 00:11:00.074
to work at the exact job you do.

00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:05.372
Instead, you faced alternatives
that were on a par --

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:07.125
hard choices --

00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:10.162
and you made reasons for yourself

00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:13.766
to choose that hobby,
that house and that job.

00:11:15.004 --> 00:11:17.237
When alternatives are on a par,

00:11:17.261 --> 00:11:18.789
the reasons given to us,

00:11:18.813 --> 00:11:21.769
the ones that determine
whether we're making a mistake,

00:11:21.793 --> 00:11:24.084
are silent as to what to do.

00:11:24.989 --> 00:11:28.678
It's here, in the space of hard choices,

00:11:28.702 --> 00:11:32.344
that we get to exercise
our normative power --

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.792
the power to create reasons for yourself,

00:11:35.816 --> 00:11:40.202
to make yourself into the kind of person

00:11:40.226 --> 00:11:44.130
for whom country living
is preferable to the urban life.

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:48.719
When we choose between options
that are on a par,

00:11:48.743 --> 00:11:51.854
we can do something
really rather remarkable.

00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:55.350
We can put our very selves
behind an option.

00:11:56.325 --> 00:11:58.109
Here's where I stand.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.108
Here's who I am, I am for banking.

00:12:02.132 --> 00:12:04.267
I am for chocolate donuts.

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:05.859
(Laughter)

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.697
This response in hard choices
is a rational response,

00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:13.397
but it's not dictated
by reasons given to us.

00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:17.854
Rather, it's supported
by reasons created by us.

00:12:19.765 --> 00:12:22.332
When we create reasons for ourselves

00:12:22.356 --> 00:12:25.622
to become this kind
of person rather than that,

00:12:25.646 --> 00:12:28.826
we wholeheartedly become
the people that we are.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.048
You might say that we become
the authors of our own lives.

00:12:35.047 --> 00:12:39.644
So when we face hard choices,
we shouldn't beat our head against a wall

00:12:39.668 --> 00:12:42.021
trying to figure out
which alternative is better.

00:12:42.045 --> 00:12:44.010
There is no best alternative.

00:12:44.502 --> 00:12:47.038
Instead of looking for reasons out there,

00:12:47.062 --> 00:12:49.339
we should be looking for reasons in here:

00:12:49.823 --> 00:12:51.342
Who am I to be?

00:12:52.278 --> 00:12:55.720
You might decide to be
a pink sock-wearing,

00:12:55.744 --> 00:12:59.633
cereal-loving, country-living banker,

00:12:59.657 --> 00:13:02.849
and I might decide to be
a black sock-wearing,

00:13:02.873 --> 00:13:04.917
urban, donut-loving artist.

00:13:06.132 --> 00:13:10.478
What we do in hard choices
is very much up to each of us.

00:13:12.887 --> 00:13:17.712
Now, people who don't exercise
their normative powers in hard choices

00:13:17.736 --> 00:13:19.062
are drifters.

00:13:19.513 --> 00:13:21.101
We all know people like that.

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:23.421
I drifted into being a lawyer.

00:13:23.445 --> 00:13:25.579
I didn't put my agency behind lawyering.

00:13:25.603 --> 00:13:27.201
I wasn't for lawyering.

00:13:28.542 --> 00:13:33.415
Drifters allow the world
to write the story of their lives.

00:13:33.439 --> 00:13:37.267
They let mechanisms
of reward and punishment --

00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:41.206
pats on the head, fear,
the easiness of an option --

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.920
to determine what they do.

00:13:43.936 --> 00:13:45.764
So the lesson of hard choices:

00:13:46.373 --> 00:13:50.837
reflect on what you can
put your agency behind,

00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:53.506
on what you can be for,

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.745
and through hard choices,

00:13:55.769 --> 00:13:57.042
become that person.

00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:02.032
Far from being sources of agony and dread,

00:14:02.056 --> 00:14:05.408
hard choices are precious opportunities

00:14:05.432 --> 00:14:09.346
for us to celebrate what is special
about the human condition,

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.973
that the reasons that govern
our choices as correct or incorrect

00:14:13.997 --> 00:14:15.663
sometimes run out,

00:14:15.687 --> 00:14:18.762
and it is here, in the space
of hard choices,

00:14:18.786 --> 00:14:22.903
that we have the power
to create reasons for ourselves

00:14:22.927 --> 00:14:25.782
to become the distinctive
people that we are.

00:14:26.496 --> 00:14:29.222
And that's why hard
choices are not a curse

00:14:29.246 --> 00:14:30.419
but a godsend.

00:14:30.967 --> 00:14:32.138
Thank you.

00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:35.610
(Applause)
