00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:17.478
I would like to share with you
a new model of higher education,

00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:20.284
a model that, once expanded,

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:22.626
can enhance the collective intelligence

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.119
of millions of creative
and motivated individuals

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:29.575
that otherwise would be left behind.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.469
Look at the world.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.281
Pick a place and focus on it.

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:38.354
You will find humans
chasing higher education.

00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:40.636
Let's meet some of them.

00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:42.797
Patrick.

00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:47.615
Patrick was born in Liberia
to a family of 20 children.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.980
During the civil war,

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.923
he and his family were forced
to flee to Nigeria.

00:00:54.468 --> 00:00:57.206
There, in spite of his situation,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.738
he graduated high school
with nearly perfect grades.

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:04.453
He wanted to continue to higher education,

00:01:04.477 --> 00:01:07.737
but due to his family
living on the poverty line,

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:10.268
he was soon sent to South Africa

00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:14.005
to work and send back money
to feed his family.

00:01:15.036 --> 00:01:18.868
Patrick never gave up his dream
of higher education.

00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:21.291
Late at night, after work,

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:25.027
he surfed the net,
looking for ways to study.

00:01:25.827 --> 00:01:27.093
Meet Debbie.

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:28.983
Debbie is from Florida.

00:01:29.897 --> 00:01:34.046
Her parents didn't go to college,
and neither did any of her siblings.

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:36.687
Debbie has worked all her life,

00:01:38.013 --> 00:01:41.823
pays taxes, supports herself
month to month,

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:44.175
proud of the American dream,

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:48.180
a dream that just won't be complete
without higher education.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.589
But Debbie doesn't have the savings
for higher education.

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.523
She can't pay the tuition.

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.829
Neither could she leave work.

00:01:58.094 --> 00:01:59.277
Meet Wael.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.145
Wael is from Syria.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.187
He's experiencing firsthand

00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:09.554
the misery, fear and failure
imposed on his country.

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:13.306
He's a big believer in education.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.363
He knew that if he could find
an opportunity for higher education,

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:20.182
an opportunity to get ahead of the rest,

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:24.667
he has a better chance to survive
in a world turned upside down.

00:02:26.057 --> 00:02:28.059
The higher education system

00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:32.217
failed Patrick, Debbie and Wael,

00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:37.186
exactly as it is failing
millions of potential students --

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.163
millions that graduate high school,

00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:43.575
millions that are qualified
for higher education,

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.103
millions that want to study
yet cannot access it for various reasons.

00:02:49.618 --> 00:02:51.523
First: financial.

00:02:52.412 --> 00:02:55.307
Universities are expensive;
we all know it.

00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:57.435
In large parts of the world,

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.346
higher education is unattainable
for an average citizen.

00:03:02.258 --> 00:03:06.102
This is probably the biggest problem
facing our society.

00:03:06.672 --> 00:03:10.258
Higher education stopped
being a right for all

00:03:10.282 --> 00:03:12.952
and became a privilege for the few.

00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:16.053
Second: cultural.

00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:20.890
Students who are qualified
for higher education

00:03:20.914 --> 00:03:24.153
can afford -- want to study -- cannot,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.428
because it is not decent,
it is not a place for a woman.

00:03:31.047 --> 00:03:34.986
This is the story of countless women
in Africa, for example,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.940
prevented from higher education
because of cultural barriers.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:42.086
And here comes the third reason:

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.922
UNESCO stated that in 2025,

00:03:45.946 --> 00:03:51.590
100 million students will be deprived
of higher education,

00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:56.584
simply because there will not be enough
seats to accommodate them,

00:03:56.608 --> 00:03:58.339
to meet the demand.

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:01.532
They will take a placement test,
they will pass it,

00:04:01.556 --> 00:04:05.863
but they still won't have access,
because there are no places available.

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:12.116
These are the reasons
I founded University of the People,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.023
a nonprofit, tuition-free,
degree-granting university

00:04:17.047 --> 00:04:18.834
to give an alternative,

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:22.352
to create an alternative,
to those who have no other;

00:04:22.376 --> 00:04:27.817
an alternative that will be
affordable and scalable,

00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:33.701
an alternative that will disrupt
the current education system,

00:04:33.725 --> 00:04:37.893
and open the gates to higher education
for every qualified student

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:42.529
regardless of what they earn,
where they live,

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:44.846
or what society says about them.

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.421
Patrick, Debbie and Wael

00:04:47.445 --> 00:04:51.071
are only three examples
out of the 1,700 accepted students

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:53.446
from 143 countries.

00:04:55.492 --> 00:04:56.872
(Applause)

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:58.172
Thank you.

00:04:58.196 --> 00:05:00.004
(Applause)

00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:02.249
We didn't need to reinvent the wheel.

00:05:02.273 --> 00:05:04.785
We just looked at what wasn't working

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:07.548
and used the amazing power of the Internet

00:05:07.572 --> 00:05:08.868
to get around it.

00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:11.923
We set out to build a model

00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:16.924
that will cut down almost entirely
the cost of higher education.

00:05:17.927 --> 00:05:19.412
And that's how we did it.

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.405
First, bricks and mortar cost money.

00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:28.446
Universities have expenses
that virtual universities don't.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.616
We don't need to pass these expenses
on to our students.

00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:33.504
They don't exist.

00:05:33.528 --> 00:05:36.647
We also don't need
to worry about capacity.

00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:40.295
There are no limits of seats
in virtual university.

00:05:40.867 --> 00:05:44.657
Actually, nobody needs to stand
at the back of the lecture hall.

00:05:45.228 --> 00:05:49.119
Textbooks are also something
our students don't need to buy.

00:05:49.803 --> 00:05:52.707
By using open educational resources

00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:55.187
and the generosity of professors

00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:59.723
who are putting their material up
free and accessible,

00:05:59.747 --> 00:06:02.499
we don't need to send
our students to buy textbooks.

00:06:02.523 --> 00:06:04.819
All of our materials come free.

00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:07.241
Even professors,

00:06:07.265 --> 00:06:11.136
the most expensive line
in any university balance sheet,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.816
come free to our students.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.587
Over 3,000 of them,

00:06:15.611 --> 00:06:21.624
including presidents, vice chancellors,
professors and academic advisers

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:27.200
from top universities such as NYU,
Yale, Berkeley and Oxford,

00:06:27.224 --> 00:06:29.502
came on board to help our students.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.984
Finally, is our belief
in peer-to-peer learning.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.600
We use this sound pedagogical model

00:06:37.624 --> 00:06:40.337
to encourage our students
from all over the world

00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:42.691
to interact and study together,

00:06:42.715 --> 00:06:47.754
and also to reduce the time
our professors need

00:06:47.778 --> 00:06:50.030
to labor over class assignments.

00:06:53.006 --> 00:06:58.208
If the Internet has made us
a global village,

00:06:58.232 --> 00:07:01.997
this model can develop
its future leadership.

00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:03.645
Look how we do it.

00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:07.055
We only offer two programs:

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:09.752
business administration
and computer science,

00:07:09.776 --> 00:07:13.934
the two programs most in demand worldwide,

00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:18.175
the two programs that are likeliest
to help our students find a job.

00:07:19.512 --> 00:07:22.250
When our students are accepted,

00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:28.137
they are placed in a small classroom
of 20 to 30 students,

00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:32.313
to ensure that those who need
personalized attention get it.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:38.590
Moreover, for every nine-week course,
they meet a new peer,

00:07:38.614 --> 00:07:42.105
a whole new set of students
from all over the world.

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:45.385
Every week, when they go
into the classroom,

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:48.142
they find the lecture notes of the week,

00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:50.430
the reading assignment,
the homework assignment,

00:07:50.454 --> 00:07:54.381
and the discussion question,
which is the core of our studies.

00:07:54.405 --> 00:07:58.863
Every week, every student must contribute
to the class discussion,

00:07:58.887 --> 00:08:03.085
and also must comment
on the contribution of others.

00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:06.607
This way, we open our students' minds,

00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:11.256
we develop a positive shift in attitude
toward different cultures.

00:08:12.089 --> 00:08:15.830
By the end of each week,
the students take a quiz,

00:08:15.854 --> 00:08:17.177
hand in their homework,

00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:21.403
which are assessed by their peers
under the supervision of the instructors,

00:08:22.292 --> 00:08:24.542
get a grade, move to the next week.

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:27.212
By the end of the course,
they take the final exam,

00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:31.404
get a grade, and follow
to the next course.

00:08:32.703 --> 00:08:37.875
We open the gates for higher education
for every qualified student.

00:08:38.855 --> 00:08:41.769
Every student with a high school diploma,

00:08:41.793 --> 00:08:44.933
sufficient English and Internet connection

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:46.549
can study with us.

00:08:46.573 --> 00:08:49.481
We don't use audio, we don't use video.

00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:51.865
Broadband is not necessary.

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:56.468
Any student from any part of the world
with any Internet connection

00:08:56.492 --> 00:08:57.891
can study with us.

00:08:58.798 --> 00:09:00.170
We are tuition free.

00:09:01.202 --> 00:09:04.819
All we ask our students to cover
is the cost of their exams,

00:09:04.843 --> 00:09:06.922
100 dollars per exam.

00:09:07.396 --> 00:09:11.996
A full-time bachelor's degree
student taking 40 courses

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.017
will pay 1,000 dollars a year,

00:09:14.867 --> 00:09:17.497
4,000 dollars for the entire degree.

00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:21.097
And for those who cannot afford even this,

00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:23.871
we offer them a variety of scholarships.

00:09:23.895 --> 00:09:26.949
It is our mission that nobody
will be left behind

00:09:26.973 --> 00:09:28.423
for financial reasons.

00:09:29.058 --> 00:09:35.114
With 5,000 students in 2016,
this model is financially sustainable.

00:09:37.352 --> 00:09:40.958
Five years ago, it was a vision.

00:09:41.813 --> 00:09:44.139
Today, it is a reality.

00:09:44.862 --> 00:09:49.645
Last month, we got the ultimate
academic endorsement to our model.

00:09:50.325 --> 00:09:53.898
University of the People
is now fully accredited.

00:09:54.743 --> 00:09:56.005
(Applause)

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:57.253
Thank you.

00:09:57.277 --> 00:10:01.225
(Applause)

00:10:01.386 --> 00:10:05.536
With this accreditation,
it's our time now to scale up.

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:09.324
We have demonstrated that our model works.

00:10:10.404 --> 00:10:13.392
I invite universities
and, even more important,

00:10:13.416 --> 00:10:15.085
developing countries' governments,

00:10:15.109 --> 00:10:17.015
to replicate this model

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:21.570
to ensure that the gates of higher
education will open widely.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:23.815
A new era is coming --

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.743
an era that will witness the disruption
of the higher education model

00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:31.211
as we know it today,

00:10:31.931 --> 00:10:34.727
from being a privilege for the few

00:10:35.658 --> 00:10:41.051
to becoming a basic right,
affordable and accessible for all.

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:43.098
Thank you.

00:10:43.122 --> 00:10:47.344
(Applause)
