00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.176
I was a new mother

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.456
and a young rabbi

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.336
in the spring of 2004

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.600
and the world was in shambles.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.496
Maybe you remember.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.656
Every day, we heard devastating reports
from the war in Iraq.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.536
There were waves of terror
rolling across the globe.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.240
It seemed like humanity
was spinning out of control.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.856
I remember the night that I read

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.016
about the series of coordinated bombings

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.736
in the subway system in Madrid,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.816
and I got up and I walked over to the crib

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.256
where my six-month-old baby girl

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.136
lay sleeping sweetly,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.496
and I heard the rhythm of her breath,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.096
and I felt this sense of urgency
coursing through my body.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.176
We were living through a time
of tectonic shifts in ideologies,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.856
in politics, in religion, in populations.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.960
Everything felt so precarious.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.736
And I remember thinking,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.360
"My God, what kind of world
did we bring this child into?

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.016
And what was I as a mother
and a religious leader

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.560
willing to do about it?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.616
Of course, I knew it was clear

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.536
that religion would be
a principle battlefield

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.016
in this rapidly changing landscape,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.736
and it was already clear

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.480
that religion was a significant
part of the problem.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.376
The question for me was,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.880
could religion
also be part of the solution?

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.096
Now, throughout history,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.336
people have committed
horrible crimes and atrocities

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.000
in the name of religion.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.616
And as we entered the 21st century,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.360
it was very clear that religious extremism
was once again on the rise.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.016
Our studies now show

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.296
that over the course
of the past 15, 20 years,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.456
hostilities and religion-related violence

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.416
have been on the increase
all over the world.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.696
But we don't even need
the studies to prove it,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.896
because I ask you,
how many of us are surprised today

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.696
when we hear the stories
of a bombing or a shooting,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.536
when we later find out
that the last word that was uttered

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.376
before the trigger is pulled
or the bomb is detonated

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.016
is the name of God?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.696
It barely raises an eyebrow today

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.656
when we learn that yet another person

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.216
has decided to show his love of God

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.480
by taking the lives of God's children.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.096
In America, religious extremism

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.656
looks like a white,
antiabortion Christian extremist

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.896
walking into Planned Parenthood
in Colorado Springs

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.776
and murdering three people.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.056
It also looks like a couple

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.896
inspired by the Islamic State

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.536
walking into an office party
in San Bernardino and killing 14.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.376
And even when religion-related extremism
does not lead to violence,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.416
it is still used
as a political wedge issue,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.536
cynically leading people
to justify the subordination of women,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.016
the stigmatization of LGBT people,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.640
racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.416
This ought to concern deeply

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.376
those of us who care
about the future of religion

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.616
and the future of faith.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.016
We need to call this what it is:

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.200
a great failure of religion.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.960
But the thing is, this isn't even the only
challenge that religion faces today.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.776
At the very same time

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.416
that we need religion
to be a strong force against extremism,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.456
it is suffering
from a second pernicious trend,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.280
what I call religious routine-ism.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.416
This is when our institutions
and our leaders

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.216
are stuck in a paradigm
that is rote and perfunctory,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.296
devoid of life, devoid of vision

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.040
and devoid of soul.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.896
Let me explain what I mean like this.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.696
One of the great blessings
of being a rabbi

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.376
is standing under the chuppah,
under the wedding canopy, with a couple,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.656
and helping them proclaim publicly

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.936
and make holy the love
that they found for one another.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.896
I want to ask you now, though,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.816
to think maybe from your own experience

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.256
or maybe just imagine it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.176
about the difference
between the intensity of the experience

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.936
under the wedding canopy,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.176
and maybe the experience
of the sixth or seventh anniversary.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.656
(Laughter)

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.576
And if you're lucky enough
to make it 16 or 17 years,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.576
if you're like most people,
you probably wake up in the morning

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.136
realizing that you forgot to make
a reservation at your favorite restaurant

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.776
and you forgot so much as a card,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.880
and then you just hope and pray
that your partner also forgot.

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:36.576
Well, religious ritual and rites

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.136
were essentially designed
to serve the function of the anniversary,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.176
to be a container in which
we would hold on to the remnants

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.096
of that sacred, revelatory encounter

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.216
that birthed the religion
in the first place.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.736
The problem is that after a few centuries,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.000
the date remains on the calendar,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.536
but the love affair is long dead.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.856
That's when we find ourselves
in endless, mindless repetitions

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.096
of words that don't mean anything to us,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.856
rising and being seated
because someone has asked us to,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.776
holding onto jealously guarded doctrine

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.656
that's completely and wildly out of step
with our contemporary reality,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.216
engaging in perfunctory practice

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.760
simply because that's the way
things have always been done.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.576
Religion is waning in the United States.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.536
Across the board,
churches and synagogues and mosques

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.160
are all complaining

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.976
about how hard it is to maintain relevance

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.136
for a generation of young people
who seem completely uninterested,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.816
not only in the institutions
that stand at the heart of our traditions

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.416
but even in religion itself.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.480
And what they need to understand

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.016
is that there is today
a generation of people

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.896
who are as disgusted by the violence
of religious extremism

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.616
as they are turned off

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.960
by the lifelessness
of religious routine-ism.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.480
Of course there is
a bright spot to this story.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.256
Given the crisis of these two
concurrent trends in religious life,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.976
about 12 or 13 years ago,
I set out to try to determine

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.536
if there was any way

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.736
that I could reclaim the heart
of my own Jewish tradition,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.376
to help make it meaningful
and purposeful again

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.840
in a world on fire.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.936
I started to wonder,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.096
what if we could harness
some of the great minds of our generation

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.096
and think in a bold and robust
and imaginative way again

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.216
about what the next iteration
of religious life would look like?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.296
Now, we had no money,
no space, no game plan,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.776
but we did have email.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.496
So my friend Melissa and I
sat down and we wrote an email

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.376
which we sent out
to a few friends and colleagues.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.216
It basically said this:

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.160
"Before you bail on religion,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.616
why don't we come together
this Friday night

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.760
and see what we might make
of our own Jewish inheritance?"

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.896
We hoped maybe 20 people would show up.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.480
It turned out 135 people came.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.536
They were cynics and seekers,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.296
atheists and rabbis.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.856
Many people said that night
that it was the first time

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.176
that they had a meaningful religious
experience in their entire lives.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.536
And so I set out to do the only
rational thing

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.696
that someone would do
in such a circumstance:

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.656
I quit my job and tried to build
this audacious dream,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.720
a reinvented, rethought religious life

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.736
which we called "IKAR,"

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.936
which means "the essence"
or "the heart of the matter."

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.056
Now, IKAR is not alone

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.616
out there in the religious
landscape today.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.456
There are Jewish and Christian
and Muslim and Catholic religious leaders,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.776
many of them women, by the way,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.816
who have set out to reclaim
the heart of our traditions,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.040
who firmly believe that now is the time
for religion to be part of the solution.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.056
We are going back
into our sacred traditions

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.816
and recognizing that all of our traditions

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.136
contain the raw material
to justify violence and extremism,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.976
and also contain the raw material
to justify compassion,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.416
coexistence and kindness --

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.256
that when others choose to read our texts
as directives for hate and vengeance,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.896
we can choose to read those same texts

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.520
as directives for love
and for forgiveness.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.616
I have found now

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.120
in communities as varied
as Jewish indie start-ups on the coasts

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.776
to a woman's mosque,

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.456
to black churches
in New York and in North Carolina,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.776
to a holy bus loaded with nuns

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.159
that traverses this country
with a message of justice and peace,

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:47.895
that there is a shared religious ethos

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:53.576
that is now emerging in the form
of revitalized religion in this country.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.736
And while the theologies
and the practices vary very much

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.456
between these independent communities,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.896
what we can see are some common,
consistent threads between them.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.960
I'm going to share with you
four of those commitments now.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.016
The first is wakefulness.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.936
We live in a time today

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.456
in which we have unprecedented access

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.376
to information about every global tragedy

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.856
that happens on every corner
of this Earth.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.576
Within 12 hours, 20 million people

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.176
saw that image
of Aylan Kurdi's little body

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.576
washed up on the Turkish shore.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.960
We all saw this picture.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.256
We saw this picture
of a five-year-old child

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.720
pulled out of the rubble
of his building in Aleppo.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.536
And once we see these images,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.200
we are called to a certain kind of action.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.936
My tradition tells a story
of a traveler who is walking down a road

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.496
when he sees a beautiful house on fire,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.056
and he says, "How can it be
that something so beautiful would burn,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.616
and nobody seems to even care?"

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.736
So too we learn that our world is on fire,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.496
and it is our job to keep our hearts
and our eyes open,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.056
and to recognize
that it's our responsibility

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.656
to help put out the flames.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.736
This is extremely difficult to do.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.536
Psychologists tell us that the more
we learn about what's broken in our world,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.896
the less likely we are to do anything.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.496
It's called psychic numbing.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.080
We just shut down at a certain point.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.576
Well, somewhere along the way,
our religious leaders forgot

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.896
that it's our job
to make people uncomfortable.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.976
It's our job to wake people up,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.136
to pull them out of their apathy

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.616
and into the anguish,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.096
and to insist that we do
what we don't want to do

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.456
and see what we do not want to see.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.856
Because we know
that social change only happens --

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.936
(Applause)

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.840
when we are awake enough
to see that the house is on fire.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.696
The second principle is hope,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.340
and I want to say this about hope.

00:10:53.364 --> 00:10:55.496
Hope is not naive,

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.456
and hope is not an opiate.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.536
Hope may be the single
greatest act of defiance

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.896
against a politics of pessimism

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.336
and against a culture of despair.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.256
Because what hope does for us

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.056
is it lifts us out of the container

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.776
that holds us and constrains us
from the outside,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.536
and says, "You can dream
and think expansively again.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.960
That they cannot control in you."

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.776
I saw hope made manifest
in an African-American church

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.336
in the South Side of Chicago this summer,

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.016
where I brought my little girl,

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.256
who is now 13

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.976
and a few inches taller than me,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.800
to hear my friend Rev. Otis Moss preach.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:41.056
That summer, there had already been
3,000 people shot

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.400
between January and July in Chicago.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.136
We went into that church
and heard Rev. Moss preach,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.096
and after he did,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.376
this choir of gorgeous women,
100 women strong,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.360
stood up and began to sing.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.336
"I need you. You need me.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.040
I love you. I need you to survive."

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.416
And I realized in that moment

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.016
that this is what religion
is supposed to be about.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.736
It's supposed to be about
giving people back a sense of purpose,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.256
a sense of hope,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.216
a sense that they and their dreams
fundamentally matter in this world

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.800
that tells them
that they don't matter at all.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.536
The third principle
is the principle of mightiness.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.216
There's a rabbinic tradition
that we are to walk around

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.536
with two slips of paper in our pockets.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.976
One says, "I am but dust and ashes."

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.696
It's not all about me.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.240
I can't control everything,
and I cannot do this on my own.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.136
The other slip of paper says,
"For my sake the world was created."

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.280
Which is to say it's true
that I can't do everything,

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.240
but I can surely do something.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.816
I can forgive.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.040
I can love.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.056
I can show up.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.696
I can protest.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.896
I can be a part of this conversation.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.776
We even now have a religious ritual,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.016
a posture,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.736
that holds the paradox
between powerlessness and power.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.976
In the Jewish community,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.296
the only time of year
that we prostrate fully to the ground

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.976
is during the high holy days.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.240
It's a sign of total submission.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.896
Now in our community,
when we get up off the ground,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.416
we stand with our hands
raised to the heavens,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:31.056
and we say, "I am strong,
I am mighty, and I am worthy.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.440
I can't do everything,
but I can do something."

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.616
In a world that conspires
to make us believe that we are invisible

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.176
and that we are impotent,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.936
religious communities and religious ritual

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.576
can remind us that for whatever
amount of time we have here on this Earth,

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.056
whatever gifts and blessings
we were given,

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.816
whatever resources we have,

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.176
we can and we must use them

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.776
to try to make the world
a little bit more just

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.181
and a little bit more loving.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.856
The fourth and final
is interconnectedness.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.136
A few years ago, there was a man
walking on the beach in Alaska,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.096
when he came across a soccer ball

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.616
that had some Japanese
letters written on it.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.976
He took a picture of it
and posted it up on social media,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.696
and a Japanese teenager contacted him.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.496
He had lost everything in the tsunami
that devastated his country,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.216
but he was able
to retrieve that soccer ball

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.256
after it had floated
all the way across the Pacific.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.056
How small our world has become.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.896
It's so hard for us to remember
how interconnected we all are

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.120
as human beings.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.696
And yet, we know

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.416
that it is systems of oppression

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.536
that benefit the most
from the lie of radical individualism.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.376
Let me tell you how this works.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.336
I'm not supposed to care

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.816
when black youth are harassed by police,

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.136
because my white-looking Jewish kids

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.056
probably won't ever get pulled over
for the crime of driving while black.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.096
Well, not so, because
this is also my problem.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.296
And guess what?
Transphobia and Islamophobia

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.856
and racism of all forms,
those are also all of our problems.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.336
And so too is anti-Semitism
all of our problems.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.056
Because Emma Lazarus was right.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.400
(Applause)

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.896
Emma Lazarus was right
when she said until all of us are free,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.856
we are none of us free.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.960
We are all in this together.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.296
And now somewhere at the intersection
of these four trends,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:36.056
of wakefulness and hope
and mightiness and interconnectedness,

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.616
there is a burgeoning, multifaith
justice movement in this country

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.896
that is staking a claim on a countertrend,

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:48.056
saying that religion can and must be
a force for good in the world.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.096
Our hearts hurt from
the failed religion of extremism,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.336
and we deserve more
than the failed religion of routine-ism.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.136
It is time for religious leaders
and religious communities

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.536
to take the lead in the spiritual
and cultural shift

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.256
that this country and the world
so desperately needs --

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.416
a shift toward love,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.336
toward justice, toward equality
and toward dignity for all.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.800
I believe that our children
deserve no less than that.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.576
Thank you.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:26.124
(Applause)
