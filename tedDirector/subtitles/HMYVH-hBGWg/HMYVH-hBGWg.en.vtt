00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Information technology grows in an exponential manner.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
It's not linear. And our intuition is linear.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
When we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
we made linear predictions where that animal would be,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
and that worked fine. It's hardwired in our brains.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
But the pace of exponential growth

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
is really what describes information technologies.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
And it's not just computation.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.160
If I take 30 steps linearly -- one, two, three, four, five --

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
I get to 30.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
If I take 30 steps exponentially -- two, four, eight, 16 --

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
I get to a billion.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
It makes a huge difference.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
And that really describes information technology.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
When I was a student at MIT,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
we all shared one computer that took up a whole building.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
The computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
a million times smaller,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
a thousand times more powerful.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
That's a billion-fold increase in capability per dollar

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
that we've actually experienced since I was a student.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
And we're going to do it again in the next 25 years.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Information technology progresses

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
through a series of S-curves

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
where each one is a different paradigm.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
So people say, "What's going to happen when Moore's Law comes to an end?"

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
Which will happen around 2020.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
We'll then go to the next paradigm.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
to bring exponential growth to computing.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
The exponential growth of computing started

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
decades before Gordon Moore was even born.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.160
And it doesn't just apply to computation.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
It's really any technology where we can measure

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
the underlying information properties.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
Here we have 49 famous computers. I put them in a logarithmic graph.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
The logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
because this represents trillions-fold increase

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
since the 1890 census.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
In 1950s they were shrinking vacuum tubes,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
making them smaller and smaller. They finally hit a wall;

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
they couldn't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
We went to the fourth paradigm, transistors,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
and finally integrated circuits.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
When that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
three-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
But what's even more amazing, really, than this

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
fantastic scale of progress,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
is that -- look at how predictable this is.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
I mean this went through thick and thin,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
through war and peace, through boom times and recessions.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.160
The Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.160
We'll see the same thing in the economic recession we're having now.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
At least the exponential growth of information technology capability

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
will continue unabated.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
And I just updated these graphs.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
Because I had them through 2002 in my book, "The Singularity is Near."

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
So we updated them,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
so I could present it here, to 2007.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
And I was asked, "Well aren't you nervous?

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.160
Maybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression."

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
I was a little nervous

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
because maybe the data wouldn't be right,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
but I've done this now for 30 years,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
and it has stayed on this exponential progression.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
Look at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in 1968.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
You can buy half a billion today,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
and they are actually better, because they are faster.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
But look at how predictable this is.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
And I'd say this knowledge is over-fitting to past data.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.160
I've been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
And the cost of a transistor cycle,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
which is a measure of the price performance of electronics,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
comes down about every year.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
That's a 50 percent deflation rate.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
And it's also true of other examples,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
like DNA data or brain data.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
But we more than make up for that.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
We actually ship more than twice as much

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
of every form of information technology.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
We've had 18 percent growth in constant dollars

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
in every form of information technology for the last half-century,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.160
despite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
This is a completely different example.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
This is not Moore's Law.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
The amount of DNA data

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
we've sequenced has doubled every year.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
The cost has come down by half every year.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
And this has been a smooth progression

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
since the beginning of the genome project.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
And halfway through the project, skeptics said,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
"Well, this is not working out. You're halfway through the genome project

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
and you've finished one percent of the project."

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
But that was really right on schedule.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
Because if you double one percent seven more times,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
which is exactly what happened,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
you get 100 percent. And the project was finished on time.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
Communication technologies:

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
50 different ways to measure this,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
the number of bits being moved around, the size of the Internet.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
But this has progressed at an exponential pace.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
This is deeply democratizing.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
I wrote, over 20 years ago in "The Age of Intelligent Machines,"

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
when the Soviet Union was going strong, that it would be swept away

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.160
by this growth of decentralized communication.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
And we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.160
to do things like simulate regions of the human brain.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
But where will we get the software?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
Some critics say, "Oh, well software is stuck in the mud."

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
But we are learning more and more about the human brain.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
Spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
The amount of data we're getting about the brain is doubling every year.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
And we're showing that we can actually turn this data

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
into working models and simulations of brain regions.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
There is about 20 regions of the brain that have been modeled,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
simulated and tested:

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
the auditory cortex, regions of the visual cortex;

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
cerebellum, where we do our skill formation;

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.160
slices of the cerebral cortex, where we do our rational thinking.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
And all of this has fueled

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
an increase, very smooth and predictable, of productivity.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
We've gone from 30 dollars to 130 dollars

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160
in constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
fueled by this information technology.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
And we're all concerned about energy and the environment.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
Well this is a logarithmic graph.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
This represents a smooth doubling,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.160
every two years, of the amount of solar energy we're creating,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
particularly as we're now applying nanotechnology,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
a form of information technology, to solar panels.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
And we're only eight doublings away

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
from it meeting 100 percent of our energy needs.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.160
And there is 10 thousand times more sunlight than we need.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.160
We ultimately will merge with this technology. It's already very close to us.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
When I was a student it was across campus, now it's in our pockets.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
What used to take up a building now fits in our pockets.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
What now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.160
And we will begin to actually deeply influence

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
our health and our intelligence,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
as we get closer and closer to this technology.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
Based on that we are announcing, here at TED,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
in true TED tradition, Singularity University.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
It's a new university

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
that's founded by Peter Diamandis, who is here in the audience,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
and myself.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
It's backed by NASA and Google,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.160
and other leaders in the high-tech and science community.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
And our goal was to assemble the leaders,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
both teachers and students,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
in these exponentially growing information technologies,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
and their application.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
But Larry Page made an impassioned speech

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
at our organizing meeting,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.160
saying we should devote this study

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.160
to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
And if we did that, then Google would back this.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
And so that's what we've done.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.160
The last third of the nine-week intensive summer session

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
will be devoted to a group project to address

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
some major challenge of humanity.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
Like for example, applying the Internet,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.160
which is now ubiquitous, in the rural areas of China or in Africa,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
to bringing health information

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
to developing areas of the world.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
And these projects will continue past these sessions,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
using collaborative interactive communication.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.160
All the intellectual property that is created and taught

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
will be online and available,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
and developed online in a collaborative fashion.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
Here is our founding meeting.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
But this is being announced today.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
It will be permanently headquartered in Silicon Valley,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
at the NASA Ames research center.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
There are different programs for graduate students,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
for executives at different companies.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
The first six tracks here -- artificial intelligence,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
advanced computing technologies, biotechnology, nanotechnology --

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.160
are the different core areas of information technology.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
Then we are going to apply them to the other areas,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
like energy, ecology,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
policy law and ethics, entrepreneurship,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.160
so that people can bring these new technologies to the world.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.160
So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160
from both the intellectual leaders, the high-tech leaders,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
particularly Google and NASA.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
This is an exciting new venture.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.160
And we invite you to participate. Thank you very much.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
(Applause)
