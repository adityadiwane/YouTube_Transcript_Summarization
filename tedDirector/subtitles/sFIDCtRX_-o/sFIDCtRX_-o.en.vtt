00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.460
This is what my last week looked like.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.196
What I did,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.036
who I was with,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.180
the main sensations I had
for every waking hour ...

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.396
If the feeling came as I thought of my dad

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.196
who recently passed away,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.276
or if I could have just definitely
avoided the worries and anxieties.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.236
And if you think I'm a little obsessive,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.116
you're probably right.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.396
But clearly, from this visualization,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.716
you can learn much more about me
than from this other one,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.716
which are images you're
probably more familiar with

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.556
and which you possibly even have
on your phone right now.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.796
Bar charts for the steps you walked,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.196
pie charts for the quality
of your sleep --

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.940
the path of your morning runs.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.396
In my day job, I work with data.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.916
I run a data visualization design company,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.276
and we design and develop ways
to make information accessible

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.396
through visual representations.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.436
What my job has taught me over the years

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.676
is that to really understand data
and their true potential,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.796
sometimes we actually
have to forget about them

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.580
and see through them instead.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.836
Because data are always
just a tool we use to represent reality.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.716
They're always used
as a placeholder for something else,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.916
but they are never the real thing.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.876
But let me step back for a moment

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.380
to when I first understood
this personally.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.436
In 1994, I was 13 years old.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.396
I was a teenager in Italy.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.036
I was too young
to be interested in politics,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.556
but I knew that a businessman,
Silvio Berlusconi,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.140
was running for president
for the moderate right.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.956
We lived in a very liberal town,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.276
and my father was a politician
for the Democratic Party.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.636
And I remember that no one thought
that Berlusconi could get elected --

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.420
that was totally not an option.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.596
But it happened.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.156
And I remember the feeling very vividly.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.036
It was a complete surprise,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.100
as my dad promised that in my town
he knew nobody who voted for him.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.036
This was the first time

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.620
when the data I had gave me
a completely distorted image of reality.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.396
My data sample was actually
pretty limited and skewed,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.156
so probably it was because of that,
I thought, I lived in a bubble,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.780
and I didn't have enough chances
to see outside of it.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.676
Now, fast-forward to November 8, 2016

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.900
in the United States.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.076
The internet polls,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.476
statistical models,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.316
all the pundits agreeing on a possible
outcome for the presidential election.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.956
It looked like we had
enough information this time,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.076
and many more chances to see outside
the closed circle we lived in --

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.420
but we clearly didn't.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.956
The feeling felt very familiar.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.460
I had been there before.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.036
I think it's fair to say
the data failed us this time --

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.916
and pretty spectacularly.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.636
We believed in data,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.076
but what happened,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.796
even with the most respected newspaper,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.516
is that the obsession to reduce everything
to two simple percentage numbers

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.516
to make a powerful headline

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.596
made us focus on these two digits

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.820
and them alone.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.436
In an effort to simplify the message

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.876
and draw a beautiful,
inevitable red and blue map,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.780
we lost the point completely.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.396
We somehow forgot
that there were stories --

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.780
stories of human beings
behind these numbers.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.636
In a different context,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.316
but to a very similar point,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.236
a peculiar challenge was presented
to my team by this woman.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.636
She came to us with a lot of data,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.076
but ultimately she wanted to tell
one of the most humane stories possible.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.796
She's Samantha Cristoforetti.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.396
She has been the first
Italian woman astronaut,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.916
and she contacted us before being launched

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.836
on a six-month-long expedition
to the International Space Station.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.076
She told us, "I'm going to space,

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.196
and I want to do something meaningful
with the data of my mission

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.460
to reach out to people."

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.956
A mission to the
International Space Station

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.076
comes with terabytes of data

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.476
about anything you can possibly imagine --

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.996
the orbits around Earth,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.116
the speed and position of the ISS

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.820
and all of the other thousands
of live streams from its sensors.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.556
We had all of the hard data
we could think of --

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.996
just like the pundits
before the election --

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.996
but what is the point
of all these numbers?

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.756
People are not interested
in data for the sake of it,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.635
because numbers are never the point.

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.620
They're always the means to an end.

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.436
The story we needed to tell

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.956
is that there is a human being
in a teeny box

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.236
flying in space above your head,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.356
and that you can actually see her
with your naked eye on a clear night.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.476
So we decided to use data
to create a connection

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.556
between Samantha and all of the people
looking at her from below.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.756
We designed and developed
what we called "Friends in Space,"

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.436
a web application that simply
lets you say "hello" to Samantha

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.716
from where you are,

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.276
and "hello" to all the people
who are online at the same time

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.820
from all over the world.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.916
And all of these "hellos"
left visible marks on the map

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.956
as Samantha was flying by

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.356
and as she was actually
waving back every day at us

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.060
using Twitter from the ISS.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.676
This made people see the mission's data
from a very different perspective.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.396
It all suddenly became much more
about our human nature and our curiosity,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.076
rather than technology.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.436
So data powered the experience,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.860
but stories of human beings
were the drive.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.996
The very positive response
of its thousands of users

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.956
taught me a very important lesson --

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.836
that working with data
means designing ways

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.596
to transform the abstract
and the uncountable

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.636
into something that can be seen,
felt and directly reconnected

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.956
to our lives and to our behaviors,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.836
something that is hard to achieve

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.756
if we let the obsession for the numbers
and the technology around them

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.060
lead us in the process.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.316
But we can do even more to connect data
to the stories they represent.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.996
We can remove technology completely.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.276
A few years ago, I met this other woman,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.676
Stefanie Posavec --

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.516
a London-based designer who shares with me
the passion and obsession about data.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.876
We didn't know each other,

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.156
but we decided to run
a very radical experiment,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.716
starting a communication using only data,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.076
no other language,

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.716
and we opted for using no technology
whatsoever to share our data.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.636
In fact, our only means of communication

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.516
would be through
the old-fashioned post office.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.996
For "Dear Data," every week for one year,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.476
we used our personal data
to get to know each other --

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.156
personal data around weekly
shared mundane topics,

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.396
from our feelings

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.276
to the interactions with our partners,

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.460
from the compliments we received
to the sounds of our surroundings.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.836
Personal information
that we would then manually hand draw

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.356
on a postcard-size sheet of paper

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.316
that we would every week
send from London to New York,

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.596
where I live,

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.820
and from New York to London,
where she lives.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.996
The front of the postcard
is the data drawing,

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.316
and the back of the card

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.769
contains the address
of the other person, of course,

00:07:13.793 --> 00:07:16.433
and the legend for how
to interpret our drawing.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.476
The very first week into the project,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.556
we actually chose
a pretty cold and impersonal topic.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.780
How many times do we
check the time in a week?

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.476
So here is the front of my card,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.476
and you can see that every little symbol

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.916
represents all of the times
that I checked the time,

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.316
positioned for days
and different hours chronologically --

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.380
nothing really complicated here.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.596
But then you see in the legend

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.076
how I added anecdotal details
about these moments.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.676
In fact, the different types of symbols
indicate why I was checking the time --

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.916
what was I doing?

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.636
Was I bored? Was I hungry?

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.876
Was I late?

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.116
Did I check it on purpose
or just casually glance at the clock?

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.396
And this is the key part --

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.116
representing the details
of my days and my personality

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.076
through my data collection.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.796
Using data as a lens or a filter
to discover and reveal, for example,

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.996
my never-ending anxiety for being late,

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.220
even though I'm absolutely always on time.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.116
Stefanie and I spent one year
collecting our data manually

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.636
to force us to focus on the nuances
that computers cannot gather --

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.196
or at least not yet --

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.716
using data also to explore our minds
and the words we use,

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.676
and not only our activities.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.116
Like at week number three,

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.956
where we tracked the "thank yous"
we said and were received,

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.636
and when I realized that I thank
mostly people that I don't know.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.996
Apparently I'm a compulsive thanker
to waitresses and waiters,

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.180
but I definitely don't thank enough
the people who are close to me.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.076
Over one year,

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.596
the process of actively noticing
and counting these types of actions

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.916
became a ritual.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.996
It actually changed ourselves.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.716
We became much more
in tune with ourselves,

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.860
much more aware of our behaviors
and our surroundings.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.476
Over one year, Stefanie and I
connected at a very deep level

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.516
through our shared data diary,

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.836
but we could do this only because
we put ourselves in these numbers,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.836
adding the contexts
of our very personal stories to them.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.316
It was the only way
to make them truly meaningful

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.540
and representative of ourselves.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.396
I am not asking you
to start drawing your personal data,

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.276
or to find a pen pal across the ocean.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.876
But I'm asking you to consider data --

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.356
all kind of data --

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.156
as the beginning of the conversation

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.380
and not the end.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.076
Because data alone
will never give us a solution.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.796
And this is why data failed us so badly --

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.196
because we failed to include
the right amount of context

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.676
to represent reality --

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.900
a nuanced, complicated
and intricate reality.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.236
We kept looking at these two numbers,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.756
obsessing with them

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.276
and pretending that our world
could be reduced

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.636
to a couple digits and a horse race,

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.916
while the real stories,

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.396
the ones that really mattered,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.836
were somewhere else.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.276
What we missed looking at these stories
only through models and algorithms

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.820
is what I call "data humanism."

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.396
In the Renaissance humanism,

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.036
European intellectuals

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.980
placed the human nature instead of God
at the center of their view of the world.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.836
I believe something similar
needs to happen

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.636
with the universe of data.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.636
Now data are apparently
treated like a God --

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.940
keeper of infallible truth
for our present and our future.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.556
The experiences
that I shared with you today

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.596
taught me that to make data faithfully
representative of our human nature

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.036
and to make sure they will not
mislead us anymore,

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.756
we need to start designing ways
to include empathy, imperfection

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.356
and human qualities

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.100
in how we collect, process,
analyze and display them.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.076
I do see a place where, ultimately,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.436
instead of using data
only to become more efficient,

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.260
we will all use data
to become more humane.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.916
Thank you.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.381
