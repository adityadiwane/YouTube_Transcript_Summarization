00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.734
Good evening.

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:19.669
We are in this wonderful

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.549
open-air amphitheater

00:00:21.549 --> 00:00:23.303
and we are enjoying ourselves

00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.005
in that mild evening

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:26.293
temperature tonight,

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:30.610
but when Qatar will host

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.152
the football World Cup

00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:33.997
10 years from now,

00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:35.469
2022,

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:36.701
we already heard it will be

00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:40.349
in the hot, very hot and sunny

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:42.693
summer months of June and July.

00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:45.006
And when Qatar has been assigned

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:46.637
to the World Cup all, many

00:00:46.637 --> 00:00:48.538
people around the world have been

00:00:48.538 --> 00:00:49.889
wondering, how would it be

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:52.112
possible that football players

00:00:52.112 --> 00:00:54.273
show spectacular football,

00:00:54.273 --> 00:00:55.478
run around in this desert

00:00:55.478 --> 00:00:57.009
climate? How would it be

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:59.904
possible that spectators sit,

00:00:59.904 --> 00:01:02.896
enjoy themselves in open-air

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:06.105
stadia in this hot environment?

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:07.746
Together with the architects of

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:09.688
Albert Speer &amp; Partner, our engineers

00:01:09.688 --> 00:01:11.544
from Transsolar have been

00:01:11.544 --> 00:01:13.328
supporting, have been developing

00:01:13.328 --> 00:01:16.991
open-air stadia based on 100 percent

00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:21.425
solar power, on 100 percent solar cooling.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:22.832
Let me tell you about that,

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:24.496
but let me start with comfort.

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:25.807
Let me start with the aspect

00:01:25.807 --> 00:01:27.513
of comfort, because many people

00:01:27.513 --> 00:01:30.535
are confusing

00:01:30.535 --> 00:01:32.689
ambient temperature

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.417
with thermal comfort.

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:35.945
We are used to looking at charts like

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:37.936
that, and you see this red line

00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:39.288
showing the air temperature

00:01:39.288 --> 00:01:40.770
in June and July, and yes, that's right,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.041
it's picking up to 45 degrees C.

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.881
It's actually very hot.

00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:48.400
But air temperature is not

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.001
the full set of climatic

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.414
parameters which define comfort.

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:54.305
Let me show you analysis

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:57.833
a colleague of mine did looking

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.409
on different football, World Cups,

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.321
Olympic Games around the world,

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:03.617
looking on the comfort

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:05.048
and analyzing the comfort

00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:07.848
people have perceived at these

00:02:07.848 --> 00:02:09.552
different sport activities,

00:02:09.552 --> 00:02:11.401
and let me start with Mexico.

00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.970
Mexico temperature has been, air

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.674
temperature has been something between

00:02:14.674 --> 00:02:17.721
15, up to 30 degrees C, and people

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.497
enjoyed themselves.

00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:21.369
It was a very comfortable game

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:23.664
in Mexico City. Have a look.

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:26.097
Orlando, same kind of stadium,

00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:28.658
open-air stadium. People have

00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:31.402
been sitting in the strong sun,

00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:33.249
in the very high humidity

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:34.364
in the afternoon, and they

00:02:34.364 --> 00:02:36.170
did not enjoy. It was not comfortable.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.137
The air temperature was not too high, but it was not

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:40.985
comfortable during these games.

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:42.680
What about Seoul? Seoul, because

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.112
of broadcast rights, all the

00:02:45.112 --> 00:02:46.417
games have been in the late

00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:47.944
afternoon. Sun has already been

00:02:47.944 --> 00:02:50.337
set, so the games have been

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.897
perceived as comfortable.

00:02:52.897 --> 00:02:55.761
What about Athens? Mediterranean

00:02:55.761 --> 00:02:58.050
climate, but in the sun it was

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.776
not comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort.

00:03:00.776 --> 00:03:02.417
And we know that from Spain,

00:03:02.417 --> 00:03:04.929
we know that "sol y sombra."

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.097
If you have a ticket, and you

00:03:07.097 --> 00:03:08.809
get a ticket for the shade,

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.017
you pay more, because you're

00:03:11.017 --> 00:03:14.778
in a more comfortable environment.

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:16.057
What about Beijing?

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:18.721
It's again, sun in the day

00:03:18.721 --> 00:03:20.449
and high humidity,

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:21.712
and it was not comfortable.

00:03:21.712 --> 00:03:22.992
So if I overlay, and if you

00:03:22.992 --> 00:03:24.681
overlay all these comfort

00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:26.600
envelopes, what we see is,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.856
in all these places, air temperature has

00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:32.690
been ranging something from 25

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.594
to 35, and if you go on

00:03:34.594 --> 00:03:37.353
the line, 30, of 30 degrees C

00:03:37.353 --> 00:03:38.802
ambient temperatures. If you

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.455
go along that line you see

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:42.976
there has been all kind of

00:03:42.976 --> 00:03:45.209
comfort, all kinds of perceived

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.018
outdoor comfort, ranging from

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.203
very comfortable

00:03:48.203 --> 00:03:50.074
to very uncomfortable.

00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:52.923
So why is that?

00:03:52.923 --> 00:03:54.619
This is because there are

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:56.706
more parameters influencing

00:03:56.706 --> 00:03:58.612
our thermal comfort, which is

00:03:58.612 --> 00:04:01.005
the sun, the direct sun,

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:03.493
the diffuse sun, which is wind,

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:06.181
strong wind, mild wind, which is

00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:08.467
air humidity, which is

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:10.696
the radiant temperature of the

00:04:10.696 --> 00:04:12.803
surroundings where we are in.

00:04:12.803 --> 00:04:14.484
And this is air temperature.

00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:15.463
All these parameters go into

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:17.517
the comfort feeling of our

00:04:17.517 --> 00:04:19.150
human body, and scientists

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.503
have developed a parameter,

00:04:21.503 --> 00:04:23.006
which is the perceived

00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:25.131
temperature, where all these

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:27.387
parameters go in and help

00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:30.294
designers to understand

00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:32.428
which is the driving parameter

00:04:32.428 --> 00:04:34.060
that I feel comfort or that

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.539
I don't feel comfort.

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.172
Which is the driving parameter

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:38.524
which gives me a perceived

00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:41.184
temperature? And these parameters,

00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:42.852
these climatic parameters are

00:04:42.852 --> 00:04:47.012
related to the human metabolism.

00:04:47.012 --> 00:04:49.251
Because of our metabolism,

00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:51.204
we as human beings,

00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:52.844
we produce heat.

00:04:52.844 --> 00:04:54.359
I'm excited, I'm talking to you,

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:56.005
I'm probably producing

00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:57.116
150 watts

00:04:57.116 --> 00:04:58.452
at the moment. You are sitting,

00:04:58.452 --> 00:05:00.140
you are relaxed, you're looking

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.487
at me. It's probably 100

00:05:01.487 --> 00:05:03.421
watts each person is producing,

00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:05.420
and we need to get rid of that

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.171
energy. I need, with my body,

00:05:07.171 --> 00:05:08.673
to get rid of the energy, and

00:05:08.673 --> 00:05:10.644
the harder it is for myself,

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:12.724
for my body, to get rid of the

00:05:12.724 --> 00:05:14.963
energy, the less comfort I feel.

00:05:14.963 --> 00:05:17.279
That's it. And if I don't

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:18.421
get rid of the energy,

00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:19.860
I will die.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.212
If we overlay what happens

00:05:24.212 --> 00:05:26.460
during the football World Cup,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.229
what will happen in June, July,

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.156
we will see, yes, air

00:05:29.156 --> 00:05:31.036
temperature will be much higher,

00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:32.692
but because the games and

00:05:32.692 --> 00:05:35.212
the plays will be in the afternoon,

00:05:35.212 --> 00:05:37.045
it's probably the same comfort

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.692
rating we've found in other

00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:40.188
places which has perceived

00:05:40.188 --> 00:05:41.899
as non-comfortable.

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:44.043
So we sat together with a team

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:46.373
which prepared the Bid Book, or goal,

00:05:46.373 --> 00:05:49.148
that we said, let's aim

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:51.107
for perceived temperature,

00:05:51.107 --> 00:05:53.750
for outdoor comfort in this range,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.421
which is perceived with a

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.624
temperature of 32 degrees

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:00.245
Celsius perceived temperature,

00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:02.405
which is extremely comfortable.

00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:04.998
People would feel really fine

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:06.892
in an open outdoor environment.

00:06:06.892 --> 00:06:08.851
But what does it mean?

00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:10.900
If we just look on what happens,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.011
we see, temperature's too high.

00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:15.804
If we apply the best architectural design,

00:06:15.804 --> 00:06:17.268
climate engineering design,

00:06:17.268 --> 00:06:19.371
we won't get much better.

00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:22.092
So we need to do something active.

00:06:22.092 --> 00:06:23.962
We need, for instance, to bring

00:06:23.962 --> 00:06:26.058
in radiant cooling technology,

00:06:26.058 --> 00:06:27.947
and we need to combine this

00:06:27.947 --> 00:06:30.164
with so-called soft conditioning.

00:06:30.164 --> 00:06:31.600
And how does it look like in a stadium?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.928
So the stadium has a few

00:06:33.928 --> 00:06:35.673
elements which create that

00:06:35.673 --> 00:06:36.915
outdoor comfort. First of all,

00:06:36.915 --> 00:06:39.151
it's shading. It needs

00:06:39.151 --> 00:06:41.465
to protect where the people

00:06:41.465 --> 00:06:43.129
are sitting against strong

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:44.328
and warm wind.

00:06:44.328 --> 00:06:45.967
But that's not all what we need

00:06:45.967 --> 00:06:48.978
to do. We need to use

00:06:48.978 --> 00:06:51.147
active systems.

00:06:51.147 --> 00:06:53.587
Instead of blowing a hurricane

00:06:53.587 --> 00:06:55.962
of chilled air through the stadium,

00:06:55.962 --> 00:06:57.710
we can use radiant

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.744
cooling technologies, like a

00:06:59.744 --> 00:07:01.944
floor heating system where water

00:07:01.944 --> 00:07:04.327
pipes are embedded in the floor.

00:07:04.327 --> 00:07:06.145
And just by using cold water

00:07:06.145 --> 00:07:07.473
going through the water pipes,

00:07:07.473 --> 00:07:09.129
you can release the heat

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:11.209
which is absorbed during the day

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:12.446
in the stadium, so you can

00:07:12.446 --> 00:07:14.329
create that comfort, and then by

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:16.889
adding dry air instead of

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:19.121
down-chilled air, the spectators

00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:21.003
and the football players can

00:07:21.003 --> 00:07:23.336
adjust to their individual

00:07:23.336 --> 00:07:25.113
comfort needs, to their

00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:26.769
individual energy balance.

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:28.746
They can adjust and find

00:07:28.746 --> 00:07:31.121
their comfort they need to find.

00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:35.577
There are 12 stadia probably

00:07:35.577 --> 00:07:37.537
to come, but there are

00:07:37.537 --> 00:07:39.856
32 training pitches where

00:07:39.856 --> 00:07:41.553
all the individual countries

00:07:41.553 --> 00:07:42.737
are going to train.

00:07:42.737 --> 00:07:44.634
We applied the same concept:

00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:46.864
shading of the training pitch,

00:07:46.864 --> 00:07:49.704
using a shelter against wind,

00:07:49.704 --> 00:07:51.593
then using the grass.

00:07:51.593 --> 00:07:54.113
Natural-watered lawn is a

00:07:54.113 --> 00:07:55.592
very good cooling source

00:07:55.592 --> 00:07:56.809
stabilizing temperature,

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:58.745
and using dehumidified air to

00:07:58.745 --> 00:07:59.824
create comfort.

00:07:59.824 --> 00:08:03.698
But even the best passive design

00:08:03.698 --> 00:08:04.444
wouldn't help.

00:08:04.444 --> 00:08:05.454
We need active system.

00:08:05.454 --> 00:08:06.504
And how do we do that?

00:08:06.504 --> 00:08:08.872
Our idea for the bid was

00:08:08.872 --> 00:08:10.609
100 percent solar cooling,

00:08:10.609 --> 00:08:12.704
based on the idea that we use

00:08:12.704 --> 00:08:14.344
the roof of the stadia,

00:08:14.344 --> 00:08:16.287
we cover the roofs of the stadia

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:17.879
with PV systems.

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:20.439
We don't borrow any energy

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:21.863
from history.

00:08:21.863 --> 00:08:23.656
We are not using fossil energies.

00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:25.472
We are not borrowing energy

00:08:25.472 --> 00:08:26.528
from our neighbors.

00:08:26.528 --> 00:08:28.648
We're using energy we can harvest

00:08:28.648 --> 00:08:31.408
on our roofs, and also on the

00:08:31.408 --> 00:08:33.495
training pitches, which will be

00:08:33.495 --> 00:08:36.167
covered with large, flexible

00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:37.880
membranes, and we will see

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.584
in the next years an industry

00:08:39.584 --> 00:08:40.767
coming up with flexible

00:08:40.767 --> 00:08:42.392
photovoltaics, giving

00:08:42.392 --> 00:08:44.169
the possibilities of shading

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:45.849
against strong sun and producing

00:08:45.849 --> 00:08:48.344
electric energy in the same time.

00:08:48.344 --> 00:08:50.055
And this energy now is

00:08:50.055 --> 00:08:51.687
harvested throughout the year,

00:08:51.687 --> 00:08:53.255
sent into the grid,

00:08:53.255 --> 00:08:55.240
is replacing fossils

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.391
in the grid, and when I need it

00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:00.288
for the cooling, I take it

00:09:00.288 --> 00:09:02.105
back from the grid and I

00:09:02.105 --> 00:09:04.472
use the solar energy

00:09:04.472 --> 00:09:06.544
which I have brought to the grid

00:09:06.544 --> 00:09:07.832
back when I need

00:09:07.832 --> 00:09:08.664
it for the solar cooling.

00:09:08.664 --> 00:09:10.087
And I can do that in the first

00:09:10.087 --> 00:09:11.135
year and I can balance that

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:12.439
in the next 10, and the next

00:09:12.439 --> 00:09:14.304
20 years, this energy,

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.927
which is necessary to condition

00:09:16.927 --> 00:09:18.626
a World Cup in Qatar,

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:20.585
the next 20 years, this energy

00:09:20.585 --> 00:09:23.166
goes into the grid of Qatar.

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:24.379
So this -- (Applause)

00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:25.483
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:09:25.483 --> 00:09:28.164
This is not only useful

00:09:28.164 --> 00:09:30.139
for stadia. We can use that also

00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:32.548
in open-air places and streets,

00:09:32.548 --> 00:09:33.731
and we've been working on

00:09:33.731 --> 00:09:35.100
the City of the Future

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.487
in Masdar, which is in the

00:09:36.487 --> 00:09:37.747
United Emirates, Abu Dhabi.

00:09:37.747 --> 00:09:39.459
And I had the pleasure to work

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:40.763
on the central plaza.

00:09:40.763 --> 00:09:42.898
And the same idea to use there,

00:09:42.898 --> 00:09:44.604
to create outdoor conditions

00:09:44.604 --> 00:09:45.755
which are perceived

00:09:45.755 --> 00:09:47.011
as comfortable. People enjoy

00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:49.211
going there instead of going

00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:50.980
into a shopping mall, which is

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.164
chilled down and which is

00:09:52.164 --> 00:09:54.243
cooled. We wanted to create

00:09:54.243 --> 00:09:55.780
an outdoor space

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.747
which is so comfortable that

00:09:57.747 --> 00:09:59.324
people can go there in the

00:09:59.324 --> 00:10:01.448
early afternoon, even in these

00:10:01.448 --> 00:10:03.440
sunny and hot summer months,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.786
and they can enjoy and meet there

00:10:04.786 --> 00:10:06.592
with their families. (Applause)

00:10:06.592 --> 00:10:07.939
And the same concept:

00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:09.376
shade against the sun,

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:10.647
shade against the wind,

00:10:10.647 --> 00:10:14.471
and use, use and take advantage

00:10:14.471 --> 00:10:17.184
of the sun you can harvest

00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:18.279
on your footprint.

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:20.288
And these beautiful umbrellas.

00:10:20.288 --> 00:10:24.576
So I'd like to encourage you

00:10:24.576 --> 00:10:26.944
to pay attention to your

00:10:26.944 --> 00:10:28.608
thermal comfort, to your

00:10:28.608 --> 00:10:29.655
thermal environment,

00:10:29.655 --> 00:10:32.344
tonight and tomorrow,

00:10:32.344 --> 00:10:34.151
and if you'd like to learn more

00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:35.273
about that, I invite you

00:10:35.273 --> 00:10:36.552
to go to our website.

00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:38.696
We uploaded a very simple

00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:40.808
perceived temperature calculator

00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:41.800
where you can check out

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.215
about your outdoor comfort.

00:10:43.215 --> 00:10:46.687
And I also hope that you

00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:48.009
share the idea that

00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:50.015
if engineers and designers

00:10:50.015 --> 00:10:51.527
can use all these different

00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:53.488
climatic parameters,

00:10:53.488 --> 00:10:56.495
it will be possible to create

00:10:56.495 --> 00:10:59.584
really good and comfortable

00:10:59.584 --> 00:11:00.864
outdoor conditions,

00:11:00.864 --> 00:11:03.993
to change our thermal perception

00:11:03.993 --> 00:11:05.871
that we feel comfortable

00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:07.959
in an outdoor environment,

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:10.351
and we can do that

00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:12.215
with the best passive design,

00:11:12.215 --> 00:11:15.391
but also using the energy source

00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:18.375
of the site in Qatar which is

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:19.229
the sun.

00:11:19.229 --> 00:11:21.745
(Applause)

00:11:21.745 --> 00:11:23.270
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.974
Shukran. (Applause)
