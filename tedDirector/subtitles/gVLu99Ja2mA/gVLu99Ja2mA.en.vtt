00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:23.077
(Applause)

00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:24.274
Thank you very much.

00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:26.236
I have a few pictures,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.886
and I'll talk a little bit
about how I'm able to do what I do.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.767
All these houses are built

00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.640
from between 70 and 80 percent
recycled material,

00:00:35.664 --> 00:00:38.815
stuff that was headed to the mulcher,
the landfill, the burn pile.

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:40.236
It was all just gone.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.236
This is the first house I built.

00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:45.963
This double front door here
with the three-light transom,

00:00:45.987 --> 00:00:48.127
that was headed to the landfill.

00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:49.983
Have a little turret there.

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:53.064
And then these buttons
on the corbels here --

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.241
right there --

00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:56.621
those are hickory nuts.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:58.752
And these buttons there --

00:00:58.776 --> 00:01:00.103
those are chicken eggs.

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:01.296
(Laughter)

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.081
Of course, first you have breakfast,

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:07.020
and then you fill the shell full
of Bondo and paint it and nail it up,

00:01:07.044 --> 00:01:10.488
and you have an architectural button
in just a fraction of the time.

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:13.423
This is a look at the inside.

00:01:13.447 --> 00:01:16.712
You can see the three-light transom
there with the eyebrow windows.

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:19.790
Certainly an architectural antique
headed to the landfill --

00:01:19.814 --> 00:01:22.412
even the lockset
is probably worth 200 dollars.

00:01:22.998 --> 00:01:24.885
Everything in the kitchen was salvaged.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.906
There's a 1952 O'Keefe &amp; Merritt stove,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.236
if you like to cook -- cool stove.

00:01:29.842 --> 00:01:31.648
This is going up into the turret.

00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:34.907
I got that staircase for 20 dollars,

00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:36.815
including delivery to my lot.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.324
(Laughter)

00:01:39.774 --> 00:01:42.076
Then, looking up in the turret,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.719
you see there are bulges
and pokes and sags and so forth.

00:01:45.743 --> 00:01:47.385
Well, if that ruins your life,

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.236
well, then, you shouldn't live there.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.137
(Laughter)

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:53.960
This is a laundry chute.

00:01:53.984 --> 00:01:56.399
And this right here is a shoe last --

00:01:56.423 --> 00:01:59.255
those are those cast-iron things
you see at antique shops.

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:00.568
So I had one of those,

00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:04.338
so I made some low-tech gadgetry,
where you just stomp on the shoe last,

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:07.236
and then the door flies open
and you throw your laundry down.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.046
And then if you're smart enough,
it goes on a basket on top of the washer.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.684
If not, it goes into the toilet.

00:02:13.708 --> 00:02:15.757
(Laughter)

00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:17.464
This is a bathtub I made,

00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:19.545
made out of scrap two-by-four.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.803
Started with the rim, and then glued
and nailed it up into a flat,

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:25.521
corbeled it up and flipped it over,

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.522
then did the two profiles on this side.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:28.906
It's a two-person tub.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:32.378
After all, it's not just
a question of hygiene,

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.894
but there's a possibility
of recreation as well.

00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:37.687
(Laughter)

00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:43.578
Then, this faucet here
is just a piece of Osage orange.

00:02:43.602 --> 00:02:45.174
It looks a little phallic,

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:46.899
but after all, it's a bathroom.

00:02:46.923 --> 00:02:49.519
(Laughter)

00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:51.865
This is a house based on a Budweiser can.

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.581
It doesn't look like a can of beer,

00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:56.109
but the design take-offs
are absolutely unmistakable:

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:58.465
the barley hops design
worked up into the eaves,

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.237
then the dentil work comes directly
off the can's red, white, blue and silver.

00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.699
Then, these corbels going
down underneath the eaves

00:03:04.723 --> 00:03:06.901
are that little design
that comes off the can.

00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:09.544
I just put a can on a copier
and kept enlarging it

00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:11.084
until I got the size I want.

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.655
Then, on the can it says,

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:15.386
"This is the famous Budweiser beer,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.468
we know of no other beer,
blah, blah, blah."

00:03:17.492 --> 00:03:18.785
So we changed that and put,

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.308
"This is the famous Budweiser house.
We don't know of any other house ..."

00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:23.484
and so forth and so on.

00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:24.665
This is a deadbolt.

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.431
It's a fence from a 1930s shaper,
which is a very angry woodworking machine.

00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:31.431
And they gave me the fence,
but they didn't give me the shaper,

00:03:31.455 --> 00:03:33.126
so we made a deadbolt out of it.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.391
That'll keep bull elephants
out, I promise.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:36.420
(Laughter)

00:03:36.444 --> 00:03:39.298
And sure enough, we've had
no problems with bull elephants.

00:03:39.322 --> 00:03:40.484
(Laughter)

00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:43.421
The shower is intended
to simulate a glass of beer.

00:03:43.445 --> 00:03:46.916
We've got bubbles going up there,
then suds at the top with lumpy tiles.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.629
Where do you get lumpy tiles?
Well, of course, you don't.

00:03:49.653 --> 00:03:53.354
But I get a lot of toilets, and so you
just dispatch a toilet with a hammer,

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:55.236
and then you have lumpy tiles.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.783
And then the faucet is a beer tap.

00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:01.533
(Laughter)

00:04:01.557 --> 00:04:05.959
Then, this panel of glass
is the same panel of glass

00:04:05.983 --> 00:04:08.830
that occurs in every middle-class
front door in America.

00:04:08.854 --> 00:04:11.362
We're getting tired of it.
It's kind of clichÃ©d now.

00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:14.811
If you put it in the front door,
your design fails.

00:04:14.835 --> 00:04:17.561
So don't put it in the front door;
put it somewhere else.

00:04:17.585 --> 00:04:19.111
It's a pretty panel of glass.

00:04:19.135 --> 00:04:20.876
But if you put it in the front door,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.408
people say, "Oh, you're trying
to be like those guys,

00:04:23.432 --> 00:04:24.583
and you didn't make it."

00:04:24.607 --> 00:04:25.762
So don't put it there.

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.236
Then, another bathroom upstairs.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.497
This light up here

00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:33.296
is the same light that occurs
in every middle-class foyer in America.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.815
Don't put it in the foyer.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.997
Put it in the shower, or in the closet,

00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:39.381
but not in the foyer.

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:43.848
Then, somebody gave me
a bidet, so it got a bidet.

00:04:43.872 --> 00:04:46.294
(Laughter)

00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:47.946
This little house here,

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.899
those branches there are made
out of Bois d'arc or Osage orange.

00:04:51.923 --> 00:04:55.391
These pictures will keep scrolling
as I talk a little bit.

00:04:55.415 --> 00:04:57.681
In order to do what I do,

00:04:57.705 --> 00:05:01.460
you have to understand what causes
waste in the building industry.

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:04.117
Our housing has become a commodity,

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:06.434
and I'll talk a little bit about that.

00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:09.569
But the first cause of waste
is probably even buried in our DNA.

00:05:09.593 --> 00:05:12.061
Human beings have a need
for maintaining consistency

00:05:12.085 --> 00:05:13.430
of the apperceptive mass.

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:15.193
What does that mean?

00:05:15.217 --> 00:05:17.499
What it means is,
for every perception we have,

00:05:17.523 --> 00:05:20.113
it needs to tally
with the one like it before,

00:05:20.137 --> 00:05:23.531
or we don't have continuity,
and we become a little bit disoriented.

00:05:23.555 --> 00:05:26.236
So I can show you an object
you've never seen before.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.161
Oh, that's a cell phone.

00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:31.245
But you've never seen this one before.

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:32.427
What you're doing

00:05:32.451 --> 00:05:35.451
is sizing up the pattern
of structural features,

00:05:35.475 --> 00:05:38.039
and then you go through your databanks:

00:05:38.063 --> 00:05:39.885
Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.901
If I took a bite out of it, you'd go,

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:44.415
"Wait a second.

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.594
(Laughter)

00:05:45.618 --> 00:05:46.967
"That's not a cell phone.

00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:49.891
That's one of those new
chocolate cell phones."

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:51.629
(Laughter)

00:05:51.653 --> 00:05:53.340
You'd have to start a new category,

00:05:53.364 --> 00:05:55.426
right between cell phones and chocolate.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.261
(Laughter)

00:05:57.285 --> 00:05:58.951
That's how we process information.

00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:01.107
You translate that
to the building industry.

00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:04.161
If we have a wall of windowpanes
and one pane is cracked, we go,

00:06:04.185 --> 00:06:06.210
"Oh, dear. That's cracked.
Let's repair it.

00:06:06.234 --> 00:06:08.870
Let's take it out and throw it away
so nobody can use it

00:06:08.894 --> 00:06:10.054
and put a new one in."

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.300
Because that's what you do
with a cracked pane.

00:06:12.324 --> 00:06:14.784
Never mind that it doesn't
affect our lives at all.

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:19.211
It only rattles that expected pattern
and unity of structural features.

00:06:19.616 --> 00:06:22.044
However, if we took a small hammer,

00:06:22.068 --> 00:06:24.634
and we added cracks
to all the other windows --

00:06:24.658 --> 00:06:26.659
(Laughter)

00:06:26.683 --> 00:06:27.897
then we have a pattern.

00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:30.988
Because Gestalt psychology
emphasizes recognition of pattern

00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:33.043
over parts that comprise a pattern.

00:06:33.067 --> 00:06:34.846
We'll go, "Ooh, that's nice."

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.016
So, that serves me every day.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.786
Repetition creates pattern.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.609
If I have 100 of these, 100 of those,

00:06:41.633 --> 00:06:43.907
it makes no difference
what these and those are.

00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:46.853
If I can repeat anything,
I have the possibility of a pattern,

00:06:46.877 --> 00:06:49.800
from hickory nuts and chicken eggs,
shards of glass, branches.

00:06:49.824 --> 00:06:51.338
It doesn't make any difference.

00:06:51.362 --> 00:06:53.890
That causes a lot of waste
in the building industry.

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:55.065
The second cause is,

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:56.990
Friedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885,

00:06:57.014 --> 00:06:59.321
wrote a book titled
"The Birth of Tragedy."

00:06:59.345 --> 00:07:00.501
And in there,

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:03.967
he said cultures tend to swing
between one of two perspectives:

00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:07.211
on the one hand,
we have an Apollonian perspective,

00:07:07.235 --> 00:07:11.014
which is very crisp and premeditated
and intellectualized

00:07:11.038 --> 00:07:12.734
and perfect.

00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:16.953
On the other end of the spectrum,
we have a Dionysian perspective,

00:07:16.977 --> 00:07:19.360
which is more given
to the passions and intuition,

00:07:19.384 --> 00:07:22.163
tolerant of organic texture
and human gesture.

00:07:22.187 --> 00:07:27.506
So the way the Apollonian personality
takes a picture or hangs a picture is,

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.406
they'll get out a transit

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.082
and a laser level

00:07:31.106 --> 00:07:32.276
and a micrometer.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.080
"OK, honey. A thousandth
of an inch to the left.

00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:37.487
That's where we want
the picture. Right. Perfect!"

00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:39.806
Predicated on plumb level,
square and centered.

00:07:40.142 --> 00:07:43.285
The Dionysian personality
takes the picture and goes:

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.107
(Laughter)

00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:50.409
That's the difference.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.861
I feature blemish.

00:07:52.885 --> 00:07:54.941
I feature organic process.

00:07:54.965 --> 00:07:56.320
Dead center John Dewey.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:08:01.120
Apollonian mindset
creates mountains of waste.

00:08:01.144 --> 00:08:02.786
If something isn't perfect,

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.640
if it doesn't line up
with that premeditated model?

00:08:05.664 --> 00:08:06.815
Dumpster.

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:08.103
"Oops. Scratch. Dumpster."

00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:10.754
"Oops" this, "oops" that.
Landfill, landfill, landfill.

00:08:10.778 --> 00:08:13.291
The third thing is arguably --

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:16.362
The Industrial Revolution
started in the Renaissance

00:08:16.386 --> 00:08:17.640
with the rise of humanism,

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.629
then got a little jump start
along about the French Revolution.

00:08:20.653 --> 00:08:23.281
By the middle of the 19th century,
it's in full flower.

00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:25.912
And we have dumaflaches and gizmos

00:08:25.936 --> 00:08:29.181
and contraptions that will do anything

00:08:29.205 --> 00:08:31.045
that we, up to that point,

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:32.820
had to do by hand.

00:08:32.844 --> 00:08:34.919
So now we have standardized materials.

00:08:34.943 --> 00:08:37.801
Well, trees don't grow
two inches by four inches,

00:08:37.825 --> 00:08:39.507
eight, ten and twelve feet tall.

00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:40.556
(Laughter)

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.003
We create mountains of waste.

00:08:42.027 --> 00:08:45.568
And they're doing a pretty good job
there in the forest,

00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:48.084
working all the byproduct
of their industry --

00:08:48.108 --> 00:08:50.870
with OSB and particle board
and so forth and so on --

00:08:50.894 --> 00:08:52.689
but it does no good

00:08:52.713 --> 00:08:55.786
to be responsible at the point
of harvest in the forest

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.169
if consumers are wasting the harvest
at the point of consumption.

00:08:59.193 --> 00:09:00.684
And that's what's happening.

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:02.786
And so if something isn't standard,

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.743
"Oops, dumpster." "Oops" this.
"Oops, warped."

00:09:05.767 --> 00:09:07.996
If you buy a two-by-four
and it's not straight,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.280
you can take it back.

00:09:09.304 --> 00:09:11.915
"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
We'll get you a straight one."

00:09:11.939 --> 00:09:15.231
Well, I feature all those warped things

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:17.070
because repetition creates pattern,

00:09:17.094 --> 00:09:19.099
and it's from a Dionysian perspective.

00:09:19.123 --> 00:09:20.405
The fourth thing

00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:24.155
is labor is disproportionately
more expensive than materials.

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:25.669
Well, that's just a myth.

00:09:25.693 --> 00:09:26.855
And there's a story:

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:30.438
Jim Tulles, one of the guys I trained --
I said, "Jim, it's time now.

00:09:30.462 --> 00:09:33.877
I got a job for you as a foreman
on a framing crew. Time for you to go."

00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:35.652
"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready."

00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:38.642
"Jim, now it's time.
You're the down -- oh!"

00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:40.017
So we hired on.

00:09:40.041 --> 00:09:43.518
And he was out there with a tape measure,
going through the trash heap,

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:46.642
looking for header material,
or the board that goes over a door,

00:09:46.666 --> 00:09:49.887
thinking he'd impress his boss --
that's how we taught him to do it.

00:09:49.911 --> 00:09:52.762
The superintendent walked up
and said, "What are you doing?"

00:09:52.786 --> 00:09:54.706
"Oh, just looking for header material,"

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.891
waiting for that kudos.

00:09:55.915 --> 00:09:59.373
He said, "I'm not paying you to go
through the trash. Get back to work."

00:09:59.397 --> 00:10:01.105
And Jim had the wherewithal to say,

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:04.503
"You know, if you were paying me
300 dollars an hour,

00:10:04.527 --> 00:10:06.544
I can see how you might say that.

00:10:06.568 --> 00:10:09.645
But right now, I'm saving you
five dollars a minute.

00:10:09.669 --> 00:10:11.017
Do the math."

00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:13.365
(Laughter)

00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:16.603
"Good call, Tulles. From now on,
you guys hit this pile first."

00:10:16.627 --> 00:10:19.102
And the irony is that he wasn't
very good at math.

00:10:19.126 --> 00:10:22.532
(Laughter)

00:10:22.556 --> 00:10:25.207
But once in a while,
you get access to the control room,

00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:27.340
and then you can
kind of mess with the dials.

00:10:27.364 --> 00:10:28.929
And that's what happened there.

00:10:29.698 --> 00:10:32.097
The fifth thing is that maybe,
after 2,500 years,

00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:35.439
Plato is still having his way with us
in his notion of perfect forms.

00:10:35.463 --> 00:10:39.635
He said that we have in our noggin
the perfect idea of what we want,

00:10:39.659 --> 00:10:42.636
and we force environmental
resources to accommodate that.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.118
So we all have in our head
the perfect house,

00:10:45.142 --> 00:10:47.372
the American dream, which is a house,

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:48.983
the dream house.

00:10:49.007 --> 00:10:50.786
The problem is we can't afford it.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.786
So we have the American dream look-alike,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.122
which is a mobile home.

00:10:54.146 --> 00:10:56.436
Now there's a blight on the planet.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.714
(Laughter)

00:10:57.738 --> 00:10:59.458
It's a chattel mortgage,

00:10:59.482 --> 00:11:01.459
just like furniture, just like a car.

00:11:01.483 --> 00:11:04.615
You write the check,
and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent.

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:07.846
After a year, you can't get insurance
on everything you have in it,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.141
only on 70 percent.

00:11:09.165 --> 00:11:10.914
Wired with 14-Gauge wire, typically.

00:11:10.938 --> 00:11:12.106
Nothing wrong with that,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.976
unless you ask it to do
what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.203
and that's what happens.

00:11:16.227 --> 00:11:17.708
It out-gasses formaldehyde --

00:11:17.732 --> 00:11:21.873
so much so that there is
a federal law in place

00:11:21.897 --> 00:11:26.461
to warn new mobile home buyers
of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger.

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:28.531
Are we just being numbingly stupid?

00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:30.362
The walls are this thick.

00:11:30.386 --> 00:11:33.363
The whole thing has
the structural value of corn.

00:11:33.387 --> 00:11:35.270
(Laughter)

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:37.866
"So ... I thought Palm Harbor
Village was over there."

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.928
"No, no. We had a wind last night.

00:11:39.952 --> 00:11:41.524
It's gone now."

00:11:41.548 --> 00:11:44.786
(Laughter)

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.211
Then when they degrade,
what do you do with them?

00:11:47.619 --> 00:11:49.323
Now, all that --

00:11:49.886 --> 00:11:52.634
that Apollonian, Platonic model --

00:11:52.658 --> 00:11:55.221
is what the building industry
is predicated on,

00:11:55.245 --> 00:11:57.921
and there are a number of things
that exacerbate that.

00:11:57.945 --> 00:12:00.463
One is that all the professionals,

00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:02.154
all the tradesmen, vendors,

00:12:02.178 --> 00:12:04.556
inspectors, engineers, architects

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.226
all think like this.

00:12:06.698 --> 00:12:08.904
And then it works its way
back to the consumer,

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:10.372
who demands the same model.

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:13.215
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
We can't get out of it.

00:12:13.531 --> 00:12:16.107
Then here come the marketeers
and the advertisers.

00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:18.555
"Woo. Woo-hoo."

00:12:18.579 --> 00:12:21.786
We buy stuff we didn't know we needed.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.342
All we have to do
is look at what one company did

00:12:24.366 --> 00:12:26.357
with carbonated prune juice.

00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:27.786
How disgusting.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.602
(Laughter)

00:12:29.626 --> 00:12:30.934
But you know what they did?

00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:34.034
They hooked a metaphor into it
and said, "I drink Dr. Pepper ..."

00:12:34.058 --> 00:12:37.052
And pretty soon, we're swilling
that stuff by the lake-ful,

00:12:37.076 --> 00:12:38.787
by the billions of gallons.

00:12:38.811 --> 00:12:41.948
It doesn't even have real prunes!
Doesn't even keep you regular.

00:12:41.972 --> 00:12:43.732
(Laughter)

00:12:43.756 --> 00:12:45.786
My oh my, that makes it worse.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.006
And we get sucked
into that faster than anything.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.739
Then, a man named
Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book

00:12:51.763 --> 00:12:53.248
titled "Being and Nothingness."

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:56.194
It's a pretty quick read.
You can snap through it in maybe --

00:12:56.218 --> 00:12:57.282
(Laughter)

00:12:57.306 --> 00:12:58.458
maybe two years,

00:12:58.482 --> 00:13:00.214
if you read eight hours a day.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.123
In there, he talked
about the divided self.

00:13:03.147 --> 00:13:06.225
He said human beings act differently
when they know they're alone

00:13:06.249 --> 00:13:08.309
than when they know
somebody else is around.

00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:10.635
So if I'm eating spaghetti,
and I know I'm alone,

00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:12.127
I can eat like a backhoe.

00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:15.365
I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve,
napkin on the table,

00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:18.706
chew with my mouth open,
make little noises,

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.707
scratch wherever I want.

00:13:20.731 --> 00:13:22.591
(Laughter)

00:13:22.615 --> 00:13:24.062
But as soon as you walk in,

00:13:24.086 --> 00:13:26.564
I go, "Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there."

00:13:26.588 --> 00:13:28.441
Napkin in my lap, half-bites,

00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:30.698
chew with my mouth closed, no scratching.

00:13:30.722 --> 00:13:35.657
Now, what I'm doing
is fulfilling your expectations

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:37.563
of how I should live my life.

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:40.861
I feel that expectation,

00:13:40.885 --> 00:13:42.301
and so I accommodate it,

00:13:42.325 --> 00:13:45.571
and I'm living my life according
to what you expect me to do.

00:13:45.595 --> 00:13:47.866
That happens in the building
industry as well.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.745
That's why all subdivisions look the same.

00:13:50.769 --> 00:13:54.885
Sometimes, we even have
these formalized cultural expectations.

00:13:54.909 --> 00:13:56.786
I'll bet all your shoes match.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.995
Sure enough, we all buy into that ...

00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:00.669
(Laughter)

00:14:00.693 --> 00:14:03.118
And with gated communities,

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:05.518
we have a formalized expectation,

00:14:05.542 --> 00:14:07.120
with a homeowners' association.

00:14:07.144 --> 00:14:08.842
Sometimes those guys are Nazis,

00:14:08.866 --> 00:14:10.213
my oh my.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.166
That exacerbates and continues this model.

00:14:14.972 --> 00:14:16.879
The last thing is gregariousness.

00:14:17.668 --> 00:14:19.581
Human beings are a social species.

00:14:19.605 --> 00:14:22.303
We like to hang together in groups,

00:14:22.327 --> 00:14:24.207
just like wildebeests, just like lions.

00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:25.887
Wildebeests don't hang with lions,

00:14:25.911 --> 00:14:27.561
because lions eat wildebeests.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.396
Human beings are like that.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.516
We do what that group does

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.396
that we're trying to identify with.

00:14:33.942 --> 00:14:35.925
You see this in junior high a lot.

00:14:36.551 --> 00:14:40.922
Those kids, they'll work
all summer long -- kill themselves --

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:45.154
so that they can afford
one pair of designer jeans.

00:14:45.178 --> 00:14:47.436
So along about September,

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.437
they can stride in and go,

00:14:49.461 --> 00:14:53.675
"I'm important today. See?
Don't touch my designer jeans!

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:56.536
I see you don't have designer jeans.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.256
You're not one of the beautiful --
See, I'm one of the beautiful people.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.468
See my jeans?"

00:15:01.492 --> 00:15:03.878
Right there is reason
enough to have uniforms.

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:07.479
And so that happens
in the building industry as well.

00:15:07.938 --> 00:15:12.157
We have confused
Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

00:15:12.181 --> 00:15:13.786
just a little bit.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.164
On the bottom tier, we have basic needs:

00:15:17.188 --> 00:15:20.722
shelter, clothing, food,
water, mating and so forth.

00:15:20.746 --> 00:15:23.084
Second: security. Third: relationships.

00:15:23.108 --> 00:15:26.126
Fourth: status, self-esteem --
that is, vanity --

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.748
and we're taking vanity
and shoving it down here.

00:15:29.603 --> 00:15:31.009
And so we end up

00:15:32.087 --> 00:15:34.063
with vain decisions,

00:15:34.865 --> 00:15:37.057
and we can't even afford our mortgage.

00:15:37.081 --> 00:15:39.835
We can't afford to eat
anything except beans;

00:15:39.859 --> 00:15:43.430
that is, our housing
has become a commodity.

00:15:44.073 --> 00:15:46.732
And it takes a little bit of nerve

00:15:47.383 --> 00:15:49.786
to dive into those primal,

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.013
terrifying parts of ourselves

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.754
and make our own decisions

00:15:55.262 --> 00:15:57.239
and not make our housing a commodity,

00:15:57.263 --> 00:16:00.786
but make it something
that bubbles up from seminal sources.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.587
That takes a little bit of nerve,

00:16:02.611 --> 00:16:05.336
and, darn it, once in a while, you fail.

00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:08.024
But that's okay.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.228
If failure destroys you,

00:16:10.252 --> 00:16:11.482
then you can't do this.

00:16:11.506 --> 00:16:14.012
I fail all the time, every day,

00:16:14.036 --> 00:16:17.748
and I've had some whopping
failures, I promise --

00:16:17.772 --> 00:16:20.786
big, public, humiliating,
embarrassing failures.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.250
Everybody points and laughs,

00:16:22.274 --> 00:16:25.370
and they say, "He tried it a fifth time,
and it still didn't work!

00:16:25.394 --> 00:16:26.774
What a moron!"

00:16:26.798 --> 00:16:28.786
Early on, contractors come by and say,

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.573
"Dan, you're a cute little bunny,

00:16:30.597 --> 00:16:32.755
but you know,
this just isn't going to work.

00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:35.110
What don't you do this?
Why don't you do that?"

00:16:35.134 --> 00:16:37.640
And your instinct is to say,

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.331
"Well, why don't you suck an egg?"

00:16:39.355 --> 00:16:40.786
(Laughter)

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.474
But you don't say that,

00:16:42.498 --> 00:16:44.604
because they're the guys you're targeting.

00:16:45.451 --> 00:16:48.430
And so what we've done --

00:16:48.454 --> 00:16:51.847
and this isn't just in housing;
it's in clothing and food

00:16:51.871 --> 00:16:54.724
and our transportation
needs, our energy --

00:16:54.748 --> 00:16:57.323
we sprawl just a little bit.

00:16:58.256 --> 00:17:00.786
And when I get a little bit of press,

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.770
I hear from people all over the world.

00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:05.938
And we may have invented excess,

00:17:05.962 --> 00:17:09.379
but the problem of waste is worldwide.

00:17:10.444 --> 00:17:13.421
We're in trouble.

00:17:13.445 --> 00:17:16.499
And I don't wear ammo belts
crisscrossing my chest

00:17:16.523 --> 00:17:17.893
and a red bandana.

00:17:18.635 --> 00:17:20.255
But we're clearly in trouble.

00:17:20.858 --> 00:17:24.786
And what we need to do is reconnect

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.447
with those really primal
parts of ourselves

00:17:28.471 --> 00:17:30.517
and make some decisions and say,

00:17:30.541 --> 00:17:35.270
"You know, I think I would like to put
CDs across the wall there.

00:17:35.294 --> 00:17:36.658
What do you think, honey?"

00:17:37.271 --> 00:17:38.966
If it doesn't work, take it down.

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:43.095
What we need to do is reconnect
with who we really are,

00:17:43.722 --> 00:17:45.698
and that's thrilling indeed.

00:17:46.743 --> 00:17:47.926
Thank you very much.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.810
(Applause)
