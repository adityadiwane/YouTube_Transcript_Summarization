00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:14.109
There we were,

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:18.738
souls and bodies packed
into a Texas church

00:00:19.428 --> 00:00:21.649
on the last night of our lives.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.699
Packed into a room just like this,

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:30.294
but with creaky wooden pews
draped in worn-down red fabric,

00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:33.958
with an organ to my left
and a choir at my back

00:00:33.982 --> 00:00:36.862
and a baptism pool
built into the wall behind them.

00:00:37.502 --> 00:00:40.271
A room like this, nonetheless.

00:00:41.356 --> 00:00:44.060
With the same great feelings of suspense,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.568
the same deep hopes for salvation,

00:00:48.743 --> 00:00:50.379
the same sweat in the palms

00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:53.894
and the same people
in the back not paying attention.

00:00:53.918 --> 00:00:55.845
(Laughter)

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.416
This was December 31, 1999,

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:03.536
the night of the Second Coming of Christ,

00:01:04.222 --> 00:01:06.692
and the end of the world as I knew it.

00:01:08.022 --> 00:01:09.648
I had turned 12 that year

00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:11.991
and had reached the age of accountability.

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:14.542
And once I stopped complaining

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.017
about how unfair it was
that Jesus would return

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:20.530
as soon as I had to be accountable
for all that I had done,

00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:23.517
I figured I had better get
my house in order very quickly.

00:01:24.448 --> 00:01:26.391
So I went to church as often as I could.

00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:31.247
I listened for silence as anxiously
as one might listen for noise,

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:34.361
trying to be sure that the Lord
hadn't pulled a fast one on me

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:35.960
and decided to come back early.

00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:38.304
And just in case he did,

00:01:38.988 --> 00:01:40.614
I built a backup plan,

00:01:41.277 --> 00:01:45.158
by reading the "Left Behind" books
that were all the rage at the time.

00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:47.115
And I found in their pages

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.880
that if I was not taken
in the rapture at midnight,

00:01:49.904 --> 00:01:51.158
I had another shot.

00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.005
All I had to do was avoid
taking the mark of the beast,

00:01:55.808 --> 00:01:58.920
fight off demons, plagues
and the Antichrist himself.

00:01:58.944 --> 00:02:00.131
It would be hard --

00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:03.324
(Laughter)

00:02:03.348 --> 00:02:04.906
but I knew I could do it.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.433
(Laughter)

00:02:06.457 --> 00:02:08.245
But planning time was over now.

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.085
It was 11:50pm.

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.271
We had 10 minutes left,

00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:14.289
and my pastor called us
out of the pews and down to the altar

00:02:14.313 --> 00:02:18.449
because he wanted to be praying
when midnight struck.

00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:21.818
So every faction of the congregation

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:23.145
took its place.

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:24.915
The choir stayed in the choir stand,

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.412
the deacons and their wives --

00:02:26.436 --> 00:02:28.939
or the Baptist Bourgeoisie
as I like to call them --

00:02:28.963 --> 00:02:30.249
(Laughter)

00:02:30.273 --> 00:02:32.480
took first position in front of the altar.

00:02:32.504 --> 00:02:34.189
You see, in America,

00:02:34.824 --> 00:02:37.885
even the Second Coming of Christ
has a VIP section.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.239
(Laughter)

00:02:40.263 --> 00:02:42.263
(Applause)

00:02:45.187 --> 00:02:47.576
And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.529
were the elderly --

00:02:49.553 --> 00:02:54.441
these men and women whose young backs
had been bent under hot suns

00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:56.446
in the cotton fields of East Texas,

00:02:57.137 --> 00:03:00.853
and whose skin seemed to be burnt
a creaseless noble brown,

00:03:00.877 --> 00:03:02.551
just like the clay of East Texas,

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.604
and whose hopes and dreams
for what life might become

00:03:05.628 --> 00:03:06.779
outside of East Texas

00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:08.446
had sometimes been bent and broken

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.969
even further than their backs.

00:03:09.993 --> 00:03:13.873
Yes, these men and women
were the stars of the show for me.

00:03:14.742 --> 00:03:17.080
They had waited their whole lives
for this moment,

00:03:17.104 --> 00:03:21.079
just as their medieval predecessors
had longed for the end of the world,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.897
and just as my grandmother
waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show

00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:27.166
to come on Channel 8
every day at 4 o'clock.

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:30.191
And as she made her way to the altar,

00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:32.310
I snuck right in behind her,

00:03:32.334 --> 00:03:34.308
because I knew for sure

00:03:34.332 --> 00:03:36.408
that my grandmother was going to heaven.

00:03:37.126 --> 00:03:41.431
And I thought that if I held on
to her hand during this prayer,

00:03:42.282 --> 00:03:44.155
I might go right on with her.

00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:46.301
So I held on

00:03:46.802 --> 00:03:48.468
and I closed my eyes

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.220
to listen,

00:03:50.678 --> 00:03:51.828
to wait.

00:03:52.314 --> 00:03:53.838
And the prayers got louder.

00:03:54.428 --> 00:03:56.869
And the shouts of response
to the call of the prayer

00:03:56.893 --> 00:03:58.296
went up higher even still.

00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:01.126
And the organ rolled on in
to add the dirge.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.343
And the heat came on to add to the sweat.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.976
And my hand gripped firmer,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.013
so I wouldn't be the one
left in the field.

00:04:07.037 --> 00:04:08.236
My eyes clenched tighter

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.232
so I wouldn't see the wheat
being separated from the chaff.

00:04:11.256 --> 00:04:13.625
And then a voice rang out above us:

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.443
"Amen."

00:04:17.474 --> 00:04:18.628
It was over.

00:04:20.044 --> 00:04:21.346
I looked at the clock.

00:04:22.643 --> 00:04:23.936
It was after midnight.

00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:27.018
I looked at the elder believers

00:04:27.697 --> 00:04:29.565
whose savior had not come,

00:04:30.205 --> 00:04:33.022
who were too proud to show
any signs of disappointment,

00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:35.439
who had believed too much and for too long

00:04:35.972 --> 00:04:37.585
to start doubting now.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.842
But I was upset on their behalf.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.339
They had been duped,

00:04:44.363 --> 00:04:45.872
hoodwinked, bamboozled,

00:04:45.896 --> 00:04:47.921
and I had gone right along with them.

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.030
I had prayed their prayers,

00:04:50.054 --> 00:04:53.000
I had yielded not to temptation
as best I could.

00:04:53.024 --> 00:04:55.444
I had dipped my head not once, but twice

00:04:56.074 --> 00:04:58.439
in that snot-inducing baptism pool.

00:04:58.463 --> 00:04:59.726
I had believed.

00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:02.531
Now what?

00:05:03.706 --> 00:05:06.821
I got home just in time
to turn on the television

00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:09.289
and watch Peter Jennings
announce the new millennium

00:05:09.313 --> 00:05:11.002
as it rolled in around the world.

00:05:11.475 --> 00:05:15.841
It struck me that it would have
been strange anyway,

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:18.245
for Jesus to come back again and again

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:19.905
based on the different time zones.

00:05:19.929 --> 00:05:25.242
(Laughter)

00:05:27.037 --> 00:05:29.210
And this made me feel
even more ridiculous --

00:05:30.354 --> 00:05:31.555
hurt, really.

00:05:33.076 --> 00:05:36.245
But there on that night,
I did not stop believing.

00:05:37.197 --> 00:05:38.781
I just believed a new thing:

00:05:39.487 --> 00:05:41.919
that it was possible not to believe.

00:05:42.894 --> 00:05:45.306
It was possible the answers
I had were wrong,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.677
that the questions themselves were wrong.

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:51.263
And now, where there was once
a mountain of certitude,

00:05:51.772 --> 00:05:54.583
there was, running right down
to its foundation,

00:05:55.168 --> 00:05:56.721
a spring of doubt,

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.461
a spring that promised rivers.

00:06:00.357 --> 00:06:03.490
I can trace the whole drama of my life

00:06:03.514 --> 00:06:05.140
back to that night in that church

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:07.246
when my savior did not come for me;

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.591
when the thing I believed most certainly

00:06:11.328 --> 00:06:13.325
turned out to be, if not a lie,

00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:15.461
then not quite the truth.

00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:20.150
And even though most of you
prepared for Y2K in a very different way,

00:06:20.937 --> 00:06:23.322
I'm convinced that you are here

00:06:23.346 --> 00:06:27.254
because some part of you has done
the same thing that I have done

00:06:27.278 --> 00:06:29.301
since the dawn of this new century,

00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:32.460
since my mother left
and my father stayed away

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:34.165
and my Lord refused to come.

00:06:34.867 --> 00:06:36.354
And I held out my hand,

00:06:36.378 --> 00:06:39.330
reaching for something to believe in.

00:06:40.587 --> 00:06:43.479
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,

00:06:44.318 --> 00:06:46.832
with the faith that my journey
from Oak Cliff, Texas

00:06:46.856 --> 00:06:50.545
was a chance to leave behind
all the challenges I had known,

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.400
the broken dreams
and broken bodies I had seen.

00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:58.079
But when I found myself back home
one winter break,

00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:01.208
with my face planted in the floor,

00:07:02.268 --> 00:07:04.603
my hands tied behind my back

00:07:05.538 --> 00:07:07.512
and a burglar's gun pressed to my head,

00:07:07.536 --> 00:07:11.379
I knew that even the best education
couldn't save me.

00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:15.293
I held on when I showed up
at Lehman Brothers

00:07:15.317 --> 00:07:17.331
as an intern in 2008.

00:07:19.048 --> 00:07:23.715
(Laughter)

00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:25.054
So hopeful --

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:28.340
(Laughter)

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:30.383
that I called home to inform my family

00:07:30.407 --> 00:07:31.957
that we'd never be poor again.

00:07:31.981 --> 00:07:34.071
(Laughter)

00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:36.801
But as I witnessed this temple of finance

00:07:36.825 --> 00:07:38.640
come crashing down before my eyes,

00:07:38.664 --> 00:07:41.940
I knew that even the best job
couldn't save me.

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:48.452
I held on when I showed up
in Washington DC as a young staffer,

00:07:48.476 --> 00:07:50.701
who had heard a voice
call out from Illinois,

00:07:50.725 --> 00:07:52.853
saying, "It's been a long time coming,

00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:57.372
but in this election, change
has come to America."

00:07:58.549 --> 00:08:00.291
But as the Congress ground to a halt

00:08:00.315 --> 00:08:02.033
and the country ripped at the seams

00:08:02.057 --> 00:08:04.490
and hope and change
began to feel like a cruel joke,

00:08:04.514 --> 00:08:07.821
I knew that even
the political second coming

00:08:07.845 --> 00:08:09.068
could not save me.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:14.316
I had knelt faithfully at the altar
of the American Dream,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.518
praying to the gods of my time

00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:18.411
of success,

00:08:18.834 --> 00:08:19.984
and money,

00:08:20.358 --> 00:08:21.508
and power.

00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:24.037
But over and over again,

00:08:24.619 --> 00:08:27.662
midnight struck, and I opened my eyes

00:08:27.686 --> 00:08:30.154
to see that all of these gods were dead.

00:08:31.447 --> 00:08:32.828
And from that graveyard,

00:08:32.852 --> 00:08:34.297
I began the search once more,

00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:35.591
not because I was brave,

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:39.020
but because I knew
that I would either believe

00:08:39.044 --> 00:08:40.271
or I would die.

00:08:40.963 --> 00:08:43.754
So I took a pilgrimage
to yet another mecca,

00:08:44.409 --> 00:08:45.755
Harvard Business School --

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:48.283
(Laughter)

00:08:48.307 --> 00:08:52.192
this time, knowing that I could not
simply accept the salvation

00:08:52.216 --> 00:08:53.446
that it claimed to offer.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.065
No, I knew there'd be more work to do.

00:08:56.981 --> 00:09:01.276
The work began in the dark corner
of a crowded party,

00:09:02.138 --> 00:09:05.552
in the late night of an early,
miserable Cambridge winter,

00:09:06.457 --> 00:09:08.493
when three friends and I asked a question

00:09:08.517 --> 00:09:11.167
that young folks searching
for something real have asked

00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:12.958
for a very long time:

00:09:12.982 --> 00:09:14.656
"What if we took a road trip?"

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.724
(Laughter)

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:20.729
We didn't know where'd we go
or how we'd get there,

00:09:20.753 --> 00:09:22.514
but we knew we had to do it.

00:09:23.108 --> 00:09:26.124
Because all our lives we yearned,
as Jack Kerouac wrote,

00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:30.100
to "sneak out into the night
and disappear somewhere,"

00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:33.044
and go find out what everybody was doing

00:09:33.068 --> 00:09:34.340
all over the country.

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:37.519
So even though there were
other voices who said

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:39.996
that the risk was too great
and the proof too thin,

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.376
we went on anyhow.

00:09:42.354 --> 00:09:47.626
We went on 8,000 miles across America
in the summer of 2013,

00:09:48.358 --> 00:09:51.798
through the cow pastures of Montana,
through the desolation of Detroit,

00:09:51.822 --> 00:09:53.445
through the swamps of New Orleans,

00:09:53.469 --> 00:09:56.071
where we found and worked
with men and women

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:57.780
who were building small businesses

00:09:57.804 --> 00:10:00.749
that made purpose their bottom line.

00:10:01.962 --> 00:10:04.648
And having been trained
at the West Point of capitalism,

00:10:04.672 --> 00:10:06.776
this struck us as a revolutionary idea.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.816
(Laughter)

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.824
And this idea spread,

00:10:10.412 --> 00:10:14.150
growing into a nonprofit
called MBAs Across America,

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.229
a movement that landed me here
on this stage today.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.797
It spread because we found
a great hunger in our generation

00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:26.264
for purpose, for meaning.

00:10:27.317 --> 00:10:30.015
It spread because we found
countless entrepreneurs

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:31.947
in the nooks and crannies of America

00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:34.424
who were creating jobs and changing lives

00:10:34.448 --> 00:10:35.977
and who needed a little help.

00:10:37.082 --> 00:10:40.368
But if I'm being honest, it also spread

00:10:40.392 --> 00:10:42.094
because I fought to spread it.

00:10:43.204 --> 00:10:45.447
There was no length
to which I would not go

00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:46.627
to preach this gospel,

00:10:46.651 --> 00:10:49.487
to get more people to believe

00:10:49.511 --> 00:10:51.910
that we could bind the wounds
of a broken country,

00:10:51.934 --> 00:10:54.091
one social business at a time.

00:10:55.116 --> 00:10:58.289
But it was this journey of evangelism

00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:01.497
that led me to the rather different gospel

00:11:02.136 --> 00:11:04.772
that I've come to share with you today.

00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:09.079
It began one evening almost a year ago

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:13.393
at the Museum of Natural History
in New York City,

00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:17.123
at a gala for alumni
of Harvard Business School.

00:11:18.341 --> 00:11:20.876
Under a full-size replica of a whale,

00:11:21.573 --> 00:11:23.924
I sat with the titans of our time

00:11:23.948 --> 00:11:26.669
as they celebrated their peers
and their good deeds.

00:11:27.727 --> 00:11:29.011
There was pride in a room

00:11:29.035 --> 00:11:31.914
where net worth
and assets under management

00:11:31.938 --> 00:11:34.317
surpassed half a trillion dollars.

00:11:35.196 --> 00:11:37.203
We looked over all that we had made,

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:39.028
and it was good.

00:11:39.927 --> 00:11:41.914
(Laughter)

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:44.296
But it just so happened,

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:46.145
two days later,

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.693
I had to travel up the road to Harlem,

00:11:49.455 --> 00:11:51.894
where I found myself
sitting in an urban farm

00:11:51.918 --> 00:11:53.703
that had once been a vacant lot,

00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:57.316
listening to a man named Tony
tell me of the kids

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.898
that showed up there every day.

00:11:59.944 --> 00:12:03.267
All of them lived below the poverty line.

00:12:04.075 --> 00:12:07.495
Many of them carried
all of their belongings in a backpack

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:09.704
to avoid losing them
in a homeless shelter.

00:12:10.432 --> 00:12:13.680
Some of them came to Tony's program,

00:12:13.704 --> 00:12:15.051
called Harlem Grown,

00:12:15.677 --> 00:12:18.024
to get the only meal they had each day.

00:12:19.465 --> 00:12:24.080
Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown
with money from his pension,

00:12:24.954 --> 00:12:27.207
after 20 years as a cab driver.

00:12:28.232 --> 00:12:30.551
He told me that he didn't give
himself a salary,

00:12:31.342 --> 00:12:35.184
because despite success,
the program struggled for resources.

00:12:35.993 --> 00:12:38.100
He told me that he would take any help

00:12:38.665 --> 00:12:39.822
that he could get.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.136
And I was there as that help.

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:49.158
But as I left Tony,
I felt the sting and salt of tears

00:12:49.838 --> 00:12:51.375
welling up in my eyes.

00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:54.474
I felt the weight of revelation

00:12:55.187 --> 00:12:58.319
that I could sit in one room on one night,

00:12:59.206 --> 00:13:03.308
where a few hundred people
had half a trillion dollars,

00:13:04.187 --> 00:13:06.248
and another room, two days later,

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.117
just 50 blocks up the road,

00:13:09.971 --> 00:13:12.215
where a man was going without a salary

00:13:12.897 --> 00:13:15.791
to get a child her only meal of the day.

00:13:16.887 --> 00:13:20.417
And it wasn't the glaring inequality
that made me want to cry,

00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:23.252
it wasn't the thought of hungry,
homeless kids,

00:13:23.276 --> 00:13:25.112
it wasn't rage toward the one percent

00:13:25.136 --> 00:13:27.414
or pity toward the 99.

00:13:27.787 --> 00:13:31.572
No, I was disturbed
because I had finally realized

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.599
that I was the dialysis

00:13:34.623 --> 00:13:37.820
for a country that needed
a kidney transplant.

00:13:38.647 --> 00:13:42.316
I realized that my story
stood in for all those

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.182
who were expected to pick
themselves up by their bootstraps,

00:13:45.206 --> 00:13:47.352
even if they didn't have any boots;

00:13:48.182 --> 00:13:49.855
that my organization stood in

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:53.629
for all the structural, systemic help
that never went to Harlem

00:13:53.653 --> 00:13:55.598
or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward;

00:13:55.622 --> 00:14:00.401
that my voice stood in
for all those voices

00:14:01.098 --> 00:14:06.241
that seemed too unlearned,
too unwashed, too unaccommodated.

00:14:07.273 --> 00:14:08.538
And the shame of that,

00:14:09.721 --> 00:14:11.108
that shame washed over me

00:14:11.132 --> 00:14:13.993
like the shame of sitting
in front of the television,

00:14:14.898 --> 00:14:17.397
watching Peter Jennings
announce the new millennium

00:14:17.421 --> 00:14:18.629
again

00:14:18.653 --> 00:14:19.803
and again

00:14:20.257 --> 00:14:21.407
and again.

00:14:21.796 --> 00:14:22.946
I had been duped,

00:14:24.084 --> 00:14:25.234
hoodwinked,

00:14:25.696 --> 00:14:26.846
bamboozled.

00:14:27.403 --> 00:14:30.477
But this time, the false savior was me.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.302
You see, I've come a long way 
from that altar

00:14:35.326 --> 00:14:37.422
on the night I thought
the world would end,

00:14:38.371 --> 00:14:40.576
from a world where people spoke in tongues

00:14:41.107 --> 00:14:43.745
and saw suffering
as a necessary act of God

00:14:44.222 --> 00:14:46.290
and took a text to be infallible truth.

00:14:46.314 --> 00:14:47.839
Yes, I've come so far

00:14:48.607 --> 00:14:51.143
that I'm right back where I started.

00:14:52.103 --> 00:14:54.318
Because it simply is not true to say

00:14:54.342 --> 00:14:56.223
that we live in an age of disbelief --

00:14:56.247 --> 00:15:00.563
no, we believe today just as much
as any time that came before.

00:15:01.409 --> 00:15:04.252
Some of us may believe
in the prophecy of Brené Brown

00:15:04.276 --> 00:15:05.452
or Tony Robbins.

00:15:06.003 --> 00:15:08.103
We may believe in the bible
of The New Yorker

00:15:08.127 --> 00:15:09.737
or the Harvard Business Review.

00:15:10.146 --> 00:15:11.725
We may believe most deeply

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.752
when we worship right here
at the church of TED,

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:17.528
but we desperately want to believe,

00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:19.098
we need to believe.

00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:22.186
We speak in the tongues
of charismatic leaders

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.402
that promise to solve all our problems.

00:15:24.426 --> 00:15:28.506
We see suffering as a necessary act
of the capitalism that is our god,

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.762
we take the text of technological progress

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.233
to be infallible truth.

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:37.650
And we hardly realize
the human price we pay

00:15:38.412 --> 00:15:40.762
when we fail to question one brick,

00:15:41.692 --> 00:15:44.641
because we fear it might shake
our whole foundation.

00:15:45.677 --> 00:15:47.278
But if you are disturbed

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.210
by the unconscionable things
that we have come to accept,

00:15:51.777 --> 00:15:54.683
then it must be questioning time.

00:15:55.987 --> 00:16:00.034
So I have not a gospel
of disruption or innovation

00:16:00.058 --> 00:16:01.508
or a triple bottom line.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.985
I do not have a gospel of faith
to share with you today, in fact.

00:16:07.125 --> 00:16:10.967
I have and I offer a gospel of doubt.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.020
The gospel of doubt does not ask
that you stop believing,

00:16:15.737 --> 00:16:17.657
it asks that you believe a new thing:

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.737
that it is possible not to believe.

00:16:21.512 --> 00:16:23.682
It is possible the answers
we have are wrong,

00:16:23.706 --> 00:16:26.289
it is possible the questions
themselves are wrong.

00:16:26.313 --> 00:16:30.135
Yes, the gospel of doubt means
that it is possible that we,

00:16:30.619 --> 00:16:32.745
on this stage, in this room,

00:16:33.178 --> 00:16:34.335
are wrong.

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:37.044
Because it raises the question, "Why?"

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:40.964
With all the power
that we hold in our hands,

00:16:40.988 --> 00:16:44.368
why are people still suffering so bad?

00:16:45.209 --> 00:16:49.764
This doubt leads me to share
that we are putting my organization,

00:16:49.788 --> 00:16:51.054
MBAs Across America,

00:16:51.078 --> 00:16:52.706
out of business.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.222
We have shed our staff
and closed our doors

00:16:55.246 --> 00:16:57.274
and we will share our model freely

00:16:57.298 --> 00:17:00.184
with anyone who sees
their power to do this work

00:17:00.208 --> 00:17:02.056
without waiting for our permission.

00:17:02.434 --> 00:17:04.755
This doubt compels me

00:17:05.236 --> 00:17:07.009
to renounce the role of savior

00:17:07.033 --> 00:17:08.428
that some have placed on me,

00:17:08.901 --> 00:17:11.996
because our time is too short
and our odds are too long

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.800
to wait for second comings,

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:17.308
when the truth is that
there will be no miracles here.

00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:20.049
And this doubt, it fuels me,

00:17:20.737 --> 00:17:22.028
it gives me hope

00:17:22.606 --> 00:17:24.856
that when our troubles overwhelm us,

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.879
when the paths laid out for us
seem to lead to our demise,

00:17:30.528 --> 00:17:33.556
when our healers bring
no comfort to our wounds,

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:36.617
it will not be our blind faith --

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.810
no, it will be our humble doubt

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.041
that shines a little light
into the darkness of our lives

00:17:44.065 --> 00:17:45.298
and of our world

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.039
and lets us raise our voice to whisper

00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:49.983
or to shout

00:17:50.437 --> 00:17:52.152
or to say simply,

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:53.326
very simply,

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:56.222
"There must be another way."

00:17:57.011 --> 00:17:58.162
Thank you.

00:17:58.186 --> 00:18:18.408
(Applause)
