00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.160
Well, this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.160
in the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.160
And I'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.160
And I'm also rather surprised, because when I look back on my life

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.160
the last thing I ever wanted to do was write, or be in any way involved in religion.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
After I left my convent, I'd finished with religion, frankly.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.160
I thought that was it.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.160
And for 13 years I kept clear of it. I wanted to be an English literature professor.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.160
And I certainly didn't even want to be a writer, particularly.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.160
But then I suffered a series of career catastrophes,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.160
one after the other, and finally found myself in television. (Laughter)

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.160
I said that to Bill Moyers, and he said, "Oh, we take anybody." (Laughter)

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.160
And I was doing some rather controversial religious programs.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.160
This went down very well in the U.K., where religion is extremely unpopular.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160
And so, for once, for the only time in my life, I was finally in the mainstream.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.160
But I got sent to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.160
And there, for the first time, I encountered the other religious traditions:

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.160
Judaism and Islam, the sister religions of Christianity.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.160
And while I found I knew nothing about these faiths at all --

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.160
despite my own intensely religious background,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
I'd seen Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
and I knew nothing about Islam at all.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
But in that city, that tortured city,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.160
where you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
you also become aware of the profound connection between them.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.160
And it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.160
to a sense of what religion can be, and actually enabled me

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
to look at my own faith in a different light.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
And I found some astonishing things in the course of my study

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.160
that had never occurred to me. Frankly, in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
I just found the whole thing absolutely incredible.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.160
These doctrines seemed unproven, abstract.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And to my astonishment, when I began seriously studying other traditions,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.160
I began to realize that belief -- which we make such a fuss about today --

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.160
is only a very recent religious enthusiasm

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.160
that surfaced only in the West, in about the 17th century.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.160
The word "belief" itself originally meant to love, to prize, to hold dear.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
In the 17th century, it narrowed its focus,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
for reasons that I'm exploring in a book I'm writing at the moment,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:42.160
to include -- to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions, a credo.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.160
"I believe:" it did not mean, "I accept certain creedal articles of faith."

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.160
It meant: "I commit myself. I engage myself."

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.160
Indeed, some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.160
In the Quran, religious opinion -- religious orthodoxy -- is dismissed as "zanna:"

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.160
self-indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian. (Laughter)

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.160
So if religion is not about believing things, what is it about?

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.160
What I've found, across the board, is that religion is about behaving differently.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.160
Instead of deciding whether or not you believe in God, first you do something.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.160
You behave in a committed way,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.160
and then you begin to understand the truths of religion.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.160
And religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action;

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
you only understand them when you put them into practice.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Now, pride of place in this practice is given to compassion.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.160
And it is an arresting fact that right across the board,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
in every single one of the major world faiths, compassion --

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.160
the ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening --

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:18.160
is not only the test of any true religiosity, it is also what will bring us

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.160
into the presence of what Jews, Christians and Muslims call "God" or the "Divine."

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.160
It is compassion, says the Buddha, which brings you to Nirvana.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.160
Why? Because in compassion, when we feel with the other,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.160
we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:46.160
another person there. And once we get rid of ego, then we're ready to see the Divine.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:54.160
And in particular, every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted -- has said --

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.160
and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the Golden Rule.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.160
First propounded by Confucius five centuries before Christ:

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.160
"Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you."

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.160
That, he said, was the central thread which ran through all his teaching

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160
and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.160
And it was -- the Golden Rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called "ren,"

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.160
human-heartedness, which was a transcendent experience in itself.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.160
And this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms, too.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
There's a famous story about the great rabbi, Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.160
A pagan came to him and offered to convert to Judaism if the rabbi could

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
recite the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.160
Hillel stood on one leg and said, "That which is hateful to you,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.160
do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah. The rest is commentary.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
Go and study it." (Laughter)

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.160
And "go and study it" was what he meant.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.160
He said, "In your exegesis, you must make it clear

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:11.160
that every single verse of the Torah is a commentary, a gloss upon the Golden Rule."

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:19.160
The great Rabbi Meir said that any interpretation of Scripture which

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.160
led to hatred and disdain, or contempt of other people --

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
any people whatsoever -- was illegitimate.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
Saint Augustine made exactly the same point.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.160
Scripture, he says, "teaches nothing but charity, and we must not leave

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.160
an interpretation of Scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it."

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:49.160
And this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:55.160
is a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life. (Applause)

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:02.160
But now look at our world. And we are living in a world that is --

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:13.160
where religion has been hijacked. Where terrorists cite Quranic verses to justify their atrocities.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:20.160
Where instead of taking Jesus' words, "Love your enemies.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:27.160
Don't judge others," we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:33.160
endlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:41.160
putting other people down. Throughout the ages, religion has been used to oppress others,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.160
and this is because of human ego, human greed.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.160
We have a talent as a species for messing up wonderful things.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:57.160
So the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point, I think --

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
that you could not and must not confine your compassion

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:07.160
to your own group: your own nation, your own co-religionists,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.160
your own fellow countrymen. You must have what one of the Chinese sages called "jian ai":

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.160
concern for everybody. Love your enemies. Honor the stranger.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:24.160
We formed you, says the Quran, into tribes and nations so that you may know one another.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:34.160
And this, again -- this universal outreach -- is getting subdued in the strident use of religion --

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.160
abuse of religion -- for nefarious gains.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.160
Now, I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.160
when I say to them what I do for a living, inform me that religion

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.160
has been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.160
The causes of our present woes are political.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.160
But, make no mistake about it, religion is a kind of fault line,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
and when a conflict gets ingrained in a region, religion can get sucked in

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.160
and become part of the problem. Our modernity has been exceedingly violent.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:28.160
Between 1914 and 1945, 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:37.160
And so many of our institutions, even football, which used to be a pleasant pastime,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.160
now causes riots where people even die.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:49.160
And it's not surprising that religion, too, has been affected by this violent ethos.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:55.160
There's also a great deal, I think, of religious illiteracy around.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.160
People seem to think, now equate religious faith with believing things.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.160
As though that -- we call religious people often believers,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:14.160
as though that were the main thing that they do. And very often, secondary goals

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:20.160
get pushed into the first place, in place of compassion and the Golden Rule.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.160
Because the Golden Rule is difficult. I sometimes -- when I'm speaking to

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.160
congregations about compassion, I sometimes see

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:37.160
a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:43.160
a lot of religious people prefer to be right, rather than compassionate. (Laughter)

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.160
Now -- but that's not the whole story.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:53.160
Since September the 11th, when my work on Islam suddenly propelled me

00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:00.160
into public life, in a way that I'd never imagined, I've been able to sort of go all over the world,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:06.160
and finding, everywhere I go, a yearning for change.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:14.160
I've just come back from Pakistan, where literally thousands of people came to my lectures,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.160
because they were yearning, first of all, to hear a friendly Western voice.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:25.160
And especially the young people were coming. And were asking me --

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:30.160
the young people were saying, "What can we do? What can we do to change things?"

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:37.160
And my hosts in Pakistan said, "Look, don't be too polite to us.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:43.160
Tell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing."

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:50.160
Because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:59.160
at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:05.160
and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:11.160
And religion, with its wide following ... Here in the United States,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:17.160
people may be being religious in a different way, as a report has just shown --

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:25.160
but they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.160
which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old-fashioned.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:35.160
But people want to be religious, and religion should be made

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.160
to be a force for harmony in the world, which it can and should be --

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
because of the Golden Rule.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.160
"Do not do to others what you would not have them do to you":

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
an ethos that should now be applied globally.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:57.160
We should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:05.160
And these -- whatever our wretched beliefs -- is a religious matter, it's a spiritual matter.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:10.160
It's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.160
And as I say, there is a hunger for change out there.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.160
Here in the United States, I think you see it in this election campaign: a longing for change.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:30.160
And people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after September the 11th,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:36.160
coming together locally to create networks of understanding.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.160
With the mosque, with the synagogue, saying, "We must start to speak to one another."

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:52.160
I think it's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation of the other.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.160
I'd -- there's one story I'd just like to mention.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:03.160
This comes from "The Iliad." But it tells you what this spirituality should be.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.160
You know the story of "The Iliad," the 10-year war between Greece and Troy.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.160
In one incident, Achilles, the famous warrior of Greece, takes his troops out of the war,

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:19.160
and the whole war effort suffers. And in the course of the ensuing muddle,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:25.160
his beloved friend, Patroclus, is killed -- and killed in single combat

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:30.160
by one of the Trojan princes, Hector. And Achilles goes mad with grief and rage and revenge,

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:39.160
and he mutilates the body. He kills Hector, he mutilates his body

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.160
and then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:51.160
which means that, in Greek ethos, Hector's soul will wander eternally, lost.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.160
And then one night, Priam, king of Troy, an old man,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.160
comes into the Greek camp incognito, makes his way to Achilles' tent

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
to ask for the body of his son.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:10.160
And everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:16.160
And Achilles looks at him and thinks of his father. And he starts to weep.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.160
And Priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.160
and he, too, starts to weep. And the sound of their weeping filled the house.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:32.160
The Greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:40.160
And then Achilles takes the body of Hector, he hands it very tenderly to the father,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.160
and the two men look at each other, and see each other as divine.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:51.160
That is the ethos found, too, in all the religions.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:59.160
It's what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.160
and beginning to appreciate the other.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:11.160
It's of great importance that the word for "holy" in Hebrew, applied to God, is "Kadosh": separate, other.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:17.160
And it is often, perhaps, the very otherness of our enemies which can

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.160
give us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is God.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.160
And now, here's my wish:

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:32.160
I wish that you would help with the creation,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:38.160
launch and propagation of a Charter for Compassion,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.160
crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.160
the three Abrahamic traditions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.160
and based on the fundamental principle of the Golden Rule.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:18:01.160
We need to create a movement among all these people that I meet in my travels --

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.160
you probably meet, too -- who want to join up, in some way,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.160
and reclaim their faith, which they feel, as I say, has been hijacked.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:16.160
We need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.160
and to give guidelines. This Charter would not be a massive document.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:28.160
I'd like to see it -- to give guidelines as to how to interpret the Scriptures,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:34.160
these texts that are being abused. Remember what the rabbis and what Augustine

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.160
said about how Scripture should be governed by the principle of charity.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:43.160
Let's get back to that. And the idea, too, of Jews, Christians and Muslims --

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.160
these traditions now so often at loggerheads -- working together to

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:55.160
create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand, at least,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.160
of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.160
And you are the people. I'm just a solitary scholar.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:09.160
Despite the idea that I love a good time, which I was rather amazed to see coming up on me

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:15.160
-- I actually spend a great deal of time alone, studying, and I'm not very --

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:22.160
you're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.160
everybody on the planet. I've had some preliminary talks,

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.160
and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, for example,

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:39.160
is very happy to give his name to this, as is Imam Feisal Rauf, the Imam in New York City.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:47.160
Also, I would be working with the Alliance of Civilizations at the United Nations.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:55.160
I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations,

00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:01.160
which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:10.160
and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.160
And the Alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:20.160
The importance of this is that this is -- I can see some of you starting to look worried,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.160
because you think it's a slow and cumbersome body --

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.160
but what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:32.160
so that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative, but that it's coming,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.160
as it were, from the United Nations, from the world --

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:41.160
who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:47.160
And so I do urge you to join me in making -- in this charter --

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:55.160
to building this charter, launching it and propagating it so that it becomes --

00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:04.160
I'd like to see it in every college, every church, every mosque, every synagogue in the world,

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:13.160
so that people can look at their tradition, reclaim it, and make religion a source of peace in the world,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.160
which it can and should be. Thank you very much. (Applause)
