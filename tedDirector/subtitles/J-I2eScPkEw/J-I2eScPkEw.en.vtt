00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.330
I've spent the last decade

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.330
subjecting myself to pain and humiliation,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
hopefully for a good cause,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
which is self-improvement.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330
And I've done this in three parts.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
So first I started with the mind.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.330
And I decided to try to get smarter

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
from A to Z --

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
or, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec."

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
And here's a little image of that.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
And this was an amazing year.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.330
It was really a fascinating journey.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
It was painful at times,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
especially for those around me.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
My wife started to fine me one dollar

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
So it had its downsides.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
But after that,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
I decided to work on the spirit.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
As I mentioned last year,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
I grew up with no religion at all.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
I'm Jewish,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
(Laughter)

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
Not really.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
by actually diving in

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
and trying to live it and immerse myself in it.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
And from the Ten Commandments

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
to growing my beard --

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
because Leviticus says you cannot shave.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
So this is what I looked like by the end.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
Thank you for that reaction.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
(Laughter)

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
I got both of them.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
So there was the topiary there.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
And there's the sheep.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
Now the final part of the trilogy

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
was I wanted to focus on the body

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
and try to be the healthiest person I could be,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
the healthiest person alive.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
And I just finished a couple of months ago.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
And I have to say, thank God.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
Because living so healthily was killing me.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
(Laughter)

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
It was so overwhelming,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
because the amount of things you have to do,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
it's just mind-boggling.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
I was listening to all the experts

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
And they were telling me

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
all the things I had to do.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
I had to eat right,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
exercise, meditate, pet dogs,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
because that lowers the blood pressure.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
I wrote the book on a treadmill,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
and it took me about a thousand miles

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
to write the book.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
I had to put on sunscreen.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
This was no small feat,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
because if you listen to dermatologists,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
So I think half of my book advance

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
went into sunscreen.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
I was like a glazed doughnut

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
for most of the year.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
There was the washing of hands.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
I had to do that properly.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
And my immunologist told me

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
that I should also wipe down

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
because those are just orgies of germs.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
So that took a lot of time.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
I also tried to be the safest person I could be,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
because that's a part of health.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
I was inspired

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
by the Danish Safety Council.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
They started a public campaign

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
that says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet."

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.330
So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
but also for walking around.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
And you can see there

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
they're shopping with their helmets.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
(Laughter)

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
Well yeah, I tried that.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
Now it's a little extreme, I admit.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
But if you think about this,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330
this is actually -- the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this --

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.330
that more people die on a per mile basis

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
from drunk walking

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
than from drunk driving.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
So something to think about tonight

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
if you've had a couple.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
So I finished,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
and it was a success in a sense.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
All of the markers went in the right direction.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
My cholesterol went down, I lost weight,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.330
my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
So that was nice.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
And it was successful overall.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
But I also learned that I was too healthy,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
and that was unhealthy.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
I was so focused on doing all these things

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
that I was neglecting my friends and family.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
And as Dan Buettner can tell you,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
having a strong social network

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
is so crucial to our health.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
So I finished.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
And I kind of went overboard

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
on the week after the project was over.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
I went to the dark side,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
and I just indulged myself.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
It was like something out of Caligula.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.330
(Laughter)

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
Without the sex part.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
Because I have three young kids,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
so that wasn't happening.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
But the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.330
And I finally have stabilized.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
So now I'm back

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
to adopting many -- not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore --

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
but dozens of healthy behaviors

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
that I adopted during my year.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
It was really a life-changing project.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
Let me just tell you two really quickly.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
The first is -- and this was surprising to me;

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
I didn't expect this to come out --

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
but I live a much quieter life now.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
Because we live in such a noisy world.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.330
There's trains and planes and cars

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
(Laughter)

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.330
And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard --

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
but it actually initiates

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
the fight-or-flight response.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
And this, over the years,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
The World Health Organization just did a big study

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
that they published this year.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
And it was done in Europe.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
And they estimated

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.330
that 1.6 million years of healthy living

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
are lost every year in Europe

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
because of noise pollution.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
So they think it's actually very deadly.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
And by the way,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
it's also terrible for your brain.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
It really impairs cognition.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
And our Founding Fathers knew about this.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
When they wrote the Constitution,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.330
they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
so that they could concentrate.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
So without noise reduction technology,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
our country would not exist.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
So as a patriot,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
I felt it was important to --

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.330
I wear all the earplugs and the earphones,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
and it's really improved my life

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
in a surprising and unexpected way.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
And the second point I want to make, the final point,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.330
is that -- and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED --

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.330
that joy is so important to your health,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.330
that very few of these behaviors

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
will stick with me

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.330
unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
And just to give you one instance of this:

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
food.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
The junk food industry

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
is really great

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
at pressing our pleasure buttons

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.330
and figuring out what's the most pleasurable.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
But I think we can use their techniques

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
and apply them to healthy food.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
To give just one example,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
we love crunchiness, mouthfeel.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.330
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
into a lot of my recipes --

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
throw in some sunflower seeds.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
And you can almost trick yourself

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
into thinking you're eating Doritos.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
(Laughter)

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
And it has made me a healthier person.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
So that is it.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
The book about it comes out in April.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
It's called "Drop Dead Healthy."

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
That's my greatest hope.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
So thank you very much.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
(Applause)
