00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Hello, everyone. Because this is my first time at TED,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I've decided to bring along an old friend

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.260
to help break the ice a bit.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Yes. That's right. This is Barbie.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
She's 50 years old. And she's looking as young as ever.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.260
(Laughter)

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
But I'd also like to introduce you to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.260
what may be an unfamiliar face.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.260
This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
They have different interests. They have divergent values.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And should they ever come in contact ...

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.260
My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Where I work, in the Arab region,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
people are busy taking up Western innovations

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and changing them into things

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
which are neither conventionally Western,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
nor are they traditionally Islamic.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
I want to show you two examples.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
The first is 4Shbab.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.260
It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
(Video): Video clips from across the globe.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
The USA.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side ♫

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
♫ Everything will be all right ♫

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
The Arab world.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:02:00.260
(Music)

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.260
♫ She was preserved by modesty of the religion ♫

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.260
♫ She was adorned by the light of the Quran ♫

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Shereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
called Ahmed Abu Haïba,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
wants young people to be inspired

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
by Islam to lead better lives.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
He reckons the best way to get that message across

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.260
is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
4Shbab was set up as an alternative

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
to existing Arab music channels.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And they look something like this.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
(Music)

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and pan-Arab pin-up girl.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
But it's not about fire and brimstone either.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
Its videos are intended to show

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
a kinder, gentler face of Islam,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
for young people to deal with life's challenges.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And it's called "The 99."

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
called Naif Al Mutawa.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And his desire is to rescue Islam

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
from images of intolerance,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.260
all in a child-friendly format.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
"The 99." The characters are meant to embody

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
the 99 attributes of Allah:

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
justice, wisdom, mercy, among others.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.260
So, for example, there is the character of Noora.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
She is meant to have the power

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
to look inside people

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and see the good and bad in everyone.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Another character called Jami

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.260
has the ability to create fantastic inventions.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
It's now a theme park.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
There is an animated series in the works.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And by this time next year,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
will have joined forces with "The 99"

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.260
to beat injustice wherever they find it.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
"The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.260
of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.260
in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Now, while 4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
there is actually a very long tradition of this.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
both ancient and modern.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this:

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
"We made you into nations and tribes

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
so that you could learn from one another."

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
And to my mind, those are pretty wise words,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
no matter what your creed. Thank you.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.260
(Applause)
