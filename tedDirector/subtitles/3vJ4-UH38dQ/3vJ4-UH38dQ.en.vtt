00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:14.017
Zika fever:

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.646
our newest dread disease.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.666
What is it? Where'd it come from?

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.920
What do we do about it?

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.120
Well for most adults,
it's a relatively mild disease --

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:32.445
a little fever, a little headache,
joint pain, maybe a rash.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.140
In fact, most people who get it
don't even know they've had it.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.354
But the more we find out
about the Zika virus

00:00:40.378 --> 00:00:41.926
the more terrifying it becomes.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.457
For example, doctors
have noticed an uptick

00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:49.195
of something called Guillain-BarrÃ©
syndrome in recent outbreaks.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.371
In Guillain-BarrÃ©, your immune system
attacks your nerve cells

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:55.514
it can partially
or even totally paralyze you.

00:00:56.092 --> 00:00:59.330
Fortunately, that's quite rare,
and most people recover.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.913
But if you're pregnant
when you're infected

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.143
you're at risk of something terrible.

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:11.960
Indeed, a child with a deformed head.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.984
Here's a normal baby.

00:01:15.134 --> 00:01:18.373
Here's that infant
with what's called microcephaly.

00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:21.553
a brain in a head that's too small.

00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:23.807
And there's no known cure.

00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:30.671
It was actually doctors
in northeastern Brazil

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:35.805
who first noticed, just a year ago,
after a Zika outbreak,

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.956
that there was a peak
in the incidence of microcephaly.

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.306
It took medical doctors another year

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.122
to be sure that it was caused
by the Zika virus,

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.297
but they're now sure.

00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:49.003
And if you're a "bring on
the evidence" type,

00:01:49.027 --> 00:01:50.590
check out this publication.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.524
So where did it come from,
and how did it get here?

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:55.857
And it is here.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:58.793
Like many of our viruses,
it came out of Africa,

00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:02.610
specifically the Zika forest in Uganda.

00:02:03.596 --> 00:02:08.374
Researchers at the nearby
Yellow Fever Research Institute

00:02:08.398 --> 00:02:12.684
identified an unknown virus
in a monkey in the Zika forest

00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:14.708
which is how it got its name.

00:02:15.413 --> 00:02:17.626
The first human cases of Zika fever

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.625
surfaced a few years later
in Uganda-Tanzania.

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.190
The virus then spread through West Africa

00:02:25.036 --> 00:02:31.450
and east through equatorial Asia --
Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia.

00:02:32.164 --> 00:02:36.156
But it was still mostly in monkeys
and, of course, mosquitoes.

00:02:37.692 --> 00:02:43.490
In fact in the 60 years between the time
it was first identified in 1947 and 2007

00:02:43.514 --> 00:02:47.117
there were only 13 reported cases
of human Zika fever.

00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:53.496
And then something extraordinary happened
on the tiny Micronesian Yap islands.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.805
There was an outbreak that affected
fully 75 percent of the population.

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:02.455
How did it get there? By air.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.136
Today we have two billion
commercial airline passengers.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.403
An infected passenger can board a plane,
fly halfway around the world

00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:14.958
before developing symptoms --
if they develop symptoms at all.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.999
Then when they land, the local mosquitoes
begin to bite them and spread the fever.

00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:26.786
Zika fever then next surfaced
in 2013 in French Polynesia.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.444
By December of that year, it was being
transmitted locally by the mosquitoes.

00:03:32.834 --> 00:03:37.834
That led to an explosive outbreak in which
almost 30,000 people were affected.

00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:40.588
From there it radiated around the Pacific.

00:03:40.612 --> 00:03:45.135
There were outbreaks in the Cook
Islands, in New Caledonia,

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:47.944
in Vanuatu, in the Solomon Islands

00:03:47.968 --> 00:03:52.856
and almost all the way around to the coast
of South America and Easter Island.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.332
And then, in early 2015,

00:03:56.356 --> 00:04:00.721
there was an upsurge of cases
of a dengue-like syndrome

00:04:01.213 --> 00:04:04.641
in the city of Natal
in northeastern Brazil.

00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:10.553
The virus wasn't dengue, it was Zika,
and it spread rapidly --

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:16.617
Recife down the coast, a big metropolitan
center, soon became the epicenter.

00:04:17.235 --> 00:04:22.837
Well people have speculated that it was
2014 World Cup soccer fans

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.910
that brought the virus into the country.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.731
But others have speculated that perhaps
it was Pacific Islanders

00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:32.414
participating in championship canoe races

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.866
that were held in Rio that year
that brought it in.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.269
Well today, this is only a year later.

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:43.000
The virus is being locally transmitted
by mosquitoes

00:04:43.024 --> 00:04:46.285
virtually throughout South America,
Central America, Mexico

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:47.730
and the Caribbean Islands

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.887
Until this year, the many
thousands of cases

00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:55.730
that have been diagnosed in the US
were contracted elsewhere.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:05:02.054
But as of this summer, it's being
transmitted locally in Miami.

00:05:02.078 --> 00:05:03.319
It's here.

00:05:03.343 --> 00:05:04.628
So what do we do about it?

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.363
Well, preventing infection

00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:13.712
is either about protecting people
or about eliminating the mosquitoes.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.651
Let's focus on people first.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.191
You can get vaccinated.

00:05:18.892 --> 00:05:22.865
You can not travel to Zika areas.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.817
Or you can cover up
and apply insect repellent.

00:05:26.658 --> 00:05:30.063
Getting vaccinated is not an option,
because there isn't a vaccine yet

00:05:30.087 --> 00:05:32.467
and there probably won't be
for a couple of years.

00:05:33.673 --> 00:05:37.616
Staying home isn't
a foolproof protection either

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.655
because we now know that
it can be sexually transmitted.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.936
Covering up and applying
insect repellent does work ...

00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:47.142
until you forget.

00:05:47.642 --> 00:05:49.420
(Laughter)

00:05:49.444 --> 00:05:52.547
So that leaves the mosquitoes,
and here's how we control them now:

00:05:53.055 --> 00:05:54.880
spraying insecticides.

00:05:56.134 --> 00:06:00.000
The protective gear is necessary
because these are toxic chemicals

00:06:00.024 --> 00:06:02.625
that kill people as well as bugs.

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:06.416
Although it does take quite a lot more
to kill a person than to kill a bug.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.616
These are pictures from
Brazil and Nicaragua.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.273
But it looks the same in Miami, Florida.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.883
And we of course can spray
insecticides from planes.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.494
Last summer, mosquito control officials
in Dorchester County, South Carolina,

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:29.423
authorized spraying of Naled,
an insecticide,

00:06:29.447 --> 00:06:32.327
early one morning,
as recommended by the manufacturer.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.025
Later that day, a beekeeper told reporters

00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:40.850
that her bee yard looked
like it had been nuked.

00:06:41.644 --> 00:06:43.033
Oops.

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:45.031
Bees are the good guys.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:52.460
The citizens of Florida protested,
but spraying continued.

00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:57.285
Unfortunately, so did the increase
in the number of Zika fever cases.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.523
That's because insecticides
aren't very effective.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:08.471
So are there any approaches that are
perhaps more effective than spraying

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.713
but with less downsides
than toxic chemicals?

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.641
I'm a huge fan of biological controls,

00:07:19.665 --> 00:07:24.158
and I share that view with Rachel Carson,
author of "Silent Spring,"

00:07:24.182 --> 00:07:29.196
the book that is credited with starting
the environmental movement.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.776
In this book she tells the story,
as an example,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.458
of how a very nasty insect
pest of livestock

00:07:38.482 --> 00:07:41.522
was eliminated in the last century.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.422
No one knows that
extraordinary story today.

00:07:44.446 --> 00:07:48.685
So Jack Block and I,
when we were writing an editorial

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:51.923
about the mosquito problem today,
retold that story.

00:07:51.947 --> 00:07:56.613
And in capsule form, it's that pupae --
that's the immature form of the insect --

00:07:56.637 --> 00:08:01.416
were irradiated until they were sterile,
grown to adulthood

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.050
and then released from planes
all over the Southwest,

00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:09.487
the Southeast and down into Mexico
and into Central America

00:08:09.511 --> 00:08:13.320
literally by the hundreds of millions
from little airplanes,

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:18.153
eventually eliminating
that terrible insect pest

00:08:18.502 --> 00:08:20.580
for most of the Western Hemisphere.

00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:24.399
Our real purpose in writing this editorial

00:08:24.423 --> 00:08:27.407
was to introduce readers
to how we can do that today --

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:31.874
not with radiation
but with our knowledge of genetics.

00:08:31.898 --> 00:08:33.048
Let me explain.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.206
This is the bad guy: Aedes aegypti.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.891
It's the most common insect
vector of diseases,

00:08:40.915 --> 00:08:44.709
not just Zika but dengue,
Chikungunya, West Nile virus

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:48.367
and that ancient plague, yellow fever.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.655
It's an urban mosquito,

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:54.585
and it's the female
that does the dirty work.

00:08:54.609 --> 00:08:59.363
She bites to get a blood meal
to feed her offspring.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.927
Males don't bite; they don't even
have the mouth parts to bite.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:10.577
A little British company called Oxitec
genetically modified that mosquito

00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:16.946
so that when it mates with a wild female,
its eggs don't develop to adulthood.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.120
Let me show you.

00:09:18.477 --> 00:09:21.001
This is the normal reproductive cycle.

00:09:21.715 --> 00:09:25.961
Oxitec designed the mosquito so that
when the male mates with the wild female

00:09:26.897 --> 00:09:28.103
the eggs don't develop.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.020
Sounds impossible?

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.972
Well let me show you
just diagrammatically how they do it.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.812
Now this represents the nucleus
of a mosquito cell,

00:09:37.836 --> 00:09:40.788
and that tangle in the middle
represents its genome,

00:09:40.812 --> 00:09:43.312
the sum total of its genes.

00:09:43.336 --> 00:09:46.685
Scientists added a single gene

00:09:46.709 --> 00:09:51.018
that codes for a protein represented
by this orange ball

00:09:51.042 --> 00:09:56.534
that feeds back on itself
to keep cranking out more of that protein.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.813
The extra copies, however,
go and gum up the mosquitoes' genes,

00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:03.115
killing the organism.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.948
To keep it alive in the laboratory
they use a compound called tetracycline.

00:10:08.456 --> 00:10:13.820
Tetracycline shuts off that gene
and allows normal development.

00:10:13.844 --> 00:10:18.177
They added another little wrinkle
so that they could study what happens.

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:24.964
And that is they added a gene
that makes the insect glow under UV light

00:10:25.456 --> 00:10:28.798
so that when they released it
they could follow exactly how far it went

00:10:28.822 --> 00:10:32.576
how long it lived
and all of the kinds of data

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.092
for a good scientific study.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.128
Now this is the pupal stage,
and at this stage

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:41.827
the females are larger than the males.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.288
That allows them to sort them
into the males and the females

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:51.034
and they allow only the males
to grow to adulthood.

00:10:51.058 --> 00:10:53.376
And let me remind you
that males don't bite.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.996
From there it's pretty simple.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.622
They take beakers full of male mosquitoes,

00:10:58.646 --> 00:11:01.226
load them into milk cartons,
and drive around the city,

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.837
releasing them guided by GPS.

00:11:04.678 --> 00:11:07.195
Here's the mayor of a city
releasing the first batch

00:11:07.219 --> 00:11:10.206
of what they call the "friendly Aedes."

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.491
Now I wish I could tell you
this is an American city, but it's not.

00:11:13.515 --> 00:11:15.459
It's Piracicaba, Brazil.

00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:20.784
The amazing thing is that in just a year

00:11:20.808 --> 00:11:25.816
it brought down the cases
of dengue by 91 percent.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.350
That's better than any insecticide
spraying can do.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.746
So why aren't we using this remarkable
biological control in the US?

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:42.696
That's because it's a GMO:
a genetically modified organism.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.354
Notice the subtitle here says
if the FDA would let them

00:11:47.664 --> 00:11:50.366
they could do the same thing here,
when Zika arrives.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.128
And of course it has arrived.

00:11:52.428 --> 00:11:56.136
So now I have to tell you the short form

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.929
of the long, torturous story
of GM regulation in the US

00:12:02.747 --> 00:12:09.326
In the US, there are three agencies that
regulate genetically modified organisms:

00:12:09.985 --> 00:12:12.476
the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.722
the EPA, the Environmental
Protection Agency,

00:12:14.746 --> 00:12:17.619
and the USDA, US Department
of Agriculture.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.133
Took these folks two years
to decide that it would be the FDA

00:12:23.157 --> 00:12:26.060
that would regulate the genetically
modified mosquito.

00:12:26.084 --> 00:12:32.568
And they would do it as a new animal drug,
if that makes any sense.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.661
Took them another five years going back
and forth and back and forth

00:12:36.685 --> 00:12:42.072
to convince the FDA
that this would not harm people,

00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:45.076
and it would not harm the environment.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.427
They finally gave them, this summer,
permission to run a little test

00:12:50.451 --> 00:12:51.990
in the Florida Keys,

00:12:52.014 --> 00:12:58.498
where they had been invited years earlier
when they Keys had an outbreak of dengue.

00:12:59.604 --> 00:13:01.635
Would that it were that easy.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.376
When the local residents heard

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.495
that there would be genetically modified
mosquitoes tested in their community

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:11.344
some of them began to organize protests.

00:13:11.368 --> 00:13:16.407
They even organized a petition on
the internet with this cuddly logo,

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:23.200
which eventually accumulated
some 160,000 signatures

00:13:23.224 --> 00:13:24.906
And they demanded a referendum

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.802
which will be conducted
in just a couple of weeks

00:13:27.826 --> 00:13:30.929
about whether the trials
would be permitted at all.

00:13:32.135 --> 00:13:38.532
Well it's Miami that really needs
these better ways of controlling insects.

00:13:38.556 --> 00:13:40.697
And there the attitudes are changing.

00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:46.736
In fact, very recently a bipartisan group
of more than 60 legislators

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.942
wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell

00:13:49.966 --> 00:13:55.310
asking that she, at the Federal level,
expedite access for Florida

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:57.418
to this new technology.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.607
So the bottom line is this:

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:03.281
biological control of harmful insects

00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:08.495
can be both more effective and
very much more environmentally friendly

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:13.312
than using insecticides,
which are toxic chemicals.

00:14:13.336 --> 00:14:16.776
That was true in Rachel Carson's
time; it's true today.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.514
What's different is that we have
enormously more information

00:14:22.538 --> 00:14:24.435
about genetics than we had then,

00:14:24.459 --> 00:14:28.593
and therefore more ability
to use that information

00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:31.379
to affect these biological controls.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.188
And I hope that what I've done
is aroused your curiosity enough

00:14:37.212 --> 00:14:42.496
to start your own inquiry --
not into just GM mosquitoes

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:48.924
but to the other genetically modified
organisms that are so controversial today.

00:14:49.567 --> 00:14:54.264
I think if you do that, and you dig down
through all of the misinformation,

00:14:54.288 --> 00:14:55.598
and the marketing

00:14:55.622 --> 00:14:59.010
on the part of the organic food industry
and the Greenpeaces

00:14:59.034 --> 00:15:02.184
and find the science,
the accurate science,

00:15:02.208 --> 00:15:04.518
you'll be surprised and pleased.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.090
Thank you.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.114
(Applause)
