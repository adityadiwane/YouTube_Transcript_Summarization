00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
as being one that is grounded in compassion.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The truth of the matter is otherwise.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Our holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the saying of "In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful,"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or, as Sir Richard Burton --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and who was a worldwide traveler

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and translator of many works of literature --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
translates it. "In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
God says to his prophet Muhammad --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that, "We have not sent you, O Muhammad,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
except as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity."

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
For us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
whose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
is to make ourselves as much like the prophet.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And the prophet, in one of his sayings, said,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
"Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
in fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion,"

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
or, "reigned himself in by compassion" --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
activators of compassion, actors of compassion

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
That is all well and good,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but where do we go wrong,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
In every religious tradition, there is the outer path and the inner path,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
or the exoteric path and the esoteric path.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or "tasawwuf" in Arabic.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And these doctors or these masters,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
refer to teachings and examples of our prophet

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that teach us where the source of our problems lies.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
In one of the battles that the prophet waged,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
he told his followers, "We are returning from the lesser war

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to the greater war, to the greater battle."

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And they said, "Messenger of God, we are battle-weary.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
How can we go to a greater battle?"

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
He said, "That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego."

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000
The sources of human problems have to do with egotism, "I."

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and he knocks on the door,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and a voice answers, "Who's there?"

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
"It's me," or, more grammatically correctly, "It is I,"

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
as we might say in English.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The voice says, "Go away."

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
he comes back.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
With much greater humility, he knocks again on the door.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The voice asks, "Who is there?"

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
He said, "It is you, O heartbreaker."

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
The door swings open, and the voice says,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
"Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's,"

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
-- two capital I's, not these eyes -- "for two egos."

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one "I,"

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and that is the "I" of divinity.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
In a teaching -- called a "hadith qudsi" in our tradition --

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
God says that, "My servant," or "My creature, my human creature,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
than what I have asked them to do."

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
You want your employees to do what you ask them to do,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and if they've done that, then they can do extra.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
But don't ignore what you've asked them to do.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
"And," God says, "my servant continues to get nearer to me,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
by doing more of what I've asked them to do" --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
extra credit, we might call it --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
"until I love him or love her.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And when I love my servant," God says,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
"I become the eyes by which he or she sees,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the ears by which he or she listens,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
the hand by which he or she grasps,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and the foot by which he or she walks,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and the heart by which he or she understands."

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It is this merging of our self with divinity

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000
that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
When he says, "I am the spirit, and I am the way,"

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and when the prophet Muhammad said, "Whoever has seen me has seen God,"

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
it is because they became so much an instrument of God,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
they became part of God's team --

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
so that God's will was manifest through them,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Compassion on earth is given, it is in us.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
get our egotism out of the way.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
have had what you might call a spiritual experience,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
a moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
the boundaries of your ego dissolved.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And at that minute, you felt at one with the universe --

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
one with that jug of water, one with every human being,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
one with the Creator --

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and you felt you were in the presence of power, of awe,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
of the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassion and mercy

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that you have ever experienced in your lives.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
That is a moment which is a gift of God to us --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
which makes us insist on "I, I, I, me, me, me,"

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and instead, like the person in Rumi's story,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
we say, "Oh, this is all you.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
This is all you. And this is all us.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And us, and I, and us are all part of you.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
O, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and the end of our journey,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
you are also the breaker of our hearts.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and for whose purpose we shall die,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings."

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Our message today, and our purpose today,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and those of you who are here today,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We know it all.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
We have access to it all.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Jung may have called it "the subconscious."

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Through our subconscious, in your dreams --

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.000
the Koran calls our state of sleep "the lesser death,"

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
"the temporary death" --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
in our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
we travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and we see wonderful things.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and beyond the limitations of time as we know it.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:08.000
But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000
God, Bokh, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
whatever the name might be through which you name

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
or access the presence of divinity,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
it is the locus of absolute being,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
absolute love and mercy and compassion,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and absolute knowledge and wisdom,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
what Hindus call "satchidananda."

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
The language differs,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
but the objective is the same.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Rumi has another story

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
about three men, a Turk, an Arab and --

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
One is asking for angur -- one is, say, an Englishman --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
one is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And they have a fight and an argument because

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
-- "I want grapes." "I want eneb. "I want angur." --

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
not knowing that the word that they're using

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
refers to the same reality in different languages.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
There's only one absolute reality by definition,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
one absolute being by definition,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
because absolute is, by definition, single,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and absolute and singular.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
There's this absolute concentration of being,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
the absolute concentration of consciousness,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:52.000
awareness, an absolute locus of compassion and love

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
that defines the primary attributes of divinity.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And these should also be

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
the primary attributes of what it means to be human.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
For what defines humanity, perhaps biologically,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
is our physiology,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:21.000
but God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And the Koran says, He speaks to the angels and says,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
"When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and breathed into him of my spirit,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
then, fall in prostration to him."

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The angels prostrate, not before the human body,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
but before the human soul.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Why? Because the soul, the human soul,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
embodies a piece of the divine breath,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
a piece of the divine soul.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
when we are taught that we were created in the divine image.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
What is the imagery of God?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
The imagery of God is absolute being,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and absolute compassion and love.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And therefore, for us to be human --

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
in the greatest sense of what it means to be human,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human --

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
means that we too have to be proper stewards

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
of the breath of divinity within us,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
of being alive, of beingness;

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
the attribute of wisdom, of consciousness, of awareness;

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
This is what I understand from my faith tradition,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and this is the common platform on which we must all stand,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and when we stand on this platform as such,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And I believe, personally, that we're on the verge

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and that, with the presence and help of people like you here,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000
we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
For he foretold of a period

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:58.000
when people shall transform their swords into plowshares

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and will not learn war or make war anymore.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option:

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:19.000
we must, we must lower our egos,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
control our egos -- whether it is individual ego, personal ego,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
family ego, national ego --

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
and let all be for the glorification of the one.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Thank you, and God bless you.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
(Applause)
