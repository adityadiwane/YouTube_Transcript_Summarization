00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.260
Good afternoon.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
If you have followed

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
diplomatic news in the past weeks,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
you may have heard of a kind of crisis

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
between China and the U.S.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
regarding cyberattacks

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
against the American company Google.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Many things have been said about this.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Some people have called a cyberwar

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
what may actually be

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
just a spy operation --

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and obviously, a quite mishandled one.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
However, this episode reveals

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
the growing anxiety in the Western world

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
regarding these emerging cyber weapons.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
It so happens that these weapons are dangerous.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
They're of a new nature:

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
they could lead the world

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
into a digital conflict

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
that could turn into an armed struggle.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.260
These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
In 1982, in the middle of the Cold War

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
in Soviet Siberia,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.260
a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Now we know today -- this was revealed

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
by Thomas Reed,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Ronald Reagan's former U.S. Air Force Secretary --

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
this explosion was actually the result

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
of a CIA sabotage operation,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
in which they had managed

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
to infiltrate the IT management systems

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
of that pipeline.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
More recently, the U.S. government revealed

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
that in September 2008, more than 3 million people

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
in the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
were plunged into darkness,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.260
victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Even more worrying for the Americans,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
in December 2008 the holiest of holies,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
the IT systems of CENTCOM,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
the central command

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
managing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
may have been infiltrated by hackers

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
who used these:

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
plain but infected USB keys.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And with these keys, they may have been able

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
to get inside CENTCOM's systems,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
to see and hear everything,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and maybe even infect some of them.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
As a result, the Americans take the threat very seriously.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I'll quote General James Cartwright,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
who says in a report to Congress

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
that cyberattacks could be as powerful as

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
weapons of mass destruction.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Moreover, the Americans have decided

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
to spend over 30 billion dollars

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.760
in the next five years

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.260
to build up their cyberwar capabilities.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And across the world today, we see

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
a sort of cyber arms race,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
with cyberwar units

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
built up by countries like North Korea

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.260
or even Iran.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Yet, what you'll never hear

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
from spokespeople

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
from the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
is that the question isn't really

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
who's the enemy, but actually

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
the very nature of cyber weapons.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
And to understand why, we must look at how,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
through the ages, military technologies

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
have maintained or destroyed

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
world peace.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
For example,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.260
if we'd had TEDxParis

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
350 years ago,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
we would have talked about the military innovation of the day --

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
the massive Vauban-style fortifications --

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and we could have predicted

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
a period of stability in the world or in Europe.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
which was indeed the case in Europe

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
between 1650 and 1750.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Similarly, if we'd had this talk

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
30 or 40 years ago, we would have seen

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
how the rise of nuclear weapons,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
However, if we'd had this talk 60 years ago,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
we would have seen how the emergence

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
of new aircraft and tank technologies,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
which give the advantage to the attacker,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
make the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and thus create the possibility of war in Europe.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
So military technologies

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
can influence the course of the world,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
can make or break world peace --

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and there lies the issue with cyber weapons.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
The first issue:

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Imagine a potential enemy announcing

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
they're building a cyberwar unit,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
but only for their country's defense.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Okay, but what distinguishes it

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
from an offensive unit?

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
It gets even more complicated

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.260
when the doctrines of use become ambiguous.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Just 3 years ago, both the U.S. and France

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.260
were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
strictly to defend their IT systems.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
But today both countries say

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
the best defense is to attack.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
And so, they're joining China,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.260
whose doctrine of use for 15 years has been

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
both defensive and offensive.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
The second issue:

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Your country could be under cyberattack

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
with entire regions plunged into total darkness,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
and you may not even know

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
who's attacking you.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.060
Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature:

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.560
they can be used

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.260
without leaving traces.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
because the defender

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
doesn't know who to fight back against.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
they risk making one more enemy

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and ending up diplomatically isolated.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
This issue isn't just theoretical.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
In May 2007, Estonia was the victim of cyberattacks,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
that damaged its communication

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and banking systems.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Estonia accused Russia.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
But NATO, though it defends Estonia,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
reacted very prudently. Why?

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Because NATO couldn't be 100% sure

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.260
that the Kremlin was indeed behind these attacks.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
So to sum up, on the one hand,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
when a possible enemy announces

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
they're building a cyberwar unit,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
you don't know whether it's for attack

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.260
or defense.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.260
On the other hand,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.260
we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
In a major article published in 1978,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
described a model to understand

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
how conflicts could arise.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
In this context,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
when you don't know if the potential enemy

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
is preparing for defense or attack,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
then this environment is

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.260
most likely to spark a conflict.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
This is the environment that's being created

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
by cyber weapons today,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and historically it was the environment in Europe

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.260
at the onset of World War I.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
So cyber weapons

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
are dangerous by nature,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
but in addition, they're emerging

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
in a much more unstable environment.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
If you remember the Cold War,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
it was a very hard game,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
but a stable one played only by two players,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
which allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Today we're moving to a multipolar world

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.260
in which coordination is much more complicated,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
as we have seen at Copenhagen.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
And this coordination may become even trickier

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
with the introduction of cyber weapons.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
Why? Because no nation

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
knows for sure whether its neighbor

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
is about to attack.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
So nations may live under the threat

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
of what Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
called the "reciprocal fear of surprise attack,"

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
as I don't know if my neighbor

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
is about to attack me or not --

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
I may never know --

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
so I might take the upper hand

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and attack first.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Just last week,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.260
in a New York Times article dated January 26, 2010,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
it was revealed for the first time that

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
officials at the National Security Agency

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.260
were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
in cases where the U.S. was about

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
to be cyberattacked.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And these preemptive attacks

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.260
might not just remain

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
in cyberspace.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.260
In May 2009, General Kevin Chilton,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
commander of the U.S. nuclear forces,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.260
stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the U.S.,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
all options would be on the table.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
Cyber weapons do not replace

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
conventional or nuclear weapons --

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.260
they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
But in doing so, they also add their own risk

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
of triggering a conflict --

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
as we've just seen, a very important risk --

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
and a risk we may have to confront

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
with a collective security solution

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
which includes all of us:

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
European allies, NATO members,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
our American friends and allies,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
our other Western allies,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and maybe, by forcing their hand a little,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
our Russian and Chinese partners.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
The information technologies

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.760
Joël de Rosnay was talking about,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.260
which were historically born from military research,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
are today on the verge of developing

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
an offensive capability of destruction,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.260
which could tomorrow, if we're not careful,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
completely destroy world peace.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
Thank you.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
