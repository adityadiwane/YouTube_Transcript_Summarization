00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I started with paragliding.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
Paragliding is taking off from mountains

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
with a paraglider, with the possibility to

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
fly cross-country, distance,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.330
just with the use of thermals to soar.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
with a paraglider.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
From there I started with skydiving.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
In this picture you can see

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
there is a four-way skydive,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
four people flying together,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
and on the left hand side it's the camera flier

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
with the camera mounted to his helmet

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
so he can film the whole jump,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
for the film itself and also for the judging.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
From regular, relative skydiving

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
I went on to freeflying.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.330
Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
You can see the skydiver with the red suit,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
he's in a stand-up position.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
The one with the yellow-green suit,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
he's flying head-down.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
And that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
in freefall also, with the helmet cam

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
to film this jump.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
You can imagine with this big surface

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
of a skysurfing board,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
there is a lot of force, a lot of power.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
Of course I can use this power

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.330
for example for nice spinning -- we call it "helicopter moves."

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.330
From there I went on to wingsuit flying.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.330
Wingsuit flying is a suit,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
that I can make fly, just only with my body.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.330
If I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
I can make it fly. And as you see

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
the fall rate is much much slower

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
because of the bigger surface.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.330
With a proper body position I'm able to really move forward

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
to gain quite some distance.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.330
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.330
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
From there with all the skills and knowledge

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
from paragliding and all the different disciplines

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
in skydiving, I went on to BASE jumping.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.330
like buildings, antennae, bridges and earth --

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
meaning mountains, cliffs.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
It's for sure -- for me -- it's the ultimate feeling

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.330
of being in free fall,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
with all the visual references.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
So my goal soon was to discover new places

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
that nobody had jumped before.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
So in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jump

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
the Eiger North Face in Switzerland.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
Two years after this, I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.330
a very famous mountain that probably

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
everybody knows in here.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.330
2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
three very famous mountains in Switzerland.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
The special thing on these three jumps were,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.330
I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.330
In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
(Laughter)

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.330
So with all this knowledge, I also

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330
wanted to get into stunts.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
So with some friends we started to do different tricks,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
like for example this jump here,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
I jumped from a paraglider.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.330
Or here -- everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
because it was very cold in Austria

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
where we did this filming.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
Everybody sitting in a basket,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
and I was on top of the balloon,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:17.330
ready to slide down with my skysurf board.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.330
Or this jump, from a moving truck on the highway.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.330
(Laughter)

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
Extreme sports on top level like this

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.330
is only possible if you practice step by step,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
if you really work hard on your skills

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
and on your knowledge.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.330
Of course you need to be in physical, very good, condition,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
so I'm training a lot.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.330
You need to have the best possible equipment.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.330
And probably the most important is

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
you have to work on your mental skills, mental preparation.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.330
And all this to come as close as possible

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.330
to the human dream of being able to fly.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
So for 2009,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.330
I'm training hard for my two new projects.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.330
The first one, I want to set a world record

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.330
in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
And I want to set a new record,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
with the longest distance ever flown.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
For my second project,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
I have a sensational idea

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.330
of a jump that never has been done before.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.330
So now, on the following movie you will see

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
that I'm much better in flying a wingsuit

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
than speaking in English.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
Enjoy, and thank you very much.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
(Applause)

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:51.330
(Applause)

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
June Cohen: I have some questions.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
I think we all might have some questions.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
Question one: so does that actually feel

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
the way the flying dream does?

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
Because it looks like it might.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.330
Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.330
possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
JC: I know the answer to this, but how do you land?

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
UE: Parachute. We have to open a parachute

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:20.330
just seconds before, I would say, impact.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
(Laughter)

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.330
It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
JC: Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those --

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it?

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
UE: It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
We're still working on it and we're

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.330
developing the wingsuits to get better performance,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
to get more knowledge.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
And I believe soon.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
JC: All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
What is the -- there was exhaust coming

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.330
out of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing?

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
UE: Nope. It's just smoke.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.330
JC: Coming off of you?

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.330
(Laughter)

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
UE: Hopefully not.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.330
(Laughter)

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.330
JC: That seems dangerous.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.330
UE: No, smoke is for two reasons,

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.330
you can see the speed, you can see the way

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
where I was flying.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
That's reason number one. And reason number two:

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.330
it's much easier for the camera guy to film

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
If I'm using smoke.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
JC: Ah, I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
so that you can be tracked. One more question.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
What do you do to to cover your face?

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
Because I just keep thinking of going that fast

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
and having your whole face smushed backwards.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.330
Are you in a helmet? Are you in goggles?

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
UE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
JC: And is that how you usually fly?

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
UE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
because of landings -- usually it's difficult --

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.330
it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
So you have to be prepared.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
JC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do?

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
Do people come to you with projects and say, "We want you to do this!"

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
and do you ever say, "No, no I'm not going to."

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
UE: Oh of course, of course. Some people have crazy ideas and --

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.330
(Laughter)

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
JC: ...a round of applause...

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
(Applause)

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
UE: Thank you very much.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:07.330
(Applause)
