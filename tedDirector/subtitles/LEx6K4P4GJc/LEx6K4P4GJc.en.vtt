00:00:13.157 --> 00:00:14.421
Food crisis.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:16.023
It's in the news every day.

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:17.369
But what is it?

00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:20.292
Some places in the world
it's too little food,

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:21.506
maybe too much.

00:00:21.963 --> 00:00:24.292
Other places, GMO is saving the world.

00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:26.609
Maybe GMO is the problem?

00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:30.817
Too much agricultural runoff
creating bad oceans, toxic oceans,

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.478
attenuation of nutrition.

00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:34.502
They go on and on.

00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:38.144
And I find the current climate
of this discussion

00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:40.467
incredibly disempowering.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.551
So how do we bring that
to something that we understand?

00:00:45.508 --> 00:00:47.738
How is this apple food crisis?

00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:50.809
You've all eaten an apple
in the last week, I'm sure.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.221
How old do you think it was
from when it was picked?

00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:56.448
Two weeks?

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:57.626
Two months?

00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:00.040
Eleven months --

00:01:00.064 --> 00:01:03.419
the average age of an apple
in a grocery store in the United States.

00:01:03.443 --> 00:01:05.942
And I don't expect it
to be much different in Europe

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.446
or anywhere else in the world.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.634
We pick them,

00:01:08.658 --> 00:01:10.735
we put them in cold storage,

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.027
we gas the cold storage --

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:13.948
there's actually documented proof

00:01:13.972 --> 00:01:16.215
of workers trying to go
into these environments

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:17.833
to retrieve an apple,

00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:19.025
and dying,

00:01:19.606 --> 00:01:20.761
because the atmosphere

00:01:20.785 --> 00:01:24.750
that they slow down the process
of the apple with is also toxic to humans.

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:27.051
How is it that none of you knew this?

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:28.579
Why didn't I know this?

00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:31.294
Ninety percent of the quality
of that apple --

00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:34.278
all of the antioxidants -- are gone
by the time we get it.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.902
It's basically a little ball of sugar.

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:40.908
How did we get so information poor

00:01:40.932 --> 00:01:42.390
and how can we do better?

00:01:43.347 --> 00:01:46.203
I think what's missing is a platform.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.439
I know platforms -- I know computers,

00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:50.582
they put me on the Internet
when I was young.

00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:51.852
I did very weird things --

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:52.877
(Laughter)

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:54.052
on this platform.

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:56.169
But I met people,
and I could express myself.

00:01:56.193 --> 00:01:58.207
How do you express yourself in food?

00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:00.096
If we had a platform,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.267
we might feel empowered
to question: What if?

00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:05.156
For me, I questioned:

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.926
What if climate was democratic?

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.837
So, this is a map of climate in the world.

00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:15.201
The most productive areas in green,
the least productive in red.

00:02:15.606 --> 00:02:16.914
They shift and they change,

00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:19.609
and Californian farmers
now become Mexican farmers.

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:22.831
China picks up land in Brazil
to grow better food,

00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:24.881
and we're a slave to climate.

00:02:26.056 --> 00:02:29.113
What if each country had
its own productive climate?

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:31.732
What would that change about how we live?

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:35.217
What would that change
about quality of life and nutrition?

00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:39.552
The last generation's problem
was, we need more food

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:40.757
and we need it cheap.

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:43.314
Welcome to your global farm.

00:02:43.338 --> 00:02:45.798
We built a huge analog farm.

00:02:45.822 --> 00:02:47.252
All these traces --

00:02:47.276 --> 00:02:50.176
these are cars, planes,
trains and automobiles.

00:02:50.597 --> 00:02:53.782
It's a miracle that we feed
seven billion people

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:56.851
with just a few of us involved
in the production of food.

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.877
What if ...

00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:01.434
we built a digital farm?

00:03:01.458 --> 00:03:02.621
A digital world farm.

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:05.454
What if you could take this apple,

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:07.762
digitize it somehow,

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:10.254
send it through particles in the air

00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:12.688
and reconstitute it on the other side?

00:03:13.337 --> 00:03:14.497
What if?

00:03:15.338 --> 00:03:17.013
Going through some of these quotes,

00:03:17.037 --> 00:03:19.079
you know, they inspire me to do what I do.

00:03:19.103 --> 00:03:20.258
First one:

00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:24.392
["Japanese farming has no youth,
no water, no land and no future."]

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:28.505
That's what I landed to the day
that I went to Minamisanriku,

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.102
one stop south of Fukushima,

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.828
after the disaster.

00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:34.403
The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo,

00:03:34.427 --> 00:03:35.802
the land is contaminated,

00:03:35.826 --> 00:03:38.147
they already import 70 percent
of their own food.

00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:40.311
But it's not unique to Japan.

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:44.146
Two percent of the American population
is involved in farming.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:48.633
What good answer comes
from two percent of any population?

00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:51.310
As we go around the world,

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:54.945
50 percent of the African
population is under 18.

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:58.721
Eighty percent don't want to be farmers.

00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:00.199
Farming is hard.

00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:04.482
The life of a small-shareholder
farmer is miserable.

00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:06.673
They go into the city.

00:04:06.697 --> 00:04:07.857
In India:

00:04:08.523 --> 00:04:11.713
farmers' families not being able
to have basic access to utilities,

00:04:11.737 --> 00:04:15.536
more farmer suicides this year
and the previous 10 before that.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.195
It's uncomfortable to talk about.

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:18.387
Where are they going?

00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:19.619
Into the city.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.887
No young people, and everyone's headed in.

00:04:22.911 --> 00:04:26.882
So how do we build this platform
that inspires the youth?

00:04:27.687 --> 00:04:29.319
Welcome to the new tractor.

00:04:29.754 --> 00:04:31.581
This is my combine.

00:04:32.224 --> 00:04:33.523
A number of years ago now,

00:04:33.547 --> 00:04:35.709
I went to Bed Bath and Beyond
and Home Depot

00:04:35.733 --> 00:04:36.884
and I started hacking.

00:04:36.908 --> 00:04:38.123
And I built silly things

00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:39.298
and I made plants dance

00:04:39.322 --> 00:04:41.173
and I attached them to my computer

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:42.487
and I killed them all --

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:44.139
a lot.

00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:45.163
(Laughter)

00:04:45.773 --> 00:04:47.383
I eventually got them to survive.

00:04:47.407 --> 00:04:49.873
And I created one of the most
intimate relationships

00:04:49.897 --> 00:04:51.112
I've ever had in my life,

00:04:51.136 --> 00:04:54.241
because I was learning
the language of plants.

00:04:55.008 --> 00:04:56.326
I wanted to make it bigger.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.113
They said, "Knock yourself out, kid!

00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:01.038
Here's an old electronics room
that nobody wants.

00:05:01.062 --> 00:05:02.364
What can you do?"

00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:05.658
With my team, we built a farm
inside of the media lab,

00:05:05.682 --> 00:05:09.616
a place historically known
not for anything about biology

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.189
but everything about digital life.

00:05:12.213 --> 00:05:14.855
Inside of these 60 square feet,

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.005
we produced enough food to feed
about 300 people once a month --

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:19.181
not a lot of food.

00:05:19.205 --> 00:05:21.720
And there's a lot of interesting
technology in there.

00:05:21.744 --> 00:05:23.399
But the most interesting thing?

00:05:24.226 --> 00:05:25.931
Beautiful, white roots,

00:05:26.478 --> 00:05:28.899
deep, green colors

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.161
and a monthly harvest.

00:05:31.668 --> 00:05:34.229
Is this a new cafeteria?

00:05:34.787 --> 00:05:38.108
Is this a new retail experience?

00:05:38.132 --> 00:05:39.706
Is this a new grocery store?

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.611
I can tell you one thing for sure:

00:05:42.127 --> 00:05:43.277
this is the first time

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:46.182
anybody in the media lab
ripped the roots off of anything.

00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:48.030
(Laughter)

00:05:48.528 --> 00:05:50.233
We get our salad in bags;

00:05:50.257 --> 00:05:51.993
there's nothing wrong with that.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.921
But what happens

00:05:53.945 --> 00:05:57.056
when you have an image-based
processing expert,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.495
a data scientist,

00:05:58.996 --> 00:06:00.392
a roboticist,

00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:02.459
ripping roots off and thinking,

00:06:02.483 --> 00:06:04.363
"Huh. I know something about --

00:06:04.387 --> 00:06:06.580
I could make this happen, I want to try."

00:06:07.364 --> 00:06:09.639
In that process we would
bring the plants out

00:06:09.663 --> 00:06:11.572
and we would take some back to the lab,

00:06:11.596 --> 00:06:13.852
because if you grew it,
you don't throw it away;

00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:15.273
it's kind of precious to you.

00:06:15.297 --> 00:06:16.694
I have this weird tongue now,

00:06:16.718 --> 00:06:20.162
because I'm afraid to let anybody eat
anything until I've eaten it first,

00:06:20.186 --> 00:06:21.575
because I want it to be good.

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:22.845
So I eat lettuce every day

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:25.326
and I can tell the pH
of a lettuce within .1.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.355
(Laughter)

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:29.550
I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no,
no, you can't eat it today."

00:06:29.574 --> 00:06:32.719
(Applause)

00:06:34.042 --> 00:06:36.630
This lettuce that day was hyper sweet.

00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:39.910
It was hyper sweet
because the plant had been stressed

00:06:39.934 --> 00:06:43.063
and it created a chemical reaction
in the plant to protect itself:

00:06:43.087 --> 00:06:44.251
"I'm not going to die!"

00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:47.404
And the plants not-going-to-die,
taste sweet to me.

00:06:48.683 --> 00:06:51.545
Technologists falling backwards
into plant physiology.

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:54.274
So we thought other people
needed to be able to try this.

00:06:54.298 --> 00:06:56.155
We want to see what people can create,

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:58.868
so we conceived of a lab
that could be shipped anywhere.

00:06:59.359 --> 00:07:00.591
And then we built it.

00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:04.718
So on the facade
of the media lab is my lab,

00:07:04.742 --> 00:07:07.435
that has about 30 points
of sensing per plant.

00:07:08.035 --> 00:07:11.204
If you know about the genome or genetics,

00:07:11.228 --> 00:07:13.731
this is the phenome, right?

00:07:13.755 --> 00:07:14.997
The phenomena.

00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:17.501
When you say, "I like
the strawberries from Mexico,"

00:07:17.525 --> 00:07:19.914
you really like the strawberries
from the climate

00:07:19.938 --> 00:07:22.026
that produced the expression
that you like.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.239
So if you're coding climate --

00:07:24.263 --> 00:07:27.564
this much CO2, this much O2 creates
a recipe -- you're coding

00:07:27.588 --> 00:07:30.863
the expression of that plant,
the nutrition of that plant,

00:07:30.887 --> 00:07:34.145
the size of that plant, the shape,
the color, the texture.

00:07:35.683 --> 00:07:36.868
We need data,

00:07:36.892 --> 00:07:38.673
so we put a bunch of sensors in there

00:07:38.697 --> 00:07:40.000
to tell us what's going on.

00:07:40.024 --> 00:07:41.606
If you think of your houseplants,

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.125
and you look at your houseplant

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:45.161
and you're super sad, because you're like,

00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:47.201
"Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?"

00:07:47.225 --> 00:07:48.225
(Laughter)

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:51.481
Farmers develop the most beautiful
fortune-telling eyes

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:53.676
by the time they're in their
late 60s and 70s.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.893
They can tell you when you
see that plant dying

00:07:55.917 --> 00:07:58.456
that it's a nitrogen deficiency,
a calcium deficiency

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.884
or it needs more humidity.

00:07:59.908 --> 00:08:02.223
Those beautiful eyes
are not being passed down.

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:05.517
These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.295
We trend those data points over time.

00:08:08.805 --> 00:08:11.280
We correlate those data points
to individual plants.

00:08:11.304 --> 00:08:15.354
These are all the broccoli
in my lab that day, by IP address.

00:08:15.378 --> 00:08:16.516
(Laughter)

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.261
We have IP-addressable broccoli.

00:08:20.176 --> 00:08:24.690
(Applause)

00:08:24.714 --> 00:08:27.389
So if that's not weird enough,

00:08:27.413 --> 00:08:29.902
you can click one
and you get a plant profile.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.942
And what this tells you
is downloadable progress on that plant,

00:08:32.966 --> 00:08:34.172
but not like you'd think,

00:08:34.196 --> 00:08:35.641
it's not just when it's ready.

00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:37.941
When does it achieve
the nutrition that I need?

00:08:37.965 --> 00:08:40.745
When does it achieve
the taste that I desire?

00:08:41.284 --> 00:08:42.960
Is it getting too much water?

00:08:42.984 --> 00:08:44.896
Is it getting too much sun?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.084
Alerts.

00:08:46.108 --> 00:08:47.942
It can talk to me, it's conversant,

00:08:47.966 --> 00:08:49.330
we have a language.

00:08:50.043 --> 00:08:51.831
(Laughter)

00:08:51.855 --> 00:08:56.491
(Applause)

00:08:56.515 --> 00:09:01.294
I think of that as the first user
on the plant Facebook, right?

00:09:01.318 --> 00:09:02.524
That's a plant profile

00:09:02.548 --> 00:09:04.541
and that plant will start making friends.

00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:05.572
(Laughter)

00:09:05.596 --> 00:09:08.215
And I mean it -- it will make
friends with other plants

00:09:08.239 --> 00:09:10.366
that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus,

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.588
less potassium.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.891
We're going to learn about a complexity

00:09:13.915 --> 00:09:15.532
that we can only guess at now.

00:09:16.048 --> 00:09:19.628
And they may not friend us back --
I don't know, they might friend us back,

00:09:19.652 --> 00:09:20.851
it depends on how we act.

00:09:20.875 --> 00:09:22.833
So this is my lab now.

00:09:23.294 --> 00:09:25.032
It's a little bit more systematized,

00:09:25.056 --> 00:09:28.287
my background is designing data centers
in hospitals of all things,

00:09:28.311 --> 00:09:31.279
so I know a little bit about creating
a controlled environment.

00:09:31.303 --> 00:09:32.453
And so --

00:09:32.754 --> 00:09:34.397
inside of this environment,

00:09:34.421 --> 00:09:36.794
we're experimenting
with all kinds of things.

00:09:36.818 --> 00:09:41.026
This process, aeroponics, was developed
by NASA for Mir Space Station

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.598
for reducing the amount of water
they send into space.

00:09:43.622 --> 00:09:46.481
What it really does is give the plant
exactly what it wants:

00:09:46.505 --> 00:09:48.140
water, minerals and oxygen.

00:09:48.164 --> 00:09:49.656
Roots are not that complicated,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.592
so when you give them that,
you get this amazing expression.

00:09:54.472 --> 00:09:57.545
It's like the plant has two hearts.

00:09:57.569 --> 00:09:59.234
And because it has two hearts,

00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.027
it grows four or five times faster.

00:10:02.657 --> 00:10:03.811
It's a perfect world.

00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:07.048
We've gone a long way into technology
and seed for an adverse world

00:10:07.072 --> 00:10:08.937
and we're going to continue to do that,

00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:10.874
but we're going to have a new tool, too,

00:10:10.898 --> 00:10:12.581
which is perfect world.

00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:14.284
So we've grown all kinds of things.

00:10:14.308 --> 00:10:18.116
These tomatoes hadn't been
in commercial production for 150 years.

00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:21.789
Do you know that we have
rare and ancient seed banks?

00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:24.054
Banks of seed.

00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:25.235
It's amazing.

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:28.141
They have germplasm alive
and things that you've never eaten.

00:10:28.165 --> 00:10:31.446
I am the only person in this room
that's eaten that kind of tomato.

00:10:31.837 --> 00:10:34.838
Problem is it was a sauce tomato
and we don't know how to cook,

00:10:34.862 --> 00:10:37.218
so we ate a sauce tomato,
which is not that great.

00:10:37.242 --> 00:10:40.558
But we've done things with protein --
we've grown all kinds of things.

00:10:40.582 --> 00:10:41.755
We've grown humans --

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:43.421
(Laughter)

00:10:44.103 --> 00:10:45.835
Well maybe you could, but we didn't.

00:10:45.859 --> 00:10:47.455
But what we realized is,

00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:49.554
the tool was too big,
it was too expensive.

00:10:49.578 --> 00:10:51.582
I was starting to put them
around the world

00:10:51.606 --> 00:10:53.423
and they were about 100,000 dollars.

00:10:53.447 --> 00:10:56.456
Finding somebody with 100 grand
in their back pocket isn't easy,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.060
so we wanted to make a small one.

00:10:58.084 --> 00:11:00.381
This project was actually
one of my student's --

00:11:00.405 --> 00:11:03.261
mechanical engineering
undergraduate, Camille.

00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:05.383
So Camille and I and my team,

00:11:05.407 --> 00:11:07.265
we iterated all summer,

00:11:07.289 --> 00:11:09.709
how to make it cheaper,
how to make it work better,

00:11:09.733 --> 00:11:11.757
how to make it so other
people can make it.

00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:15.084
Then we dropped them off in schools,
seventh through eleventh grade.

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:18.107
And if you want to be humbled,
try to teach a kid something.

00:11:18.131 --> 00:11:19.980
So I went into this school and I said,

00:11:20.004 --> 00:11:21.897
"Set it to 65 percent humidity."

00:11:21.921 --> 00:11:24.187
The seventh grader
said, "What's humidity?"

00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:26.076
And I said, "Oh, it's water in air."

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.544
He said, "There's no water
in air, you're an idiot."

00:11:28.568 --> 00:11:29.587
(Laughter)

00:11:29.611 --> 00:11:31.620
And I was like, "Alright, don't trust me.

00:11:31.644 --> 00:11:33.303
Actually -- don't trust me, right?

00:11:33.327 --> 00:11:34.478
Set it to 100.

00:11:34.502 --> 00:11:36.207
He sets it to 100 and what happens?

00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:39.005
It starts to condense, make a fog
and eventually drip.

00:11:39.457 --> 00:11:42.681
And he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain.

00:11:43.372 --> 00:11:45.002
Why didn't you just tell me that?"

00:11:45.026 --> 00:11:46.996
(Laughter)

00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:50.332
We've created an interface
for this that's much like a game.

00:11:50.356 --> 00:11:51.672
They have a 3D environment,

00:11:51.696 --> 00:11:53.712
they can log into it anywhere in the world

00:11:53.736 --> 00:11:55.519
on their smartphone, on their tablet.

00:11:55.543 --> 00:11:58.970
They have different parts of the bots --
the physical, the sensors.

00:11:58.994 --> 00:12:01.634
They select recipes that have
been created by other kids

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:02.808
anywhere in the world.

00:12:02.832 --> 00:12:05.863
They select and activate that recipe,
they plant a seedling.

00:12:06.324 --> 00:12:08.161
While it's growing, they make changes.

00:12:08.185 --> 00:12:11.194
They're like, "Why does a plant
need CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad?

00:12:11.218 --> 00:12:12.369
It kills people."

00:12:12.393 --> 00:12:13.764
Crank up CO2, plant dies.

00:12:14.404 --> 00:12:17.401
Or crank down CO2, plant does very well.

00:12:17.425 --> 00:12:18.615
Harvest plant,

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.297
and you've created a new digital recipe.

00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:23.911
It's an iterative design and development

00:12:23.935 --> 00:12:25.847
and exploration process.

00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.283
They can download, then,

00:12:27.307 --> 00:12:30.024
all of the data about that new plant
that they developed

00:12:30.048 --> 00:12:32.334
or the new digital recipe
and what did it do --

00:12:32.358 --> 00:12:33.802
was it better or was it worse?

00:12:33.826 --> 00:12:35.952
Imagine these as little cores
of processing.

00:12:36.771 --> 00:12:38.738
We're going to learn so much.

00:12:39.764 --> 00:12:42.462
Here's one of the food computers,
as we call them,

00:12:42.486 --> 00:12:44.738
in a school in three weeks' time.

00:12:45.793 --> 00:12:47.232
This is three weeks of growth.

00:12:47.256 --> 00:12:49.100
But more importantly,

00:12:49.124 --> 00:12:53.084
it was the first time that this kid
ever thought he could be a farmer --

00:12:53.658 --> 00:12:55.774
or that he would want to be a farmer.

00:12:56.187 --> 00:12:58.202
So, we've open-sourced all of this.

00:12:58.226 --> 00:13:01.312
It's all online; go home, try to build
your first food computer.

00:13:01.336 --> 00:13:03.725
It's going to be difficult --
I'm just telling you.

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:05.813
We're in the beginning,
but it's all there.

00:13:05.837 --> 00:13:08.536
It's very important to me
that this is easily accessible.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.407
We're going to keep making it more so.

00:13:10.946 --> 00:13:12.374
These are farmers,

00:13:13.016 --> 00:13:14.993
electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,

00:13:15.017 --> 00:13:17.050
environmental engineer,
computer scientist,

00:13:17.074 --> 00:13:19.668
plant scientist,
economist, urban planners.

00:13:20.214 --> 00:13:22.968
On one platform, doing
what they're good at.

00:13:22.992 --> 00:13:24.816
But we got a little too big.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.672
This is my new facility
that I'm just starting.

00:13:27.696 --> 00:13:29.536
This warehouse could be anywhere.

00:13:30.088 --> 00:13:31.353
That's why I chose it.

00:13:31.718 --> 00:13:33.341
And inside of this warehouse

00:13:33.365 --> 00:13:35.734
we're going to build something
kind of like this.

00:13:35.758 --> 00:13:37.220
These exist right now.

00:13:37.244 --> 00:13:38.471
Take a look at it.

00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:41.384
These exist, too.

00:13:42.034 --> 00:13:43.314
One grows greens,

00:13:43.338 --> 00:13:44.919
one grows Ebola vaccine.

00:13:46.212 --> 00:13:50.126
Pretty amazing that plants
and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.646
is one of the reasons
we're getting ahead of Ebola.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:56.654
The plants are producing
the protein that's Ebola resistant.

00:13:57.083 --> 00:13:59.621
So pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals,

00:13:59.645 --> 00:14:01.161
all they way down to lettuce.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.558
But these two things look nothing alike,

00:14:03.582 --> 00:14:05.859
and that's where I am with my field.

00:14:05.883 --> 00:14:07.272
Everything is different.

00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:10.939
We're in that weird "We're alright" stage

00:14:10.963 --> 00:14:12.826
and it's like, "Here's my black box --"

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.001
"No, buy mine."

00:14:14.025 --> 00:14:17.386
"No, no, no -- I've got intellectual
property that's totally valuable.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.610
Don't buy his, buy mine."

00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:20.919
And the reality is,
we're just at the beginning,

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:23.086
in a time when society is shifting, too.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.825
When we ask for more, cheaper food,

00:14:24.849 --> 00:14:28.189
we're now asking for better,
environmentally friendly food.

00:14:28.654 --> 00:14:33.967
And when you have McDonald's advertising
what's in the Chicken McNugget,

00:14:33.991 --> 00:14:36.086
the most mysterious
food item of all time --

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.847
they are now basing
their marketing plan on that --

00:14:38.871 --> 00:14:40.341
everything is changing.

00:14:40.365 --> 00:14:41.887
So into the world now.

00:14:41.911 --> 00:14:43.569
Personal food computers,

00:14:44.764 --> 00:14:45.914
food servers

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:48.672
and food data centers

00:14:50.434 --> 00:14:52.853
run on the open phenome.

00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:56.474
Think open genome, but we're going
to put little climate recipes,

00:14:56.498 --> 00:14:57.659
like Wikipedia,

00:14:57.683 --> 00:15:01.164
that you can pull down, actuate and grow.

00:15:03.275 --> 00:15:05.005
What does this look like in a world?

00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:07.164
You remember the world
connected by strings?

00:15:07.188 --> 00:15:08.735
We start having beacons.

00:15:09.338 --> 00:15:11.424
We start sending information about food,

00:15:11.448 --> 00:15:12.767
rather than sending food.

00:15:13.249 --> 00:15:14.967
This is not just my fantasy,

00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:17.029
this is where we're already deploying.

00:15:17.578 --> 00:15:19.267
Food computers, food servers,

00:15:19.291 --> 00:15:20.727
soon-to-be food data centers,

00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:23.165
connecting people together
to share information.

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:30.080
The future of food is not about fighting
over what's wrong with this.

00:15:30.556 --> 00:15:32.382
We know what's wrong with this.

00:15:33.128 --> 00:15:37.643
The future of food is about networking
the next one billion farmers

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:39.941
and empowering them with a platform

00:15:39.965 --> 00:15:41.985
to ask and answer the question,

00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:44.028
"What if?"

00:15:44.052 --> 00:15:45.223
Thank you.

00:15:45.247 --> 00:15:54.080
(Applause)
