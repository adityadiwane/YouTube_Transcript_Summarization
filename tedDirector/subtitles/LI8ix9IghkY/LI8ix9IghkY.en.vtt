00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.319
I'm a very lucky person.

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:23.797
I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:26.125
and the people and creatures that live on it.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.745
And my passion was inspired at the age of seven,

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:32.080
when my parents first took me to Morocco,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.206
at the edge of the Sahara Desert.

00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:36.581
Now imagine a little Brit

00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:39.702
somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home.

00:00:39.702 --> 00:00:41.978
What an amazing experience.

00:00:41.978 --> 00:00:44.471
And it made me want to explore more.

00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:47.074
So as a filmmaker,

00:00:47.074 --> 00:00:49.885
I've been from one end of the Earth to the other

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:52.593
trying to get the perfect shot

00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:56.385
and to capture animal behavior never seen before.

00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:59.017
And what's more, I'm really lucky,

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:02.135
because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide.

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:07.385
Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:11.218
and actually being able to get that message out

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:14.076
gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step.

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:17.218
You might think that it's quite hard

00:01:17.218 --> 00:01:19.468
to find new stories and new subjects,

00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:23.799
but new technology is changing the way we can film.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.635
It's enabling us to get fresh, new images

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:29.752
and tell brand new stories.

00:01:29.752 --> 00:01:32.635
In Nature's Great Events,

00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:36.177
a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough,

00:01:36.177 --> 00:01:38.427
we wanted to do just that.

00:01:38.427 --> 00:01:41.468
Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:44.718
You see them all the time, you think.

00:01:44.718 --> 00:01:48.802
But there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:50.510
and had never been filmed.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.760
So what we did, we went to Alaska,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.128
which is where the grizzlies rely

00:01:57.128 --> 00:02:00.114
on really high, almost inaccessible, mountain slopes

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:02.049
for their denning.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.397
And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air.

00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:14.177
(Video) David Attenborough: Throughout Alaska and British Columbia,

00:02:14.177 --> 00:02:19.389
thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.343
There is nothing to eat up here,

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:26.843
but the conditions were ideal for hibernation.

00:02:26.843 --> 00:02:32.274
Lots of snow in which to dig a den.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.700
To find food, mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.552
where the snow will already be melting.

00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:54.910
But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs.

00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:24.718
These mountains are dangerous places,

00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:28.177
but ultimately the fate of these bear families,

00:03:28.177 --> 00:03:31.691
and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific,

00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:36.308
depends on the salmon.

00:03:36.324 --> 00:03:38.885
KB: I love that shot.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.177
I always get goosebumps every time I see it.

00:03:41.177 --> 00:03:43.218
That was filmed from a helicopter

00:03:43.218 --> 00:03:46.010
using a gyro-stabilized camera.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.468
And it's a wonderful bit of gear,

00:03:48.468 --> 00:03:52.427
because it's like having a flying tripod, crane and dolly all rolled into one.

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:55.635
But technology alone isn't enough.

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:58.135
To really get the money shots,

00:03:58.135 --> 00:04:01.177
it's down to being in the right place at the right time.

00:04:01.177 --> 00:04:04.135
And that sequence was especially difficult.

00:04:04.135 --> 00:04:07.635
The first year we got nothing.

00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:11.218
We had to go back the following year,

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:14.218
all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska.

00:04:14.218 --> 00:04:16.843
And we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks.

00:04:16.843 --> 00:04:19.885
And eventually we got lucky.

00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:24.218
The cloud lifted, the wind was still,

00:04:24.218 --> 00:04:25.968
and even the bear showed up.

00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:28.552
And we managed to get that magic moment.

00:04:28.552 --> 00:04:30.427
For a filmmaker,

00:04:30.427 --> 00:04:34.600
new technology is an amazing tool,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.806
but the other thing that really, really excites me

00:04:37.806 --> 00:04:40.760
is when new species are discovered.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.047
Now, when I heard about one animal,

00:04:43.047 --> 00:04:46.010
I knew we had to get it for my next series,

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.760
Untamed Americas, for National Geographic.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.071
In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered

00:04:55.071 --> 00:04:57.343
in the cloud forests of Ecuador.

00:04:57.343 --> 00:04:59.427
And what was amazing about that discovery

00:04:59.427 --> 00:05:01.843
is that it also solved the mystery

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.880
of what pollinated a unique flower.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.843
It depends solely on the bat.

00:05:06.843 --> 00:05:09.577
Now, the series hasn't even aired yet,

00:05:09.577 --> 00:05:12.004
so you're the very first to see this.

00:05:12.004 --> 00:05:13.119
See what you think.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.808
(Video) Narrator: The tube-lipped nectar bat.

00:05:25.796 --> 00:05:28.137
A pool of delicious nectar

00:05:28.137 --> 00:05:30.302
lies at the bottom of each flower's long flute.

00:05:30.302 --> 00:05:35.147
But how to reach it?

00:05:35.147 --> 00:05:40.343
Necessity is the mother of evolution.

00:05:40.343 --> 00:06:03.749
(Music)

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:06.756
This two-and-a-half-inch bat

00:06:06.756 --> 00:06:13.481
has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue,

00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:17.379
the longest relative to body length

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.698
of any mammal in the world.

00:06:19.698 --> 00:06:26.837
If human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue.

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:33.872
(Applause)

00:06:33.872 --> 00:06:35.937
KB: What a tongue.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:40.802
We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower

00:06:40.802 --> 00:06:45.427
and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times.

00:06:45.427 --> 00:06:48.510
So imagine how quick that thing is in real life.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.722
Now people often ask me, "Where's your favorite place on the planet?"

00:06:53.722 --> 00:06:56.255
And the truth is I just don't have one.

00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:58.802
There are so many wonderful places.

00:06:58.802 --> 00:07:02.302
But some locations draw you back time and time again.

00:07:02.302 --> 00:07:05.050
And one remote location --

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.070
I first went there as a backpacker;

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.385
I've been back several times for filming,

00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:11.135
most recently for Untamed Americas --

00:07:11.135 --> 00:07:15.885
it's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America,

00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:21.052
and it's the most otherworldly place I know.

00:07:21.052 --> 00:07:24.154
But at 15,000 feet, it's tough.

00:07:24.154 --> 00:07:25.677
It's freezing cold,

00:07:25.677 --> 00:07:30.343
and that thin air really gets you.

00:07:30.343 --> 00:07:32.654
Sometimes it's hard to breathe,

00:07:32.654 --> 00:07:35.697
especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment.

00:07:35.697 --> 00:07:40.302
And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover.

00:07:40.302 --> 00:07:44.593
But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere

00:07:44.593 --> 00:07:48.531
is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens

00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:50.970
with amazing clarity.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.156
Have a look.

00:07:55.156 --> 00:07:58.812
(Video) Narrator: Some 1,500 miles south of the tropics,

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.497
between Chile and Bolivia,

00:08:00.497 --> 00:08:05.673
the Andes completely change.

00:08:05.673 --> 00:08:10.302
It's called the Altiplano, or "high plains" --

00:08:10.302 --> 00:08:14.185
a place of extremes

00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:17.874
and extreme contrasts.

00:08:17.874 --> 00:08:22.385
Where deserts freeze

00:08:22.385 --> 00:08:26.218
and waters boil.

00:08:26.218 --> 00:08:29.718
More like Mars than Earth,

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:32.141
it seems just as hostile to life.

00:08:40.456 --> 00:08:44.125
The stars themselves --

00:08:50.325 --> 00:08:54.046
at 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air

00:08:54.046 --> 00:09:02.189
makes for perfect stargazing.

00:09:02.189 --> 00:09:08.073
Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby.

00:09:08.073 --> 00:09:12.145
But just looking up with the naked eye,

00:09:12.145 --> 00:09:15.390
you really don't need one.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:10:02.400
(Music)

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:08.427
(Applause)

00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:11.744
KB: Thank you so much

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:14.218
for letting me share some images

00:10:14.218 --> 00:10:17.127
of our magnificent, wonderful Earth.

00:10:17.127 --> 00:10:19.024
Thank you for letting me share that with you.

00:10:19.024 --> 00:10:22.556
(Applause)
