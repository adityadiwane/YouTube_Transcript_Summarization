00:00:12.727 --> 00:00:14.358
Thank you very much. Good evening.

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:17.698
Some of you may have noticed
that my last name is Nutt.

00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:21.139
And if you did,
you are forgiven for wondering

00:00:21.163 --> 00:00:24.079
how a Nutt managed
to end up in a war zone.

00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:28.444
I actually was offered, right out
of medical school, and accepted

00:00:28.468 --> 00:00:32.305
a volunteer contract to work
with UNICEF in war-torn Somalia,

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.808
that was worth one dollar.

00:00:34.832 --> 00:00:37.243
And, you see, I had to be paid this dollar

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:40.402
in the event that the UN needed
to issue an evacuation order,

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:42.496
so that I would be covered.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.892
I was, after all, heading into one
of the world's most dangerous places.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.475
And by now, some of you
may be asking yourselves,

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:52.031
and I just want to reassure you,

00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:54.354
that I did get half the money up front.

00:00:54.378 --> 00:00:56.166
(Laughter)

00:00:56.717 --> 00:00:59.569
But you see, this is how,
with 50 cents in my pocket,

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:01.885
I ended up in Baidoa, Somalia.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:04.885
Journalists called it the "city of death."

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.123
And they called it the city of death

00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:10.305
because 300,000 people
had lost their lives there --

00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:14.363
300,000 people,

00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:18.543
mostly as a result
of war-related famine and disease.

00:01:19.487 --> 00:01:23.434
I was part of a team that was tasked
with trying to figure out

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.427
how best to respond
to this humanitarian catastrophe.

00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:29.554
It was right on the heels
of the Rwandan genocide,

00:01:29.578 --> 00:01:32.245
and aid money to the region was drying up.

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:34.311
Many aid organizations, unfortunately,

00:01:34.335 --> 00:01:36.911
had been forced to close their doors.

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:40.645
And so the question that I was asked
to specifically help answer,

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:46.345
which is one that aid workers ask
themselves in war zones the world over,

00:01:47.202 --> 00:01:49.250
is: What the hell do we do now?

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:53.535
You know, the security environment
in Somalia at that moment in time --

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:55.590
and nothing has really changed too much --

00:01:55.614 --> 00:02:00.052
can best be described as "Mad Max"
by way of "A Clockwork Orange."

00:02:01.477 --> 00:02:06.608
And I remember very distinctly
a couple of days after my arrival,

00:02:06.632 --> 00:02:09.237
I went up to a feeding clinic.

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:12.505
There were dozens of women
who were standing in line,

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.269
and they were clutching
their infants very close.

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.054
About 20 minutes into
this conversation I was having

00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:21.102
with this one young woman,

00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:22.502
I leaned forward

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.796
and tried to put my finger
in the palm of her baby's hand.

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:29.536
And when I did this,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.558
I discovered that her baby
was already in rigor.

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.003
She was stiff,

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.114
and her little, lifeless hand
was curled into itself.

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:44.053
She had died hours before

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.946
of malnutrition and dehydration.

00:02:48.242 --> 00:02:51.140
I later learned
that as her baby was dying,

00:02:51.164 --> 00:02:55.486
this young woman had
been held for two days

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.246
by some teenage boys who were armed
with Kalashnikov rifles,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.800
and they were trying
to shake her down for more money,

00:03:02.824 --> 00:03:05.506
money she very clearly did not have.

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:09.148
And this is a scene that I have confronted

00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:11.759
in war zones the world over;

00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:17.748
places where kids, some as young
as eight -- they are this big --

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:20.668
and those kids, they have
never been to school.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:27.121
But they have fought and they have killed
with automatic rifles.

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:31.502
Is this just the way the world is?

00:03:32.451 --> 00:03:36.800
Some will you tell you
that war is unavoidably human.

00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:40.347
After all, it is as old
as existence itself.

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:48.053
We say never again, and yet it happens
again and again and again.

00:03:49.232 --> 00:03:54.963
But I will tell you
that I have seen the absolute worst

00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:59.444
of what we as human beings
are capable of doing to one another,

00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:04.627
and yet I still believe
a different outcome is possible.

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:06.893
Do you want to know why?

00:04:07.536 --> 00:04:09.854
Because over 20 years of doing this work,

00:04:09.878 --> 00:04:12.589
going in and out of war zones
around the world,

00:04:12.613 --> 00:04:14.756
I have come to understand

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.700
that there are aspects of this problem

00:04:16.724 --> 00:04:20.802
that we, all of us, as people
occupying this shared space,

00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:23.604
that we can change --

00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:27.562
not through force or coercion or invasion,

00:04:27.586 --> 00:04:31.315
but by simply looking at all
of the options available to us

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.058
and choosing the ones that favor
peace at the expense of war,

00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:41.924
instead of war at the expense of peace.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.420
How so?

00:04:44.444 --> 00:04:46.183
Well, I want you to consider this:

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:51.664
there are at least 800 million
small arms and light weapons

00:04:51.688 --> 00:04:54.144
in circulation in the world today.

00:04:54.788 --> 00:04:58.277
The vast majority of civilians,
like that young baby,

00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:00.690
who are dying in war zones
around the world,

00:05:00.714 --> 00:05:03.689
are dying at the hands
of various armed groups

00:05:03.713 --> 00:05:10.039
who rely on a near-infinite supply
of cheap, easy and efficient weapons

00:05:10.063 --> 00:05:14.723
to rape, threaten, intimidate
and brutalize those civilians

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:16.151
at every turn.

00:05:16.937 --> 00:05:18.088
How cheap?

00:05:18.112 --> 00:05:19.728
Well, in some parts of the world,

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:24.150
you can buy an AK-47
for as little as 10 dollars.

00:05:24.174 --> 00:05:27.030
In many places in which I have worked,

00:05:27.621 --> 00:05:32.118
it is easier to get access
to an automatic rifle

00:05:32.142 --> 00:05:36.263
than it is to get access
to clean drinking water.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.636
And so now the important part:

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.818
Can anything be done about this?

00:05:43.922 --> 00:05:45.802
To answer that question,

00:05:45.826 --> 00:05:47.836
let's take a look
at this map of the world.

00:05:48.246 --> 00:05:52.630
And now, let's add in all of the countries
that are currently at war,

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:55.600
and the number of people
who have either died

00:05:55.624 --> 00:05:58.092
or have been displaced
as a result of that violence.

00:05:58.116 --> 00:05:59.512
It is a staggering number --

00:05:59.536 --> 00:06:02.233
more than 40 million people.

00:06:02.764 --> 00:06:05.431
But you will also notice
something else about this map.

00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:07.575
You will notice
that most of those countries

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:08.953
are in the Global South.

00:06:09.453 --> 00:06:11.743
Now, let's look at the countries

00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:16.622
that are the world's top 20 exporters
of small arms in the world.

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:18.801
And what do we notice?

00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:20.794
Well, you see them in green.

00:06:20.818 --> 00:06:24.708
You will notice that those are mostly
countries in the Global North,

00:06:24.732 --> 00:06:26.430
primarily Western countries.

00:06:26.454 --> 00:06:27.670
What does this tell us?

00:06:27.694 --> 00:06:31.185
This tells us that most of the people
who are dying in war

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:33.112
are living in poor countries,

00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:35.950
and yet most of the people
who are profiting from war

00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:40.971
are living in rich countries --
people like you and me.

00:06:41.804 --> 00:06:44.606
And then what if we go
beyond small arms for a second.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.854
What if we look at all weapons
in circulation in the world?

00:06:47.878 --> 00:06:49.662
Who does the biggest business?

00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:52.161
Well, roughly 80 percent of those weapons

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:55.727
come from none other
than the five permanent members

00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:57.642
of the United Nations Security Council,

00:06:57.666 --> 00:06:59.094
plus Germany.

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:01.047
It's shocking, isn't it?

00:07:01.515 --> 00:07:04.191
Now, some of you might be saying
at this moment in time,

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:07.466
"Oh yeah, but OK,
hang on a second there ... Nutt."

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.695
(Laughter)

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:12.080
Grade school was spectacular for me.

00:07:12.104 --> 00:07:14.048
It was, really, a wonderful experience.

00:07:14.072 --> 00:07:17.026
(Laughter)

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.262
But you might be saying to yourselves,

00:07:19.286 --> 00:07:22.634
You know, all of these weapons
in war zones -- they're not a cause,

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:25.080
but an effect of the violence
that plagues them

00:07:25.104 --> 00:07:26.588
each and every single day.

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.795
You know, places like Iraq
and Afghanistan,

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:32.233
where they need these weapons
to be able to maintain law and order,

00:07:32.257 --> 00:07:35.878
promote peace and security,
to combat terror groups --

00:07:35.902 --> 00:07:38.397
surely this is a good thing.

00:07:38.773 --> 00:07:41.461
Let's take a look at that assumption
for just one moment,

00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:45.271
because you see there has been
a boom in the small-arms trade

00:07:45.295 --> 00:07:47.079
since the start of the War on Terror.

00:07:47.103 --> 00:07:50.301
In fact, it is a business
that has grown threefold

00:07:50.325 --> 00:07:52.268
over the past 15 years.

00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:56.245
And now let's compare that
to the number of people

00:07:56.269 --> 00:08:00.095
who have directly died
in armed conflict around the world

00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:01.294
in that same period.

00:08:01.627 --> 00:08:03.072
What do you notice?

00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:05.453
Well, you notice that, in fact,
that also goes up

00:08:05.477 --> 00:08:07.088
roughly three- to fourfold.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:10.777
They basically go up
and end at the same point.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.080
Now, we can have a circular argument here

00:08:14.104 --> 00:08:18.176
about whether this increase
in fatalities is a response

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.109
to the increase of small arms,
or the other way around.

00:08:22.133 --> 00:08:24.629
But here's what we should
really take away from this.

00:08:24.653 --> 00:08:26.313
What we should take away from this

00:08:26.337 --> 00:08:30.755
is that this is a relationship
worth scrutinizing,

00:08:31.447 --> 00:08:36.313
especially when you consider
that small arms that were shipped to Iraq

00:08:36.337 --> 00:08:38.131
for use by the Iraqi Army,

00:08:38.155 --> 00:08:41.402
or to Syria for so-called
moderate opposition fighters,

00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:45.619
that those arms, many of them,
are now in the hands of ISIS;

00:08:46.096 --> 00:08:48.836
or when you consider that arms
that were shipped to Libya

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.573
are now actively drifting
across the Sahel,

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:56.340
and ending up with groups
like Boko Haram and al Qaeda

00:08:56.364 --> 00:08:59.069
and other militant groups.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.784
And therein lies the problem.

00:09:02.466 --> 00:09:03.618
Because, you see,

00:09:03.642 --> 00:09:09.161
small arms anywhere
are a menace everywhere,

00:09:09.831 --> 00:09:14.174
because their first stop
is rarely their last.

00:09:14.904 --> 00:09:17.320
Spending on war per person per year

00:09:17.344 --> 00:09:21.389
now amounts to about 249 dollars --

00:09:21.413 --> 00:09:23.814
249 dollars per person,

00:09:23.838 --> 00:09:28.777
which is roughly 12 times
what we spend on foreign aid,

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:32.238
money that is used to educate
and vaccinate children

00:09:32.262 --> 00:09:35.125
and combat malnutrition
in the Global South.

00:09:35.814 --> 00:09:39.111
But we can shift that balance.

00:09:39.604 --> 00:09:40.755
How do we do this?

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:43.621
Well, it is essentially a problem
of both supply and demand,

00:09:43.645 --> 00:09:45.588
so we can tackle it from both sides.

00:09:45.993 --> 00:09:47.663
On the supply side,

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:50.861
we can push our governments

00:09:50.885 --> 00:09:53.948
to adopt international arms
transparency mechanisms

00:09:53.972 --> 00:09:55.773
like the Arms Trade Treaty,

00:09:55.797 --> 00:09:59.564
which makes it so that rich countries
have to be more accountable

00:09:59.588 --> 00:10:01.263
for where their arms are going

00:10:01.287 --> 00:10:03.686
and what their arms might be used for.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.975
Here in the United States,

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:09.616
the largest arms-exporting country
in the world by far,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.565
President Obama has rightly signed
the Arms Trade Treaty,

00:10:13.589 --> 00:10:16.150
but none of it takes effect,
it isn't binding,

00:10:16.174 --> 00:10:19.683
until it is approved
and ratified by the Senate.

00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:23.819
This is where we need
to make our voices heard.

00:10:23.843 --> 00:10:27.557
You know, the curbing of small arms --

00:10:27.581 --> 00:10:30.383
it's not going to solve
the problem of war.

00:10:30.407 --> 00:10:33.689
Increased control mechanisms
won't solve that problem.

00:10:33.713 --> 00:10:36.960
But it's an important step
in the right direction.

00:10:36.984 --> 00:10:39.857
And it's up to all of us
who live in those rich countries

00:10:39.881 --> 00:10:41.691
to make change here.

00:10:41.994 --> 00:10:45.203
What about on the demand side?

00:10:45.227 --> 00:10:47.980
You know, there are generations
around the world

00:10:48.004 --> 00:10:50.060
who are being lost to war.

00:10:51.202 --> 00:10:54.193
It is possible to disrupt
that cycle of violence

00:10:54.217 --> 00:10:58.210
with investments in education,
in strengthening the rule of law

00:10:58.234 --> 00:11:00.615
and in economic development,
especially for women.

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:02.267
I have personally seen

00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:05.332
just how incredibly powerful
those kinds of efforts can be

00:11:05.356 --> 00:11:06.690
around the world.

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:08.834
But here's the thing:

00:11:08.858 --> 00:11:10.266
they take time,

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.329
which means for you as individuals,
if you want to give,

00:11:14.353 --> 00:11:16.060
please, by all means do it.

00:11:16.084 --> 00:11:19.647
But know that how you give
is just as important

00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:21.678
as how much you give.

00:11:22.147 --> 00:11:24.592
Regular contributions
like monthly contributions

00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:27.904
are a far more effective way of giving,

00:11:27.928 --> 00:11:30.641
because they allow
humanitarian organizations

00:11:30.665 --> 00:11:34.990
to properly plan and be invested
over the long term,

00:11:35.014 --> 00:11:40.639
and to be present in the lives of families
who have been affected by war,

00:11:40.663 --> 00:11:44.899
wars that many of us, frankly,
all too quickly forget.

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:51.299
When I first got on that plane
for Somalia as a young doctor,

00:11:52.942 --> 00:11:56.239
I had no idea what it meant
to live with war.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.921
But I can tell you that I know
what it means now.

00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:02.981
And I know what it means

00:12:03.529 --> 00:12:07.704
to lie in bed in the pitch-black night

00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:12.327
and listen to that haunting
"pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!"

00:12:13.295 --> 00:12:14.914
of automatic gunfire,

00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:18.425
and wonder with absolute dread

00:12:19.298 --> 00:12:22.885
how many minutes I have left
until it will be right on top of me.

00:12:23.556 --> 00:12:28.593
I can tell you that it is a terrifying
and agonizing fear,

00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:32.974
one that millions of people
around the world are forced to confront

00:12:32.998 --> 00:12:35.164
each and every single day,

00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:36.521
especially children.

00:12:37.417 --> 00:12:40.157
Over the years of doing this work,

00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:45.293
unfortunately, war has killed
far too many people close to me.

00:12:46.277 --> 00:12:49.253
And on at least a couple of occasions,

00:12:49.277 --> 00:12:52.047
war has very nearly killed me as well.

00:12:53.309 --> 00:12:58.183
But I firmly believe,

00:12:58.207 --> 00:13:00.984
which is why I get up and do
what I do every single day,

00:13:01.786 --> 00:13:04.514
that we can make different choices here.

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:08.103
Because you see, war is ours,

00:13:08.127 --> 00:13:09.706
as human beings.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.342
We buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.659
We are therefore
not powerless to solve it.

00:13:18.569 --> 00:13:20.240
On the contrary,

00:13:20.264 --> 00:13:23.215
we are the only ones who can.

00:13:23.731 --> 00:13:26.841
Thank you very much, and I want
to wish you the greatest success.

00:13:26.865 --> 00:13:33.739
(Applause)
