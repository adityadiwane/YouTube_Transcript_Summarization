00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
A talk about surgical robots

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
is also a talk about surgery.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.330
And while I've tried to make my images not too graphic,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
than normal people do,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.330
because, after all, what a surgeon does to a patient,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
if it were done without consent,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
would be a felony.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.330
Surgeons are the tailors, the plumbers,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
the carpenters -- some would say the butchers --

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
of the medical world:

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
cutting, reshaping, reforming,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
bypassing, fixing.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.330
But you need to talk about surgical instruments

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.330
and the evolution of surgical technology together.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
So in order to give you some kind of a perspective

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
of where we are right now

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
with surgical robots,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
and where we're going to be going in the future,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
I want to give you a little bit of perspective

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
of how we got to this point,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
how we even came to believe

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
that surgery was OK,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
that this was something that was possible to do,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.330
that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
So, a little bit of perspective --

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
about 10,000 years of perspective.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
This is a trephinated skull.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.330
And trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
And many, many hundreds of skulls like this

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
have been found in archaeological sites

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
all over the world,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.330
dating back five to 10 thousand years.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.330
Five to 10 thousand years! Now imagine this.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
You are a healer in a Stone Age village.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
And you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him --

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
Oliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
He's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
But you think to yourself,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
"I'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
But maybe if I cut a hole in his head I can fix it."

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.330
(Laughter)

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
Now that is surgical thinking.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.330
Now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
What is astonishing about this is,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.330
even though we don't know really how much of this

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
was intended to be religious,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
what we can tell is that these patients lived!

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
Judging by the healing on the borders of these holes,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.330
they lived days, months, years following trephination.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
And so what we are seeing is evidence

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
of a refined technique

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
all over the world.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
This arose independently at sites everywhere

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
that had no communication to one another.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.330
We really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
Now we can fast forward many thousands of years

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
into the Bronze Age and beyond.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
And we see new refined tools coming out.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
than their bold, trephinating ancestors.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
These guys confined their surgery

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
to fairly superficial injuries.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
And surgeons were tradesmen,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
rather than physicians.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.330
This persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
That may have saved the writers,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.330
but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
They were still a mistrusted lot.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
Surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
because the landscape was dominated

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
by the itinerant barber surgeon.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330
These were folks that traveled from village to village, town to town,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.330
doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
Because we were in the age before anesthesia,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
the agony of the patient

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
is really as much of the public spectacle

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
as the surgery itself.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
One of the most famous of these guys, Frere Jacques,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
shown here doing a lithotomy --

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
which is the removal of the bladder stone,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time --

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
had to take less than two minutes.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
You had to have quite a flair for the dramatic,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
and be really, really quick.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
And so here you see him doing a lithotomy.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.330
And he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
wandering around in Europe,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
which is an astonishing number,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.330
when you think that surgery must have been a last resort.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
I mean who would put themselves through that?

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.330
Until anesthesia, the absence of sensation.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
at the Mass. General in 1847,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
a whole new era of surgery was ushered in.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.330
Anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
Anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.330
to start to delve deeper into the body.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.330
This was truly a revolution in surgery.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
But there was a pretty big problem with this.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.330
After these very long, painstaking operations,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.330
attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.330
the patients died.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.330
They died of massive infection.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
Surgery didn't hurt anymore,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
but it killed you pretty quickly.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.330
And infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
until the next big revolution in surgery,

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
which was aseptic technique.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
Joseph Lister was aepsis's,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
or sterility's, biggest advocate,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
But eventually they did come around.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.330
The Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
And they came back to their American clinic and they said

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
they had learned it was as important to wash your hands

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
before doing surgery

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
as it was to wash up afterwards. (Laughter)

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
Something so simple.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.330
And yet, operative mortality dropped profoundly.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
These surgeries were actually now being effective.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.330
With the patient insensitive to pain,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
and a sterile operating field

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.330
all bets were off, the sky was the limit.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.330
You could now start doing surgery everywhere,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
on the gut, on the liver,

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
on the heart, on the brain.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
Transplantation: you could take an organ out of one person,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
you could put it in another person, and it would work.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore;

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.330
they had become gods.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.330
The era of the "big surgeon, big incision" had arrived,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
but at quite a cost,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
because they are saving lives,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.330
but not necessarily quality of life,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
because healthy people don't usually need surgery,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.330
and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
The question had to be asked,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
"Well, can we do these same surgeries

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.330
but through little incisions?"

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery:

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
surgery with long instruments through small incisions.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.330
And it really changed the landscape of surgery.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.330
Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
until the 1980s,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.330
that allowed this to be done for real operations.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
So what you see -- this is now the first surgical image --

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.330
as we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.330
It looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
We bring instruments in,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
from two separate cuts in the side,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.330
and then you can start manipulating tissue.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
Within 10 years of the first gallbladder surgeries

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
being done laparoscopically,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
a majority of gallbladder surgeries

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
were being done laparoscopically --

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.330
truly a pretty big revolution.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.330
But there were casualties of this revolution.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
These techniques were a lot harder to learn

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
than people had anticipated.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.330
The learning curve was very long.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.330
And during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
Surgeons had to give up their 3D vision.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
They had to give up their wrists.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:37.330
They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.330
This surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:48.330
Now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
But this is hard.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
And one of the reasons why it is so hard

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.330
is because the external ergonomics are terrible.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.330
You've got these long instruments, and you're working off your centerline.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:06.330
And the instruments are essentially working backwards.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
So what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
and put it on the other side of that small incision,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.330
is you need to put a wrist on that instrument.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
And so -- I get to talk about robots --

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
the da Vinci robot

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.330
put just that wrist on the other side of that incision.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.330
And now, in contrast to the laparoscopy,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.330
you can precisely place the needle in your instruments,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.330
and you can pass it all the way through

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
and follow it in a trajectory.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
And the reason why this becomes so much easier

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
is -- you can see on the bottom --

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
the hands are making the motions,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.330
and the instruments are following those motions exactly.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.330
Now, what you put between those instruments and those hands,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.330
is a large, fairly complicated robot.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.330
The surgeon is sitting at a console,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.330
and controlling the robot with these controllers.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.330
And the robot is moving these instruments around,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.330
and powering them, down inside the body.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
You have a 3D camera, so you get a 3D view.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.330
And since this was introduced in 1999,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
a lot of these robots have been out

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.330
and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.330
which is a prostate deep in the pelvis,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
and it requires fine dissection

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
and delicate manipulation

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
to be able to get a good surgical outcome.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:37.330
You can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.330
without cracking the chest.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
This is all done in between the ribs.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
And you can go inside the heart itself

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.330
and repair the valves from the inside.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
You've got these technologies -- thank you --

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
(Applause)

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
And so you might say, "Wow this is really cool!

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
So, smartypants, why isn't all surgery being done this way?"

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.330
And there are some reasons, some good reasons.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
And cost is one of them.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
I talked about the large, complicated robot.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.330
With all its bells and whistles, one of those robots

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
More useful than a solid gold surgeon,

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.330
but, still, it's a fairly big capital investment.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:25.330
But once you've got it, your procedure costs do come down.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
But there are other barriers.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.330
So something like a prostatectomy --

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.330
the prostate is small, and it's in one spot,

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
and you can set your robot up very precisely

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
to work in that one spot.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.330
And so it's perfect for something like that.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
And in fact if you, or anyone you know,

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.330
chances are it was done with one of these systems.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.330
But if you need to reach more places than just one,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
you need to move the robot.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
And you need to put some new incisions in there.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
And you need to re-set it up.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.330
And then you need to add some more ports, and more.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
And the problem is it gets time-consuming, and cumbersome.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
And for that reason there are many surgeries

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.330
that just aren't being done with the da Vinci.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:16.330
So we had to ask the question, "Well how do we fix that?"

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.330
What if we could change it so that we didn't have to re-set up

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
each time we wanted to move somewhere different?

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
What if we could bring all the instruments

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
in together in one place?

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.330
How would that change the capabilities of the surgeon?

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.330
And how would that change the experience for the patient?

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
Now, to do that,

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.330
we need to be able to bring a camera

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.330
and instruments in together through one small tube,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:52.330
Or, not so coincidentally, like a tube like this.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
So what's going to come out of that tube

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.330
is the debut of this new technology,

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:02.330
this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.330
Ready? So here it comes.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
This is the camera, and three instruments.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
And as you see it come out,

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
in order to actually be able to do anything useful,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
it can't all stay clustered up like this.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.330
It has to be able to come off of the centerline

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.330
and then be able to work back toward that centerline.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
He's a cheeky little devil.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
But what this lets you do

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
is gives you that all-important traction,

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
and counter-traction,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
so that you can dissect, so that you can sew,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
so that you can do all the things that you need to do,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
all the surgical tasks.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.330
But it's all coming in through one incision.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.330
It's not so simple.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.330
But it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.330
as we're going around.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.330
For the patient, however,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:14:00.330
it's transparent. This is all they're going to see.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.330
It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:09.330
We get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.330
As we take these capabilities, and we get to go to the next places,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.330
we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
And I think to really get the rest of the way

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
in that revolution,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
we need to not just take our hands in in new ways,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.330
we also need to take our eyes in in new ways.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
We need to see beyond the surface.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.330
We need to be able to guide what we're cutting

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:38.330
in a much better way.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
This is a cancer surgery.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
One of the problems with this,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
even for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.330
is you can't see the cancer,

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.330
especially when it's hidden below the surface.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
And so what we're starting to do

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.330
is we're starting to inject specially designed markers

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.330
into the bloodstream that will target the cancer.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.330
It will go, bind to the cancer.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.330
And we can make those markers glow.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.330
And we can take special cameras,

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.330
and we can look at it.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
Now we know where we need to cut,

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
even when it's below the surface.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.330
We can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.330
And we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:29.330
so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.330
We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.330
so that when we do a new vessel

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
and we bypass a blockage on the heart,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.330
we can see if we actually made the connection,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.330
before we close that patient back up again --

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.330
something that we haven't been able to do

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.330
without radiation before.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.330
We can light up tumors

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.330
like this kidney tumor,

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.330
so that you can exactly see where the boundary is

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.330
between the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind,

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.330
or the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.330
And we don't even need to confine ourselves

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.330
to this macro vision.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.330
We have flexible microscopic probes

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.330
that we can bring down into the body.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.330
And we can look at cells directly.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.330
I'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see, down on the bottom,

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.330
and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand, up at the top.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.330
So this is all very prototypey at this point.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.330
But you care about nerves, if you are a surgical patient.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.330
Because they let you keep continence,

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.330
bladder control, and sexual function after surgery,

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:44.330
all of which is generally fairly important to the patient.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.330
So, with the combination of these technologies

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:52.330
we can reach it all, and we can see it all.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.330
We can heal the disease.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.330
And we can leave the patient whole and intact

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.330
and functional afterwards.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.330
Now, I've talked about the patient

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.330
as if the patient is, somehow, someone abstract

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.330
outside this room.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.330
And that is not the case.

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:16.330
Many of you, all of you maybe,

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:19.330
will at some point, or have already, faced a diagnosis of cancer,

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.330
or heart disease, or some organ dysfunction

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.330
that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:29.330
And when you get to that point --

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.330
I mean, these maladies don't care

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.330
how many books you've written,

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.330
how many companies you've started,

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.330
that Nobel Prize you have yet to win,

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:43.330
how much time you planned to spend with your children.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.330
These maladies come for us all.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.330
And the prospect I'm offering you, of an easier surgery ...

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:53.330
is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying?

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.330
I'm not sure I really even want it to.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.330
Because facing your own mortality

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.330
causes a re-evaluation of priorities,

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:08.330
and a realignment of what your goals are in life, unlike anything else.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:13.330
And I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.330
What I want instead,

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:21.330
is for you to be whole, intact,

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:26.330
and functional enough to go out and save the world,

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.330
after you've decided you need to do it.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.330
And that is my vision for your future.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.330
Thank you.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:49.330
(Applause)
