00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.218
People love their automobiles.

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:23.306
They allow us to go
where we want to when we want to.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.945
They're a form of entertainment,

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:26.970
they're a form of art,

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:28.676
a pride of ownership.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.369
Songs are written about cars.

00:00:30.393 --> 00:00:32.728
Prince wrote a great song:
"Little Red Corvette."

00:00:32.752 --> 00:00:36.202
He didn't write "Little Red Laptop
Computer" or "Little Red Dirt Devil."

00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:37.420
He wrote about a car.

00:00:37.444 --> 00:00:39.306
One of my favorites has always been:

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.305
"Make Love to Your Man in a Chevy Van,"

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.685
because that was my vehicle
when I was in college.

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:48.118
The fact is, when we do
our market research around the world,

00:00:48.142 --> 00:00:52.135
we see there's a nearly universal
aspiration on the part of people

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:53.313
to own an automobile --

00:00:53.337 --> 00:00:58.103
750 million people
in the world today own a car.

00:00:58.127 --> 00:00:59.672
And you say, boy, that's a lot.

00:00:59.696 --> 00:01:00.852
But you know what?

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:03.011
That's just 12 percent of the population.

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:05.169
We really have to ask the question:

00:01:05.193 --> 00:01:07.912
Can the world sustain
that number of automobiles?

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:11.804
And if you look at projections
over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years,

00:01:11.828 --> 00:01:15.124
it looks like the world
car park could grow

00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:18.083
to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles.

00:01:18.107 --> 00:01:21.782
If you park those end to end
and wrap them around the Earth,

00:01:21.806 --> 00:01:25.152
that would stretch
around the Earth 125 times.

00:01:25.176 --> 00:01:28.462
Now, we've made great progress
with automobile technology

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:30.127
over the last 100 years.

00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:33.988
Cars are dramatically cleaner,
dramatically safer, more efficient

00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:37.712
and radically more affordable
than they were 100 years ago.

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:39.305
But the fact remains:

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.805
the fundamental DNA of the automobile
has stayed pretty much the same.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.097
If we were to reinvent the automobile
today, rather than 100 years ago,

00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:51.926
knowing what we know about the issues
associated with our product

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.409
and about the technologies
that exist today,

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:55.628
what would we do?

00:01:55.652 --> 00:01:57.892
We wanted something
that was really affordable.

00:01:57.916 --> 00:01:59.599
The fuel cell looked great:

00:01:59.623 --> 00:02:01.344
one-tenth as many moving parts,

00:02:01.368 --> 00:02:04.493
a fuel-cell propulsion system
as an internal combustion engine,

00:02:04.517 --> 00:02:05.722
and it emits just water.

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:08.108
And we wanted to take
advantage of Moore's Law

00:02:08.132 --> 00:02:09.973
with electronic controls and software,

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:13.036
and we absolutely wanted
our car to be connected.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.940
So we embarked upon the reinvention
around an electrochemical engine,

00:02:16.964 --> 00:02:18.120
the fuel cell,

00:02:18.144 --> 00:02:20.128
and hydrogen as the energy carrier.

00:02:20.152 --> 00:02:21.661
First was Autonomy.

00:02:21.685 --> 00:02:24.742
Autonomy really set the vision
for where we wanted to head.

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:28.806
We embodied all of the key components
of a fuel-cell propulsion system.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.501
We then had Autonomy
drivable with Hy-Wire,

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:34.806
and we showed Hy-Wire here
at this conference last year.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.993
Hy-Wire is the world's first
drivable fuel cell,

00:02:38.017 --> 00:02:40.806
and we have followed
up that now with Sequel.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.806
And Sequel truly is a real car.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.602
So if we could run the video --

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.189
(Futuristic music)

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.801
[Reinventing the Automobile]

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:36.057
(Video) It truly is my great pleasure
to introduce Sequel.

00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:55.123
[Acceleration]

00:03:56.506 --> 00:03:59.322
[Cruising]

00:04:00.463 --> 00:04:03.339
[Steering]

00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:07.569
[Braking]

00:04:11.147 --> 00:04:13.900
But the real key question
I'm sure that's on your mind:

00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:15.900
Where is the hydrogen going to come from?

00:04:15.924 --> 00:04:19.090
And secondly, when are these kinds
of cars going to be available?

00:04:19.114 --> 00:04:21.314
So let me talk about hydrogen first.

00:04:21.338 --> 00:04:24.956
The beauty of hydrogen is it can come
from so many different sources:

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.743
it can come from fossil fuels,

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:29.528
it can come from any way
that you can create electricity,

00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:31.188
including renewables.

00:04:31.212 --> 00:04:33.003
And it can come from biofuels.

00:04:33.027 --> 00:04:34.545
And that's quite exciting.

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.821
The vision here is to have each local
community play to its natural strength

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.144
in creating the hydrogen.

00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:42.520
A lot of hydrogen is produced
today in the world.

00:04:42.544 --> 00:04:44.828
It's produced to get
sulfur out of gasoline --

00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:46.659
which I find is somewhat ironic.

00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:49.290
It's produced in the fertilizer industry;

00:04:49.314 --> 00:04:52.536
it's produced in the chemical
manufacturing industry.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.949
That hydrogen is being made

00:04:53.973 --> 00:04:56.638
because there's a good
business reason for its use.

00:04:56.662 --> 00:04:59.226
But it tells us that we know
how to create it,

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.523
we know how to create it cost-effectively,

00:05:01.547 --> 00:05:03.814
we know how to handle it safely.

00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:05.035
We did an analysis

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:07.655
where you would have
a station in each city

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:10.806
with each of the 100 largest cities
in the United States,

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.806
and located the stations

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.806
so you'd be no more than two miles
from a station at any time.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.139
We put one every 25 miles on the freeway,

00:05:18.163 --> 00:05:22.168
and it turns out that translates
into about 12,000 stations.

00:05:22.192 --> 00:05:25.557
And at a million dollars each,
that would be about 12 billion dollars.

00:05:25.581 --> 00:05:26.806
That's a lot of money.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.925
But if you built the Alaskan
pipeline today,

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.030
that's half of what the Alaskan
pipeline would cost.

00:05:32.054 --> 00:05:36.054
But the real exciting vision
that we see, truly, is home refueling,

00:05:36.078 --> 00:05:39.703
much like recharging your laptop
or recharging your cell phone.

00:05:39.727 --> 00:05:42.766
So we're pretty excited
about the future of hydrogen.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.806
We think it's a question of not whether,
but a question of when.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.606
What we've targeted for ourselves --

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.155
and we're making great progress
toward this goal --

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:54.671
is to have a propulsion system
based on hydrogen and fuel cells,

00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:56.417
designed and validated,

00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:59.386
that can go head-to-head
with the internal combustion engine.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.417
We're talking about obsoleting
the internal combustion engine,

00:06:02.441 --> 00:06:05.482
and doing it in terms
of affordability at scale volumes,

00:06:05.506 --> 00:06:07.905
its performance and its durability.

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:10.620
So that's what we're driving to for 2010.

00:06:10.644 --> 00:06:13.122
We haven't seen anything yet
in our development work

00:06:13.146 --> 00:06:14.622
that says that isn't possible.

00:06:14.646 --> 00:06:17.766
We actually think the future
is going to be event-driven.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.767
So since we can't predict the future,

00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:22.806
we want to spend a lot of our time
trying to create that future.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.250
I'm very, very intrigued

00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:28.805
by the fact that our cars and trucks
sit idle 90 percent of the time:

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:31.028
they're parked all around us.

00:06:31.052 --> 00:06:34.403
They're usually parked within 100 feet
of the people that own them.

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:38.206
Now, if you take the power-generating
capability of an automobile

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.459
and you compare that to the electric grid
in the United States,

00:06:41.483 --> 00:06:46.076
it turns out that the power
in four percent of the automobiles

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.663
equals that of the electric
grid of the US.

00:06:48.687 --> 00:06:51.588
That's a huge power-generating capability,

00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:53.718
a mobile power-generating capability.

00:06:53.742 --> 00:06:56.719
And hydrogen and fuel cells
give us that opportunity

00:06:56.743 --> 00:06:59.521
to actually use our cars and trucks
when they're parked

00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:01.522
to generate electricity for the grid.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.671
We talked about swarm networks earlier.

00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:07.072
Talk about the ultimate swarm --
having all of the processors

00:07:07.096 --> 00:07:09.240
and all of the cars
when they're sitting idle

00:07:09.264 --> 00:07:12.766
being part of a global grid
for computing capability.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.451
We find that premise quite exciting.

00:07:15.475 --> 00:07:17.713
The automobile becomes,
then, an appliance --

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.013
not in a commodity sense,

00:07:19.037 --> 00:07:21.806
but an appliance, mobile power,
mobile platform

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.445
for information and computing
and communication,

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:26.806
as well as a form of transportation.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.457
And the key to all of this
is to make it affordable,

00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:30.632
to make it exciting,

00:07:30.656 --> 00:07:33.797
to get it on a pathway where
there's a way to make money doing it.

00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:36.806
And again, this is a pretty
big march to take here.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.983
A lot of people say:

00:07:38.007 --> 00:07:39.201
How do you sleep at night

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:41.844
when you're wrestling with a problem
of that magnitude?

00:07:41.868 --> 00:07:45.032
I tell them I sleep like a baby:
I wake up crying every two hours.

00:07:45.056 --> 00:07:46.199
(Laughter)

00:07:46.223 --> 00:07:48.521
Actually, the theme
of this conference, I think,

00:07:48.545 --> 00:07:50.919
has hit on one of the major keys
to pull that off,

00:07:50.943 --> 00:07:53.133
and that's relationships
and working together.

00:07:53.157 --> 00:07:54.327
Thank you very much.

00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:57.662
(Applause)

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:02.364
Chris Anderson: Larry, Larry -- wait,
wait, wait. Larry, wait one sec.

00:08:03.292 --> 00:08:05.674
I've got so many questions
I could ask you.

00:08:05.698 --> 00:08:07.635
I just want to ask one.

00:08:07.659 --> 00:08:09.513
You know, I could be wrong about this,

00:08:09.537 --> 00:08:13.161
but my sense is that
in the public mind today,

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:19.586
GM is not viewed as as serious
about some of these environmental ideas

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.731
as some of your Japanese
competitors, maybe even as Ford.

00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:25.525
Are you serious about it,

00:08:25.549 --> 00:08:29.806
and not just, you know,
when the consumers want it,

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.470
when the regulators force us
to do it, we will go there?

00:08:32.494 --> 00:08:34.996
Will you guys really try
and show leadership on this?

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.408
Larry Burns: Absolutely.
We're absolutely serious.

00:08:37.432 --> 00:08:39.689
We're into this
over a billion dollars already,

00:08:39.713 --> 00:08:42.000
so I would hope people
would think we're serious

00:08:42.024 --> 00:08:44.009
when we're spending that kind of money.

00:08:44.033 --> 00:08:47.041
And secondly, it's a fundamental
business proposition.

00:08:47.065 --> 00:08:48.221
I'll be honest with you;

00:08:48.245 --> 00:08:50.546
we're into it for business
growth opportunities.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.310
We can't grow our business
unless we solve these problems.

00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:56.714
The growth of the auto industry
will be capped by sustainability issues

00:08:56.738 --> 00:08:58.236
if we don't solve the problems.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.756
And there's a simple principle
of strategy that says:

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.829
Do unto yourself
before others do unto you.

00:09:02.853 --> 00:09:05.758
If we can see this possible
future, others can, too.

00:09:05.782 --> 00:09:08.259
And we want to be the first one
to create it, Chris.
