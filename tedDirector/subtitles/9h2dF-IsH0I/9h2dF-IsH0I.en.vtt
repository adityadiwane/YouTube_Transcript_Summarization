00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm going to start here.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
This is a hand-lettered sign

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
that appeared in a mom and pop bakery

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
The store owned one of those machines

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
that can print on plates of sugar.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And kids could bring in drawings

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and have the store print a sugar plate

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
for the top of their birthday cake.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
But unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to draw

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
was cartoon characters.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
They liked to draw the Little Mermaid,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
they'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
But it turns out to be illegal

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
to print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
onto a plate of sugar.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And it's a copyright violation.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
And policing copyright violations

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
for children's birthday cakes

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
was such a hassle

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
that the College Bakery said,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
"You know what, we're getting out of that business.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
If you're an amateur,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
you don't have access to our machine anymore.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
If you want a printed sugar birthday cake,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.260
you have to use one of our prefab images --

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
only for professionals."

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
So there's two bills in Congress right now.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
One is called SOPA, the other is called PIPA.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
It's from the Senate.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
PIPA is short for PROTECTIP,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
which is itself short for

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
Preventing Real Online Threats

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
to Economic Creativity

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and Theft of Intellectual Property --

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
because the congressional aides who name these things

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
have a lot of time on their hands.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
And what SOPA and PIPA want to do

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
is they want to do this.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
They want to raise the cost

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
of copyright compliance

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
to the point where people simply get out of the business

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
of offering it as a capability to amateurs.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Now the way they propose to do this

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
is to identify sites

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
that are substantially infringing on copyright --

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
although how those sites are identified

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
is never fully specified in the bills --

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and then they want to remove them from the domain name system.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
They want to take them out of the domain name system.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Now the domain name system

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
is the thing that turns human-readable names, like Google.com,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
into the kinds of addresses

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
machines expect --

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.260
74.125.226.212.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Now the problem with this model of censorship,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
of identifying a site

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and then trying to remove it from the domain name system,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
is that it won't work.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Now the reason it won't work

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.260
is that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browser

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
or you can make it a clickable link

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
and you'll still go to Google.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
So the policing layer

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
around the problem

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.260
becomes the real threat of the act.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
that won't accomplish its stated goals,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
you have to understand a little bit about the back story.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And the back story is this:

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
SOPA and PIPA, as legislation,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
were drafted largely by media companies

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
that were founded in the 20th century.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
The 20th century was a great time to be a media company,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
If you were making a TV show,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.260
it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made;

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
it only had to be better

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
than the two other shows

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
that were on at the same time --

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
which is a very low threshold

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
of competitive difficulty.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Which meant

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
that if you fielded average content,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
you got a third of the U.S. public for free --

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
tens of millions of users

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
for simply doing something

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
that wasn't too terrible.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
This is like having a license to print money

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and a barrel of free ink.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
But technology moved on, as technology is wont to do.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
that scarcity started to get eroded --

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and I don't mean by digital technology;

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
I mean by analog technology.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Cassette tapes, video cassette recorders,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
even the humble Xerox machine

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
created new opportunities

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
for us to behave in ways

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
that astonished the media business.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Because it turned out

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
we're not really couch potatoes.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
We don't really like to only consume.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
We do like to consume,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
but every time one of these new tools came along,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
it turned out we also like to produce

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and we like to share.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And this freaked the media businesses out --

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
it freaked them out every time.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Jack Valenti, who was the head lobbyist

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
for the Motion Picture Association of America,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.260
once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
to Jack the Ripper

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and poor, helpless Hollywood

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
to a woman at home alone.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
That was the level of rhetoric.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And so the media industries

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
begged, insisted, demanded

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
that Congress do something.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And Congress did something.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
By the early 90s, Congress passed the law

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
that changed everything.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
of 1992.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
look, if people are taping stuff off the radio

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and then making mixtapes for their friends,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
that is not a crime. That's okay.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Taping and remixing

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and sharing with your friends is okay.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
that's not okay.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
But this taping business,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
fine, let it go.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And they thought that they clarified the issue,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
because they'd set out a clear distinction

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
between legal and illegal copying.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
They had wanted Congress

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
to outlaw copying full-stop.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
So when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.260
the media businesses gave up on the idea

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
because it was clear

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
that if Congress was acting in their framework,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.260
they might actually increase the rights of citizens

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
to participate in our own media environment.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
So they went for plan B.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
It took them a while to formulate plan B.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Plan B appeared in its first full-blown form

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
in 1998 --

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
It was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
But the main thrust of the DMCA

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
was that it was legal to sell you

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
uncopyable digital material --

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
It would be, as Ed Felton once famously said,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
"Like handing out water

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
that wasn't wet."

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Bits are copyable. That's what computers do.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
That is a side effect of their ordinary operation.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
So in order to fake the ability

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
to sell uncopyable bits,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
the DMCA also made it legal

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
to force you to use systems

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
that broke the copying function of your devices.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Every DVD player and game player

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and television and computer you brought home --

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it --

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
could be broken by the content industries,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And to make sure you didn't realize,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
or didn't enact their capabilities

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
as general purpose computing devices,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
they also made it illegal

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
for you to try to reset

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
the copyability of that content.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
The DMCA marks the moment

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
when the media industries

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
gave up on the legal system

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
and simply tried to prevent copying

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
through technical means.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
Now the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
but in this one domain, limiting sharing,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
it has mostly not worked.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And the main reason it hasn't worked

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
than anyone imagined.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
The mixtape, the fanzine,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
that was nothing compared to what we're seeing now

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
with the Internet.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
We are in a world

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
where most American citizens

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
over the age of 12

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
share things with each other online.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
We share written things, we share images,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
we share audio, we share video.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Some of the stuff we share

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
is stuff we've made out of what we've found,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and all of it horrifies those industries.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
So PIPA and SOPA

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
are round two.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
But where the DMCA was surgical --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
we want to go down into your computer,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
we want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and prevent it from doing

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
what they said it would do at the store --

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
PIPA and SOPA are nuclear

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.260
and they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the world

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
and censor content.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
Now the mechanism, as I said, for doing this,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
is you need to take out anybody

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
pointing to those IP addresses.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
You need to take them out of search engines,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
you need to take them out of online directories,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
you need to take them out of user lists.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.260
And because the biggest producers of content on the Internet

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
are not Google and Yahoo,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
they're us,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
we're the people getting policed.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
Because in the end,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
the real threat

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
to the enactment of PIPA and SOPA

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
is our ability to share things with one another.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
So what PIPA and SOPA risk doing

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
is taking a centuries-old legal concept,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
innocent until proven guilty,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
and reversing it --

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
guilty until proven innocent.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
You can't share

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
until you show us

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
that you're not sharing something

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
we don't like.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
Suddenly, the burden of proof for legal versus illegal

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
falls affirmatively on us

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
and on the services

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
that might be offering us any new capabilities.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
And if it costs even a dime

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
to police a user,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
that will crush a service

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
with a hundred million users.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
So this is the Internet they have in mind.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Imagine this sign everywhere --

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
imagine it says YouTube

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and Facebook and Twitter.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
Imagine it says TED,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
because the comments can't be policed

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
at any acceptable cost.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
The real effects of SOPA and PIPA

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
are going to be different than the proposed effects.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
The threat, in fact,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
is this inversion of the burden of proof,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
where we suddenly

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
are all treated like thieves

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
at every moment we're given the freedom to create,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
to produce or to share.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
And the people who provide those capabilities to us --

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
the YouTubes, the Facebooks, the Twitters and TEDs --

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
are in the business

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
of having to police us,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
or being on the hook for contributory infringement.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
There's two things you can do

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
to help stop this --

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
a simple thing and a complicated thing,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
an easy thing and a hard thing.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
The simple thing, the easy thing, is this:

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
if you're an American citizen,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
call your representative, call your senator.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
When you look at

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
the people who co-signed on the SOPA bill,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
people who've co-signed on PIPA,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
what you see is that they have cumulatively received

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
millions and millions of dollars

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
from the traditional media industries.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
You don't have millions and millions of dollars,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
but you can call your representatives,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and you can remind them that you vote,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and you can ask not to be treated like a thief,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
and you can suggest that you would prefer

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
that the Internet not be broken.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
And if you're not an American citizen,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
you can contact American citizens that you know

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
and encourage them to do the same.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Because this seems like a national issue,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
but it is not.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
These industries will not be content

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
with breaking our Internet.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
If they break it, they will break it for everybody.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
That's the easy thing.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
That's the simple thing.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
The hard thing is this:

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
get ready, because more is coming.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
which was purposed last year, which did not pass.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
And all of this goes back

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
to the failure of the DMCA

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
to disallow sharing as a technical means.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
which horrified those industries.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
Because the whole business

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
and then gathering evidence and proving that,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
that turns out to be really inconvenient.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
"We'd prefer not to do that,"

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
says the content industries.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
And what they want is not to have to do that.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
They don't want legal distinctions

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
between legal and illegal sharing.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
They just want the sharing to go away.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
PIPA and SOPA are not oddities, they're not anomalies,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
they're not events.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
They're the next turn of this particular screw,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
which has been going on 20 years now.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
And if we defeat these, as I hope we do,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
more is coming.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Because until we convince Congress

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
that the way to deal with copyright violation

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.260
is the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster, with YouTube,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
and the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
that goes on in democratic societies.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
That's the way to handle this.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
In the meantime,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
the hard thing to do is to be ready.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
Time Warner has called

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
and they want us all back on the couch,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
just consuming --

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
not producing, not sharing --

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
and we should say, "No."

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
Thank you.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:53.260
(Applause)
