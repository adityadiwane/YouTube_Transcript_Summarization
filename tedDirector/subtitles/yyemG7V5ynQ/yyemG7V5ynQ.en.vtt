00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So, basically we have public leaders,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
public officials who are out of control;

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
they are writing bills that are unintelligible,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and out of these bills are going to come

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.260
maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
which has a dramatically negative impact on our life.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.260
If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.260
you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits;

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
if you're trying to get a small business loan,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
you face a blizzard of paperwork.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
What are we going to do about it? I define simplicity

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
as a means to achieving clarity,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
transparency and empathy,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
building humanity into communications.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
I've been simplifying things for 30 years.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I come out of the advertising and design business.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.260
My focus is understanding you people,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and how you interact with the government

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
to get your benefits,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and how you view brands.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.260
So, very quickly, when President Obama said,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
"I don't see why we can't

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.260
have a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement."

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
So, I locked myself in a room,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
figured out the content,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
organized the document, and wrote it in plain English.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
I've had this checked by the two top

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
consumer credit lawyers in the country.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
This is a real thing.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Now, I went one step further and said,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
"Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and just have a paper document? Let's go online."

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And many people

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
might need help in computation.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Working with the Harvard Business School,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment:

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
If you spent 62 dollars for a meal,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
the longer you take to pay out that loan,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
it's 99 dollars and 17 cents.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
How about that? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people?

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
But it's going to work. It's more effective

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
than just computational aids.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And what about terms like

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
"over the limit"?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Perhaps a stealth thing.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Define it in context. Tell people what it means.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
When you put it in plain English,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
you almost force the institution

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
to give the people a way, a default out of that,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and not put themselves at risk.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Plain English is about

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
changing the content.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And one of the things I'm most proud of

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
is this agreement for IBM.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
It's a grid, it's a calendar.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
you have responsibilities.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Received very favorably by business.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
And there is some good news to report today.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Each year, one in 10 taxpayers

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
receives a notice from the IRS.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
There are 200 million letters that go out.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Running through this typical letter that they had,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
I ran it through my simplicity lab,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
it's pretty unintelligible.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
70 percent of their transactions in plain English.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
They have been tested in the laboratory.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
When I run it through my lab,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
this heat-mapping shows everything

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
is intelligible.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
And the IRS has introduced the program.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.260
(Applause)

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
There are a couple of things going on right now

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
that I want to bring to your attention.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
There is a lot of discussion now

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
about a consumer financial protection agency,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
how to mandate simplicity.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
We see all this complexity.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
It's incumbent upon us,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and this organization, I believe,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
to make clarity, transparency

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and empathy a national priority.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
There is no way that we should allow government

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
to communicate the way they communicate.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
There is no way we should do business

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
with companies that have agreements

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
So, how are we going to change the world?

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.260
Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
I thank you.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.260
(Applause)
