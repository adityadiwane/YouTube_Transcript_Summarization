00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:14.454
I am a climate scientist,

00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:17.797
and I hate weather.

00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:20.227
I have spent too much time in California,

00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:23.916
and I strongly feel that weather
should be optional.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.074
(Laughter)

00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:28.139
So I don't want to experience clouds,

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:29.536
let alone study them.

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:33.883
But clouds seem to follow me
wherever I go.

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:39.123
The thing is, clouds are a real
challenge for climate science.

00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:43.612
We don't know how they're going to react
as the planet heats up,

00:00:43.636 --> 00:00:47.357
and hidden in that uncertainty

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:48.667
might be hope.

00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:51.884
Maybe, just maybe,

00:00:51.908 --> 00:00:54.589
clouds could slow down global warming,

00:00:54.613 --> 00:00:58.260
and buy us a little bit more time
to get our act together,

00:00:58.284 --> 00:01:01.000
which would be very convenient right now.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.510
I mean, even I could put up
with a few more cloudy days

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:07.601
if clouds saved the planet.

00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:11.097
Now, we are sure about some things.

00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:14.040
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas,

00:01:14.064 --> 00:01:15.460
we're emitting a lot of it,

00:01:15.484 --> 00:01:17.030
and the planet is heating up.

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:18.666
Case closed.

00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:21.182
But I still go to work every day.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.490
It turns out that there is a lot
that we don't understand

00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:26.981
about climate change.

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:29.898
In particular, we haven't answered

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:32.806
what seems to be a very
fundamental question.

00:01:33.404 --> 00:01:34.995
We know it's going to get hot,

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.738
but we don't know exactly
how hot it's going to get.

00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:42.431
Now, this is a really
easy question to answer

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:45.429
if one of you would like
to give me a time machine.

00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:47.914
But I'm going to be honest with you:

00:01:47.938 --> 00:01:49.993
if I had a time machine,

00:01:50.017 --> 00:01:53.303
I would not be hanging out
at this particular point in history.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.102
So in order to see the future,

00:01:57.126 --> 00:02:00.740
we have to rely on the output
of computer simulations --

00:02:00.764 --> 00:02:02.727
climate models, like this one.

00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:05.178
Now, in my line of work,

00:02:05.202 --> 00:02:08.903
I encounter many very charming
people on the internet

00:02:08.927 --> 00:02:13.063
who like to tell me
that climate models are all wrong.

00:02:13.762 --> 00:02:16.078
And I would just like to say:

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.286
no kidding!

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.787
Seriously? I get paid to complain
about climate models.

00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:25.172
But we don't want models to be perfect.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.140
We want them to be useful.

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:29.397
I mean, think about it:

00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:31.479
a computer simulation

00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:35.389
that's able to exactly
reproduce all of reality.

00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:37.775
That's not a climate model;

00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:39.887
That's "The Matrix."

00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:44.254
So, models are not crystal balls.

00:02:44.278 --> 00:02:45.969
They're research tools,

00:02:45.993 --> 00:02:50.243
and the ways in which they're wrong
can actually teach us a lot.

00:02:50.813 --> 00:02:52.166
For example:

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.184
different climate models
are largely able to capture

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.332
the warming that we've seen so far.

00:02:57.356 --> 00:03:00.124
But fast-forward to the end of the century

00:03:00.148 --> 00:03:02.477
under a business-as-usual scenario,

00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.027
and climate models
don't really agree anymore.

00:03:05.607 --> 00:03:08.799
Yeah, they're all warming;
that's just basic physics.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.359
But some of them project catastrophe --

00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:15.234
more than five times the warming
we've seen already.

00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:18.161
And others are literally more chill.

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:23.663
So why don't climate models agree
on how warm it's going to get?

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:26.301
Well, to a large extent,

00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:29.905
it's because they don't agree
on what clouds will do in the future.

00:03:30.572 --> 00:03:33.343
And that is because, just like me,

00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:35.203
computers hate clouds.

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.829
Computers hate clouds because
they're simultaneously very large

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:41.099
and very small.

00:03:41.624 --> 00:03:42.782
Clouds are formed

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:47.431
when microscopic water droplets
or ice crystals coalesce

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:49.041
around tiny particles.

00:03:49.515 --> 00:03:53.234
But at the same time, they cover
two-thirds of the earth's surface.

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:56.735
In order to really
accurately model clouds,

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:01.283
we'd need to track the behavior
of every water droplet and dust grain

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.749
in the entire atmosphere,

00:04:02.773 --> 00:04:05.274
and there's no computer
powerful enough to do that.

00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:08.437
So instead, we have to make a trade-off:

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.843
we can zoom in and get the details right,

00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:14.845
but have no idea
what's going on worldwide;

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:19.792
or, we could sacrifice
realism at small scales

00:04:19.816 --> 00:04:21.738
in order to see the bigger picture.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.359
Now, there's no one right answer,

00:04:24.383 --> 00:04:25.938
no perfect way to do this,

00:04:26.422 --> 00:04:29.364
and different climate models
make different choices.

00:04:30.263 --> 00:04:32.628
Now, it is unfortunate

00:04:32.652 --> 00:04:34.990
that computers struggle with clouds,

00:04:35.014 --> 00:04:37.712
because clouds are crucially important

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:40.088
in regulating the temperature
of the planet.

00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:43.025
In fact, if all the clouds went away,

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:46.169
we would experience
profound climate changes.

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.282
But without clouds,

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:50.571
would it be warmer or colder?

00:04:51.312 --> 00:04:52.872
The answer is both.

00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:56.858
So I'm going to be honest with you,
I am not a cloud spotter.

00:04:56.882 --> 00:04:59.152
My favorite type of cloud is none.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.696
But even I know that clouds
come in all shapes and sizes.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:08.607
Low, thick clouds like these
are really good at blocking out the sun

00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:10.026
and ruining your barbecue,

00:05:10.708 --> 00:05:13.631
and high, wispy clouds like these cirrus

00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:15.876
largely let that sunlight stream through.

00:05:16.436 --> 00:05:18.833
Every sunny day is the same,

00:05:18.857 --> 00:05:21.340
but every cloudy day
is cloudy in its own way.

00:05:21.857 --> 00:05:23.815
And it's this diversity

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:27.644
that can make the global impact of clouds
very hard to understand.

00:05:28.096 --> 00:05:31.100
So to see this global effect of clouds,

00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:33.767
it really helps to take a selfie.

00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.459
It will never cease to blow my mind

00:05:38.483 --> 00:05:41.031
that we can see our planet
from outer space,

00:05:41.692 --> 00:05:43.333
but we can't see all of it.

00:05:43.938 --> 00:05:45.578
Clouds are blocking the view.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.485
That's what they do.

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:52.195
These low, thick clouds
are extremely effective sunshades.

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.783
They turn back about 20 percent
of everything the sun sends us.

00:05:56.294 --> 00:05:58.998
That is a lot of wasted solar power.

00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:02.004
So, low clouds are powerful sunshades,

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.868
making the planet cooler.

00:06:03.892 --> 00:06:06.061
But that's not the only effect of clouds.

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:08.338
Our planet has a temperature,

00:06:08.362 --> 00:06:10.549
and like anything with a temperature,

00:06:10.573 --> 00:06:11.918
it's giving off heat.

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:15.795
We are radiating thermal energy
away into space,

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.664
and we can see this in the infrared.

00:06:18.688 --> 00:06:21.799
Once again, clouds are blocking the view.

00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:26.010
That's because high clouds live
in the upper reaches of the atmosphere,

00:06:26.034 --> 00:06:27.407
where it's very cold.

00:06:27.811 --> 00:06:31.509
And this means that they lose
very little heat to space themselves.

00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:35.924
But at the same time, they block
the heat coming up from the planet below.

00:06:35.948 --> 00:06:38.823
The earth is trying to cool itself off,

00:06:38.847 --> 00:06:41.356
and high clouds are getting in the way.

00:06:41.983 --> 00:06:46.057
The result is a very
powerful greenhouse effect.

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.673
So, clouds play this very
large and dual role

00:06:50.697 --> 00:06:52.268
in the climate system.

00:06:52.292 --> 00:06:55.083
We've got low clouds that act
like a sunshade,

00:06:55.107 --> 00:06:56.476
cooling the planet,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.419
and high clouds which act
like a greenhouse,

00:06:59.443 --> 00:07:00.629
warming the planet.

00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:04.486
Right now, these two effects --
they don't cancel out.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.928
That sunshade -- it's a little
bit more powerful.

00:07:07.952 --> 00:07:11.030
So if we got rid
of all the clouds tomorrow,

00:07:11.054 --> 00:07:14.268
which, for the record,
I am not advocating,

00:07:14.292 --> 00:07:16.122
our planet would get warmer.

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:20.606
So clearly, all of the clouds
are not going away.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.902
But climate change is change.

00:07:23.348 --> 00:07:24.758
So we can ask:

00:07:24.782 --> 00:07:27.870
How will global warming change clouds?

00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:31.510
But remember, clouds are so important

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.632
in regulating the earth's temperature,

00:07:33.656 --> 00:07:36.367
and they both warm and cool the planet.

00:07:36.391 --> 00:07:39.471
So even small changes to cloud cover

00:07:39.495 --> 00:07:41.576
could have profound consequences.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.020
So we might also ask:

00:07:44.044 --> 00:07:47.153
How will clouds change global warming?

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.847
And that is where there might
be space for hope.

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:54.709
If global warming triggers cloud changes

00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:59.885
that make for a less powerful greenhouse
or a more effective sunshade,

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:03.599
then that would enhance
the cooling power of clouds.

00:08:03.623 --> 00:08:07.150
It would act in opposition
to global warming,

00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:10.144
and that's what's happening
in those climate models

00:08:10.168 --> 00:08:12.661
that project relatively muted warming.

00:08:13.214 --> 00:08:16.577
But climate models struggle with clouds,

00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:19.755
and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways.

00:08:20.412 --> 00:08:22.741
Clouds could help us out
with global warming.

00:08:23.653 --> 00:08:25.252
They could also make it worse.

00:08:25.953 --> 00:08:28.839
Now, we know that
climate change is happening

00:08:28.863 --> 00:08:30.628
because we can see it:

00:08:30.652 --> 00:08:36.224
rising temperatures, melting icecaps,
shifts in rainfall patterns.

00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:40.098
And you might think that we
could also see it in the clouds.

00:08:40.122 --> 00:08:42.638
But here's something else unfortunate:

00:08:42.662 --> 00:08:45.333
clouds are really hard to see.

00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:48.300
I see everybody from the Pacific Northwest

00:08:48.324 --> 00:08:50.523
is like, "I have some
suggestions for you."

00:08:50.547 --> 00:08:51.571
(Laughter)

00:08:51.595 --> 00:08:54.191
And you guys, we have tried looking up.

00:08:54.215 --> 00:08:55.266
(Laughter)

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.309
But in order to do climate science,

00:08:58.333 --> 00:09:03.466
we need to see all of the clouds,
everywhere, for a very long time.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.235
And that's what makes it hard.

00:09:05.917 --> 00:09:10.691
Now, nothing sees more clouds
than a satellite --

00:09:10.715 --> 00:09:12.635
not even a British person.

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:13.780
(Laughter)

00:09:13.804 --> 00:09:18.911
And fortunately, we do have
satellite observations of clouds

00:09:18.935 --> 00:09:21.799
that, like me, date back to the 1980s.

00:09:22.502 --> 00:09:26.116
But these satellites
were designed for weather,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.664
not climate.

00:09:27.688 --> 00:09:29.602
They weren't in it for the long haul.

00:09:29.626 --> 00:09:32.312
So to get that long-term
trend information,

00:09:32.336 --> 00:09:34.111
we need to do climate science.

00:09:34.135 --> 00:09:37.253
We have to stitch together
the output of multiple satellites

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:40.355
with different viewing angles and orbits

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:42.302
and carrying different camera equipment.

00:09:42.326 --> 00:09:43.548
And as a result,

00:09:43.572 --> 00:09:45.724
there are gaps in our knowledge.

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:49.648
But even from this very cloudy picture,

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:52.835
we're starting to get hints
of a possible future.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:56.068
When we looked at the observations,

00:09:56.092 --> 00:09:57.908
one thing jumped out at us:

00:09:58.492 --> 00:10:00.521
the clouds are moving.

00:10:01.513 --> 00:10:04.002
As the planet's temperature increases,

00:10:04.026 --> 00:10:05.958
high clouds rise up.

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:10.736
They move to the colder
upper reaches of the atmosphere,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.423
and this means that even
as the planet heats up,

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.764
high clouds don't.

00:10:16.204 --> 00:10:18.841
They remain at roughly
the same temperature.

00:10:18.865 --> 00:10:22.363
So they are not losing more heat to space.

00:10:22.387 --> 00:10:25.424
But at the same time,
they're trapping more heat

00:10:25.448 --> 00:10:27.181
from the warming planet below.

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:30.669
This intensifies the greenhouse effect.

00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:35.360
High clouds are making
global warming worse.

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:38.667
Clouds are moving
in other dimensions, too.

00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:41.696
The atmospheric circulation,
that large-scale motion

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.638
of air and water in the atmosphere,

00:10:43.662 --> 00:10:45.049
is changing,

00:10:45.073 --> 00:10:47.337
and clouds are going with it.

00:10:49.036 --> 00:10:50.642
On large scales,

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:54.778
clouds seem to be moving
from the tropics toward the poles.

00:10:54.802 --> 00:10:57.339
It's kind of like your
grandparents in reverse.

00:10:58.027 --> 00:10:59.606
And this matters,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.479
because if your job
is to block incoming sunlight,

00:11:03.503 --> 00:11:06.519
you are going to be much
more effective in the tropics

00:11:06.543 --> 00:11:08.740
under that intense tropical sun

00:11:08.764 --> 00:11:10.621
than you are in higher latitudes.

00:11:11.092 --> 00:11:12.962
So if this keeps up,

00:11:12.986 --> 00:11:16.083
this will also make global warming worse.

00:11:16.107 --> 00:11:18.428
And what we have not found,

00:11:18.452 --> 00:11:20.730
despite years of looking,

00:11:20.754 --> 00:11:23.332
is any indication of the opposite.

00:11:23.865 --> 00:11:26.797
There is no observational evidence

00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:30.556
that clouds will substantially
slow down global warming.

00:11:31.961 --> 00:11:35.298
The earth is not going
to break its own fever.

00:11:36.013 --> 00:11:38.449
Now, there are still uncertainties here.

00:11:39.044 --> 00:11:41.272
We don't know for sure

00:11:41.296 --> 00:11:42.951
what the future holds.

00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:46.197
But we are sending our kids there,

00:11:46.802 --> 00:11:48.800
and they are never coming back.

00:11:50.253 --> 00:11:53.384
I want them to be prepared
for what they'll face,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.363
and that is why it is so important

00:11:57.387 --> 00:12:00.638
to keep our earth-observing
satellites up there

00:12:00.662 --> 00:12:04.458
and to hire diverse and smart
and talented people

00:12:04.482 --> 00:12:06.749
who do not hate clouds

00:12:06.773 --> 00:12:08.708
to improve the climate models.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.913
But uncertainty is not ignorance.

00:12:13.873 --> 00:12:15.345
We don't know everything,

00:12:15.913 --> 00:12:17.507
but we don't know nothing,

00:12:18.254 --> 00:12:20.648
and we know what carbon dioxide does.

00:12:21.651 --> 00:12:24.815
I started my career as an astrophysicist,

00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:26.321
so you can believe me

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:31.802
when I say that this is the greatest
place in the universe.

00:12:32.904 --> 00:12:35.721
Other planets might have liquid water.

00:12:36.808 --> 00:12:39.951
On earth, we have whiskey.

00:12:39.975 --> 00:12:41.988
(Laughter)

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:47.020
(Applause)

00:12:47.044 --> 00:12:50.237
We are so lucky to live here,

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.504
but let's not push our luck.

00:12:54.296 --> 00:12:57.234
I don't think that clouds
will save the planet.

00:12:58.045 --> 00:12:59.733
I think that's probably up to us.

00:13:00.177 --> 00:13:01.416
Thank you.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.390
(Applause)
