00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:17.178
On Mondays and Thursdays,
I learn how to die.

00:00:17.178 --> 00:00:19.102
I call them my terminal days.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.936
My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term,

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:26.738
but a lot of people in my family died
of melanoma cancer

00:00:26.738 --> 00:00:29.373
and my parents and grandparents had it.

00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:32.657
And I kept thinking, one day I could
be sitting in front of a doctor

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:34.779
who looks at my exams and says,

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:37.094
"Ricardo, things don't look very good.

00:00:37.094 --> 00:00:39.773
You have six months or a year to live."

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:43.019
And you start thinking about
what you would do with this time.

00:00:43.034 --> 00:00:45.814
And you say, "I'm going to spend 
more time with the kids.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.396
I'm going to visit these places,

00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:49.878
I'm going to go up and down
mountains and places

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:53.702
and I'm going to do all the things
I didn't do when I had the time."

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.639
But of course, we all know

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.623
these are very bittersweet memories 
we're going to have.

00:00:58.623 --> 00:00:59.946
It's very difficult to do.

00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:03.599
You spend a good part of the time
crying, probably.

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:05.986
So I said, I'm going to do something else.

00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:10.825
Every Monday and Thursday,
I'm going use my terminal days.

00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:13.194
And I will do, during those days,

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:16.721
whatever it is I was going to do
if I had received that piece of news.

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.094
(Laughter)

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:20.128
When you think about --

00:01:20.128 --> 00:01:24.293
(Applause)

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:26.770
when you think about the opposite of work,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.247
we, many times, think it's leisure.

00:01:29.247 --> 00:01:32.314
And you say, ah, I need 
some leisure time, and so forth.

00:01:32.314 --> 00:01:35.851
But the fact is that,
leisure is a very busy thing.

00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:38.250
You go play golf and tennis,
and you meet people,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.360
and you're going for lunch,
and you're late for the movies.

00:01:41.362 --> 00:01:43.410
It's a very crowded thing that we do.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.530
The opposite of work is idleness.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.945
But very few of us know
what to do with idleness.

00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:54.002
When you look at the way
that we distribute our lives in general,

00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:58.561
you realize that in the periods
in which we have a lot of money,

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:00.558
we have very little time.

00:02:00.558 --> 00:02:05.585
And then when we finally have time,
we have neither the money nor the health.

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:10.205
So we started thinking about that
as a company for the last 30 years.

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:13.376
This is a complicated company
with thousands of employees,

00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:15.736
hundreds of millions
of dollars of business

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:22.289
that makes rocket fuel propellent systems,
runs 4,000 ATMs in Brazil,

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.646
does income tax preparation
for dozens of thousands.

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:29.258
So this is not a simple business.

00:02:29.258 --> 00:02:31.386
We looked at it and we said,

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:36.254
let's devolve to these people,
let's give these people a company

00:02:36.254 --> 00:02:38.634
where we take away
all the boarding school aspects

00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:41.023
of, this is when you arrive,
this is how you dress,

00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:43.585
this is how you go to meetings,
this is what you say,

00:02:43.585 --> 00:02:44.906
this is what you don't say,

00:02:44.906 --> 00:02:46.412
and let's see what's left.

00:02:46.412 --> 00:02:48.242
So we started this about 30 years ago,

00:02:48.242 --> 00:02:50.767
and we started dealing
with this very issue.

00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:52.964
And so we said, look, the retirement,

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:56.106
the whole issue of how 
we distribute our graph of life.

00:02:56.106 --> 00:02:59.263
Instead of going mountain climbing
when you're 82,

00:02:59.263 --> 00:03:01.436
why don't you do it next week?

00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:02.791
And we'll do it like this,

00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:07.187
we'll sell you back your Wednesdays
for 10 percent of your salary.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:11.440
So now, if you were going to be 
a violinist, which you probably weren't,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.594
you go and do this on Wednesday.

00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:14.941
And what we found --

00:03:14.941 --> 00:03:17.478
we thought, these are the older people

00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:20.077
who are going to be really interested
in this program.

00:03:20.077 --> 00:03:22.531
And the average age
of the first people who adhered

00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:23.979
were 29, of course.

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:25.337
And so we started looking,

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:27.837
and we said, we have to do things
in a different way.

00:03:27.837 --> 00:03:29.608
So we started saying things like,

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:31.982
why do we want to know
what time you came to work,

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:33.233
what time you left, etc.?

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.587
Can't we exchange this for a contract

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:39.049
for buying something from you,
some kind of work?

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.070
Why are we building these headquarters?

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.838
Is it not an ego issue
that we want to look solid

00:03:43.838 --> 00:03:45.717
and big and important?

00:03:45.717 --> 00:03:49.001
But we're dragging you two hours
across town because of it?

00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:52.532
So we started asking questions one by one.

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:53.925
We'd say it like this:

00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:56.207
One: How do we find people?

00:03:56.207 --> 00:03:59.390
We'd go out and try
and recruit people and we'd say,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.943
look, when you come to us,

00:04:00.943 --> 00:04:03.165
we're not going to have
two or three interviews

00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:05.577
and then you're going to be
married to us for life.

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:07.727
That's not how we do 
the rest of our lives.

00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:09.832
So, come have your interviews.

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:13.268
Anyone who's interested
in interviewing, you will show up.

00:04:13.268 --> 00:04:17.261
And then we'll see what happens
out of the intuition that rises from that,

00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:21.303
instead of just filling out the little 
items of whether you're the right person.

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:23.420
And then, come back.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.481
Spend an afternoon, spend a whole day,
talk to anybody you want.

00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:29.542
Make sure we are the bride 
you thought we were

00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:32.605
and not all the bullshit
we put into our own ads.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.681
(Laughter)

00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:38.377
Slowly we went to a process 
where we'd say things like,

00:04:38.377 --> 00:04:41.138
we don't want anyone to be
a leader in the company

00:04:41.138 --> 00:04:43.281
if they haven't been 
interviewed and approved

00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:46.132
by their future subordinates.

00:04:46.132 --> 00:04:51.009
Every six months, everyone gets 
evaluated, anonymously, as a leader.

00:04:51.588 --> 00:04:55.620
And this determines whether they should
continue in that leadership position,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.410
which is many times
situational, as you know.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.464
And so if they don't have 70, 80 percent 
of a grade, they don't stay,

00:05:04.464 --> 00:05:08.803
which is probably the reason why
I haven't been CEO for more than 10 years.

00:05:08.803 --> 00:05:12.699
And over time, we started asking
other questions.

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.215
We said things like,

00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:17.544
why can't people set their own salaries?

00:05:17.544 --> 00:05:19.120
What do they need to know?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.183
There's only three things 
you need to know:

00:05:21.183 --> 00:05:23.518
how much people make inside the company,

00:05:23.518 --> 00:05:26.387
how much people make somewhere
else in a similar business

00:05:26.387 --> 00:05:29.679
and how much we make in general
to see whether we can afford it.

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:32.264
So let's give people these three
pieces of information.

00:05:32.264 --> 00:05:34.272
So we started having, in the cafeteria,

00:05:34.272 --> 00:05:36.773
a computer where you could go in 
and you could ask

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:38.970
what someone spent, 
how much someone makes,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.450
what they make in benefits, 
what the company makes,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.760
what the margins are, and so forth.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.522
And this is 25 years ago.

00:05:47.452 --> 00:05:50.187
As this information started 
coming to people,

00:05:50.187 --> 00:05:53.296
we said things like, we don't want 
to see your expense report,

00:05:53.296 --> 00:05:55.868
we don't want to know how many 
holidays you're taking,

00:05:55.892 --> 00:05:57.780
we don't want to know where you work.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.756
We had, at one point,
14 different offices around town,

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:04.150
and we'd say, go to the one 
that's closest to your house,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.651
to the customer that 
you're going to visit today.

00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:08.770
Don't tell us where you are.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.895
And more, even when we had
thousands of people, 5,000 people,

00:06:12.895 --> 00:06:16.273
we had two people in the H.R. department,

00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:18.671
and thankfully one of them has retired.

00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:20.630
(Laughter)

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.384
And so, the question we were asking was,
how can we be taking care of people?

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.187
People are the only thing we have.

00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:29.625
We can't have a department that runs
after people and looks after people.

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:35.006
So as we started finding that this worked,
and we'd say, we're looking for --

00:06:35.006 --> 00:06:37.701
and this is, I think,
the main thing I was looking for

00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:39.744
in the terminal days and in the company,

00:06:39.744 --> 00:06:43.313
which is, how do you set up for wisdom?

00:06:43.313 --> 00:06:47.989
We've come from an age of revolution,
industrial revolution,

00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:50.672
an age of information,
an age of knowledge,

00:06:50.672 --> 00:06:53.284
but we're not any closer
to the age of wisdom.

00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:56.611
How we design, how do we organize,
for more wisdom?

00:06:56.611 --> 00:06:58.154
So for example, many times,

00:06:58.154 --> 00:07:02.501
what's the smartest or the intelligent
decision doesn't jive.

00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:04.883
So we'd say things like,

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:08.890
let's agree that you're going to sell
57 widgets per week.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.563
If you sell them by Wednesday, 
please go to the beach.

00:07:12.563 --> 00:07:16.274
Don't create a problem for us, 
for manufacturing, for application,

00:07:16.274 --> 00:07:19.377
then we have to buy new companies,
we have to buy our competitors,

00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:22.599
we have to do all kinds of things
because you sold too many widgets.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:24.835
So go to the beach
and start again on Monday.

00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:27.271
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:27.271 --> 00:07:30.610
So the process is looking for wisdom.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.150
And in the process, of course, 
we wanted people to know everything,

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.519
and we wanted to be truly democratic
about the way we ran things.

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:43.210
So our board had two seats open 
with the same voting rights,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.328
for the first two people who showed up.

00:07:45.328 --> 00:07:46.896
(Laughter)

00:07:46.896 --> 00:07:52.132
And so we had cleaning ladies voting
on a board meeting,

00:07:52.132 --> 00:07:55.228
which had a lot of other very important
people in suits and ties.

00:07:55.228 --> 00:07:58.857
And the fact is that they kept us honest.

00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:02.606
This process, as we started looking
at the people who came to us,

00:08:02.606 --> 00:08:04.184
we'd say, now wait a second,

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:07.067
people come to us and they say,
where am I supposed to sit?

00:08:07.067 --> 00:08:10.307
How am I supposed to work?
Where am I going to be in 5 years' time?

00:08:10.308 --> 00:08:13.386
And we looked at that and we said,
we have to start much earlier.

00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:14.409
Where do we start?

00:08:14.409 --> 00:08:16.924
We said, oh, kindergarten 
seems like a good place.

00:08:16.924 --> 00:08:21.581
So we set up a foundation, which now has, 
for 11 years, three schools,

00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:23.883
where we started asking
the same questions,

00:08:23.883 --> 00:08:26.795
how do you redesign school for wisdom?

00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:29.724
It is one thing to say,
we need to recycle the teachers,

00:08:29.724 --> 00:08:31.398
we need the directors to do more.

00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:37.333
But the fact is that what we do
with education is entirely obsolete.

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:39.831
The teacher's role is entirely obsolete.

00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:45.478
Going from a math class, to biology,
to 14th-century France is very silly.

00:08:45.482 --> 00:08:50.184
(Applause)

00:08:50.184 --> 00:08:52.913
So we started thinking, 
what could it look like?

00:08:52.913 --> 00:08:56.482
And we put together people, 
including people who like education,

00:08:56.482 --> 00:09:01.917
people like Paulo Freire, 
and two ministers of education in Brazil

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:04.586
and we said, if we were to design
a school from scratch,

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:06.013
what would it look like?

00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:09.746
And so we created this school,
which is called Lumiar,

00:09:09.746 --> 00:09:11.898
and Lumiar, one of them
is a public school,

00:09:11.898 --> 00:09:13.704
and Lumiar says the following:

00:09:13.704 --> 00:09:17.881
Let's divide this role
of the teacher into two.

00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:20.242
One guy, we'll call a tutor.

00:09:20.242 --> 00:09:25.217
A tutor, in the old sense of the Greek
"paideia": Look after the kid.

00:09:25.217 --> 00:09:29.047
What's happening at home,
what's their moment in life, etc..

00:09:29.047 --> 00:09:30.387
But please don't teach,

00:09:30.387 --> 00:09:33.797
because the little you know compared 
to Google, we don't want to know.

00:09:33.797 --> 00:09:34.949
Keep that to yourself.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.297
(Laughter)

00:09:36.297 --> 00:09:40.250
Now, we'll bring in people
who have two things:

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.617
passion and expertise, and it could be
their profession or not.

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:46.534
And we use the senior citizens,

00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:50.887
who are 25 percent of the population
with wisdom that nobody wants anymore.

00:09:50.887 --> 00:09:53.494
So we bring them to school and we say,

00:09:53.494 --> 00:09:57.330
teach these kids whatever
you really believe in.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.946
So we have violinists teaching math.

00:09:59.946 --> 00:10:02.511
We have all kinds of things where we say,

00:10:02.511 --> 00:10:05.492
don't worry about 
the course material anymore.

00:10:05.492 --> 00:10:10.456
We have approximately 10 great threads
that go from 2 to 17.

00:10:10.456 --> 00:10:14.846
Things like, how do we measure
ourselves as humans?

00:10:14.846 --> 00:10:18.472
So there's a place for math and physics
and all that there.

00:10:18.472 --> 00:10:20.336
How do we express ourselves?

00:10:20.336 --> 00:10:22.741
So there's a place
for music and literature, etc.,

00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:24.385
but also for grammar.

00:10:24.385 --> 00:10:27.042
And then we have things
that everyone has forgotten,

00:10:27.042 --> 00:10:29.611
which are probably the most 
important things in life.

00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:33.309
The very important things in life,
we know nothing about.

00:10:33.309 --> 00:10:35.549
We know nothing about love,

00:10:35.549 --> 00:10:37.641
we know nothing about death,

00:10:37.641 --> 00:10:39.718
we know nothing about why we're here.

00:10:39.718 --> 00:10:44.252
So we need a thread in school that
talks about everything we don't know.

00:10:44.252 --> 00:10:46.356
So that's a big part of what we do.

00:10:46.356 --> 00:10:51.951
(Applause)

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:54.869
So over the years, we started going
into other things.

00:10:54.869 --> 00:10:57.031
We'd say, why do we have to scold the kids

00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:59.822
and say, sit down and come here 
and do that, and so forth.

00:10:59.822 --> 00:11:03.137
We said, let's get the kids to do 
something we call a circle,

00:11:03.137 --> 00:11:04.402
which meets once a week.

00:11:04.402 --> 00:11:06.712
And we'd say, you put the rules together

00:11:06.712 --> 00:11:09.039
and then you decide
what you want to do with it.

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:11.221
So can you all hit yourself on the head?

00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:13.543
Sure, for a week, try.

00:11:13.543 --> 00:11:17.478
They came up with the very same
rules that we had,

00:11:17.478 --> 00:11:18.869
except they're theirs.

00:11:18.869 --> 00:11:21.114
And then, they have the power,

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:26.106
which means, they can and do
suspend and expel kids

00:11:26.106 --> 00:11:31.504
so that we're not playing school,
they really decide.

00:11:31.504 --> 00:11:34.547
And then, in this same vein,

00:11:34.547 --> 00:11:36.941
we keep a digital mosaic,

00:11:36.941 --> 00:11:40.572
because this is not constructivist
or Montessori or something.

00:11:40.572 --> 00:11:44.110
It's something where we keep
the Brazilian curriculum

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.778
with 600 tiles of a mosaic,

00:11:46.778 --> 00:11:49.915
which we want to expose these kids
to by the time they're 17.

00:11:49.915 --> 00:11:52.750
And follow this all the time
and we know how they're doing

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.790
and we say, you're not interested 
in this now, let's wait a year.

00:11:56.804 --> 00:12:01.036
And the kids are in groups
that don't have an age category,

00:12:01.036 --> 00:12:04.762
so the six-year-old kid
who is ready for that with an 11-year-old,

00:12:04.762 --> 00:12:07.127
that eliminates all of the gangs
and the groups

00:12:07.127 --> 00:12:11.012
and this stuff that we have 
in the schools, in general.

00:12:11.012 --> 00:12:13.453
And they have a zero 
to 100 percent grading,

00:12:13.453 --> 00:12:17.254
which they do themselves with an app
every couple of hours.

00:12:17.254 --> 00:12:21.689
Until we know they're 37 percent of the
way we'd like them to be on this issue,

00:12:21.689 --> 00:12:26.584
so that we can send them out in the world
with them knowing enough about it.

00:12:26.584 --> 00:12:31.827
And so the courses are World Cup Soccer,
or building a bicycle.

00:12:31.827 --> 00:12:36.098
And people will sign up for 
a 45-day course on building a bicycle.

00:12:36.098 --> 00:12:40.667
Now, try to build a bicycle without 
knowing that pi is 3.1416.

00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:42.431
You can't.

00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:46.943
And try, any one of you, 
using 3.1416 for something.

00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:48.589
You don't know anymore.

00:12:48.589 --> 00:12:51.020
So this is lost and that's what 
we try to do there,

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.134
which is looking 
for wisdom in that school.

00:12:53.134 --> 00:12:58.694
And that brings us back to this graph
and this distribution of our life.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.751
I accumulated a lot of money 
when I think about it.

00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:05.998
When you think and you say,
now is the time to give back --

00:13:05.998 --> 00:13:08.670
well, if you're giving back, 
you took too much.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:15.722
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:13:16.822 --> 00:13:19.402
I keep thinking of Warren Buffet
waking up one day

00:13:19.402 --> 00:13:22.786
and finding out he has 30 billion dollars
more than he thought he had.

00:13:22.786 --> 00:13:25.578
And he looks and he says,
what am I going to do with this?

00:13:25.578 --> 00:13:28.415
And he says, I'll give it to someone
who really needs this.

00:13:28.415 --> 00:13:30.703
I'll give it to Bill Gates. (Laughter)

00:13:32.086 --> 00:13:35.236
And my guy, who's my financial
advisor in New York,

00:13:35.236 --> 00:13:37.129
he says, look, you're a silly guy

00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:40.402
because you would have 4.1 times 
more money today

00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:44.662
if you had made money with money
instead of sharing as you go.

00:13:44.668 --> 00:13:46.480
But I like sharing as you go better.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.786
(Applause)

00:13:49.786 --> 00:13:54.058
I taught MBAs at MIT for a time

00:13:54.058 --> 00:13:56.664
and I ended up, one day,
at the Mount Auburn Cemetery.

00:13:56.664 --> 00:13:58.608
It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge.

00:13:58.608 --> 00:14:01.650
And I was walking around.
It was my birthday and I was thinking.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.044
And the first time around, 
I saw these tombstones

00:14:04.044 --> 00:14:06.817
and these wonderful people 
who'd done great things

00:14:06.817 --> 00:14:10.699
and I thought, what do I want 
to be remembered for?

00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:12.485
And I did another stroll around,

00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:14.930
and the second time,
another question came to me,

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.233
which did me better, which was,

00:14:17.233 --> 00:14:20.120
why do I want to be remembered at all?

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.257
(Laughter)

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:25.078
And that, I think, 
took me different places.

00:14:25.078 --> 00:14:29.326
When I was 50, my wife Fernanda and I
sat for a whole afternoon,

00:14:29.326 --> 00:14:31.508
we had a big pit with fire,

00:14:31.508 --> 00:14:35.084
and I threw everything I had ever 
done into that fire.

00:14:35.084 --> 00:14:37.471
This is a book in 38 languages,

00:14:37.471 --> 00:14:41.018
hundreds and hundreds of articles
and DVDs, everything there was.

00:14:41.018 --> 00:14:42.438
And that did two things.

00:14:42.438 --> 00:14:47.363
One, it freed our five kids
from following in our steps, our shadow --

00:14:47.363 --> 00:14:49.019
They don't know what I do.

00:14:49.019 --> 00:14:50.243
(Laughter)

00:14:50.243 --> 00:14:51.552
Which is good.

00:14:51.552 --> 00:14:53.477
And I'm not going to take them somewhere

00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:55.871
and say, one day 
all of this will be yours.

00:14:55.871 --> 00:14:57.428
(Laughter)

00:14:57.428 --> 00:15:00.960
The five kids know nothing, which is good.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.641
And the second thing is,

00:15:02.641 --> 00:15:07.339
I freed myself from this anchor
of past achievement or whatever.

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:11.837
I'm free to start something new every time
and to decide things from scratch

00:15:11.837 --> 00:15:13.958
in part of those terminal days.

00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.375
And some people would say,

00:15:15.375 --> 00:15:17.913
oh, so now you have this time,
these terminal days,

00:15:17.913 --> 00:15:19.771
and so you go out and do everything.

00:15:19.771 --> 00:15:22.093
No, we've been to the beaches,

00:15:22.093 --> 00:15:24.655
so we've been to Samoa and Maldives
and Mozambique,

00:15:24.655 --> 00:15:26.421
so that's done.

00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:28.530
I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.401
I've gone down 60 meters to see 
hammerhead sharks.

00:15:32.401 --> 00:15:36.952
I've spent 59 days on the back of a camel
from Chad to Timbuktu.

00:15:36.952 --> 00:15:40.943
I've gone to the magnetic 
North Pole on a dog sled.

00:15:40.943 --> 00:15:42.719
So, we've been busy.

00:15:42.719 --> 00:15:48.722
It's what I'd like to call 
my empty bucket list.

00:15:48.722 --> 00:15:51.701
(Laughter)

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:55.258
And with this rationale,
I look at these days and I think,

00:15:55.258 --> 00:15:57.777
I'm not retired. 
I don't feel retired at all.

00:15:57.777 --> 00:15:59.918
And so I'm writing a new book.

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:03.731
We started three new companies
in the last two years.

00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:08.934
I'm now working on getting this 
school system for free out into the world,

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:12.363
and I've found, very interestingly enough,
that nobody wants it for free.

00:16:12.387 --> 00:16:14.325
And so I've been trying for 10 years

00:16:14.325 --> 00:16:17.750
to get the public system
to take over this school rationale,

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.145
much as the public schools we have,

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:24.842
which has instead of 43 out of 100,
as their rating, as their grades,

00:16:24.842 --> 00:16:27.531
has 91 out of 100.

00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:29.964
But for free, nobody wants it.

00:16:29.964 --> 00:16:33.158
So maybe we'll start charging for it 
and then it will go somewhere.

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:36.939
But getting this out is one
of the things we want to do.

00:16:36.939 --> 00:16:40.256
And I think what this leaves us
as a message for all of you,

00:16:40.256 --> 00:16:42.008
I think is a little bit like this:

00:16:42.008 --> 00:16:45.165
We've all learned
how to go on Sunday night

00:16:45.165 --> 00:16:47.582
to email and work from home.

00:16:47.582 --> 00:16:49.292
But very few of us have learned

00:16:49.292 --> 00:16:52.422
how to go to the movies
on Monday afternoon.

00:16:52.422 --> 00:16:56.523
And if we're looking for wisdom,
we need to learn to do that as well.

00:16:56.523 --> 00:17:00.173
And so, what we've done all
of these years is very simple,

00:17:00.173 --> 00:17:03.345
is use the little tool,
which is ask three whys in a row.

00:17:03.345 --> 00:17:06.106
Because the first why
you always have a good answer for.

00:17:06.106 --> 00:17:08.521
The second why,
it starts getting difficult.

00:17:08.521 --> 00:17:12.460
By the third why, you don't really know
why you're doing what you're doing.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:18.688
What I want to leave you with is the seed
and the thought that maybe if you do this,

00:17:18.688 --> 00:17:21.444
you will come to the question, what for?

00:17:21.444 --> 00:17:22.946
What am I doing this for?

00:17:22.946 --> 00:17:25.827
And hopefully, as a result of that,
and over time,

00:17:25.827 --> 00:17:28.960
I hope that with this,
and that's what I'm wishing you,

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.663
you'll have a much wiser future.

00:17:31.663 --> 00:17:33.448
Thank you very much.

00:17:33.448 --> 00:17:40.987
(Applause)

00:17:45.957 --> 00:17:51.044
Chris Anderson: So Ricardo, 
you're kind of crazy.

00:17:51.044 --> 00:17:52.869
(Laughter)

00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:56.049
To many people, this seems crazy.

00:17:56.049 --> 00:17:59.438
And yet so deeply wise, also.

00:17:59.438 --> 00:18:02.347
The pieces I'm trying
to put together are this:

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:04.442
Your ideas are so radical.

00:18:04.442 --> 00:18:09.491
How, in business, for example,
these ideas have been out for a while,

00:18:10.191 --> 00:18:13.401
probably the percentage of businesses 
that have taken some of them

00:18:13.401 --> 00:18:15.303
is still quite low.

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:18.201
Are there any times you've seen 
some big company

00:18:18.201 --> 00:18:21.830
take on one of your ideas 
and you've gone, "Yes!"?

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.627
Ricardo Semler: It happens.
It happened about two weeks ago

00:18:24.627 --> 00:18:26.837
with Richard Branson,
with his people saying,

00:18:26.837 --> 00:18:29.369
oh, I don't want to control
your holidays anymore,

00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:31.553
or Netflix does a little bit
of this and that,

00:18:31.553 --> 00:18:33.880
but I don't think it's very important.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.634
I'd like to see it happen maybe a little
bit in a bit of a missionary zeal,

00:18:37.634 --> 00:18:39.208
but that's a very personal one.

00:18:39.208 --> 00:18:43.420
But the fact is that it takes a leap 
of faith about losing control.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.716
And almost nobody who is in control
is ready to take leaps of faith.

00:18:46.716 --> 00:18:49.056
It will have to come from kids 
and other people

00:18:49.056 --> 00:18:51.298
who are starting companies 
in a different way.

00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:52.806
CA: So that's the key thing?

00:18:52.806 --> 00:18:55.005
From your point of view
the evidence is there,

00:18:55.005 --> 00:18:57.001
in the business point of view this works,

00:18:57.001 --> 00:18:59.709
but people just don't have
the courage to -- (Whoosh)

00:18:59.709 --> 00:19:01.831
RS: They don't even have the incentive.

00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:04.587
You're running a company
with a 90-day mandate.

00:19:04.587 --> 00:19:06.466
It's a quarterly report.

00:19:06.466 --> 00:19:08.684
If you're not good in 90 days, you're out.

00:19:08.684 --> 00:19:12.605
So you say, "Here's a great program that,
in less than one generation --"

00:19:12.605 --> 00:19:14.529
And the guy says, "Get out of here."

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.420
So this is the problem.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.335
(Laughter)

00:19:19.335 --> 00:19:24.651
CA: What you're trying to do in education
seems to me incredibly profound.

00:19:24.651 --> 00:19:29.149
Everyone is bothered about
their country's education system.

00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:31.922
No one thinks that
we've caught up yet to a world

00:19:31.922 --> 00:19:34.872
where there's Google and all these 
technological options.

00:19:34.872 --> 00:19:38.742
So you've got actual evidence now that 
the kids so far going through your system,

00:19:38.742 --> 00:19:41.294
there's a dramatic increase 
in performance.

00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:43.859
How do we help you move
these ideas forward?

00:19:43.859 --> 00:19:47.843
RS: I think it's that problem
of ideas whose time has come.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.252
And I've never been very evangelical
about these things.

00:19:52.252 --> 00:19:53.793
We put it out there.

00:19:53.793 --> 00:19:55.238
Suddenly, you find people --

00:19:55.238 --> 00:19:57.753
there's a group in Japan, 
which scares me very much,

00:19:57.753 --> 00:20:00.918
which is called the Semlerists,
and they have 120 companies.

00:20:00.918 --> 00:20:05.289
They've invited me.
I've always been scared to go.

00:20:05.289 --> 00:20:10.464
And there is a group in Holland
that has 600 small, Dutch companies.

00:20:10.464 --> 00:20:13.141
It's something that
will flourish on its own.

00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:15.632
Part of it will be wrong, 
and it doesn't matter.

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:17.709
This will find its own place.

00:20:17.709 --> 00:20:20.194
And I'm afraid
of the other one, which says,

00:20:20.194 --> 00:20:22.126
this is so good you've got to do this.

00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:24.792
Let's set up a system 
and put lots of money into it

00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:27.319
and then people will do it no matter what.

00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:30.563
CA: So you have asked 
extraordinary questions your whole life.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:33.396
It seems to me that's the fuel 
that's driven a lot of this.

00:20:33.396 --> 00:20:39.265
Do you have any other questions for us,
for TED, for this group here?

00:20:39.265 --> 00:20:43.854
RS: I always come back 
to variations of the question

00:20:43.854 --> 00:20:47.105
that my son asked me when he was three.

00:20:47.105 --> 00:20:51.046
We were sitting in a jacuzzi,
and he said, "Dad, why do we exist?"

00:20:51.056 --> 00:20:52.620
There is no other question.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.134
Nobody has any other question.

00:20:54.134 --> 00:20:58.123
We have variations of this one question,
from three onwards.

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:03.519
So when you spend time in a company,
in a bureaucracy, in an organization

00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:05.142
and you're saying, boy --

00:21:05.142 --> 00:21:07.859
how many people do you know
who on their death beds said,

00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:10.264
boy, I wish I had spent
more time at the office?

00:21:10.264 --> 00:21:15.314
So there's a whole thing 
of having the courage now --

00:21:15.314 --> 00:21:17.222
not in a week, not in two months,

00:21:17.222 --> 00:21:19.516
not when you find out 
you have something --

00:21:19.516 --> 00:21:22.388
to say, no, what am I doing this for?

00:21:22.388 --> 00:21:24.505
Stop everything. Let me do something else.

00:21:24.505 --> 00:21:26.070
And it will be okay,

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.341
it will be much better
than what you're doing,

00:21:28.341 --> 00:21:31.449
if you're stuck in a process.

00:21:31.449 --> 00:21:34.651
CA: So that strikes me as a profound
and quite beautiful way to end

00:21:34.651 --> 00:21:36.277
this penultimate day of TED.

00:21:36.277 --> 00:21:37.955
Ricardo Semler, thank you so much.

00:21:37.955 --> 00:21:39.532
RS: Thank you so much.

00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:41.184
(Applause)
