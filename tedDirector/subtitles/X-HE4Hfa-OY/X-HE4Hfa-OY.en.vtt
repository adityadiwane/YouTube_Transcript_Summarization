00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:18.419
Some years ago, I set out to try to understand

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.147
if there was a possibility to develop biofuels

00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:25.849
on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.533
but not compete with agriculture for water,

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.971
fertilizer or land.

00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:33.501
So here's what I came up with.

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:35.109
Imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.387
just underwater, and we fill it with wastewater

00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:40.515
and some form of microalgae that produces oil,

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:42.675
and we make it out of some kind of flexible material

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.747
that moves with waves underwater,

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:46.787
and the system that we're going to build, of course,

00:00:46.787 --> 00:00:49.107
will use solar energy to grow the algae,

00:00:49.107 --> 00:00:51.318
and they use CO2, which is good,

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.683
and they produce oxygen as they grow.

00:00:53.683 --> 00:00:57.347
The algae that grow are in a container that

00:00:57.347 --> 00:01:00.139
distributes the heat to the surrounding water,

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:02.403
and you can harvest them and make biofuels

00:01:02.403 --> 00:01:05.083
and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed,

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:07.923
and of course you'd have to make a large area of this,

00:01:07.923 --> 00:01:10.475
so you'd have to worry about other stakeholders

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:14.667
like fishermen and ships and such things, but hey,

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.930
we're talking about biofuels,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.132
and we know the importance of potentially getting

00:01:19.132 --> 00:01:21.611
an alternative liquid fuel.

00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:24.292
Why are we talking about microalgae?

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:27.979
Here you see a graph showing you the different types

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.831
of crops that are being considered for making biofuels,

00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.394
so you can see some things like soybean,

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.711
which makes 50 gallons per acre per year,

00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:41.768
or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm, and that

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:46.262
tall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute.

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:48.793
That is to say, microalgae contributes between 2,000

00:01:48.793 --> 00:01:51.585
and 5,000 gallons per acre per year,

00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:54.937
compared to the 50 gallons per acre per year from soy.

00:01:54.937 --> 00:01:58.201
So what are microalgae? Microalgae are micro --

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.649
that is, they're extremely small, as you can see here

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.617
a picture of those single-celled organisms

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:05.927
compared to a human hair.

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:08.753
Those small organisms have been around

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:10.793
for millions of years and there's thousands

00:02:10.793 --> 00:02:13.017
of different species of microalgae in the world,

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:16.041
some of which are the fastest-growing plants on the planet,

00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:19.233
and produce, as I just showed you, lots and lots of oil.

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:22.521
Now, why do we want to do this offshore?

00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:25.369
Well, the reason we're doing this offshore is because

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:29.965
if you look at our coastal cities, there isn't a choice,

00:02:29.965 --> 00:02:32.764
because we're going to use waste water, as I suggested,

00:02:32.764 --> 00:02:34.675
and if you look at where most of the waste water

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:38.244
treatment plants are, they're embedded in the cities.

00:02:38.244 --> 00:02:41.927
This is the city of San Francisco, which has 900 miles

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:44.582
of sewer pipes under the city already,

00:02:44.582 --> 00:02:48.558
and it releases its waste water offshore.

00:02:48.558 --> 00:02:52.470
So different cities around the world treat their waste water

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.838
differently. Some cities process it.

00:02:54.838 --> 00:02:56.484
Some cities just release the water.

00:02:56.484 --> 00:02:59.142
But in all cases, the water that's released is

00:02:59.142 --> 00:03:02.102
perfectly adequate for growing microalgae.

00:03:02.102 --> 00:03:03.767
So let's envision what the system might look like.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.869
We call it OMEGA, which is an acronym for

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:10.300
Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.852
At NASA, you have to have good acronyms.

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:15.695
So how does it work? I sort of showed you how it works already.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:19.415
We put waste water and some source of CO2

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:22.462
into our floating structure,

00:03:22.462 --> 00:03:26.103
and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow,

00:03:26.103 --> 00:03:28.821
and they sequester CO2 that would otherwise go off

00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:31.431
into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.

00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:33.759
They of course use solar energy to grow,

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.310
and the wave energy on the surface provides energy

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.614
for mixing the algae, and the temperature

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:41.174
is controlled by the surrounding water temperature.

00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:44.528
The algae that grow produce oxygen, as I've mentioned,

00:03:44.528 --> 00:03:47.816
and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and

00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:51.257
other bi-algal products of interest.

00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:54.674
And the system is contained. What do I mean by that?

00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:56.800
It's modular. Let's say something happens that's

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.994
totally unexpected to one of the modules.

00:03:58.994 --> 00:04:01.193
It leaks. It's struck by lightning.

00:04:01.193 --> 00:04:03.802
The waste water that leaks out is water that already now

00:04:03.802 --> 00:04:06.190
goes into that coastal environment, and

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.438
the algae that leak out are biodegradable,

00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:09.524
and because they're living in waste water,

00:04:09.524 --> 00:04:12.593
they're fresh water algae, which means they can't

00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:14.390
live in salt water, so they die.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.550
The plastic we'll build it out of is some kind of

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.182
well-known plastic that we have good experience with, and

00:04:19.182 --> 00:04:24.033
we'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again.

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:27.605
So we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about

00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:30.082
this system that I'm showing you, and that is to say

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:32.916
we need to think in terms of the water, the fresh water,

00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:35.282
which is also going to be an issue in the future,

00:04:35.282 --> 00:04:37.119
and we're working on methods now

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:39.641
for recovering the waste water.

00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:42.433
The other thing to consider is the structure itself.

00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:45.484
It provides a surface for things in the ocean,

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:48.727
and this surface, which is covered by seaweeds

00:04:48.727 --> 00:04:51.221
and other organisms in the ocean,

00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:55.208
will become enhanced marine habitat

00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:56.871
so it increases biodiversity.

00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:58.871
And finally, because it's an offshore structure,

00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:01.773
we can think in terms of how it might contribute

00:05:01.773 --> 00:05:05.527
to an aquaculture activity offshore.

00:05:05.527 --> 00:05:07.116
So you're probably thinking, "Gee, this sounds

00:05:07.116 --> 00:05:11.687
like a good idea. What can we do to try to see if it's real?"

00:05:11.687 --> 00:05:15.502
Well, I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz

00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:18.664
at the California Fish and Game facility,

00:05:18.664 --> 00:05:21.713
and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks

00:05:21.713 --> 00:05:23.436
to test some of these ideas.

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:26.058
We also set up experiments in San Francisco

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:28.889
at one of the three waste water treatment plants,

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.385
again a facility to test ideas.

00:05:31.385 --> 00:05:34.689
And finally, we wanted to see where we could look at

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:37.393
what the impact of this structure would be

00:05:37.393 --> 00:05:41.050
in the marine environment, and we set up a field site

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.513
at a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab

00:05:43.513 --> 00:05:45.873
in Monterey Bay, where we worked in a harbor

00:05:45.873 --> 00:05:50.719
to see what impact this would have on marine organisms.

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.809
The laboratory that we set up in Santa Cruz was our skunkworks.

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.707
It was a place where we were growing algae

00:05:56.707 --> 00:05:59.372
and welding plastic and building tools

00:05:59.372 --> 00:06:00.895
and making a lot of mistakes,

00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:02.826
or, as Edison said, we were

00:06:02.826 --> 00:06:06.276
finding the 10,000 ways that the system wouldn't work.

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:10.522
Now, we grew algae in waste water, and we built tools

00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:13.954
that allowed us to get into the lives of algae

00:06:13.954 --> 00:06:15.676
so that we could monitor the way they grow,

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:18.378
what makes them happy, how do we make sure that

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:22.280
we're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.369
So the most important feature that we needed to develop were these

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:28.097
so-called photobioreactors, or PBRs.

00:06:28.097 --> 00:06:29.440
These were the structures that would be floating at the

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.865
surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material

00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:35.522
that'll allow the algae to grow, and we had built lots and lots

00:06:35.522 --> 00:06:38.651
of designs, most of which were horrible failures,

00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:40.986
and when we finally got to a design that worked,

00:06:40.986 --> 00:06:43.273
at about 30 gallons, we scaled it up

00:06:43.273 --> 00:06:46.889
to 450 gallons in San Francisco.

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.083
So let me show you how the system works.

00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:52.795
We basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it,

00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:55.501
and we circulate it through this floating structure,

00:06:55.501 --> 00:06:58.233
this tubular, flexible plastic structure,

00:06:58.233 --> 00:06:59.726
and it circulates through this thing,

00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:02.438
and there's sunlight of course, it's at the surface,

00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:04.843
and the algae grow on the nutrients.

00:07:04.843 --> 00:07:07.265
But this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag.

00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:10.507
The algae are not going to suffocate because of CO2,

00:07:10.522 --> 00:07:11.361
as we would.

00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:14.020
They suffocate because they produce oxygen, and they

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.196
don't really suffocate, but the oxygen that they produce

00:07:16.196 --> 00:07:19.300
is problematic, and they use up all the CO2.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.732
So the next thing we had to figure out was how we could

00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:24.961
remove the oxygen, which we did by building this column

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:26.438
which circulated some of the water,

00:07:26.438 --> 00:07:29.808
and put back CO2, which we did by bubbling the system

00:07:29.808 --> 00:07:32.260
before we recirculated the water.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.964
And what you see here is the prototype,

00:07:33.964 --> 00:07:37.762
which was the first attempt at building this type of column.

00:07:37.762 --> 00:07:40.202
The larger column that we then installed in San Francisco

00:07:40.202 --> 00:07:41.830
in the installed system.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.228
So the column actually had another very nice feature,

00:07:45.228 --> 00:07:48.345
and that is the algae settle in the column,

00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:51.919
and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:54.886
in a context where we could easily harvest it.

00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:57.661
So we would remove the algaes that concentrated

00:07:57.661 --> 00:08:00.229
in the bottom of this column, and then we could

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:04.052
harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae

00:08:04.052 --> 00:08:07.948
to the surface and can skim it off with a net.

00:08:07.948 --> 00:08:11.585
So we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact

00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:14.516
of this system in the marine environment,

00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:17.996
and I mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site

00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:20.236
in Moss Landing Marine Lab.

00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:23.076
Well, we found of course that this material became

00:08:23.076 --> 00:08:25.988
overgrown with algae, and we needed then to develop

00:08:25.988 --> 00:08:28.396
a cleaning procedure, and we also looked at how

00:08:28.396 --> 00:08:31.333
seabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact you

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:34.356
see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting,

00:08:34.356 --> 00:08:37.460
and would periodically work its way across this little

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.348
floating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guy

00:08:40.348 --> 00:08:42.437
or train him to be able to clean the surface

00:08:42.437 --> 00:08:44.844
of these things, but that's for the future.

00:08:44.844 --> 00:08:46.165
Now really what we were doing,

00:08:46.165 --> 00:08:47.937
we were working in four areas.

00:08:47.937 --> 00:08:50.820
Our research covered the biology of the system,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.988
which included studying the way algae grew,

00:08:52.988 --> 00:08:56.637
but also what eats the algae, and what kills the algae.

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:58.816
We did engineering to understand what we would need

00:08:58.816 --> 00:09:01.109
to be able to do to build this structure,

00:09:01.109 --> 00:09:03.812
not only on the small scale, but how we would build it

00:09:03.812 --> 00:09:07.128
on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required.

00:09:07.128 --> 00:09:10.328
I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals

00:09:10.328 --> 00:09:12.857
and looked at basically the environmental impact

00:09:12.857 --> 00:09:16.008
of the system, and finally we looked at the economics,

00:09:16.008 --> 00:09:17.655
and what I mean by economics is,

00:09:17.655 --> 00:09:20.760
what is the energy required to run the system?

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.182
Do you get more energy out of the system

00:09:22.182 --> 00:09:23.763
than you have to put into the system

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:25.776
to be able to make the system run?

00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:27.522
And what about operating costs?

00:09:27.522 --> 00:09:29.580
And what about capital costs?

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.738
And what about, just, the whole economic structure?

00:09:33.738 --> 00:09:36.456
So let me tell you that it's not going to be easy,

00:09:36.456 --> 00:09:39.016
and there's lots more work to do in all four

00:09:39.016 --> 00:09:42.608
of those areas to be able to really make the system work.

00:09:42.608 --> 00:09:45.528
But we don't have a lot of time, and I'd like to show you

00:09:45.528 --> 00:09:49.030
the artist's conception of how this system might look

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.710
if we find ourselves in a protected bay

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.894
somewhere in the world, and we have in the background

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:57.662
in this image, the waste water treatment plant

00:09:57.662 --> 00:10:00.535
and a source of flue gas for the CO2,

00:10:00.535 --> 00:10:03.270
but when you do the economics of this system,

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.342
you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work.

00:10:06.342 --> 00:10:10.912
Unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water,

00:10:10.912 --> 00:10:14.640
sequester carbon, and potentially for photovoltaic panels

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.120
or wave energy or even wind energy,

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.391
and if you start thinking in terms of

00:10:19.391 --> 00:10:22.432
integrating all of these different activities,

00:10:22.432 --> 00:10:27.079
you could also include in such a facility aquaculture.

00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:30.007
So we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture

00:10:30.007 --> 00:10:32.101
where we're growing mussels or scallops.

00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:35.093
We'd be growing oysters and things

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.931
that would be producing high value products and food,

00:10:37.931 --> 00:10:40.701
and this would be a market driver as we build the system

00:10:40.701 --> 00:10:44.015
to larger and larger scales so that it becomes, ultimately,

00:10:44.015 --> 00:10:49.816
competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.513
So there's always a big question that comes up,

00:10:52.513 --> 00:10:55.857
because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation

00:10:55.857 --> 00:10:58.846
right now, and so we've been thinking cradle to cradle.

00:10:58.846 --> 00:11:01.563
What are we going to do with all this plastic that we're

00:11:01.563 --> 00:11:04.304
going to need to use in our marine environment?

00:11:04.304 --> 00:11:05.822
Well, I don't know if you know about this,

00:11:05.822 --> 00:11:08.584
but in California, there's a huge amount of plastic

00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:11.929
that's used in fields right now as plastic mulch,

00:11:11.929 --> 00:11:15.153
and this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses

00:11:15.153 --> 00:11:17.904
right along the surface of the soil, and this provides

00:11:17.904 --> 00:11:21.162
warming the soil to increase the growing season,

00:11:21.162 --> 00:11:23.705
it allows us to control weeds,

00:11:23.705 --> 00:11:27.297
and, of course, it makes the watering much more efficient.

00:11:27.297 --> 00:11:29.610
So the OMEGA system will be part

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.689
of this type of an outcome, and that when we're finished

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:35.378
using it in the marine environment, we'll be using it,

00:11:35.378 --> 00:11:37.931
hopefully, on fields.

00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:39.251
Where are we going to put this,

00:11:39.251 --> 00:11:41.762
and what will it look like offshore?

00:11:41.762 --> 00:11:44.753
Here's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay.

00:11:44.753 --> 00:11:47.433
San Francisco produces 65 million gallons a day

00:11:47.433 --> 00:11:50.193
of waste water. If we imagine a five-day retention time

00:11:50.193 --> 00:11:52.562
for this system, we'd need 325 million gallons

00:11:52.562 --> 00:11:56.588
to accomodate, and that would be about 1,280 acres

00:11:56.588 --> 00:12:00.207
of these OMEGA modules floating in San Francisco Bay.

00:12:00.207 --> 00:12:02.001
Well, that's less than one percent

00:12:02.001 --> 00:12:03.752
of the surface area of the bay.

00:12:03.752 --> 00:12:07.494
It would produce, at 2,000 gallons per acre per year,

00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:10.490
it would produce over 2 million gallons of fuel,

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.690
which is about 20 percent of the biodiesel,

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.698
or of the diesel that would be required in San Francisco,

00:12:15.698 --> 00:12:18.888
and that's without doing anything about efficiency.

00:12:18.888 --> 00:12:21.858
Where else could we potentially put this system?

00:12:21.858 --> 00:12:24.758
There's lots of possibilities.

00:12:24.758 --> 00:12:26.810
There's, of course, San Francisco Bay, as I mentioned.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.626
San Diego Bay is another example,

00:12:28.626 --> 00:12:31.539
Mobile Bay or Chesapeake Bay, but the reality is,

00:12:31.539 --> 00:12:33.631
as sea level rises, there's going to be lots and lots

00:12:33.631 --> 00:12:37.538
of new opportunities to consider. (Laughter)

00:12:37.538 --> 00:12:41.106
So what I'm telling you about is a system

00:12:41.106 --> 00:12:44.738
of integrated activities.

00:12:44.738 --> 00:12:47.348
Biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy

00:12:47.348 --> 00:12:50.150
is integrated with aquaculture.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.074
I set out to find a pathway

00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:59.720
to innovative production of sustainable biofuels,

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.968
and en route I discovered that what's really required

00:13:02.968 --> 00:13:10.245
for sustainability is integration more than innovation.

00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:13.675
Long term, I have great faith

00:13:13.675 --> 00:13:18.820
in our collective and connected ingenuity.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.136
I think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.338
if we are radically open

00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:29.068
and we don't care who gets the credit.

00:13:29.068 --> 00:13:33.284
Sustainable solutions for our future problems

00:13:33.284 --> 00:13:35.684
are going to be diverse

00:13:35.684 --> 00:13:38.149
and are going to be many.

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:40.940
I think we need to consider everything,

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.972
everything from alpha to OMEGA.

00:13:43.972 --> 00:13:46.852
Thank you. (Applause)

00:13:46.852 --> 00:13:52.202
(Applause)

00:13:52.607 --> 00:13:55.819
Chris Anderson: Just a quick question for you, Jonathan.

00:13:55.819 --> 00:13:58.027
Can this project continue to move forward within

00:13:58.027 --> 00:14:01.992
NASA or do you need some very ambitious

00:14:01.992 --> 00:14:06.068
green energy fund to come and take it by the throat?

00:14:06.068 --> 00:14:07.371
Jonathan Trent: So it's really gotten to a stage now

00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:10.385
in NASA where they would like to spin it out into something

00:14:10.385 --> 00:14:12.776
which would go offshore, and there are a lot of issues

00:14:12.776 --> 00:14:15.003
with doing it in the United States because of limited

00:14:15.003 --> 00:14:17.497
permitting issues and the time required to get permits

00:14:17.497 --> 00:14:19.011
to do things offshore.

00:14:19.011 --> 00:14:21.809
It really requires, at this point, people on the outside,

00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:24.113
and we're being radically open with this technology

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:25.825
in which we're going to launch it out there

00:14:25.825 --> 00:14:28.101
for anybody and everybody who's interested

00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:29.941
to take it on and try to make it real.

00:14:29.941 --> 00:14:32.418
CA: So that's interesting. You're not patenting it.

00:14:32.418 --> 00:14:34.093
You're publishing it.

00:14:34.093 --> 00:14:34.856
JT: Absolutely.

00:14:34.856 --> 00:14:36.747
CA: All right. Thank you so much.

00:14:36.747 --> 00:14:40.322
JT: Thank you. (Applause)
