00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.216
What does a working mother look like?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.496
If you ask the Internet,
this is what you'll be told.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.950
Never mind that this is
what you'll actually produce

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.856
if you attempt to work at a computer
with a baby on your lap.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.416
(Laughter)

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.336
But no, this isn't a working mother.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.536
You'll notice a theme in these photos.
We'll look at a lot of them.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.976
That theme is amazing natural lighting,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.136
which, as we all know,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.336
is the hallmark
of every American workplace.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.816
There are thousands of images like these.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.256
Just put the term "working mother"
into any Google image search engine,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.536
stock photo site.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.016
They're all over the Internet,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.416
they're topping
blog posts and news pieces,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.776
and I've become kind of obsessed with them
and the lie that they tell us

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.776
and the comfort that they give us,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.216
that when it comes
to new working motherhood in America,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.016
everything's fine.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.616
But it's not fine.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.056
As a country, we are sending
millions of women back to work

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.016
every year, incredibly
and kind of horrifically soon

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.696
after they give birth.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.416
That's a moral problem

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.336
but today I'm also going to tell you
why it's an economic problem.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.976
I got so annoyed and obsessed
with the unreality of these images,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.016
which look nothing like my life,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.216
that I recently decided to shoot and star
in a parody series of stock photos

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.376
that I hoped the world would start to use

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.656
just showing the really awkward reality
of going back to work

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.240
when your baby's food source
is attached to your body.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.696
I'm just going to show you two of them.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.776
(Laughter)

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.896
Nothing says "Give that girl a promotion"
like leaking breast milk

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.056
through your dress during a presentation.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.496
You'll notice that there's
no baby in this photo,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.136
because that's not how this works,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.496
not for most working mothers.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.576
Did you know, and this will ruin your day,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.776
that every time a toilet is flushed,
its contents are aerosolized

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.216
and they'll stay airborne for hours?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.976
And yet, for many new working mothers,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.256
this is the only place during the day
that they can find to make food

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.600
for their newborn babies.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.336
I put these things,
a whole dozen of them, into the world.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.976
I wanted to make a point.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.416
I didn't know what I was also doing
was opening a door,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.976
because now, total strangers
from all walks of life

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.936
write to me all the time

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.816
just to tell me what it's like
for them to go back to work

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.856
within days or weeks of having a baby.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.456
I'm going to share
10 of their stories with you today.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.856
They are totally real,
some of them are very raw,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.920
and not one of them
looks anything like this.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.136
Here's the first.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.856
"I was an active duty
service member at a federal prison.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.256
I returned to work after the maximum
allowed eight weeks for my C-section.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.336
A male coworker was annoyed
that I had been out on 'vacation,'

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.789
so he intentionally opened the door on me
while I was pumping breast milk

00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:11.856
and stood in the doorway
with inmates in the hallway."

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.176
Most of the stories that these women,
total strangers, send to me now,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.456
are not actually even about breastfeeding.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.376
A woman wrote to me to say,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.176
"I gave birth to twins and went back
to work after seven unpaid weeks.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.856
Emotionally, I was a wreck.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.216
Physically, I had a severe hemorrhage
during labor, and major tearing,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.976
so I could barely get up, sit or walk.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.856
My employer told me I wasn't allowed
to use my available vacation days

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.640
because it was budget season."

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.416
I've come to believe that we can't look
situations like these in the eye

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.256
because then we'd be horrified,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.336
and if we get horrified
then we have to do something about it.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.216
So we choose to look at,
and believe, this image.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.696
I don't really know
what's going on in this picture,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.376
because I find it weird
and slightly creepy.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.816
(Laughter)

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.056
Like, what is she doing?

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.096
But I know what it tells us.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.656
It tells us that everything's fine.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.416
This working mother, all working mothers
and all of their babies, are fine.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.416
There's nothing to see here.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.856
And anyway, women have made a choice,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.176
so none of it's even our problem.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.136
I want to break this choice thing
down into two parts.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.776
The first choice says
that women have chosen to work.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.016
So, that's not true.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.255
Today in America, women make up
47 percent of the workforce,

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:35.256
and in 40 percent of American households

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.816
a woman is the sole
or primary breadwinner.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.376
Our paid work is a part, a huge part,
of the engine of this economy,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.176
and it is essential
for the engines of our families.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.376
On a national level,
our paid work is not optional.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.336
Choice number two says that women
are choosing to have babies,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.480
so women alone should bear
the consequences of those choices.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.976
You know, that's one of those things

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.456
that when you hear it in passing,
can sound correct.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.909
I didn't make you have a baby.

00:05:03.933 --> 00:05:06.016
I certainly wasn't there
when that happened.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.056
But that stance
ignores a fundamental truth,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.976
which is that our procreation
on a national scale is not optional.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.496
The babies that women, many of them
working women, are having today,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.736
will one day fill our workforce,
protect our shores,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.576
make up our tax base.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.776
Our procreation
on a national scale is not optional.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.176
These aren't choices.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.016
We need women to work.
We need working women to have babies.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.517
So we should make
doing those things at the same time

00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:39.941
at least palatable, right?

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.656
OK, this is pop quiz time:

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.616
what percentage of working
women in America do you think

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.160
have no access to paid maternity leave?

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.640
88 percent.

00:05:53.873 --> 00:05:57.016
88 percent of working mothers
will not get one minute of paid leave

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.656
after they have a baby.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.296
So now you're thinking about unpaid leave.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.896
It exists in America.
It's called FMLA. It does not work.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.896
Because of the way it's structured,
all kinds of exceptions,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.936
half of new mothers are ineligible for it.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.294
Here's what that looks like.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.136
"We adopted our son.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.376
When I got the call, the day he was born,
I had to take off work.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.536
I had not been there long enough
to qualify for FMLA,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.296
so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.736
When I took time off
to meet my newborn son,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.960
I lost my job."

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.736
These corporate stock photos
hide another reality, another layer.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.376
Of those who do have access
to just that unpaid leave,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.576
most women can't afford
to take much of it at all.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.096
A nurse told me, "I didn't qualify
for short-term disability

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.176
because my pregnancy
was considered a preexisting condition.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.867
We used up all of our tax returns
and half of our savings

00:06:55.891 --> 00:06:57.736
during my six unpaid weeks.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.496
We just couldn't manage any longer.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.056
Physically it was hard,
but emotionally it was worse.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.056
I struggled for months
being away from my son."

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.976
So this decision
to go back to work so early,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.176
it's a rational economic decision
driven by family finances,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.456
but it's often physically horrific

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.016
because putting a human
into the world is messy.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.456
A waitress told me,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.016
"With my first baby, I was back
at work five weeks postpartum.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.096
With my second, I had to have
major surgery after giving birth,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.136
so I waited until six weeks to go back.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.240
I had third degree tears."

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.936
23 percent of new
working mothers in America

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.560
will be back on the job
within two weeks of giving birth.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.976
"I worked as a bartender and cook,
average of 75 hours a week while pregnant.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.616
I had to return to work
before my baby was a month old,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.656
working 60 hours a week.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.736
One of my coworkers was only able
to afford 10 days off with her baby."

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.936
Of course, this isn't just a scenario
with economic and physical implications.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.136
Childbirth is, and always will be,
an enormous psychological event.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.256
A teacher told me,

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.256
"I returned to work
eight weeks after my son was born.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.176
I already suffer from anxiety,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.296
but the panic attacks I had prior
to returning to work were unbearable."

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.416
Statistically speaking,

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.136
the shorter a woman's leave
after having a baby,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.376
the more likely she will be to suffer
from postpartum mood disorders

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.496
like depression and anxiety,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.536
and among many potential
consequences of those disorders,

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.696
suicide is the second
most common cause of death

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.600
in a woman's first year postpartum.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.816
Heads up that this next story --

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.416
I've never met this woman,
but I find it hard to get through.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.616
"I feel tremendous grief and rage
that I lost an essential,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.496
irreplaceable and formative
time with my son.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.936
Labor and delivery
left me feeling absolutely broken.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.616
For months, all I remember
is the screaming: colic, they said.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.776
On the inside, I was drowning.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.496
Every morning, I asked myself
how much longer I could do it.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.696
I was allowed to bring my baby to work.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.856
I closed my office door
while I rocked and shushed

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.376
and begged him to stop screaming
so I wouldn't get in trouble.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.456
I hid behind that office door
every damn day

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.416
and cried while he screamed.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.096
I cried in the bathroom
while I washed out the pump equipment.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.256
Every day, I cried all the way to work
and all the way home again.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.416
I promised my boss that the work
I didn't get done during the day,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.096
I'd make up at night from home.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.920
I thought, there's just something
wrong with me that I can't swing this."

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.136
So those are the mothers.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.936
What of the babies?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.456
As a country, do we care
about the millions of babies

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.336
born every year to working mothers?

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.696
I say we don't,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.176
not until they're of working
and tax-paying and military-serving age.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.105
We tell them we'll see them in 18 years,

00:09:54.129 --> 00:09:55.891
and getting there is kind of on them.

00:09:57.854 --> 00:10:00.616
One of the reasons I know this
is that babies whose mothers

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.936
have 12 or more weeks at home with them

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.936
are more likely to get their vaccinations
and their well checks in their first year,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.656
so those babies are more protected
from deadly and disabling diseases.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.920
But those things are hidden
behind images like this.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:23.776
America has a message for new mothers
who work and for their babies.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.576
Whatever time you get together,
you should be grateful for it,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.336
and you're an inconvenience

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.376
to the economy and to your employers.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.936
That narrative of gratitude
runs through a lot of the stories I hear.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.616
A woman told me,

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.816
"I went back at eight weeks
after my C-section

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.656
because my husband was out of work.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.416
Without me, my daughter
had failure to thrive.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.736
She wouldn't take a bottle.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.376
She started losing weight.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.216
Thankfully, my manager
was very understanding.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.776
He let my mom bring my baby,

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.096
who was on oxygen and a monitor,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.240
four times a shift so I could nurse her."

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.336
There's a little club
of countries in the world

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.216
that offer no national
paid leave to new mothers.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.696
Care to guess who they are?

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.656
The first eight make up eight million
in total population.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.176
They are Papua New Guinea,
Suriname and the tiny island nations

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:23.416
of Micronesia, Marshall Islands,
Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tonga.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.816
Number nine is
the United States of America,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.920
with 320 million people.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.656
Oh, that's it.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.256
That's the end of the list.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.896
Every other economy on the planet

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.816
has found a way to make some level
of national paid leave work

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.816
for the people doing the work
of the future of those countries,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.896
but we say,
"We couldn't possibly do that."

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.416
We say that the market
will solve this problem,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.776
and then we cheer when corporations
offer even more paid leave to the women

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.056
who are already the highest-educated
and highest-paid among us.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.896
Remember that 88 percent?

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.760
Those middle- and low-income women
are not going to participate in that.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.336
We know that there are staggering
economic, financial, physical

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.896
and emotional costs to this approach.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.936
We have decided --
decided, not an accident,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.896
to pass these costs directly
on to working mothers and their babies.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.576
We know the price tag is higher
for low-income women,

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.376
therefore disproportionately
for women of color.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.856
We pass them on anyway.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.496
All of this is to America's shame.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.416
But it's also to America's risk.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.336
Because what would happen

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.416
if all of these individual
so-called choices to have babies

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.440
started to turn into individual choices
not to have babies.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.016
One woman told me,

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.296
"New motherhood is hard.
It shouldn't be traumatic.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.576
When we talk about expanding
our family now,

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.896
we focus on how much time I would have
to care for myself and a new baby.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.216
If we were to have to do it again
the same way as with our first,

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.880
we might stick with one kid."

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.696
The birthrate needed in America
to keep the population stable

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.856
is 2.1 live births per woman.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.856
In America today, we are at 1.86.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.176
We need women to have babies,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.736
and we are actively disincentivizing
working women from doing that.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.976
What would happen to work force,
to innovation, to GDP,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.136
if one by one, the working mothers
of this country were to decide

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.520
that they can't bear
to do this thing more than once?

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.176
I'm here today with only
one idea worth spreading,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.336
and you've guessed what it is.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.056
It is long since time
for the most powerful country on Earth

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.136
to offer national paid leave

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.875
to the people doing the work
of the future of this country

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:48.776
and to the babies
who represent that future.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.936
Childbirth is a public good.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.496
This leave should be state-subsidized.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.016
It should have no exceptions
for small businesses,

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.496
length of employment or entrepreneurs.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.896
It should be able
to be shared between partners.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.896
I've talked today a lot about mothers,

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.600
but co-parents matter on so many levels.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.616
Not one more woman
should have to go back to work

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.816
while she is hobbling and bleeding.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.496
Not one more family should have
to drain their savings account

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.176
to buy a few days
of rest and recovery and bonding.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.496
Not one more fragile infant

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.456
should have to go directly
from the incubator to day care

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.176
because his parents have used up
all of their meager time

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.816
sitting in the NICU.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.698
Not one more working family
should be told that the collision

00:14:33.722 --> 00:14:38.056
of their work, their needed work
and their needed parenthood,

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.560
is their problem alone.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.416
The catch is that when this is happening
to a new family, it is consuming,

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.216
and a family with a new baby
is more financially vulnerable

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.696
than they've ever been before,

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.656
so that new mother cannot afford
to speak up on her own behalf.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.896
But all of us have voices.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.496
I am done, done having babies,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.376
and you might be pre-baby,

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.776
you might be post-baby,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.416
you might be no baby.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.296
It should not matter.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.736
We have to stop framing this
as a mother's issue,

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.456
or even a women's issue.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.040
This is an American issue.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.696
We need to stop buying the lie
that these images tell us.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.976
We need to stop being comforted by them.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.656
We need to question
why we're told that this can't work

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.976
when we see it work
everywhere all over the world.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.776
We need to recognize
that this American reality

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.416
is to our dishonor and to our peril.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.616
Because this is not,

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.256
this is not,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.760
and this is not
what a working mother looks like.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.920
(Applause)
