00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.716
Hi. So, this chap here,

00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:20.978
he thinks he can tell you the future.

00:00:20.978 --> 00:00:22.957
His name is Nostradamus, although here the Sun have

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:26.627
made him look a little bit like Sean Connery. (Laughter)

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:29.530
And like most of you, I suspect, I don't really believe

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.638
that people can see into the future.

00:00:30.638 --> 00:00:33.342
I don't believe in precognition, and every now and then,

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:36.524
you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future,

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:39.583
and that's probably because it was a fluke, and we only

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:42.198
hear about the flukes and about the freaks.

00:00:42.198 --> 00:00:46.277
We don't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong.

00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:48.437
Now we expect that to happen with silly stories

00:00:48.437 --> 00:00:51.576
about precognition, but the problem is,

00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:54.920
we have exactly the same problem in academia

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.421
and in medicine, and in this environment, it costs lives.

00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:02.786
So firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out,

00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:05.315
just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:07.151
a piece of research where he found evidence

00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:10.809
of precognitive powers in undergraduate students,

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:13.383
and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal

00:01:13.383 --> 00:01:15.664
and most of the people who read this just said, "Okay, well,

00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:17.845
fair enough, but I think that's a fluke, that's a freak, because I know

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:20.679
that if I did a study where I found no evidence

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.191
that undergraduate students had precognitive powers,

00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:26.743
it probably wouldn't get published in a journal.

00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:29.598
And in fact, we know that that's true, because

00:01:29.598 --> 00:01:32.127
several different groups of research scientists tried

00:01:32.127 --> 00:01:35.647
to replicate the findings of this precognition study,

00:01:35.647 --> 00:01:38.282
and when they submitted it to the exact same journal,

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:41.434
the journal said, "No, we're not interested in publishing

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:45.959
replication. We're not interested in your negative data."

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.713
So this is already evidence of how, in the academic

00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:53.583
literature, we will see a biased sample of the true picture

00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:57.050
of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.479
But it doesn't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.846
It also happens in, for example, cancer research.

00:02:05.846 --> 00:02:09.923
So in March, 2012, just one month ago, some researchers

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:12.819
reported in the journal Nature how they had tried

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.665
to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at

00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:20.220
potential treatment targets in cancer,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.858
and out of those 53 studies, they were only able

00:02:22.858 --> 00:02:25.934
to successfully replicate six.

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:30.267
Forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable.

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:34.180
And they say in their discussion that this is very likely

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.819
because freaks get published.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.915
People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies,

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:41.035
and the occasions when it works they will publish,

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:42.714
and the ones where it doesn't work they won't.

00:02:42.714 --> 00:02:46.655
And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem,

00:02:46.655 --> 00:02:49.944
because it is a problem, because it sends us all down blind alleys,

00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:51.650
their first recommendation of how to fix this problem

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.043
is to make it easier to publish negative results in science,

00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:57.950
and to change the incentives so that scientists are

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.302
encouraged to post more of their negative results in public.

00:03:02.302 --> 00:03:06.154
But it doesn't just happen in the very dry world

00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:10.005
of preclinical basic science cancer research.

00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:13.662
It also happens in the very real, flesh and blood

00:03:13.662 --> 00:03:17.253
of academic medicine. So in 1980,

00:03:17.253 --> 00:03:20.261
some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide,

00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.592
and this was an anti-arrhythmic drug,

00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:24.843
a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms,

00:03:24.858 --> 00:03:27.086
and the idea was, after people have had a heart attack,

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:28.623
they're quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms,

00:03:28.623 --> 00:03:31.000
so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.713
rhythms, this will increase the chances of them surviving.

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:37.721
Early on its development, they did a very small trial,

00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:39.365
just under a hundred patients.

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:43.017
Fifty patients got lorcainide, and of those patients, 10 died.

00:03:43.017 --> 00:03:46.060
Another 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.018
with no active ingredient, and only one of them died.

00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:51.667
So they rightly regarded this drug as a failure,

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:54.536
and its commercial development was stopped, and because

00:03:54.536 --> 00:03:58.884
its commercial development was stopped, this trial was never published.

00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:04.281
Unfortunately, over the course of the next five, 10 years,

00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:08.106
other companies had the same idea about drugs that would

00:04:08.106 --> 00:04:10.698
prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks.

00:04:10.698 --> 00:04:12.418
These drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.830
very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.673
and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs

00:04:19.673 --> 00:04:22.584
also caused an increased rate of death

00:04:22.584 --> 00:04:25.331
that before we detected that safety signal,

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:31.382
over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America

00:04:31.382 --> 00:04:34.833
from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs.

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:38.431
Now actually, in 1993,

00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:41.991
the researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study,

00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:45.832
published a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community,

00:04:45.832 --> 00:04:48.957
in which they said, "When we carried out our study in 1980,

00:04:48.957 --> 00:04:50.893
we thought that the increased death rate that occurred

00:04:50.893 --> 00:04:54.251
in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance."

00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:56.283
The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons,

00:04:56.283 --> 00:04:57.921
and this study was never published;

00:04:57.921 --> 00:05:00.307
it's now a good example of publication bias.

00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:02.198
That's the technical term for the phenomenon where

00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:06.436
unflattering data gets lost, gets unpublished, is left

00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:09.807
missing in action, and they say the results described here

00:05:09.807 --> 00:05:14.615
"might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead."

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:17.828
Now these are stories from basic science.

00:05:17.828 --> 00:05:22.615
These are stories from 20, 30 years ago.

00:05:22.615 --> 00:05:25.762
The academic publishing environment is very different now.

00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:29.757
There are academic journals like "Trials," the open access journal,

00:05:29.757 --> 00:05:32.412
which will publish any trial conducted in humans

00:05:32.412 --> 00:05:35.715
regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result.

00:05:35.715 --> 00:05:39.684
But this problem of negative results that go missing in action

00:05:39.684 --> 00:05:43.243
is still very prevalent. In fact it's so prevalent

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:49.094
that it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine.

00:05:49.094 --> 00:05:52.109
So this is a drug called reboxetine, and this is a drug

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:54.644
that I myself have prescribed. It's an antidepressant.

00:05:54.644 --> 00:05:57.180
And I'm a very nerdy doctor, so I read all of the studies

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.232
that I could on this drug. I read the one study that was published

00:06:00.232 --> 00:06:03.179
that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo,

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:05.043
and I read the other three studies that were published

00:06:05.043 --> 00:06:08.614
that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant,

00:06:08.614 --> 00:06:10.801
and because this patient hadn't done well on those other antidepressants,

00:06:10.801 --> 00:06:13.267
I thought, well, reboxetine is just as good. It's one to try.

00:06:13.267 --> 00:06:16.659
But it turned out that I was misled. In fact,

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.108
seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine

00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:21.820
against a dummy placebo sugar pill. One of them

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.132
was positive and that was published, but six of them

00:06:24.132 --> 00:06:28.180
were negative and they were left unpublished.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.919
Three trials were published comparing reboxetine

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.145
against other antidepressants in which reboxetine

00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:33.938
was just as good, and they were published,

00:06:33.938 --> 00:06:38.327
but three times as many patients' worth of data was collected

00:06:38.327 --> 00:06:40.198
which showed that reboxetine was worse than

00:06:40.198 --> 00:06:44.899
those other treatments, and those trials were not published.

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:48.658
I felt misled.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.788
Now you might say, well, that's an extremely unusual example,

00:06:50.788 --> 00:06:52.796
and I wouldn't want to be guilty of the same kind of

00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:55.777
cherry-picking and selective referencing

00:06:55.777 --> 00:06:57.568
that I'm accusing other people of.

00:06:57.568 --> 00:06:59.452
But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:01.579
has actually been very, very well studied.

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:03.797
So here is one example of how you approach it.

00:07:03.797 --> 00:07:06.237
The classic model is, you get a bunch of studies where

00:07:06.237 --> 00:07:08.422
you know that they've been conducted and completed,

00:07:08.422 --> 00:07:10.743
and then you go and see if they've been published anywhere

00:07:10.743 --> 00:07:13.606
in the academic literature. So this took all of the trials

00:07:13.606 --> 00:07:15.760
that had ever been conducted on antidepressants

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.402
that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA.

00:07:19.402 --> 00:07:23.158
They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package.

00:07:23.158 --> 00:07:26.358
So that's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs,

00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:28.456
because we can never know if we have those,

00:07:28.456 --> 00:07:31.950
but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.299
And then they went to see if these trials had been published

00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:36.871
in the peer-reviewed academic literature. And this is what they found.

00:07:36.871 --> 00:07:40.040
It was pretty much a 50-50 split. Half of these trials

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.637
were positive, half of them were negative, in reality.

00:07:43.637 --> 00:07:48.378
But when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature,

00:07:48.378 --> 00:07:50.612
what they found was a very different picture.

00:07:50.612 --> 00:07:54.984
Only three of the negative trials were published,

00:07:54.984 --> 00:07:59.626
but all but one of the positive trials were published.

00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:03.387
Now if we just flick back and forth between those two,

00:08:03.387 --> 00:08:05.981
you can see what a staggering difference there was

00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:09.431
between reality and what doctors, patients,

00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:12.053
commissioners of health services, and academics

00:08:12.053 --> 00:08:15.334
were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature.

00:08:15.334 --> 00:08:19.788
We were misled, and this is a systematic flaw

00:08:19.788 --> 00:08:23.118
in the core of medicine.

00:08:23.118 --> 00:08:25.781
In fact, there have been so many studies conducted on

00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:29.165
publication bias now, over a hundred, that they've been

00:08:29.165 --> 00:08:32.359
collected in a systematic review, published in 2010,

00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:35.125
that took every single study on publication bias

00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:36.424
that they could find.

00:08:36.424 --> 00:08:39.276
Publication bias affects every field of medicine.

00:08:39.276 --> 00:08:43.589
About half of all trials, on average, go missing in action,

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:46.647
and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely

00:08:46.647 --> 00:08:49.701
to be published as negative findings.

00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:53.762
This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine.

00:08:53.762 --> 00:08:57.633
If I flipped a coin 100 times but then

00:08:57.633 --> 00:09:00.892
withheld the results from you from half of those tosses,

00:09:00.892 --> 00:09:04.292
I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads.

00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:06.098
But that wouldn't mean that I had a two-headed coin.

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:07.825
That would mean that I was a chancer

00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:10.939
and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it. (Laughter)

00:09:10.939 --> 00:09:14.576
But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:18.365
in the whole of evidence-based medicine.

00:09:18.365 --> 00:09:22.797
And to me, this is research misconduct.

00:09:22.797 --> 00:09:25.540
If I conducted one study and I withheld

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.540
half of the data points from that one study,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.247
you would rightly accuse me, essentially, of research fraud.

00:09:33.247 --> 00:09:36.030
And yet, for some reason, if somebody conducts

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.588
10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want,

00:09:40.588 --> 00:09:43.376
we don't consider that to be research misconduct.

00:09:43.376 --> 00:09:45.943
And when that responsibility is diffused between

00:09:45.943 --> 00:09:49.104
a whole network of researchers, academics,

00:09:49.104 --> 00:09:52.632
industry sponsors, journal editors, for some reason

00:09:52.632 --> 00:09:54.085
we find it more acceptable,

00:09:54.085 --> 00:09:57.760
but the effect on patients is damning.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.778
And this is happening right now, today.

00:10:02.778 --> 00:10:05.489
This is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug

00:10:05.489 --> 00:10:08.085
which governments around the world have spent billions

00:10:08.085 --> 00:10:10.657
and billions of dollars on stockpiling,

00:10:10.657 --> 00:10:13.805
and we've stockpiled Tamiflu in panic,

00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:17.754
in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza.

00:10:17.754 --> 00:10:20.438
Complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia

00:10:20.438 --> 00:10:25.252
and death. (Laughter)

00:10:25.252 --> 00:10:28.460
Now when the Cochrane systematic reviewers

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.985
were trying to collect together all of the data from all

00:10:30.985 --> 00:10:34.633
of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not,

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:37.584
they found that several of those trials were unpublished.

00:10:37.584 --> 00:10:39.426
The results were unavailable to them.

00:10:39.426 --> 00:10:43.390
And when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.072
through Freedom of Information Act requests, through

00:10:45.072 --> 00:10:49.881
harassing various different organizations, what they found was inconsistent.

00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:52.347
And when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports,

00:10:52.347 --> 00:10:55.393
the 10,000-page long documents that have

00:10:55.393 --> 00:10:58.993
the best possible rendition of the information,

00:10:58.993 --> 00:11:01.881
they were told they weren't allowed to have them.

00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:04.564
And if you want to read the full correspondence

00:11:04.564 --> 00:11:07.854
and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company,

00:11:07.854 --> 00:11:10.571
you can see that written up in this week's edition

00:11:10.571 --> 00:11:14.938
of PLOS Medicine.

00:11:14.938 --> 00:11:18.797
And the most staggering thing of all of this, to me,

00:11:18.797 --> 00:11:22.096
is that not only is this a problem, not only do we recognize

00:11:22.096 --> 00:11:26.291
that this is a problem, but we've had to suffer fake fixes.

00:11:26.291 --> 00:11:29.349
We've had people pretend that this is a problem that's been fixed.

00:11:29.349 --> 00:11:31.537
First of all, we had trials registers, and everybody said,

00:11:31.537 --> 00:11:35.140
oh, it's okay. We'll get everyone to register their trials, they'll post the protocol,

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.164
they'll say what they're going to do before they do it,

00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:39.285
and then afterwards we'll be able to check and see if all the trials which

00:11:39.285 --> 00:11:41.753
have been conducted and completed have been published.

00:11:41.753 --> 00:11:43.949
But people didn't bother to use those registers.

00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:46.568
And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along,

00:11:46.568 --> 00:11:48.111
and they said, oh, well, we will hold the line.

00:11:48.111 --> 00:11:50.744
We won't publish any journals, we won't publish any trials,

00:11:50.744 --> 00:11:53.426
unless they've been registered before they began.

00:11:53.426 --> 00:11:56.957
But they didn't hold the line. In 2008, a study was conducted

00:11:56.957 --> 00:11:59.972
which showed that half of all of trials published by journals

00:11:59.972 --> 00:12:02.639
edited by members of the ICMJE

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:07.452
weren't properly registered, and a quarter of them weren't registered at all.

00:12:07.452 --> 00:12:10.253
And then finally, the FDA Amendment Act was passed

00:12:10.253 --> 00:12:12.602
a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts

00:12:12.602 --> 00:12:16.045
a trial must post the results of that trial within one year.

00:12:16.045 --> 00:12:20.141
And in the BMJ, in the first edition of January, 2012,

00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:22.845
you can see a study which looks to see if people kept

00:12:22.845 --> 00:12:26.564
to that ruling, and it turns out that only one in five

00:12:26.564 --> 00:12:29.428
have done so.

00:12:29.428 --> 00:12:32.711
This is a disaster.

00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:36.275
We cannot know the true effects of the medicines

00:12:36.275 --> 00:12:39.491
that we prescribe if we do not have access

00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:42.671
to all of the information.

00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:46.630
And this is not a difficult problem to fix.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:51.758
We need to force people to publish all trials

00:12:51.758 --> 00:12:54.729
conducted in humans, including the older trials,

00:12:54.729 --> 00:12:58.674
because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008,

00:12:58.674 --> 00:13:01.287
and I don't know what world it is in which we're only

00:13:01.287 --> 00:13:05.743
practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years.

00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:07.848
We need to publish all trials in humans,

00:13:07.848 --> 00:13:10.922
including the older trials, for all drugs in current use,

00:13:10.922 --> 00:13:13.838
and you need to tell everyone you know

00:13:13.838 --> 00:13:17.280
that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.231
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:23.504
(Applause)
