00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I'd like to start with a short story.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
It's about a little boy

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.260
whose father was a history buff

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and who used to take him by the hand

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.260
to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
on the outskirts of their camp.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
They would always stop by to visit

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
these huge winged bulls that used to guard

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
the gates of that ancient metropolis,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
and the boy used to be scared

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
of these winged bulls,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
but at the same time they excited him.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And the dad used to use those bulls

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
to tell the boy stories about

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
that civilization and their work.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Let's fast-forward to the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
San Francisco Bay Area many decades later,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
where I started a technology company

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
that brought the world its first

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
3D laser scanning system.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Let me show you how it works.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Female Voice: Long range laser scanning

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
by sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
The system measures the beam's time of flight,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
recording the time it takes for the light

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
to hit a surface and make its return.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
With two mirrors, the scanner calculates

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
the beam's horizontal and vertical angles,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
giving accurate x, y, and z coordinates.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
The point is then recorded

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.260
into a 3D visualization program.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
All of this happens in seconds.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Ben Kacyra: You can see here,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
these systems are extremely fast.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
They collect millions of points at a time

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
with very high accuracy

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and very high resolution.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
A surveyor with traditional survey tools

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
would be hard-pressed to produce

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
maybe 500 points in a whole day.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
These babies would be producing

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
something like ten thousand points a second.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
So, as you can imagine,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
this was a paradigm shift

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
in the survey and construction

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
as well as in reality capture industry.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Approximately ten years ago,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
my wife and I started a foundation to do good,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and right about that time,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
were blown up by the Taliban.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
They were gone in an instant.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And unfortunately, there was

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
no detailed documentation of these Buddhas.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
This clearly devastated me,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and I couldn't help but wonder about

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
the fate of my old friends, the winged bulls,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and the fate of the many, many

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
heritage sites all over the world.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Both my wife and I

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
were so touched by this

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
that we decided to

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
expand the mission of our foundation

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.260
to include digital heritage preservation

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
of world sites.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
We called the project CyArk,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
which stands for Cyber Archive.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
To date, with the help of

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
a global network of partners,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
we've completed close to fifty projects.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Let me show you some of them:

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Chichen Itza,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Rapa Nui --

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and what you're seeing here

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
are the cloud of points --

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Babylon,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Rosslyn Chapel,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Pompeii,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and our latest project, Mt. Rushmore,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
which happened to be one of

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
our most challenging projects.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
As you see here, we had to develop

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
a special rig to bring the scanner

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
up close and personal.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
The results of our work in the field

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
are used to produce

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
media and deliverables to be used

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
by conservators and researchers.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.260
We also produce media for

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
dissemination to the public --

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
free through the CyArk website.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
These would be used for education,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
cultural tourism, etc.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
What you're looking at in here

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
is a 3D viewer that we developed

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
that would allow the display

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and manipulation of [the] cloud of points

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
in real time, cutting sections through them

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
and extracting dimensions.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
This happens to be the cloud of points

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.260
for Tikal.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
In here you see a traditional 2D

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
architectural engineering drawing

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
that's used for preservation, and of course

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
we tell the stories through fly-throughs.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And here, this is a fly-through

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
the cloud of points of Tikal,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
and here you see it rendered

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and photo-textured with the photography

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
that we take of the site.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And so this is not a video.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
This is actual 3D points with

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
two to three millimeter accuracy.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And of course the data can be used

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
to develop 3D models that are

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
very accurate and very detailed.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And here you're looking at a model

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
that's extracted from the cloud of points

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
for Stirling Castle.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
It's used for studies, for visualization,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
as well as for education.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
And finally, we produce mobile apps

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
that include narrated virtual tools.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
The more I got involved

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
in the heritage field,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
the more it became clear to me

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
that we are losing the sites

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
and the stories faster than we can

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
physically preserve them.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Of course, earthquakes

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
and all the natural phenomena --

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
floods, tornadoes, etc. --

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
take their toll.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
However, what occurred to me was

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
human-caused destruction, which was

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
not only causing a significant portion

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
of the destruction, but actually

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
it was accelerating.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
This includes arson,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
urban sprawl,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
acid rain, not to mention

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
terrorism and wars.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
It was getting more and more apparent

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
that we're fighting a losing battle.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
We're losing our sites

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and the stories,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and basically we're losing

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
a piece -- and a significant piece --

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
of our collective memory.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Imagine us as a human race

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.260
not knowing where we came from.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Luckily, in the last two or three decades,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
digital technologies have been developing

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
that have helped us to develop tools

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
that we've brought to bear

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
in the digital preservation,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
in our digital preservation war.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
This includes, for example,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.260
the 3D laser scanning systems,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
ever more powerful personal computers,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
3D graphics,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
high-definition digital photography,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
not to mention the Internet.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
Because of this accelerated

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
pace of destruction,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
it became clear to us that we needed

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
to challenge ourselves and our partners

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
to accelerate our work.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And we created a project

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
we call the CyArk 500 Challenge --

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and that is to digitally preserve

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
500 World Heritage Sites

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
in five years.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
We do have the technology

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
that's scaleable,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.260
and our network of global partners

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
has been expanding and can be expanded

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
at a rapid rate,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
so we're comfortable

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
that this task can be accomplished.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
However, to me, the 500 is

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.260
really just the first 500.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.260
In order to sustain our work into the future,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
we use technology centers

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
where we partner with

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
local universities and colleges

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
to take the technology to them,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
whereby they then can help us

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
with digital preservation of their heritage sites,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and at the same time, it gives them

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.260
the technology to benefit from in the future.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.260
Let me close with another short story.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Two years ago, we were approached

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
by a partner of ours to digitally preserve

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
an important heritage site,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
the Royal Kasubi Tombs.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
The work was done successfully in the field,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and the data was archived

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
and publicly disseminated

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
through the CyArk website.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Last March,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
we received very sad news.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
The Royal Tombs had been destroyed

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
by suspected arson.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
A few days later, we received a call:

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
"Is the data available

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.260
and can it be used for reconstruction?"

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Our answer, of course, was yes.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
Let me leave you with a final thought.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Our heritage is much more than

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
our collective memory --

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
it's our collective treasure.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
We owe it to our children,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
our grandchildren and the generations

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
we will never meet

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
to keep it safe

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and to pass it along.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Thank you.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
(Applause)

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Thank you.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
Thank you.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Thank you.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Well, I'm staying here because

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
we wanted to demonstrate to you

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
the power of this technology

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
and so, while I've been speaking,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
you have been scanned.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
(Laughter)

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
The two wizards that I have

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
that are behind the curtain

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
will help me bring

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:42.260
the results on the screen.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:52.260
(Applause)

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
This is all in 3D and of course

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
you can fly through the cloud of points.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
You can look at it from on top,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
from the ceiling.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
You can look from different vantage points,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
but I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
on an individual in the crowd,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
just to show the amount of detail

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
that we can create.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
So you have been digitally preserved

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
in about four minutes.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
(Laughter)

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.260
I'd like to thank the wizards here.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
We were very lucky to have

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.260
two of our partners participate in this:

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
the Historic Scotland,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
and the Glasgow School of Art.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.260
I'd like to also thank personally

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.260
the efforts of David Mitchell,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
who is the Director of Conservation

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
at Historic Scotland.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
David.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
(Applause)

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
And Doug Pritchard, who's the Head of

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
Let's give them a hand.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
(Applause)

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
Thank you.
