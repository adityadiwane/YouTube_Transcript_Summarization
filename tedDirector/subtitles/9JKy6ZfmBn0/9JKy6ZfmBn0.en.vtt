00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:20.581
Before March, 2011, I was a photographic retoucher

00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:23.528
based in New York City.

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:25.584
We're pale, gray creatures.

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:27.644
We hide in dark, windowless rooms,

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:29.972
and generally avoid sunlight.

00:00:29.972 --> 00:00:34.236
We make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect,

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:36.216
and the impossible possible,

00:00:36.216 --> 00:00:40.266
and we get criticized in the press all the time,

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:43.767
but some of us are actually talented artists

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.847
with years of experience

00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:49.751
and a real appreciation for images and photography.

00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:54.915
On March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest

00:00:54.915 --> 00:00:58.751
of the world did, as the tragic events unfolded in Japan.

00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:00.924
Soon after, an organization I volunteer with,

00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:04.766
All Hands Volunteers, were on the ground, within days,

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.598
working as part of the response efforts.

00:01:07.598 --> 00:01:09.894
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers,

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:11.558
knew we couldn't just sit at home,

00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:15.282
so I decided to join them for three weeks.

00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:18.927
On May the 13th, I made my way to the town of ÅŒfunato.

00:01:18.927 --> 00:01:22.607
It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture,

00:01:22.607 --> 00:01:25.014
about 50,000 people,

00:01:25.014 --> 00:01:27.819
one of the first that was hit by the wave.

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.630
The waters here have been recorded at reaching

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.332
over 24 meters in height,

00:01:33.332 --> 00:01:35.041
and traveled over two miles inland.

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:38.583
As you can imagine, the town had been devastated.

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:41.114
We pulled debris from canals and ditches.

00:01:41.114 --> 00:01:44.545
We cleaned schools. We de-mudded and gutted homes

00:01:44.545 --> 00:01:47.043
ready for renovation and rehabilitation.

00:01:47.043 --> 00:01:51.495
We cleared tons and tons of stinking, rotting fish carcasses

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:53.714
from the local fish processing plant.

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:57.123
We got dirty, and we loved it.

00:01:57.123 --> 00:02:00.240
For weeks, all the volunteers and locals alike

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.480
had been finding similar things.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.426
They'd been finding photos and photo albums

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:08.059
and cameras and SD cards.

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:09.275
And everyone was doing the same.

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:11.940
They were collecting them up, and handing them in to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.113
various places around the different towns for safekeeping.

00:02:15.113 --> 00:02:18.229
Now, it wasn't until this point that I realized

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:20.659
that these photos were such a huge part

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.659
of the personal loss these people had felt.

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.453
As they had run from the wave, and for their lives,

00:02:26.453 --> 00:02:28.973
absolutely everything they had,

00:02:28.973 --> 00:02:31.797
everything had to be left behind.

00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:34.082
At the end of my first week there, I found myself

00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:37.276
helping out in an evacuation center in the town.

00:02:37.276 --> 00:02:40.611
I was helping clean the onsen, the communal onsen,

00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:42.917
the huge giant bathtubs.

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:45.354
This happened to also be a place in the town where

00:02:45.354 --> 00:02:48.358
the evacuation center was collecting the photos.

00:02:48.358 --> 00:02:50.283
This is where people were handing them in,

00:02:50.283 --> 00:02:52.791
and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me

00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:55.435
to help them start hand-cleaning them.

00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:58.484
Now, it was emotional and it was inspiring,

00:02:58.484 --> 00:03:02.242
and I've always heard about thinking outside the box,

00:03:02.242 --> 00:03:05.653
but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:08.080
that something happened.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.133
As I looked through the photos, there were some

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:11.899
were over a hundred years old,

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:15.483
some still in the envelope from the processing lab,

00:03:15.483 --> 00:03:17.373
I couldn't help but think as a retoucher

00:03:17.373 --> 00:03:20.198
that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch,

00:03:20.198 --> 00:03:24.235
and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.

00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:26.622
So that evening, I just reached out on Facebook

00:03:26.622 --> 00:03:28.816
and asked a few of them, and by morning

00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:32.295
the response had been so overwhelming and so positive,

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.160
I knew we had to give it a go.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.014
So we started retouching photos.

00:03:37.014 --> 00:03:39.807
This was the very first.

00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:44.414
Not terribly damaged, but where the water had caused

00:03:44.414 --> 00:03:46.600
that discoloration on the girl's face

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.203
had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy.

00:03:50.203 --> 00:03:52.498
Otherwise, that little girl isn't going to look

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.198
like that little girl anymore, and surely that's as tragic

00:03:55.198 --> 00:03:58.742
as having the photo damaged.

00:03:58.742 --> 00:04:05.070
(Applause)

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.283
Over time, more photos came in, thankfully,

00:04:08.283 --> 00:04:11.757
and more retouchers were needed,

00:04:11.757 --> 00:04:14.695
and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn,

00:04:14.695 --> 00:04:17.778
and within five days, 80 people wanted to help

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:19.747
from 12 different countries.

00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:22.116
Within two weeks, I had 150 people

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:23.987
wanting to join in.

00:04:23.987 --> 00:04:26.363
Within Japan, by July, we'd branched out

00:04:26.363 --> 00:04:28.975
to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata,

00:04:28.975 --> 00:04:31.369
further north to a town called Yamada.

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:34.637
Once a week, we would set up our scanning equipment

00:04:34.637 --> 00:04:37.145
in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up,

00:04:37.145 --> 00:04:39.518
where people were reclaiming their photos.

00:04:39.518 --> 00:04:43.350
The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before,

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.224
but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo,

00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:49.133
they could give it to us, have it scanned,

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:51.147
uploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded

00:04:51.147 --> 00:04:53.780
by a gaijin, a stranger,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.883
somewhere on the other side of the globe,

00:04:55.883 --> 00:04:58.247
and it'd start being fixed.

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:01.385
The time it took, however, to get it back

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:03.432
is a completely different story,

00:05:03.432 --> 00:05:06.020
and it depended obviously on the damage involved.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.753
It could take an hour. It could take weeks.

00:05:07.753 --> 00:05:09.857
It could take months.

00:05:09.857 --> 00:05:13.974
The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn,

00:05:13.974 --> 00:05:17.676
or pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:20.106
and detail that the water hadn't damaged.

00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:22.851
It was very time-consuming.

00:05:22.851 --> 00:05:25.472
Now, all these photos had been damaged by water,

00:05:25.472 --> 00:05:28.803
submerged in salt water, covered in bacteria,

00:05:28.803 --> 00:05:32.244
in sewage, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time

00:05:32.244 --> 00:05:34.188
is going to continue to damage them,

00:05:34.188 --> 00:05:37.304
so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project.

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:40.274
We couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned,

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:43.290
dry and reclaimed.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.742
Now, we were lucky with our hand-cleaning.

00:05:45.742 --> 00:05:48.979
We had an amazing local woman who guided us.

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.172
It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos.

00:05:53.172 --> 00:05:54.957
As my team leader Wynne once said,

00:05:54.957 --> 00:05:56.903
it's like doing a tattoo on someone.

00:05:56.903 --> 00:06:00.434
You don't get a chance to mess it up.

00:06:00.434 --> 00:06:03.417
The lady who brought us these photos was lucky,

00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:05.647
as far as the photos go.

00:06:05.647 --> 00:06:08.029
She had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.448
when she realized she was doing more damage.

00:06:10.448 --> 00:06:12.699
She also had duplicates.

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.792
Areas like her husband and her face, which otherwise

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.896
would have been completely impossible to fix,

00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:20.754
we could just put them together in one good photo,

00:06:20.754 --> 00:06:23.206
and remake the whole photo.

00:06:23.206 --> 00:06:25.884
When she collected the photos from us,

00:06:25.884 --> 00:06:28.247
she shared a bit of her story with us.

00:06:28.247 --> 00:06:31.207
Her photos were found by her husband's colleagues

00:06:31.207 --> 00:06:33.197
at a local fire department in the debris

00:06:33.197 --> 00:06:36.313
a long way from where the home had once stood,

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.488
and they'd recognized him.

00:06:38.488 --> 00:06:40.769
The day of the tsunami, he'd actually been in charge

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:43.296
of making sure the tsunami gates were closed.

00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:46.424
He had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded.

00:06:46.424 --> 00:06:49.866
Her two little boys, not so little anymore, but her two boys

00:06:49.866 --> 00:06:52.056
were both at school, separate schools.

00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:54.624
One of them got caught up in the water.

00:06:54.624 --> 00:06:56.571
It took her a week to find them all again

00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:58.968
and find out that they had all survived.

00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:01.898
The day I gave her the photos also happened to be

00:07:01.898 --> 00:07:05.841
her youngest son's 14th birthday.

00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:09.514
For her, despite all of this, those photos

00:07:09.514 --> 00:07:12.225
were the perfect gift back to him,

00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:15.321
something he could look at again, something he remembered from before

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.588
that wasn't still scarred from that day in March

00:07:19.588 --> 00:07:22.403
when absolutely everything else in his life had changed

00:07:22.403 --> 00:07:26.552
or been destroyed.

00:07:26.552 --> 00:07:28.409
After six months in Japan,

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:31.559
1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands,

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:33.809
hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean

00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:37.049
over 135,000 photographs,

00:07:37.049 --> 00:07:42.753
the large majority â€” (Applause) â€”

00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:45.983
a large majority of which did actually find their home again,

00:07:45.983 --> 00:07:48.738
importantly.

00:07:48.738 --> 00:07:51.911
Over five hundred volunteers around the globe

00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:56.569
helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back,

00:07:56.569 --> 00:07:58.819
fully restored and retouched.

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:01.272
During this time, we hadn't really spent more than

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:04.118
about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials,

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:07.448
most of which was printer inks.

00:08:07.448 --> 00:08:10.335
We take photos constantly.

00:08:10.335 --> 00:08:12.904
A photo is a reminder of someone or something,

00:08:12.904 --> 00:08:15.762
a place, a relationship, a loved one.

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:18.271
They're our memory-keepers and our histories,

00:08:18.271 --> 00:08:20.983
the last thing we would grab

00:08:20.983 --> 00:08:23.491
and the first thing you'd go back to look for.

00:08:23.491 --> 00:08:25.595
That's all this project was about,

00:08:25.595 --> 00:08:29.026
about restoring those little bits of humanity,

00:08:29.026 --> 00:08:31.138
giving someone that connection back.

00:08:31.138 --> 00:08:36.831
When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this,

00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:38.915
it makes a huge difference

00:08:38.915 --> 00:08:41.700
in the lives of the person receiving it.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.503
The project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers.

00:08:45.503 --> 00:08:48.574
For some of them, it's given them a connection

00:08:48.574 --> 00:08:51.106
to something bigger, giving something back,

00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:52.985
using their talents on something

00:08:52.985 --> 00:08:56.405
other than skinny models and perfect skin.

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:59.018
I would like to conclude by reading an email

00:08:59.018 --> 00:09:01.448
I got from one of them, Cindy,

00:09:01.448 --> 00:09:06.050
the day I finally got back from Japan after six months.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.805
"As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the individuals

00:09:09.805 --> 00:09:12.954
and the stories represented in the images.

00:09:12.954 --> 00:09:16.441
One in particular, a photo of women of all ages,

00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:20.817
from grandmother to little girl, gathered around a baby,

00:09:20.817 --> 00:09:24.339
struck a chord, because a similar photo from my family,

00:09:24.339 --> 00:09:26.791
my grandmother and mother, myself,

00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:30.200
and newborn daughter, hangs on our wall.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.354
Across the globe, throughout the ages,

00:09:33.354 --> 00:09:37.243
our basic needs are just the same, aren't they?"

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.560
Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.026
(Applause)
