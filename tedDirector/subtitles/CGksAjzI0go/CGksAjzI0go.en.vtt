00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.330
It's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.330
when the finance, the credit, which drives our economies froze.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
A massive cardiac arrest.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.330
The effect, the payback, perhaps, for years of vampire predators like Bernie Madoff,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
whom we saw earlier.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
Abuse of steroids, binging and so on.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
And it's only a few months since governments

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.330
injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
And we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.330
where no one quite knows what's worked, or what doesn't.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.330
We don't have any very clear maps, any compass to guide us.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
We don't know which experts to believe anymore.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
What I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.330
to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
what things we should be looking out for

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
and how we can actually use the crisis.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
There's a definition of leadership which says,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.330
"It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
for the biggest possible effect."

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
And I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.330
which is by no means small, really is used to the full.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
I want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
I've got a very confused background

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.330
which perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
I've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms, as you can see.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
I trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
I've been a civil servant,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
and I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.330
But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city, this university, as a student.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.330
And then as now, it was a beautiful place of balls and punts, beautiful people,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
many of whom took to heart Ronald Reagan's comment

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
that, "even if they say hard work doesn't do you any harm,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
why risk it?"

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
But when I was here,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.330
a lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.330
leaving school at a time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.330
and essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.330
And I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.330
And they were people who were not short of wit, or grace or energy,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
but they had no hope, no jobs, no prospects.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
And when people aren't allowed to be useful,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
they soon think that they're useless.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
And although that was great for the music business at the time,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
it wasn't much good for anything else.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
And ever since then, I've wondered why it is that capitalism

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.330
is so amazingly efficient at some things, but so inefficient at others,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.330
why it's so innovative in some ways and so un-innovative in others.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
Now, since that time,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
we've actually been through an extraordinary boom,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
the longest boom ever in the history of this country.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
Unprecedented wealth and prosperity,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.330
but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
H.L. Mencken once said that, "to every complex problem,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.330
there is a simple solution and it's wrong."

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
But I'm not saying growth is wrong,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
but it's very striking that throughout the years of growth,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
many things didn't get better.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.330
Rates of depression carried on up, right across the Western world.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
If you look at America, the proportion of Americans

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
with no one to talk to about important things

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
went up from a tenth to a quarter.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
We commuted longer to work, but as you can see from this graph,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.330
the longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
And it became ever clearer that economic growth

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.330
doesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
We're now at another moment

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.330
when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
There will be a million unemployed young people here

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
by the end of the year,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
thousands losing their jobs everyday in America.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
We've got to do whatever we can to help them,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
but we've also got to ask, I think, a more profound question

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
of whether we use this crisis to jump forward

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.330
to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.330
to a better balance of economy and society.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
And I think one of the lessons of history is that

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.330
even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.330
They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.330
They often lead to the acceleration of much-needed reforms.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
And you saw that in the '30s,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
when the Great Depression paved the way

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.330
for Bretton Woods, welfare states and so on.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
And I think you can see around us now,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
which could grow.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
You can see it in daily life.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
When times are hard, people have to do things for themselves,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.330
and right across the world, Oxford, Omaha, Omsk,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
people taking over land, taking over roofs,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
turning barges into temporary farms.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
And I'm a very small part of this.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
I have 60,000 of these things in my garden.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
A few of these. This is Atilla the hen.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
And I'm a very small part of a very large movement,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
which for some people is about survival,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
but is also about values, about a different kind of economy,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
which isn't so much about consumption and credit,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
but about things which matter to us.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
And everywhere too, you can see a proliferation of time banks

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
and parallel currencies,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
people using smart technologies to link up

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
all the resources freed up by the market -- people, buildings, land --

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.330
and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
There's a similar story, I think, for governments.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
Ronald Reagan, again, said the two funniest sentences

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
in the English language are,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
"I'm from the government. And I'm here to help."

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
But I think last year when governments did step in,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
people were quite glad that they were there, that they did act.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
But now, a few months on,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
however good politicians are at swallowing frogs

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
without pulling a face, as someone once put it,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
they can't hide their uncertainty.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
Because it's already clear

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.330
how much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.330
really went into fixing the past, bailing out the banks, the car companies,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
not preparing us for the future.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.330
How much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption,

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.330
not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
And everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
which are being spent of our money and our children's money,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
now, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking:

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.330
Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
to accelerate the shift to a green economy,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.330
which scar countries like this and the United States

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
rather than just giving the money to the incumbents?

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
Surely, we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs, to civil society,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
for people able to create the new,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
not to the big, well-connected companies,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.330
big, clunky government programs.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.330
And, after all this, as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
"Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
Don't overdo it."

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
And I think more and more people are also asking:

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
Why boost consumption, rather than change what we consume?

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.330
Like the mayor of São Paulo who's banned advertising billboards,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
or the many cities like San Francisco

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
putting in infrastructures for electric cars.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.330
You can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
Some, I think some of the bankers

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
But ask yourselves: What will be the biggest sectors of the economy

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.330
in 10, 20, 30 years time? It won't be the ones lining up for handouts,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
like cars and aerospace and so on.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
The biggest sector, by far, will be health --

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
already 18 percent of the American economy,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.330
predicted to grow to 30, even 40 percent by mid-century.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.330
Elder care, child care, already much bigger employers than cars.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.330
Education: six, seven, eight percent of the economy and growing.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.330
Environmental services, energy services, the myriad of green jobs,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.330
which isn't just about products, but is using distributed networks,

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.330
and it's founded above all on care, on relationships,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
on what people do to other people, often one to one,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
rather than simply selling them a product.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
And I think that what connects the challenge for civil society,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.330
is, in a way, a very simple one, but quite a difficult one.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.330
We know our societies have to radically change.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.330
We know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.330
But we also know it's only through experiment

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.330
that we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.330
how to care for a much older population,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.330
how to deal with drug addiction and so on.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
And here's the problem.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
In science, we do experiments systematically.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.330
Our societies now spend two, three, four percent of GDP

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.330
to invest systematically in new discovery, in science, in technology,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
which illuminate gatherings like this.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.330
than they were a hundred years ago, maybe they are,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.330
but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
And what's striking though,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
is that in society there's almost nothing comparable,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
no comparable investment,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.330
no systematic experiment, in the things capitalism isn't very good at,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:52.330
like compassion, or empathy, or relationships or care.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
Now, I didn't really understand that until I met this guy

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
who was then an 80-year-old, slightly shambolic man

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:03.330
who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.330
He had helped shape Britain's post-war institutions,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.330
its welfare state, its economy,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
became an inventor of many, many different organizations.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:20.330
Some famous ones like the Open University, which has 110,000 students,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
the University of the Third Age, which has nearly half a million older people

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
teaching other older people,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:30.330
as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
and schools for social entrepreneurs.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.330
And he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
He believed if you see a problem, you shouldn't tell someone to act,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
you should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.330
and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:51.330
that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.330
And his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:00.330
not from a theory, but from experiment, and experiment involving the people

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
with the best intelligence on social needs,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
which were usually the people living with those needs.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.330
And he believed we live with others, we share the world with others

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.330
and therefore our innovation must be done with others too,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.330
not doing things at people, for them, and so on.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.330
Now, what he did didn't used to have a name,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.330
but I think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
It's what we do in the organization named after him

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
where we try and invent, create, launch new ventures,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.330
whether it's schools, web companies, health organizations and so on.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.330
And we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
of institutions working on social innovation,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.330
using ideas from design or technology or community organizing

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:48.330
to develop the germs of a future world, but through practice and through demonstration

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.330
and not through theory.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.330
And they're spreading from Korea to Brazil to India to the USA

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.330
and across Europe.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:03.330
And they've been given new momentum by the crisis, by the need for better answers

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
to joblessness, community breakdown and so on.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
Some of the ideas are strange.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
These are complaints choirs.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.330
People come together to sing about the things that really bug them.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
(Laughter)

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.330
Others are much more pragmatic: health coaches, learning mentors, job clubs.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
And some are quite structural, like social impact bonds

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.330
where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
or helping old people keep out of hospital,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.330
and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
Now, the idea that all of this represents,

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.330
I think, is rapidly becoming a common sense

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
and part of how we respond to the crisis,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.330
recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.330
as well as technological progress.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.330
There were big health innovation funds

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
launched earlier this year in this country,

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
as well as a public service innovation lab.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.330
Across northern Europe, many governments

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
now have innovation laboratories within them.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
And just a few months ago, President Obama

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.330
launched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.330
And what people are beginning to ask is:

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.330
Surely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
of our GDP, of our economy,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.330
what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.330
into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education,

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.330
new ways of helping the disabled?

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.330
Perhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.330
to those we've had in the economy and in technology.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
And if, a generation or two ago, the big challenges

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
were ones like getting a man on the moon,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:42.330
are ones like eliminating child malnutrition, stopping trafficking,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
or one, I think closer to home for America or Europe,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
why don't we set ourselves the goal

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.330
of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.330
Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.330
but only with radical and systematic experiment,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.330
not just with technologies, but also with lifestyles and culture

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.330
and policies and institutions too.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:10.330
Now, I want to end by saying a little bit about what I think this means for capitalism.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
I think what this is all about, this whole movement

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.330
which is growing from the margins, remains quite small.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.330
Nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.330
What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
It's already immersed in social networks.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:31.330
It will become more involved in social investment, and social care

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.330
and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
not just from what you sell to them,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
and from relationships as well as from consumption.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:46.330
But interestingly too, it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.330
about how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:57.330
into society, trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:01.330
Now, I think this future will be quite surprising to many people.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:06.330
In recent years, a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
History was over

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.330
and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.330
But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.330
and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.330
just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
Then, people said monarchy dominated everywhere

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.330
because it was rooted in human nature.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.330
We were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.330
Just as today, the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.330
say it's rooted in human nature,

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
only now it's individualism, inquisitiveness, and so on.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:47.330
Then monarchy had seen off its big challenger, mass democracy,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.330
which was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.330
just as capitalism has seen off socialism.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.330
Even Fidel Castro now says that the only thing worse

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
than being exploited by multinational capitalism

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.330
is not being exploited by multinational capitalism.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:07.330
And whereas then monarchies, palaces and forts dominated every city skyline

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.330
and looked permanent and confident,

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:13.330
today it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.330
I'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.330
and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost,

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
though that might be quite tempting.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.330
But I do think we're on the verge of a period when,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:29.330
just as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too,

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.330
the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end,

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.330
and it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society,

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.330
transformed from being a master into a servant,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.330
a servant to the productive economy and of human needs.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.330
And as that happens,

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.330
we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism,

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.330
which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks,

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.330
it's not a self-sufficient system.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.330
It depends on other systems,

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.330
on ecology, on family, on community,

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.330
and if these aren't replenished, capitalism suffers too.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:09.330
And our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate.

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:13.330
It's not just competitive, it's also caring.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:19.330
Because of the depth of the crisis, I think we are at a moment of choice.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.330
The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us.

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.330
It will be worse at the end of this year,

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.330
quite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today.

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.330
But this is one of those very rare moments

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.330
when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.330
to get back to where we were a year or two ago,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:40.330
and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for,

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:45.330
or whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.330
and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.330
Thank you.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.330
(Applause)
