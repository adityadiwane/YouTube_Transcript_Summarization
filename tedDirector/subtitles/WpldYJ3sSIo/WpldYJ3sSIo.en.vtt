00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:18.016
I've got a great idea
that's going to change the world.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.434
It's fantastic, it's going
to blow your mind.

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:21.859
It's my beautiful baby.

00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:24.312
Here's the thing:
everybody loves a beautiful baby.

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:26.277
I mean, I was a beautiful baby.

00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:28.777
Here's me and my dad
a couple days after I was born.

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.440
So in the world of product design,

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.832
the beautiful baby's like the concept car.

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:34.742
It's the knockout.

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.905
You see it and you go, "Oh, my God.
I'd buy that in a second!"

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.300
So why is it that this year's new cars

00:00:40.324 --> 00:00:43.588
look pretty much exactly
like last year's new cars?

00:00:43.612 --> 00:00:45.384
(Laughter)

00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:48.226
What went wrong between
the design studio and the factory?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.654
Today, I don't want to talk
about beautiful babies,

00:00:50.678 --> 00:00:53.419
I want to talk about the awkward
adolescence of design --

00:00:53.443 --> 00:00:58.021
those sort of dorky teenage years

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:00.988
where you're trying to figure out
how the world works.

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:03.202
I'm going to start with an example

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:05.654
from some work that we did
on newborn health.

00:01:05.678 --> 00:01:07.310
So here's a problem:

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:11.349
four million babies around the world,
mostly in developing countries,

00:01:11.373 --> 00:01:13.734
die every year
before their first birthday,

00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:15.586
even before their first month of life.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.270
It turns out half of those kids,

00:01:17.294 --> 00:01:19.508
or about 1.8 million newborns
around the world,

00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:22.420
would make it if you could
just keep them warm

00:01:22.444 --> 00:01:25.166
for the first three days,
maybe the first week.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.891
So this is a newborn intensive care unit
in Kathmandu, Nepal.

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:31.624
All of these kids in blankets
belong in incubators --

00:01:31.648 --> 00:01:33.297
something like this.

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:36.117
This is a donated Japanese Atom incubator

00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:38.814
that we found in a NICU in Kathmandu.

00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:40.551
This is what we want.

00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:43.909
Probably what happened is a hospital
in Japan upgraded their equipment

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:47.362
and donated their old stuff to Nepal.

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:50.451
The problem is, without technicians,
without spare parts,

00:01:50.475 --> 00:01:53.894
donations like this
very quickly turn into junk.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:57.751
So this seemed like a problem
that we could do something about.

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:01.992
Keeping a baby warm for a week --
that's not rocket science.

00:02:02.016 --> 00:02:03.399
So we got started.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:07.294
We partnered with a leading medical
research institution here in Boston.

00:02:07.318 --> 00:02:10.234
We conducted months
of user research overseas,

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:12.964
trying to think like designers,
human-centered design --

00:02:12.988 --> 00:02:15.061
"Let's figure out what people want."

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:17.928
We killed thousands of Post-it notes.

00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:21.375
We made dozens of prototypes
to get to this.

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:24.367
So this is the NeoNurture
infant incubator,

00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:28.065
and this has a lot of smarts
built into it, and we felt great.

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:30.403
So the idea here is,
unlike the concept car,

00:02:30.427 --> 00:02:32.281
we want to marry something beautiful

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:34.784
with something that actually works.

00:02:34.808 --> 00:02:36.895
And our idea is that this design

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.382
would inspire manufacturers
and other people of influence

00:02:40.406 --> 00:02:42.915
to take this model and run with it.

00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:46.433
Here's the bad news:

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:50.431
the only baby ever actually put
inside the NeoNurture incubator

00:02:50.455 --> 00:02:53.698
was this kid during a Time
magazine photo shoot.

00:02:54.328 --> 00:02:56.531
So recognition is fantastic.

00:02:56.555 --> 00:02:59.230
We want design to get out
for people to see it.

00:02:59.254 --> 00:03:01.120
It won lots of awards.

00:03:01.144 --> 00:03:03.406
But it felt like a booby prize.

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:05.866
We wanted to make beautiful things

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.027
that are going to make
the world a better place,

00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:12.705
and I don't think this kid was even
in it long enough to get warm.

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:18.436
So it turns out that design 
for inspiration doesn't really ...

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.986
I guess what I would say is,
for us, for what I want to do,

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.420
it's either too slow or it just
doesn't work, it's ineffective.

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:28.481
So, really, I want to design for outcomes.

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:32.201
I don't want to make beautiful stuff;
I want to make the world a better place.

00:03:32.225 --> 00:03:34.010
So when we were designing NeoNurture,

00:03:34.034 --> 00:03:37.475
we paid a lot of attention to the people
who are going to use this thing,

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.102
for example, poor families, rural doctors,

00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:43.282
overloaded nurses,
even repair technicians.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:46.518
We thought we had all our bases
covered, we'd done everything right.

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:49.408
Well, it turns out there's this
whole constellation of people

00:03:49.432 --> 00:03:52.295
who have to be involved
in a product for it to be successful:

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.009
manufacturing, financing,
distribution, regulation.

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:57.286
Michael Free at PATH
says you have to figure out

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.944
who will "choose, use and pay the dues"

00:03:59.968 --> 00:04:01.258
for a product like this.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.726
And I have to ask the question
that VCs always ask:

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.600
"Sir, what is your business,
and who is your customer?"

00:04:06.624 --> 00:04:07.897
Who is our customer?

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.557
Well, here's an example.

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:12.852
This is a Bangladeshi hospital director
outside his facility.

00:04:12.876 --> 00:04:15.713
It turns out he doesn't buy
any of his equipment.

00:04:15.737 --> 00:04:18.503
Those decisions are made
by the Ministry of Health

00:04:18.527 --> 00:04:19.851
or by foreign donors,

00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:21.256
and it just kind of shows up.

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.090
Similarly, here's a multinational
medical-device manufacturer.

00:04:25.114 --> 00:04:28.024
It turns out they've got to fish
where the fish are.

00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:31.385
So it turns out that in emerging
markets -- where the fish are --

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.504
are the emerging middle class
of these countries --

00:04:34.528 --> 00:04:37.982
diseases of affluence:
heart disease, infertility.

00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:42.484
So it turns out that design
for outcomes in one aspect

00:04:42.508 --> 00:04:46.032
really means thinking about design
for manufacture and distribution.

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:47.862
OK, that was an important lesson.

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:52.433
Second, we took that lesson and tried
to push it into our next project.

00:04:52.457 --> 00:04:54.966
So we started by finding a manufacturer,

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.288
an organization called MTTS in Vietnam,

00:04:57.312 --> 00:05:00.710
that manufactures newborn-care
technologies for Southeast Asia.

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:02.618
Our other partner is East Meets West,

00:05:02.642 --> 00:05:05.268
an American foundation
that distributes that technology

00:05:05.292 --> 00:05:07.942
to poor hospitals around that region.

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:10.649
So we started with them, saying,
"Well, what do you want?

00:05:10.673 --> 00:05:12.402
What's a problem you want to solve?"

00:05:12.426 --> 00:05:14.931
And they said, "Let's work
on newborn jaundice."

00:05:14.955 --> 00:05:19.017
So this is another one of these
mind-boggling global problems.

00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:22.780
Jaundice affects two-thirds
of newborns around the world.

00:05:22.804 --> 00:05:27.328
Of those newborns, one in 10 roughly,

00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:29.832
if it's not treated,
the jaundice gets so severe

00:05:29.856 --> 00:05:32.529
that it leads to either
a life-long disability,

00:05:32.553 --> 00:05:35.094
or the kids could even die.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.309
There's one way to treat jaundice,

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:39.873
and that's what's called
an exchange transfusion.

00:05:39.897 --> 00:05:43.741
So as you can imagine, that's expensive
and a little bit dangerous.

00:05:43.765 --> 00:05:45.550
There is another cure.

00:05:45.574 --> 00:05:51.217
It's very technological,
it's very complex, a little daunting.

00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:53.463
You've got to shine blue light on the kid.

00:05:53.487 --> 00:05:54.549
(Laughter)

00:05:54.573 --> 00:05:58.024
Bright blue light on as much
of the skin as you can cover.

00:05:58.048 --> 00:05:59.929
How is this a hard problem?

00:05:59.953 --> 00:06:05.594
I went to MIT. OK, we'll figure that out.

00:06:05.618 --> 00:06:07.054
(Laughter)

00:06:07.078 --> 00:06:08.245
So here's an example.

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:12.777
This is an overhead phototherapy device
that's designed for American hospitals,

00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.779
and here's how it's supposed to be used.

00:06:14.803 --> 00:06:18.672
It's over the baby,
illuminating a single patient.

00:06:19.426 --> 00:06:21.165
Take it out of an American hospital,

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.398
send it overseas
to a crowded facility in Asia,

00:06:23.422 --> 00:06:24.874
here's how it's actually used.

00:06:24.898 --> 00:06:28.121
The effectiveness of phototherapy
is a function of light intensity.

00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:31.552
These dark blue squares show you
where it's effective phototherapy.

00:06:31.576 --> 00:06:33.607
Here's what it looks
like under actual use.

00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:37.312
So those kids on the edges aren't actually
receiving effective phototherapy.

00:06:37.336 --> 00:06:40.762
But without training,
without some kind of light meter,

00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:42.104
how would you know?

00:06:42.596 --> 00:06:44.657
We see other examples
of problems like this.

00:06:44.681 --> 00:06:46.503
Here's a neonatal intensive care unit,

00:06:46.527 --> 00:06:48.489
where moms come in to visit their babies.

00:06:48.513 --> 00:06:51.008
And keep in mind that Mom
maybe just had a C-section,

00:06:51.032 --> 00:06:52.898
so that's already kind of a bummer.

00:06:52.922 --> 00:06:54.295
Mom's visiting her kid.

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:57.454
She sees her baby naked,
lying under some blue lights,

00:06:57.478 --> 00:06:59.593
looking kind of vulnerable.

00:06:59.617 --> 00:07:02.629
It's not uncommon for Mom
to put a blanket over the baby.

00:07:03.474 --> 00:07:07.348
From a phototherapy standpoint,
maybe not the best behavior.

00:07:07.372 --> 00:07:09.246
In fact, that sounds kind of dumb.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.060
Except, what we've learned is that
there's no such thing as a dumb user --

00:07:14.084 --> 00:07:16.746
there are only dumb products.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.608
We have to think like existentialists:

00:07:18.632 --> 00:07:20.696
it's not the painting
we would have painted,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.735
it's the painting
that we actually painted.

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:25.269
It's the use -- designed for actual use.

00:07:25.293 --> 00:07:27.293
How are people actually going to use this?

00:07:27.737 --> 00:07:30.817
So, similarly, when we think
about our partner MTTS,

00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:34.269
they've made some amazing technologies
for treating newborn illnesses.

00:07:34.293 --> 00:07:36.602
So here's an overhead warmer and a CPAP.

00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:39.371
They're inexpensive, really rugged.

00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:42.232
They've treated 50,000 kids
in Vietnam with this technology.

00:07:42.256 --> 00:07:43.613
But here's the problem:

00:07:43.637 --> 00:07:46.440
Every doctor in the world,
every hospital administrator,

00:07:46.464 --> 00:07:51.716
has seen TV -- curse those "ER" reruns!

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.389
Turns out they all know what a medical
device is supposed to look like.

00:07:55.897 --> 00:07:58.928
They want Buck Rogers,
they don't want effective.

00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:01.067
It sounds crazy, it sounds dumb,

00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:04.258
but there are actually hospitals
who would rather have no equipment

00:08:04.282 --> 00:08:06.338
than something that looks
cheap and crummy.

00:08:06.362 --> 00:08:09.656
So again, if we want
people to trust a device,

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.088
it has to look trustworthy.

00:08:11.112 --> 00:08:12.603
So thinking about outcomes,

00:08:12.627 --> 00:08:15.004
it turns out appearances matter.

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:17.535
We took all that information together.

00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:19.890
We tried, this time, to get it right.

00:08:19.914 --> 00:08:21.302
And here's what we developed.

00:08:21.326 --> 00:08:23.262
This is the Firefly phototherapy device,

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:26.138
except this time,
we didn't stop at the concept car.

00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:30.201
From the very beginning, we started
by talking to manufacturers.

00:08:30.225 --> 00:08:33.369
Our goal is to make
a state-of-the-art product

00:08:33.393 --> 00:08:36.075
that our partner MTTS
can actually manufacture.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:40.186
Our goal is to study how they work,
the resources they have access to,

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.416
so that they can make this product.

00:08:42.765 --> 00:08:45.256
So that's the design
for manufacture question.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.115
When we think about actual use,

00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:49.448
you'll notice that Firefly
has a single bassinet.

00:08:49.472 --> 00:08:51.345
It only fits a single baby,

00:08:51.369 --> 00:08:55.403
and the idea here is it's obvious
how you ought to use this device.

00:08:55.427 --> 00:08:57.300
If you try to put more than one kid in,

00:08:57.324 --> 00:08:59.353
you're stacking them on top of each other.

00:08:59.377 --> 00:09:01.009
(Laughter)

00:09:01.033 --> 00:09:03.804
So the idea here is you want
to make it hard to use wrong.

00:09:03.828 --> 00:09:06.495
In other words, you want to make
the right way to use it

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:08.457
the easiest way to use it.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:11.493
Another example -- again, silly Mom.

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:15.070
Silly Mom thinks her baby looks cold,
wants to put a blanket over the baby.

00:09:15.094 --> 00:09:18.016
That's why we have lights
above and below the baby in Firefly,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.077
so if Mom does put a blanket
over the baby,

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:23.052
it's still receiving effective
phototherapy from below.

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.214
Last story here:

00:09:25.238 --> 00:09:27.133
I've got a friend in India who told me

00:09:27.157 --> 00:09:30.138
that you haven't really tested
a piece of electronic technology

00:09:30.162 --> 00:09:32.204
for distribution in Asia,

00:09:32.228 --> 00:09:34.673
until you've trained a cockroach
to climb in and pee

00:09:34.697 --> 00:09:37.149
on every single little
component on the inside.

00:09:37.173 --> 00:09:38.957
(Laughter)

00:09:38.981 --> 00:09:40.340
You think it's funny.

00:09:40.364 --> 00:09:42.578
I had a laptop in the Peace Corps,

00:09:42.602 --> 00:09:44.806
and the screen had all these
dead pixels on it.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.615
And one day I looked in --
they were all dead ants

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:49.703
that had gotten
into my laptop and perished.

00:09:49.727 --> 00:09:50.878
Those poor ants.

00:09:50.902 --> 00:09:52.442
(Laughter)

00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:56.030
So with Firefly, what we did is --
the problem is electronics get hot,

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.776
and you have to put in vents
or fans to keep them cool --

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.044
in most products.

00:10:00.068 --> 00:10:04.853
We decided we can't put a "Do not enter"
sign next to the vent.

00:10:04.877 --> 00:10:06.876
We actually got rid of all that stuff.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.264
So Firefly's totally sealed.

00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:10.217
These are the kinds of lessons --

00:10:10.241 --> 00:10:12.877
as awkward as it was
to be a pretty goofy teenager,

00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:14.884
much worse to be a frustrated designer.

00:10:14.908 --> 00:10:18.018
So I was thinking, "What I really
want to do is change the world.

00:10:18.042 --> 00:10:20.785
I have to pay attention
to manufacturing and distribution.

00:10:20.809 --> 00:10:24.800
I have to pay attention to how people
are actually going to use a device.

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:27.840
I actually have to pay attention.
There's no excuse for failure.

00:10:27.864 --> 00:10:29.738
I have to think like an existentialist.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:33.002
I have to accept that there
are no dumb users, only dumb products."

00:10:33.026 --> 00:10:35.396
We have to ask ourselves hard questions.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.746
Are we designing
for the world that we want?

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.778
Are we designing
for the world that we have?

00:10:41.166 --> 00:10:43.280
Are we designing
for the world that's coming,

00:10:43.304 --> 00:10:44.598
whether we're ready or not?

00:10:44.622 --> 00:10:47.641
I got into this business
designing products.

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:51.685
I've since learned that if you really want
to make a difference in the world,

00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:53.472
you have to design outcomes.

00:10:53.496 --> 00:10:55.037
And that's design that matters.

00:10:55.061 --> 00:10:56.213
Thank you.

00:10:56.237 --> 00:10:59.855
(Applause)
