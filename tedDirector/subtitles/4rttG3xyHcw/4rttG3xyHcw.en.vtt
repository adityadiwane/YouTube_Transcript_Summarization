00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.687
Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney.

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:22.734
I got to the airport, to the hotel, checked in,

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:25.513
and, sitting there in the lobby, was a brochure

00:00:25.513 --> 00:00:28.135
for the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it,

00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:31.276
and I came across a show called "Minto: Live."

00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:34.908
The description read: "The suburban streets of Minto

00:00:34.908 --> 00:00:37.449
become the stage for performances

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.655
created by international artists

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:42.455
in collaboration with the people of Minto."

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:45.170
What was this place called Minto?

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.531
Sydney, as I would learn, is a city of suburbs,

00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:51.204
and Minto lies southwest, about an hour away.

00:00:51.204 --> 00:00:54.563
I have to say, it wasn't exactly what I had in mind

00:00:54.563 --> 00:00:56.160
for my first day down under.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.099
I mean, I'd thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach,

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:02.055
but Minto? But still, I'm a producer,

00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:05.227
and the lure of a site-specific theater project

00:01:05.227 --> 00:01:07.496
was more than I could resist. (Laughter)

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:09.980
So, off I went into Friday afternoon traffic,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.385
and I'll never forget what I saw when I got there.

00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:15.039
For the performance, the audience walked

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.829
around the neighborhood from house to house,

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.709
and the residents, who were the performers,

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:22.820
they came out of their houses, and they performed

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.659
these autobiographical dances on their lawns,

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.007
on their driveways. (Laughter)

00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:31.975
The show is a collaboration with a U.K.-based

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:34.634
performance company called Lone Twin.

00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:36.530
Lone Twin had come to Minto and worked

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.654
with the residents, and they had created these dances.

00:01:39.654 --> 00:01:43.492
This Australian-Indian girl, she came out and started

00:01:43.492 --> 00:01:45.513
to dance on her front lawn,

00:01:45.513 --> 00:01:48.451
and her father peered out the window to see

00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:50.958
what all the noise and commotion was about,

00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.166
and he soon joined her.

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:56.293
And he was followed by her little sister.

00:01:56.293 --> 00:01:59.351
And soon they were all dancing this joyous,

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:03.526
exuberant dance right there on their lawn. (Laughter)

00:02:03.526 --> 00:02:05.718
And as I walked through the neighborhood,

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:09.939
I was amazed and I was moved by the incredible

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.376
sense of ownership this community clearly felt

00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:14.946
about this event.

00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:17.905
"Minto: Live" brought Sydneysiders into dialogue

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:21.235
with international artists, and really celebrated

00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:24.723
the diversity of Sydney on its own terms.

00:02:24.723 --> 00:02:28.436
The Sydney Festival which produced "Minto: Live" I think

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:32.211
represents a new kind of 21st-century arts festival.

00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.726
These festivals are radically open.

00:02:35.726 --> 00:02:39.438
They can transform cities and communities.

00:02:39.438 --> 00:02:42.118
To understand this, I think it kind of makes sense

00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:44.444
to look where we've come from.

00:02:44.444 --> 00:02:46.467
Modern arts festivals were born

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:47.965
in the rubble of World War II.

00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:50.567
Civic leaders created these annual events

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:53.676
to celebrate culture as the highest

00:02:53.676 --> 00:02:56.281
expression of the human spirit.

00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:59.364
In 1947, the Edinburgh Festival was born

00:02:59.364 --> 00:03:02.021
and Avignon was born and hundreds of others

00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:03.922
would follow in their wake.

00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:07.174
The work they did was very, very high art,

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:09.778
and stars came along like Laurie Anderson

00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:12.053
and Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage

00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:13.473
who made work for this circuit,

00:03:13.473 --> 00:03:16.244
and you had these seminal shows like "The Mahabharata"

00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:19.229
and the monumental "Einstein on the Beach."

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.724
But as the decades passed,

00:03:21.724 --> 00:03:24.925
these festivals, they really became the establishment,

00:03:24.925 --> 00:03:28.318
and as the culture and capital accelerated,

00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:30.319
the Internet brought us all together,

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.251
high and low kind of disappeared,

00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:34.873
a new kind of festival emerged.

00:03:34.873 --> 00:03:38.012
The old festivals, they continued to thrive, but

00:03:38.012 --> 00:03:42.360
from Brighton to Rio to Perth, something new was emerging,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.304
and these festivals were really different.

00:03:45.304 --> 00:03:48.199
They're open, these festivals, because, like in Minto,

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.415
they understand that the dialogue

00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:54.133
between the local and the global is essential.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:58.636
They're open because they ask the audience to be a player,

00:03:58.636 --> 00:04:03.046
a protagonist, a partner, rather than a passive spectator,

00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:06.625
and they're open because they know that imagination

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.784
cannot be contained in buildings,

00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:10.637
and so much of the work they do

00:04:10.637 --> 00:04:13.937
is site-specific or outdoor work.

00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:17.325
So, the new festival, it asks the audience to play

00:04:17.325 --> 00:04:20.443
an essential role in shaping the performance.

00:04:20.443 --> 00:04:25.539
Companies like De La Guarda, which I produce, and Punchdrunk

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.353
create these completely immersive experiences

00:04:28.353 --> 00:04:31.548
that put the audience at the center of the action,

00:04:31.548 --> 00:04:34.650
but the German performance company Rimini Protokoll

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.937
takes this all to a whole new level.

00:04:37.937 --> 00:04:41.719
In a series of shows that includes "100 Percent Vancouver,"

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.716
"100 Percent Berlin," Rimini Protokoll makes shows

00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:48.549
that actually reflect society.

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:53.086
Rimini Protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that city

00:04:53.086 --> 00:04:56.497
at that moment in terms of race and gender and class,

00:04:56.497 --> 00:04:59.771
through a careful process that begins three months before,

00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:02.998
and then those 100 people share stories about

00:05:02.998 --> 00:05:05.534
themselves and their lives, and the whole thing

00:05:05.534 --> 00:05:10.156
becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment.

00:05:10.156 --> 00:05:13.591
LIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues.

00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:16.002
They understand that theater and performance

00:05:16.002 --> 00:05:17.320
can happen anywhere.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.529
You can do a show in a schoolroom,

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.914
in an airport, — (Laughter) —

00:05:22.914 --> 00:05:25.399
in a department store window.

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:29.821
Artists are explorers. Who better to show us the city anew?

00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:33.168
Artists can take us to a far-flung part of the city

00:05:33.168 --> 00:05:35.196
that we haven't explored, or they can take us into

00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:39.621
that building that we pass every day but we never went into.

00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:43.784
An artist, I think, can really show us people

00:05:43.784 --> 00:05:46.923
that we might overlook in our lives.

00:05:46.923 --> 00:05:50.318
Back to Back is an Australian company of people

00:05:50.318 --> 00:05:54.904
with intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing show

00:05:54.904 --> 00:05:58.073
in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal

00:05:58.073 --> 00:05:59.483
at rush hour.

00:05:59.483 --> 00:06:02.203
We, the audience, were given headsets and seated

00:06:02.203 --> 00:06:04.987
on one side of the terminal.

00:06:04.987 --> 00:06:06.979
The actors were right there in front of us,

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.389
right there among the commuters,

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:10.949
and we could hear them,

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.044
but we might not have otherwise seen them.

00:06:14.044 --> 00:06:18.562
So Back to Back takes site-specific theater and uses it

00:06:18.562 --> 00:06:21.836
to gently remind us about who and what we choose

00:06:21.836 --> 00:06:24.727
to edit out of our daily lives.

00:06:24.727 --> 00:06:27.839
So, the dialogue with the local and the global,

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:31.749
the audience as participant and player and protagonist,

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:34.877
the innovative use of site, all of these things

00:06:34.877 --> 00:06:37.726
come to play in the amazing work

00:06:37.726 --> 00:06:41.783
of the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe.

00:06:41.783 --> 00:06:45.523
Royal de Luxe's giant puppets come into a city

00:06:45.523 --> 00:06:48.276
and they live there for a few days.

00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:51.850
For "The Sultan's Elephant," Royal de Luxe

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.873
came to central London and brought it to a standstill

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:59.262
with their story of a giant little girl and her friend,

00:06:59.262 --> 00:07:01.774
a time-traveling elephant.

00:07:01.774 --> 00:07:06.443
For a few days, they transformed a massive city

00:07:06.443 --> 00:07:11.346
into a community where endless possibility reigned.

00:07:11.346 --> 00:07:14.937
The Guardian wrote, "If art is about transformation,

00:07:14.937 --> 00:07:18.927
then there can be no more transformative experience.

00:07:18.927 --> 00:07:22.827
What 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less

00:07:22.827 --> 00:07:25.673
than an artistic occupation of the city

00:07:25.673 --> 00:07:30.550
and a reclamation of the streets for the people."

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.010
We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.316
on their cities, but I'm much [more] interested in many more things,

00:07:38.316 --> 00:07:42.081
like how a festival helps a city to express itself,

00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:45.352
how it lets it come into its own.

00:07:45.352 --> 00:07:47.477
Festivals promote diversity,

00:07:47.477 --> 00:07:49.463
they bring neighbors into dialogue,

00:07:49.463 --> 00:07:51.908
they increase creativity,

00:07:51.908 --> 00:07:55.080
they offer opportunities for civic pride,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.739
they improve our general psychological well-being.

00:07:58.739 --> 00:08:02.947
In short, they make cities better places to live.

00:08:02.947 --> 00:08:03.925
Case in point:

00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:07.269
When "The Sultan's Elephant" came to London

00:08:07.269 --> 00:08:11.625
just nine months after 7/7, a Londoner wrote,

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:15.258
"For the first time since the London bombings,

00:08:15.258 --> 00:08:18.868
my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice.

00:08:18.868 --> 00:08:20.610
She had gathered with others

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.798
to watch 'The Sultan's Elephant,' and, you know,

00:08:23.798 --> 00:08:26.481
it just made all the difference."

00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:28.631
Lyn Gardner in The Guardian has written

00:08:28.631 --> 00:08:33.094
that a great festival can show us a map of the world,

00:08:33.094 --> 00:08:37.142
a map of the city and a map of ourselves,

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:40.348
but there is no one fixed festival model.

00:08:40.348 --> 00:08:43.184
I think what's so brilliant about the festivals,

00:08:43.184 --> 00:08:48.250
the new festivals, is that they are really fully capturing

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.438
the complexity and the excitement

00:08:51.438 --> 00:08:53.463
of the way we all live today.

00:08:53.463 --> 00:09:01.408
Thank you very much. (Applause)
