00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
The fragrance that you will smell, you will never be able to smell this way again.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
It’s a fragrance called Beyond Paradise,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
which you can find in any store in the nation.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
Except here it’s been split up in parts by Estée Lauder

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
and by the perfumer who did it, Calice Becker,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.160
and I'm most grateful to them for this.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.160
And it’s been split up in successive bits and a chord.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
So what you’re smelling now is the top note.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.160
And then will come what they call the heart, the lush heart note.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
I will show it to you.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
The Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.160
The lush heart note, Melaleuca bark note -- which does not contain any Melaleuca bark,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
because it’s totally forbidden.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
And after that, the complete fragrance.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
Now what you are smelling is a combination of --

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
I asked how many molecules there were in there, and nobody would tell me.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.160
So I put it through a G.C., a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
and it’s about 400.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
So what you’re smelling is several hundred molecules

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
floating through the air, hitting your nose.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.160
And do not get the impression that this is very subjective.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
You are all smelling pretty much the same thing, OK?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.160
Smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.160
It’s not really true.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
And perfumery shows you that can’t be true,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.160
because if it were like that it wouldn’t be an art, OK?

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160
Now, while the smell wafts over you, let me tell you the history of an idea.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.160
Everything that you’re smelling in here

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
is made up of atoms that come from what I call

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
the Upper East Side of the periodic table -- a nice, safe neighborhood.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.160
(Laughter)

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
You really don’t want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Some people have tried in the 1920s

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.160
to add things from the bad parts, and it didn’t really work.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
These are the five atoms from which just about everything

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.160
that you’re going to smell in real life, from coffee to fragrance, are made of.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
The top note that you smelled at the very beginning,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
the cut-grass green, what we call in perfumery -- they’re weird terms --

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
and this would be called a green note,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
because it smells of something green, like cut grass.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.160
This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. And I had to learn chemistry on the fly

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.160
in the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.160
This has six carbon atoms, so "hexa," hexene-1-ol.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
It has one double bond, it has an alcohol on the end,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
so it’s "ol," and that’s why they call it cis-3-hexene-1-ol.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Once you figure this out, you can really impress people at parties.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160
This smells of cut grass. Now, this is the skeleton of the molecule.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
If you dress it up with atoms, hydrogen atoms --

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
that’s what it looks like when you have it on your computer --

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160
but actually it’s sort of more like this, in the sense that the atoms have a certain

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
sphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.160
OK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK?

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.160
Why doesn’t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.160
But the first theory is: it must be the shape.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
And that’s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
almost everything else in biology works by shape.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
Enzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it’s all, you know,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.160
the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing, in this case a smell.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
And I will try and explain to you what’s wrong with this notion.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
And the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Now, this is a totally insane idea.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.160
And when I first came across it in the early '90s, I thought my predecessor,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright, had really taken leave of their senses,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
and I’ll explain to you why this was the case.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
However, I came to realize gradually that they may be right --

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so, but I’m working on it.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Here’s how shape works in normal receptors.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.160
You have a molecule coming in, it gets into the protein, which is schematic here,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.160
and it causes this thing to switch, to turn, to move in some way

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.160
by binding in certain parts.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
And the attraction, the forces, between the molecule and the protein

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.160
cause the motion. This is a shape-based idea.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160
Now, what’s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.160
The way --I expect everybody to memorize these compounds.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.160
This is one page of work from a chemist’s workbook, OK?

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
Working for a fragrance company.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
He’s making 45 molecules, and he’s looking for a sandalwood,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160
something that smells of sandalwood.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
Because there’s a lot of money in sandalwoods.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.160
And of these 45 molecules, only 4629 actually smells of sandalwood.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
And he puts an exclamation mark, OK? This is an awful lot of work.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.160
This actually is roughly, in man-years of work, 200,000 dollars roughly,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.160
if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
So this is a profoundly inefficient process.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
And my definition of a theory is, it’s not just something

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
that you teach people; it’s labor saving.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
A theory is something that enables you to do less work.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.160
I love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why -- a very simple fact

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.160
that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.160
This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. It smells of cut grass.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.160
This is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol, and this smells of rotten eggs, OK?

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.160
Now, you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.160
If it does, you put the glass down, you go to a different bar.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.160
This is -- in other words, we never get the O-H --

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
we never mistake it for an S-H, OK?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
Like, at no concentration, even pure, you know,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
if you smelt pure ethanol, it doesn’t smell of rotten eggs.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Conversely, there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.160
It’s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
Now, I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.160
for biology, and he says, "That’s easy! The things are a different color!"

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.160
(Laughter)

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.160
We have to go a little beyond that. Now let me explain why vibrational theory has

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.160
some sort of interest in it. These molecules, as you saw in the beginning,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
In fact, molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.160
which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:52.160
So this is the sound of the O-H stretch, translated into the audible range.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
S-H, quite a different frequency.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.160
Now, this is kind of interesting, because it tells you

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
that you should be looking for a particular fact, which is this:

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.160
nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S-H, OK?

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Now, Fact B: nothing in the world has that frequency except S-H.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
If you look on this, imagine a piano keyboard.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.160
The S-H stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
that has been, so to speak, damaged,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
and there are no neighboring notes, nothing is close to it.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
You have a unique smell, a unique vibration.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
So I went searching when I started in this game

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
to this whole crazy story.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
I went searching for a type of molecule, any molecule,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.160
that would have that vibration and that -- the obvious prediction

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:49.160
If it didn’t, the whole idea was toast, and I might as well move on to other things.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160
Now, after searching high and low for several months,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.160
I discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
which has exactly the same vibration.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
Now the good news is, Boranes you can get hold of.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
The bad news is they’re rocket fuels.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
Most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.160
and when you call up the companies, they only give you minimum ten tons, OK?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160
(Laughter)

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
So this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
and they wouldn’t have liked it at my college.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:29.160
However, I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually, and here is the beast.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
And it really does have the same -- if you calculate,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.160
if you measure the vibrational frequencies, they are the same as S-H.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.160
Now, does it smell of sulfur? Well, if you go back in the literature,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
there’s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.160
alive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:54.160
And in an enormous 40-page paper in German he says, at one point --

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
my wife is German and she translated it for me --

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
and at one point he says, "ganz widerlich Geruch,"

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:05.160
an "absolutely repulsive smell," which is good. Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
So this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:15.160
had been known since 1910, and utterly forgotten until 1997, 1998.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.160
Now, the slight fly in the ointment is this: that

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.160
if we smell molecular vibrations, we must have a spectroscope in our nose.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.160
Now, this is a spectroscope, OK, on my laboratory bench.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
And it’s fair to say that if you look up somebody’s nose,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
you’re unlikely to see anything resembling this.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
And this is the main objection to the theory.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.160
OK, great, we smell vibrations. How? All right?

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
Now when people ask this kind of question, they neglect something,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.160
which is that physicists are really clever, unlike biologists.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
(Laughter)

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
This is a joke. I’m a biologist, OK?

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.160
So it’s a joke against myself.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
Bob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
in the days when Ford Motor was spending vast amounts of money

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.160
on fundamental research, discovered a way

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano-scale.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
In other words, no mirrors, no lasers, no prisms, no nonsense,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:14.160
just a tiny device, and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160
Now, I could do the dance of electron tunneling,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.160
but I’ve done a video instead, which is much more interesting. Here’s how it works.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.160
Electrons are fuzzy creatures, and they can jump across gaps,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.160
but only at equal energy. If the energy differs, they can’t jump.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
Unlike us, they won’t fall off the cliff.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:40.160
OK. Now. If something absorbs the energy, the electron can travel.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
So here you have a system, you have something --

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.160
and there’s plenty of that stuff in biology --

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.160
some substance giving an electron, and the electron tries to jump,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.160
and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
does the reaction happen, OK?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.160
This is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:06.160
And every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.160
In other words, I’ve taken off-the-shelf components,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
and I’ve made a spectroscope.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160
What’s nice about this idea, if you have a philosophical bent of mind,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
is that then it tells you that the nose,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.160
Of course, it doesn’t matter, because it could also be that they’re not.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.160
But it has a certain --

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
(Laughter)

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.160
-- it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.160
who read too much 19th-century German literature.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.160
And then a magnificent thing happened:

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:40.160
I left academia and joined the real world of business,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
and a company was created around my ideas

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
to make new molecules using my method,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.160
along the lines of, let’s put someone else’s money where your mouth is.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160
And one of the first things that happened was

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
we started going around to fragrance companies

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.160
asking for what they needed, because, of course,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
if you could calculate smell, you don’t need chemists.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.160
You need a computer, a Mac will do it, if you know how to program the thing right,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.160
OK? So you can try a thousand molecules,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160
And so that’s a direct path to making new odorants.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.160
And one of the first things that happened was

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
we went to see some perfumers in France --

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
and here’s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression --

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.160
and one of them says, "You cannot make a coumarin."

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
He says to me, "I bet you cannot make a coumarin."

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.160
Now, coumarin is a very common thing, a material,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.160
And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical, OK?

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.160
It’s the molecule that has made men’s fragrances

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.160
smell the way they do since 1881, to be exact.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
And the problem is it’s a carcinogen.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:59.160
So nobody likes particularly to -- you know, aftershave with carcinogens.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160
(Laughter)

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160
There are some reckless people, but it’s not worth it, OK?

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.160
So they asked us to make a new coumarin. And so we started doing calculations.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.160
of coumarin, and you smooth it out,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:19.160
so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:25.160
And then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.160
related or unrelated, that have the same vibrations.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.160
And we actually, in this case, I’m sorry to say,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
it happened -- it was serendipitous.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160
Because I got a phone call from our chief chemist

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.160
and he said, look, I’ve just found this such a beautiful reaction,

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.160
that even if this compound doesn’t smell of coumarin,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.160
I want to do it, it’s just such a nifty,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.160
one step -- I mean, chemists have weird minds --

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.160
one step, 90 percent yield, you know, and you get this lovely

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
crystalline compound. Let us try it.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.160
And I said, first of all, let me do the calculation on that compound, bottom right,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:05.160
which is related to coumarin, but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:10.160
Calculate the vibrations, the purple spectrum is that new fellow,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.160
the white one is the old one.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:23.160
They made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.160
And this is our new baby, called tonkene.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
You see, when you’re a scientist, you’re always selling ideas.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.160
And people are very resistant to ideas, and rightly so.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.160
Why should new ideas be accepted?

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:42.160
But when you put a little 10-gram vial on the table in front of perfumers

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
and it smells like coumarin, and it isn’t coumarin,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
and you’ve found it in three weeks,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
this focuses everybody’s mind wonderfully.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.160
(Laughter)

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:56.160
(Applause)

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.160
And people often ask me, is your theory accepted?

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.160
And I said, well, by whom? I mean most, you know -- there’s three attitudes:

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.160
You’re right, and I don’t know why, which is the most rational one at this point.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.160
You’re right, and I don’t care how you do it, in a sense;

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.160
you bring me the molecules, you know.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
And: You’re completely wrong, and I’m sure you’re completely wrong.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.160
OK? Now, we’re dealing with people who only want results,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.160
and this is the commercial world.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.160
And they tell us that even if we do it by astrology, they’re happy.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.160
But we’re not actually doing it by astrology.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.160
But for the last three years, I’ve had what I consider to be

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.160
the best job in the entire universe, which is to put my hobby --

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
which is, you know, fragrance and all the magnificent things --

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.160
plus a little bit of biophysics, a small amount of self-taught chemistry

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.160
at the service of something that actually works.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.160
Thank you very much.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160
(Applause)
