(Applause)

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
(Video) Announcer: Threats, in the wake of Bin Laden's death, have spiked.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Announcer Two: Famine in Somalia. Announcer Three: Police pepper spray.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Announcer Four: Vicious cartels. Announcer Five: Caustic cruise lines.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Announcer Six: Societal decay. Announcer Seven: 65 dead.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Announcer Eight: Tsunami warning. Announcer Nine: Cyberattacks.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Multiple Announcers: Drug war. Mass destruction. Tornado.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
Recession. Default. Doomsday. Egypt. Syria.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Crisis. Death. Disaster.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Oh, my God.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Peter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I collected over the last six months --

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
could have easily been the last six days

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
or the last six years.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
The point is that the news media

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
preferentially feeds us negative stories

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
because that's what our minds pay attention to.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
And there's a very good reason for that.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Every second of every day,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
our senses bring in way too much data

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
than we can possibly process in our brains.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And because nothing is more important to us

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
than survival,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
the first stop of all of that data

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
called the amygdala.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Now the amygdala is our early warning detector,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
our danger detector.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
It sorts and scours through all of the information

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
looking for anything in the environment that might harm us.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
So given a dozen news stories,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
we will preferentially look

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
at the negative news.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And that old newspaper saying,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
"If it bleeds it leads,"

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
is very true.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
So given all of our digital devices

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
that are bringing all the negative news to us

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
seven days a week, 24 hours a day,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
it's no wonder that we're pessimistic.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
It's no wonder that people think

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.260
that the world is getting worse.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
But perhaps that's not the case.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Perhaps instead,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
it's the distortions brought to us

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
of what's really going on.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
over the last century

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
by a series of forces

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
are, in fact, accelerating to a point

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
that we have the potential in the next three decades

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
to create a world of abundance.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Now I'm not saying

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
we don't have our set of problems --

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
climate crisis, species extinction,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
water and energy shortage -- we surely do.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And as humans, we are far better

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
at seeing the problems way in advance,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.260
but ultimately we knock them down.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
So let's look

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
at what this last century has been

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
to see where we're going.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Over the last hundred years,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
the average human lifespan has more than doubled,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
average per capita income adjusted for inflation

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
around the world has tripled.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Childhood mortality

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
has come down a factor of 10.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Add to that the cost of food, electricity,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
transportation, communication

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.260
have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Steve Pinker has showed us

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
that, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
in human history.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And Charles Kenny

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
in the last 130 years.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
We truly are living in an extraordinary time.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And many people forget this.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
In fact, we redefine what poverty means.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Think of this, in America today,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
the majority of people under the poverty line

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
still have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
television, mobile phones,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
air conditioning and cars.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
The wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
could have never dreamed of such luxuries.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Underpinning much of this

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
is technology,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and of late,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
exponentially growing technologies.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
My good friend Ray Kurzweil

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
showed that any tool that becomes an information technology

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and experiences price performance doubling

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
every 12 to 24 months.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
That's why the cellphone in your pocket

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
than a supercomputer of the '70s.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Now look at this curve.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
I want you to notice two things from this curve.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Number one, how smooth it is --

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
through good time and bad time, war time and peace time,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
recession, depression and boom time.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
This is the result of faster computers

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
being used to build faster computers.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.260
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
And also, even though it's plotted

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
on a log curve on the left,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
it's curving upwards.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
The rate at which the technology is getting faster

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
is itself getting faster.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
And on this curve, riding on Moore's Law,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
available to all of us.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Cloud computing,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing;

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
sensors and networks; robotics;

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
personalized production around the planet;

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
synthetic biology;

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
fuels, vaccines and foods;

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
digital medicine; nanomaterials; and A.I.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
I mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
by IBM's Watson?

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
I mean, that was epic.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
In fact, I scoured the headlines

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And I love this: "Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents."

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Jeopardy's not an easy game.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
It's about the nuance of human language.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And imagine if you would

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
A.I.'s like this on the cloud

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
available to every person with a cellphone.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Four years ago here at TED,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
called Singularity University.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
And we teach our students all of these technologies,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and particularly how they can be used

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
to solve humanity's grand challenges.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
And every year we ask them

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
to start a company or a product or a service

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
that can affect positively the lives of a billion people

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
within a decade.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Think about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
can touch the lives of a billion people today.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Today we can point at dozens of companies

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
that have done just that.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.260
When I think about creating abundance,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet;

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
it's about creating a life of possibility.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
It is about taking that which was scarce

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and making it abundant.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
You see, scarcity is contextual,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and technology is a resource-liberating force.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Let me give you an example.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
So this is a story of Napoleon III

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
in the mid-1800s.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
He's the dude on the left.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
He invited over to dinner

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
the king of Siam.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
All of Napoleon's troops

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
were fed with silver utensils,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Napoleon himself with gold utensils.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
But the King of Siam,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
he was fed with aluminum utensils.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
You see, aluminum

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
was the most valuable metal on the planet,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
worth more than gold and platinum.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
is made of aluminum.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
You see, even though aluminum

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
it doesn't come as a pure metal.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
It's all bound by oxygen and silicates.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
But then the technology of electrolysis came along

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
and literally made aluminum so cheap

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
that we use it with throw-away mentality.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.260
So let's project this analogy going forward.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
We think about energy scarcity.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
we are on a planet

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
than we use in a year.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.260
every 88 minutes.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
It's not about being scarce,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
it's about accessibility.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
And there's good news here.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
For the first time, this year

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
the cost of solar-generated electricity

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.260
is 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India --

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
Last month, MIT put out a study

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
showing that by the end of this decade,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
in the sunny parts of the United States,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
compared to 15 cents

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
as a national average.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
And if we have abundant energy,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
we also have abundant water.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Now we talk about water wars.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Do you remember

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
back towards the Earth,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
in 1990 after it just passed Saturn?

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
He took a famous photo. What was it called?

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
"A Pale Blue Dot."

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Because we live on a water planet.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Yes, 97.5 percent is saltwater,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
two percent is ice,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
but here too there is hope.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And there is technology coming online,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
not 10, 20 years from now,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
right now.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
There's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
one of the great DIY innovators,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
I'd like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so --

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
his technology called Slingshot

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
that many of you may have heard of,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
It's able to generate

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
out of any source -- saltwater, polluted water, latrine --

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
at less than two cents a liter.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
The chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
to do a major test

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
of hundreds of units of this in the developing world.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
And if that pans out,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
which I have every confidence it will,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Coca-Cola will deploy this globally

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
to 206 countries

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
around the planet.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
This is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.260
that exists today.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
And we've seen this in cellphones.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
My goodness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetration

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
of cellphones in the developing world

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
by the end of 2013.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Think about it,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
has better mobile comm

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
than President Reagan did 25 years ago.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
And if they're on a smartphone on Google,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
they've got access to more knowledge and information

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
than President Clinton did 15 years ago.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
They're living in a world of information and communication abundance

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
that no one could have ever predicted.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Better than that,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
the things that you and I

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for --

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
GPS, HD video and still images,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
libraries of books and music,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
medical diagnostic technology --

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
into your cellphone.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
Probably the best part of it

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
is what's coming down the pike in health.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.260
something called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
We're challenging teams around the world

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
to basically combine these technologies

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
into a mobile device

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
that you can speak to, because it's got A.I.,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
you can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.260
than a team of board-certified doctors.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
So literally, imagine this device

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
25 percent of the disease burden

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and 1.3 percent of the health care workers.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
that it doesn't recognize,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
it calls the CDC

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
But here, here is the biggest force

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
for bringing about a world of abundance.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
I call it the rising billion.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
So the white lines here are population.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
And by the way,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
the biggest protection against a population explosion

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
is making the world educated

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
and healthy.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
In 2010,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
we had just short of two billion people

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
online, connected.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
By 2020,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
that's going from two billion to five billion

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
Internet users.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
Three billion new minds

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
who have never been heard from before

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.260
are connecting to the global conversation.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
What will these people want?

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
What will they consume? What will they desire?

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
And rather than having economic shutdown,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
These people represent

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
tens of trillions of dollars

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
injected into the global economy.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
And they will get healthier

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
by using the Tricorder,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
and by literally being able to use

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
3D printing and infinite computing

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
[become] more productive than ever before.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
So what could three billion rising,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
healthy, educated, productive members of humanity

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
bring to us?

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
What about giving the oppressed,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
wherever they might be,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
the voice to be heard and the voice to act

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
for the first time ever?

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
What will these three billion people bring?

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
What about contributions we can't even predict?

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
The one thing I've learned at the X Prize

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
is that small teams

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
driven by their passion with a clear focus

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
can do extraordinary things,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
things that large corporations and governments

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
could only do in the past.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
Let me share and close with a story

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
that really got me excited.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
There is a program that some of you might have heard of.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
It's a game called Foldit.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.260
It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
And this is a game

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.260
where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and figure out how the protein is going to fold.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
And it's very important for research in medicine.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
And up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
And this game has been played

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
by university professors and so forth.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
And it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
came online and started playing it.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
And it showed that, in fact, today,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
the human pattern recognition machinery

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
is better at folding proteins than the best computers.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
And when these individuals went and looked

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
at who was the best protein folder in the world,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
it wasn't an MIT professor,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
it wasn't a CalTech student,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
it was a person from England, from Manchester,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.260
a woman who, during the day,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.260
and, at night, was the world's best protein folder.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
what gives me tremendous confidence

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.260
in the future

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.260
is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
to take on the grand challenges of this planet.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
We have the tools with this exponential technology.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
We have the passion of the DIY innovator.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
We have the capital of the techno-philanthropist.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
And we have three billion new minds

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
coming online to work with us

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
to solve the grand challenges,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.260
to do that which we must do.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
We are living into extraordinary decades ahead.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
Thank you.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:16:08.260
(Applause)
