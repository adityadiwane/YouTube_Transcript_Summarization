00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Images like this, from the Auschwitz concentration camp,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and have given us a new understanding of who we are,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
where we've come from and the times we live in.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
During the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocities

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and the daily horrors of Iraq.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This has led to a common understanding of our situation,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence, and perhaps

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from, to our peril.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Here is an example

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
from an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globe

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
a couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, "The Indian life

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
was a difficult one, but there were no employment problems,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
community harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
crime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribes

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
or wholesale slaughter." Now, you're all familiar with this treacle.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We teach it to our children. We hear it on television

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and in storybooks. Now, the original title of this session

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
was, "Everything You Know Is Wrong," and I'm going to present evidence

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that, in fact, our ancestors were far more violent than we are,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now, in the decade of Darfur and Iraq,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and obscene. But I'm going to try to convince you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that that is the correct picture. The decline of violence

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
over centuries, over decades and over years,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees it

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
all over the world, although not homogeneously.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It's especially evident in the West, beginning with England

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
from the millennium scale to the year scale --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to try to persuade you of this. Until 10,000 years ago, all humans

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
lived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
or government. And this is the state that's commonly thought

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Lawrence Keeley, looking at casualty rates

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
among contemporary hunter-gatherers, which is our best source

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
of evidence about this way of life, has shown a rather different conclusion.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Here is a graph that he put together

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in a number of foraging, or hunting and gathering societies.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
at the hands of another man, as opposed to passing away

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
of natural causes, in a variety of foraging societies

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
at the hands of another man to, in the case of the Gebusi,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
only a 15 percent chance. The tiny, little blue bar in the lower

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
left-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and Europe in the twentieth century, and includes all the deaths

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
of both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
during the 20th century, there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Also at the millennium scale, we can look

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
in the Bible. And in this supposed source of our moral values,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
such as the following from Numbers 31: "And they warred

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and they slew all the males. And Moses said unto them,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
'Have you saved all the women alive? Now, therefore, kill every male

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
by lying with him, but all the women children that have not know a man

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'" In other words,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
kill the men; kill the children; if you see any virgins,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Also in the Bible, one sees that the death penalty

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, talking back to your parents --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
(Laughter) -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Well, let's click the zoom lens

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
down one order of magnitude, and look at the century scale.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughout

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the Middle Ages to modern times,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
we know just from conventional history -- the evidence

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
in socially sanctioned forms of violence.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
For example, any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
were routine forms of criminal punishment. The kind of infraction

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
today that would give you a fine, in those days would result in

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
your tongue being cut out, your ears being cut off, you being blinded,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
a hand being chopped off and so on.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment:

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
burning at the stake, disemboweling, breaking on the wheel,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
being pulled apart by horses and so on.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes:

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
criticizing the king, stealing a loaf of bread. Slavery, of course,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
was the preferred labor-saving device, and cruelty was

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
a popular form of entertainment. Perhaps the most vivid example

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
was the practice of cat burning, in which a cat was hoisted

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat, howling in pain,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
was burned to death.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
What about one-on-one murder? Well, there, there are good statistics,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
because many municipalities recorded the cause of death.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
The criminologist Manuel Eisner

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
scoured all of the historical records across Europe

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
for homicide rates in any village, hamlet, town, county

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that he could find, and he supplemented them

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
with national data, when nations started keeping statistics.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000
He plotted on a logarithmic scale, going from 100 deaths

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
per 100,000 people per year, which was approximately the rate

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets down

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
to less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
in seven or eight European countries. Then, there is a slight uptick

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
in the 1960s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Let's click down now to the decade scale.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
According to non-governmental organizations

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
that keep such statistics, since 1945, in Europe and the Americas,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
there has been a steep decline in interstate wars,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms, and in military coups,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
even in South America. Worldwide, there's been a steep decline

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
in deaths in interstate wars. The yellow bars here show the number

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And, as you can see, the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
per conflict per year in this decade, as horrific as it is.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Even in the year scale, one can see a decline of violence.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Since the end of the Cold War, there have been fewer civil wars,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
fewer genocides -- indeed, a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. You can see

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
then it soared upward for several decades, and began

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
a precipitous decline, starting in the 1990s, so that it went back

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to the level that was last enjoyed in 1960.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
President Clinton, if you're here, thank you.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
(Laughter)

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So the question is, why are so many people so wrong

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
about something so important? I think there are a number of reasons.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
One of them is we have better reporting. The Associated Press

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
than sixteenth-century monks were.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
There's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
to recall specific instances of something,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
the higher the probability that you assign to it.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
in their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinion

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and advocacy markets: no one ever attracted observers, advocates

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and donors by saying

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
things just seem to be getting better and better.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
(Laughter)

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
in modern intellectual life, and an unwillingness to acknowledge

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
there could be anything good about Western culture.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And of course, our change in standards can outpace the change

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
in behavior. One of the reasons violence went down

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
That's a process that seems to be continuing,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
things always look more barbaric than they would have been

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
by historic standards. So today, we get exercised -- and rightly so --

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
in Texas after a 15-year appeal process. We don't consider

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
that a couple of hundred years ago, they may have been burned

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that lasted 10 minutes, and indeed, that that would have been repeated

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
over and over again. Today, we look at capital punishment

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
as evidence of how low our behavior can sink,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
rather than how high our standards have risen.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Well, why has violence declined? No one really knows,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
but I have read four explanations, all of which, I think,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
have some grain of plausibility. The first is, maybe

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Thomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
that life in a state of nature was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and short." Not because, he argued,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
humans have some primordial thirst for blood

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
but because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
before they invade you. More recently, Thomas Schelling

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
in the basement. Being a good American, he has a pistol

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
in the nightstand, pulls out his gun, and walks down the stairs.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Now, each one of them is thinking,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
"I don't really want to kill that guy, but he's about to kill me.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Maybe I had better shoot him, before he shoots me,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
especially since, even if he doesn't want to kill me,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
he's probably worrying right now that I might kill him

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
before he kills me." And so on.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Now, one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
You don't strike first, but you have a publicly announced policy

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
The only thing is that it's

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
liable to having its bluff called, and therefore can only work

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
if it's credible. To make it credible, you must avenge all insults

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and settle all scores, which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Life becomes an episode of "The Sopranos." Hobbes' solution,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
the "Leviathan," was that if authority for the legitimate use

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan --

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
because any kind of aggression will be punished,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
leaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
to invade preemptively, out of fear of them attacking you first.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
to make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore, it would lead

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
to a state of peace. Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
that you failed to see in the earlier slide --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
coincided with the rise of centralized states.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
in zones of anarchy, in failed states, collapsed empires,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
frontier regions, mafias, street gangs and so on.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
The second explanation is that in many times and places,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
In earlier times, when suffering and early death were common

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
in one's own life, one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
on others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
longer and more pleasant, one puts a higher value on life in general.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and was worked out in the book "Nonzero" by the journalist

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Robert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
in an interaction, such as gains in trade when two parties trade

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
their surpluses and both come out ahead, or when two parties

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
that results in them not having to fight the whole time.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Wright argues that technology has increased the number

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
of positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
by allowing the trade of goods, services and ideas

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
over longer distances and among larger groups of people.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
"Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
the Japanese is that they built my mini-van."

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
(Laughter)

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
called "The Expanding Circle," by the philosopher Peter Singer,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
of empathy, an ability to treat other peoples' interests

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
as comparable to one's own. Unfortunately, by default

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
People outside that circle are treated as sub-human,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and can be exploited with impunity. But, over history,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
the circle has expanded. One can see, in historical record,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
it expanding from the village, to the clan, to the tribe,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
to the nation, to other races, to both sexes,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and, in Singer's own arguments, something that we should extend

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
to other sentient species. The question is,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
if this has happened, what has powered that expansion?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And there are a number of possibilities, such as increasing circles

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
The logic of the golden rule -- the more you think about and interact

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
with other people, the more you realize that it is untenable

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
to privilege your interests over theirs,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
at least not if you want them to listen to you. You can't say

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
that my interests are special compared to yours,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
anymore than you can say that the particular spot

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
that I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
because I happen to be standing on it that very minute.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism, by histories,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and journalism, and memoirs, and realistic fiction, and travel,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
and literacy, which allows you to project yourself into the lives

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
in life, the sense that "there but for fortune go I."

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Whatever its causes, the decline of violence, I think,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
has profound implications. It should force us to ask not just, why

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
is there war? But also, why is there peace? Not just,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
what are we doing wrong? But also, what have we been doing right?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Because we have been doing something right,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
and it sure would be good to find out what it is.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:18.000
(Applause).

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Chris Anderson: I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
that that expansion of -- that you were talking about,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
that Peter Singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
by greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the world

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
is therefore getting smaller. I mean, is that also a grain of truth?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Steven Pinker: Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
over larger and larger circles. But also, I think it helps us

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
imagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you read

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages, you think,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
how could they possibly have done it,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
how could they have not have empathized with the person

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
that they're disemboweling? But clearly,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
as far as they're concerned, this is just an alien being

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
that does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything, I think,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
that makes it easier to imagine trading places

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
to that other person.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
CA: Well, Steve, I would love every news media owner to hear that talk

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
at some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
SP: My pleasure.
