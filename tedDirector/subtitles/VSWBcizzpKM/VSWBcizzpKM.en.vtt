00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This morning, the world's experts

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
from I guess three or four different companies on building seats,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I could have told them that.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
(Laughter)

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
they will be steering cars by wire,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
without all that mechanical stuff.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
(Laughter)

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That's reassuring.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
(Applause)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to get rid of all that mechanical stuff.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I would love to talk about the technology,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
about what's in here.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
it would be that from the time we started building this,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the big idea wasn't the technology.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in the iBOT for the disabled community.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
to a fairly big problem in transportation.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You never know what strikes the fancy of whom,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
What I don't think most people think about

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
is the context of how technology is applied.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
lived either on farms or in small towns.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So, the car --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It was half as long.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because you can imagine what the roads look like

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
when you have a million horses,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and a million of them urinating and doing other things,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And it is certainly a wonder.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
who's been very supportive of us --

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But think about where the world is today.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
That's 3.2 billion people.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We've solved all the transportation problems

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough;

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
we found a new continent.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that we turned the continent into a country.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Over the last hundred years, we started building cars,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in an extraordinarily efficient way,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
But during that entire process, more and more people have been born,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and more and more people are moving to cities.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
into cities in the next decade and a half.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And if you just look at how technology has been applied,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
large-weight problems of moving things around.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Nobody would want to give them up.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
The fact is, the last mile is the problem,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and half the world now lives in dense cities.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And people spend, depending on who they are,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and almost all particulate pollution on this planet

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And again, I say that not to attack any industry,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
are extraordinarily efficient,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
both from an engineering point of view,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And we all love our cars, and I do.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
It's not sustainable.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles;

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
1.7 million people used cars.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks --

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
it isn't sustainable environmentally;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and it's not sustainable politically.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I mean, what are we fighting over right now?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
but once we made this, we instantly decided

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And every one of those industries, by the way --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
cities that were architected and built for people --

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
now have a footprint that,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
while we've solved every other transportation problem --

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and it's like Moore's law.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
then on a railroad, then an airplane.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Every other form of transportation's been improved.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
They've gotten bigger; they're spread out.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The 20 largest cities in the world.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
what we take for granted as we now go between cities?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
environmentally friendly?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
What if it would make it a little bit more palatable

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and use our cars the way we want,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and then have our cities energized again?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
We thought it would be really neat to do that,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and one of the problems we really were worried about

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I don't look like a motor vehicle.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I have the same footprint as a pedestrian;

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I have the same unique capability

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I took this down to Ground Zero,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Or maybe we should be out in the street

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
We've been so concerned about that,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
we went to the Postmaster General of the United States,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
as the first person we ever showed on the outside,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously."

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
He agreed. We went to a number of police departments

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
that want their police officers back in the neighborhood

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
(Laughter)

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So we've been working really, really hard,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We went out and we found some visionary people

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
with enough money to let us design and build these things,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
But if I could ask you to do one thing,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
it's not to think about it as a piece of technology,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
which can go 60 miles an hour,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
that can bring you everywhere you want to go,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and it's broken, and it doesn't work.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
One of the more exciting things that occurred to us

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
A few weeks ago, after we launched it,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and he's marveling at the technology,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and skateboarders are zipping by,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
a little old lady -- came by me --

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and says, "Can I try that?"

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And so I said, "Sure."

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and she turns back around, and she's all smiles.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
"Finally, they made something for us."

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And the camera is looking down at her.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I'm thinking, "Wow, that was great --

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
(Laughter)

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
-- please lady, don't say another word."

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
(Laughter)

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And the camera is down at her,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and this guy has to put the microphone in her face,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
said, "What do you mean by that?"

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And I figured, "It's all over now,"

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and she looks up and she says, "Well,"

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
she's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
she says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades,"

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
she knew them by name;

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
she says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle."

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things."

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and the legislators might not get it --

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
not to invade the most precious little bit of space left,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
the sidewalks in these cities.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and then the other eight feet -- it's --

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
that little piece is all that's there.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
But she looks up and says this,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool --

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
so I guess subliminally I was worried

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
that it's the older population that's going to worry.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
call AARP, get an appointment right away.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
We've got to show them this thing.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And they took it to Washington; they showed them;

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and they're going to be involved now,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
help re-energize their downtown.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000
(Applause)

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
or any of the other think tanks --

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
will be in cities.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
They learned to start with cell phones.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
They start at the top of the technology food chain.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
We've got to start building cities and human environments

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
in a dense, rich, green-space environment,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Cars were not meant for parallel parking;

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it:

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
You do it in your sneakers.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Not much has changed.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times --

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes --

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train --

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail --

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
or you're going to keep parking those cars.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
But if you could put a pin in most cities,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
re-park your car and go somewhere;

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
you can't get to a cab or a subway.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
We could change the way people allocate their resources,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
the way this planet uses its energy,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
make it more fun.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine;

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Yes, it could be attached to this,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
and yes, on a kilogram of propane,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
because some of you might be skeptical

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
about the capability of this to have an impact,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
We've been working on this,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
actually, as an alternative energy source,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
starting way back with Johnson &amp; Johnson, to run an iBOT,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
because the best batteries you could get --

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline --

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
which is why nobody drives electric cars.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency --

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
can run computers and a light bulb.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt --

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
or clean water in this country that way.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Depending on whose numbers you believe,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
We need water.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
or watching their kids die.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
then using a little bit of the electricity control that process,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
from anything that comes into it to cool it.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
So if we put this box on here in a few years,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
could we have a solution to transportation, electricity,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
and communication, and maybe drinkable water

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
I don't know, but we'll try it.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I better shut up.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:14.000
(Applause)
