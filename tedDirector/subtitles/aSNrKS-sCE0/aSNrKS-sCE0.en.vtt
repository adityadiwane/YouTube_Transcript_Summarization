00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I was trying to think, how is sync connected to happiness,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.330
and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
We like to dance together, we like singing together.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.330
And so, if you'll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.330
with a first experiment today. The experiment is --

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
and I notice, by the way, that when you applauded,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
that you did it in a typical North American way,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.330
that is, you were raucous and incoherent.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.330
You were not organized. It didn't even occur to you to clap in unison.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
Do you think you could do it? I would like to see if this audience would --

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
no, you haven't practiced, as far as I know --

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
can you get it together to clap in sync?

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:13.330
(Clapping)

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
Whoa! Now, that's what we call emergent behavior.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
(Laughter)

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.330
So I didn't expect that, but -- I mean, I expected you could synchronize.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
It didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
It's interesting.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
(Laughter)

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.330
So what do we make of that? First of all, we know that you're all brilliant.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.330
This is a room full of intelligent people, highly sensitive.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
Some trained musicians out there.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
Is that what enabled you to synchronize?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
So to put the question a little more seriously,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.330
let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
for spontaneous synchronization.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330
Do you need, for instance, to be as smart as you are?

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.330
Do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize?

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.330
Do you need to be alive? I mean, that's a spooky thought, right?

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.330
Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.330
It's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.330
if not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.330
It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.330
It's a deep tendency toward order in nature

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
I mean, I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it's not.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
But there is a countervailing force in the universe --

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.330
the tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that's our theme.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.330
Now, to get into that, let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.330
when you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.330
which is the glorious example of birds that flock together,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
or fish swimming in organized schools.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.330
So these are not particularly intelligent creatures,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
and yet, as we'll see, they exhibit beautiful ballets.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
This is from a BBC show called "Predators,"

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.330
and what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
When you're small and vulnerable, like these starlings,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.330
or like the fish, it helps to swarm to avoid predators, to confuse predators.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
For a long time, biologists were puzzled by this behavior,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
wondering how it could be possible.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
We're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
These creatures are not choreographed.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
They're choreographing themselves.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
And only today is science starting to figure out how it works.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.330
I'll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin, a researcher at Oxford,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
that shows how swarms work.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
There are just three simple rules.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.330
First, all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
Second, all the individuals have a tendency to line up.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
And third, they're all attracted to each other,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
but they try to keep a small distance apart.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
And when you build those three rules in,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
automatically you start to see swarms

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.330
Now, fish like to stay close together, about a body length apart.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.330
But except for that difference, the rules are the same for both.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
Now, all this changes when a predator enters the scene.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.330
There's a fourth rule: when a predator's coming, get out of the way.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
Here on the model you see the predator attacking.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
The prey move out in random directions,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
so there's this constant splitting and reforming.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
And you see that in nature.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.330
Keep in mind that, although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.330
what's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.330
Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.330
That is, out of the desire to save itself,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
each creature is following these rules,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
and that leads to something that's safe for all of them.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
Even though it looks like they're thinking as a group, they're not.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
You might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
so you can think of several.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.330
As I say, if you're in a swarm, your odds of being the unlucky one

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.330
are reduced as compared to a small group.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
There are many eyes to spot danger.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:55.330
And you'll see in the example with the starlings, with the birds,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
that actually waves of panic can propagate,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
sending messages over great distances.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:11.330
You'll see -- let's see, it's coming up possibly at the very end -- maybe not.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
Information can be sent over half a kilometer away

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
in a very short time through this mechanism.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
Yes, it's happening here.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
See if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.330
It's beautiful. The birds are, we sort of understand, we think,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
from that computer model, what's going on.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
As I say, it's just those three simple rules,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
plus the one about watch out for predators.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
We don't, however, really understand at a mathematical level.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.330
I'm a mathematician. We would like to be able to understand better.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
I mean, I showed you a computer model, but a computer is not understanding.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
A computer is, in a way, just another experiment.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.330
We would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.330
and to understand, you know, exactly where this organization comes from.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
How do the rules give rise to the patterns?

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
There is one case that we have begun to understand better,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.330
and it's the case of fireflies.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
If you see fireflies in North America,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
like so many North American sorts of things,

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.330
they tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
They each do their own thing, flashing on and off,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
paying no attention to their neighbors.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.330
But in Southeast Asia -- places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo --

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:30.330
there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
You can see it every night along the river banks.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.330
The trees, mangrove trees, are filled with fireflies communicating with light.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.330
Specifically, it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.330
in perfect synchrony, to reinforce a message to the females.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.330
And the message, as you can imagine, is "Come hither. Mate with me."

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:58.330
(Music)

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.330
In a second I'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
so that you can get a sense. This is a single frame.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:11.330
Then on, and then off -- a 30th of a second, there.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.330
And then watch this whole river bank, and watch how precise the synchrony is.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.330
On, more on and then off.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
The combined light from these beetles -- these are actually tiny beetles --

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.330
is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.330
as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It's stunning.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
For a long time it was not believed

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
when the first Western travelers, like Sir Francis Drake,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.330
went to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
No one believed them.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
We don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
And for a long time, even after it was documented,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.330
that explained it, or, you know, a human being's tendency

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
to see patterns where there are none.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
But I hope you've convinced yourself now, with this nighttime video,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
that they really were very well synchronized.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
Okay, well, the issue then is, do we need to be alive

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
to see this kind of spontaneous order,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
and I've already hinted that the answer is no.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
Well, you don't have to be a whole creature.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
You can even be just a single cell.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
Like, take, for instance, your pacemaker cells in your heart right now.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
They're keeping you alive.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:35.330
Every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region, the sinoatrial node,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.330
which has about 10,000 independent cells that would each beep,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
have an electrical rhythm -- a voltage up and down --

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
to send a signal to the ventricles to pump.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.330
Now, your pacemaker is not a single cell.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.330
It's this democracy of 10,000 cells that all have to fire in unison

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
for the pacemaker to work correctly.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.330
I don't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:02.330
If you have epilepsy, there is an instance of billions of brain cells, or at least millions,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
discharging in pathological concert.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.330
So this tendency towards order is not always a good thing.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
You don't have to be alive. You don't have to be even a single cell.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.330
If you look, for instance, at how lasers work,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.330
that would be a case of atomic synchrony.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.330
In a laser, what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
is that this light is incoherent --

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
many different colors and different frequencies,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
sort of like the way you clapped initially --

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
but if you were a laser, it would be rhythmic applause.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
It would be all atoms pulsating in unison,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
emitting light of one color, one frequency.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
Now comes the very risky part of my talk,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.330
which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
Hold your breath for me.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.330
What I have here are two empty water bottles.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
This is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:03.330
This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.330
I have some metronomes here.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
Can you hear that?

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
All right, so, I've got a metronome,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.330
and it's the world's smallest metronome, the -- well, I shouldn't advertise.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.330
Anyway, so this is the world's smallest metronome.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
I've set it on the fastest setting, and I'm going to now take

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
another one set to the same setting.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
We can try this first. If I just put them on the table together,

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
there's no reason for them to synchronize, and they probably won't.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.330
Maybe you'd better listen to them. I'll stand here.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.330
What I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
because their frequencies aren't perfectly the same.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
Right? They did.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
They were in sync for a while, but then they drifted apart.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
And the reason is that they're not able to communicate.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
Now, you might think that's a bizarre idea.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
How can metronomes communicate?

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.330
Well, they can communicate through mechanical forces.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
So I'm going to give them a chance to do that.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.330
I also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate?

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
I'm going to put them on a movable platform,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:33.330
which is the "Guide to Graduate Study at Cornell." Okay? So here it is.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
Let's see if we can get this to work.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.330
My wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
because otherwise the whole thing will tip over.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:50.330
All right. So there we go. Let's see. OK, I'm not trying to cheat --

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:55.330
let me start them out of sync. No, hard to even do that.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.330
(Applause)

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:17.330
All right. So before any one goes out of sync, I'll just put those right there.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.330
(Laughter)

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
Now, that might seem a bit whimsical,

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:25.330
but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.330
sometimes has unexpected consequences.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
And a clear case of that,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
was something that happened in London in the year 2000.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
The Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London --

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.330
a beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames,

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.330
first river crossing in over 100 years in London.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
There was a big competition for the design of this bridge,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.330
and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team --

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.330
in the TED spirit, actually -- of an architect --

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.330
perhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom, Lord Norman Foster --

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:04.330
working with an artist, a sculptor, Sir Anthony Caro,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:08.330
and an engineering firm, Ove Arup.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.330
And together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision,

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.330
which was -- he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.330
and he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss,

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.330
he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.330
He would shoot his light saber across the abyss, making a blade of light,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
and then scamper across on this blade of light.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
He said, "That's the vision I want to give to London.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
I want a blade of light across the Thames."

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
So they built the blade of light,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:43.330
and it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's --

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.330
probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.330
with cables that are out on the side.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.330
You're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.330
These cables were on the side of the bridge,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.330
like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames --

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.330
that's what's holding up this bridge.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
Now, everyone was very excited to try it out.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:08.330
On opening day, thousands of Londoners came out, and something happened.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.330
And within two days the bridge was closed to the public.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.330
So I want to first show you some interviews with people

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.330
who were on the bridge on opening day, who will describe what happened.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:25.330
Man: It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.330
rather like being on the boat.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.330
Woman: Yeah, it felt unstable, and it was very windy,

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:35.330
and I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides, so you could definitely --

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.330
there was something going on sideways, it felt, maybe.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.330
Interviewer: Not up and down? Boy: No.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.330
Interviewer: And not forwards and backwards? Boy: No.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.330
Interviewer: Just sideways. About how much was it moving, do you think?

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.330
Boy: It was about --

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.330
Interviewer: I mean, that much, or this much?

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.330
Boy: About the second one.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.330
Interviewer: This much? Boy: Yeah.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.330
Man: It was at least six, six to eight inches, I would have thought.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.330
Interviewer: Right, so, at least this much? Man: Oh, yes.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.330
Woman: I remember wanting to get off.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.330
Interviewer: Oh, did you? Woman: Yeah. It felt odd.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:08.330
Interviewer: So it was enough to be scary? Woman: Yeah, but I thought that was just me.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.330
Interviewer: Ah! Now, tell me why you had to do this?

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.330
Boy: We had to do this because, to keep in balance

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.330
because if you didn't keep your balance,

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:21.330
then you would just fall over about, like, to the left or right, about 45 degrees.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.330
Interviewer: So just show me how you walk normally. Right.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:31.330
And then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. Right.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.330
So you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and --

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.330
oh, and short steps?

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.330
Man: That's right. And it seemed obvious to me

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.330
that it was probably the number of people on it.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.330
Interviewer: Were they deliberately walking in step, or anything like that?

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.330
Man: No, they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.330
Steven Strogatz: All right, so that already gives you a hint of what happened.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:59.330
Think of the bridge as being like this platform.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.330
Think of the people as being like metronomes.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.330
Now, you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome,

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.330
but after all, we do walk like -- I mean, we oscillate back and forth as we walk.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.330
And especially if we start to walk like those people did, right?

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:16.330
They all showed this strange sort of skating gait

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.330
that they adopted once the bridge started to move.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.330
And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.330
But also, after you see the bridge on opening day, you'll see an interesting clip

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:31.330
of work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.330
who figured out what happened on the bridge,

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.330
and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:41.330
It was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.330
between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.330
that engineers knew nothing about.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.330
Actually, I think the first person you'll see

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.330
is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.330
(Video) Interviewer: Did anyone get hurt? Engineer: No.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.330
Interviewer: Right. So it was quite small -- Engineer: Yes. Interviewer: -- but real?

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.330
Engineer: Absolutely. Interviewer: You thought, "Oh, bother."

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.330
Engineer: I felt I was disappointed about it.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:08.330
We'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge, and we'd analyzed it,

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.330
we'd checked it to codes -- to heavier loads than the codes --

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.330
and here it was doing something that we didn't know about.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.330
Interviewer: You didn't expect. Engineer: Exactly.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.330
Narrator: The most dramatic and shocking footage

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.330
shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people --

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.330
apparently rocking from side to side in unison,

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.330
not only with each other, but with the bridge.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.330
This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.330
But how could the crowd become synchronized?

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.330
Was there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect?

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.330
This was to be the focus of the investigation.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:48.330
Interviewer: Well, at last the simulated bridge is finished, and I can make it wobble.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:53.330
Now, Allan, this is all your fault, isn't it? Allan McRobie: Yes.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.330
Interviewer: You designed this, yes, this simulated bridge,

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.330
and this, you reckon, mimics the action of the real bridge?

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.330
AM: It captures a lot of the physics, yes.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.330
Interviewer: Right. So if we get on it, we should be able to wobble it, yes?

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.330
Allan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me,

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.330
suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.330
in the same way as the real bridge --

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.330
provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.330
AM: This one's only a couple of tons, so it's fairly easy to get going.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.330
Just by walking. Interviewer: Well, it's certainly going now.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.330
AM: It doesn't have to be a real dangle. Just walk. It starts to go.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.330
Interviewer: It's actually quite difficult to walk.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.330
You have to be careful where you put your feet down, don't you,

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.330
because if you get it wrong, it just throws you off your feet.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:38.330
AM: It certainly affects the way you walk, yes. You can't walk normally on it.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.330
Interviewer: No. If you try and put one foot in front of another,

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.330
it's moving your feet away from under you. AM: Yes.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.330
Interviewer: So you've got to put your feet out sideways.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.330
So already, the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.330
as our witnesses walked on the real bridge.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.330
AM: ... ice-skating gait. There isn't all this sort of snake way of walking.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.330
Interviewer: For a more convincing experiment,

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.330
I wanted my own opening-day crowd, the sound check team.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.330
Their instructions: just walk normally.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.330
It's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.330
They're all having some difficulty walking.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.330
And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.330
But then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:32.330
You can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step,

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.330
and therefore to drive it to move further.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.330
SS: All right, well, with that from the Ministry of Silly Walks,

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.330
maybe I'd better end. I see I've gone over.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.330
But I hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way,

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.330
to see all the amazing synchrony around us. Thank you.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.330
(Applause)
