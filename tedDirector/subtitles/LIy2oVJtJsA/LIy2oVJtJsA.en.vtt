00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:14.602
Nine years ago, I worked

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:16.799
for the U.S. government in Iraq,

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:19.928
helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:22.565
And I was there, and I worked in that job

00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:24.415
because I believe that technology

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:27.064
can improve people's lives.

00:00:27.064 --> 00:00:29.999
One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.819
at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad,

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:35.558
and he said to me, "You Americans,

00:00:35.558 --> 00:00:36.909
you can put a man on the moon,

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:38.454
but when I get home tonight,

00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:41.310
I won't be able to turn on my lights."

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.967
At the time, the U.S. government had spent

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:45.327
more than two billion dollars

00:00:45.327 --> 00:00:47.684
on electricity reconstruction.

00:00:47.684 --> 00:00:50.856
How do you ensure technology reaches users?

00:00:50.856 --> 00:00:52.836
How do you put it in their hands

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:55.072
so that it is useful?

00:00:55.072 --> 00:00:58.116
So those are the questions that my colleagues and I

00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:00.229
at D-Rev ask ourselves.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.377
And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.

00:01:03.377 --> 00:01:05.971
And I took over the organization four years ago

00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:08.272
and really focused it on developing products

00:01:08.272 --> 00:01:10.460
that actually reach users,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.946
and not just any users,

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:16.001
but customers who live on
less than four dollars a day.

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:17.909
One of the key areas we've been working on recently

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.422
is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious

00:01:20.422 --> 00:01:22.554
that medical devices have something in common

00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:25.120
with Iraq's electricity grid then,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.249
there are some commonalities.

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.958
Despite the advanced technology,

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.726
it's not reaching the people who need it most.

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:35.134
So I'm going to tell you about one of
the projects we've been working on,

00:01:35.134 --> 00:01:38.041
the ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee

00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:40.197
for above-knee amputees.

00:01:40.197 --> 00:01:43.497
And this project started when
the Jaipur Foot Organization,

00:01:43.497 --> 00:01:46.091
the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world,

00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:47.560
came to the Bay Area and they said,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.530
"We need a better knee."

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.678
Chances are, if you're living on
less than four dollars a day,

00:01:53.678 --> 00:01:55.555
and you're an amputee,

00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:57.729
you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.142
Most people think it's land mines,

00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:00.748
but it's a vehicle accident.

00:02:00.748 --> 00:02:02.604
You're walking by the side of the road

00:02:02.604 --> 00:02:04.028
and you're hit by a truck,

00:02:04.028 --> 00:02:05.889
or you're trying to to jump on a moving train,

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:09.873
you're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.

00:02:09.873 --> 00:02:13.038
And the reality is that if
you don't have much money,

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:15.038
like this young named Kamal right here,

00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:17.242
the option you really have

00:02:17.242 --> 00:02:19.806
is a bamboo staff to get around.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.289
And how big a problem is this?

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.215
There's over three million amputees every year

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:28.504
who need a new or replacement knee.

00:02:28.504 --> 00:02:30.373
And what are their options?

00:02:30.373 --> 00:02:32.972
This is a high-end. This is
what we'd call a "smart knee."

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:34.990
It's got a microprocessor inside.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.075
It can pretty much do anything,

00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:38.772
but it's 20,000 dollars,

00:02:38.772 --> 00:02:40.978
and to give you a sense of who wears this,

00:02:40.978 --> 00:02:44.221
veterans, American veterans coming
back from Afghanistan or Iraq

00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:46.547
would be fit with something like this.

00:02:46.547 --> 00:02:49.064
This is a low-end titanium knee.

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:51.541
It's a polycentric knee, and all that that means

00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:53.750
is the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.300
that mimics a natural human knee.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.703
But at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive

00:02:58.703 --> 00:03:01.087
for people like Kamal.

00:03:01.087 --> 00:03:03.680
And lastly, here you see a low-end knee.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.511
This is a knee that's been designed specifically

00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:07.187
for poor people.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.020
And while you have affordability,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.915
you've lost on functionality.

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:13.566
The mechanism here is a single axis,

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:15.815
and a single axis is like a door hinge.

00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:18.100
So you can think about how unstable that would be.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.005
And this is the type of mechanism

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:23.894
that the Jaipur Foot Organization was using
when they were looking for a better knee,

00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:26.251
and I just wanted to give you a sense
of what a leg system looks like,

00:03:26.251 --> 00:03:27.590
because I'm showing you all these knees

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.966
and I imagine it's hard to think 
how it all fits together.

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:32.008
So at the top you have a socket,

00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:33.954
and this fits over someone's residual limb,

00:03:33.954 --> 00:03:36.514
and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.

00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:37.698
And then you have the knee,

00:03:37.698 --> 00:03:39.416
and here I've got a single axis on the knee

00:03:39.416 --> 00:03:41.128
so you can see how it rotates,

00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:45.091
and then a pylon, and then a foot.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.634
And we've been able to develop a knee,

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:49.996
a polycentric knee, so that type of knee

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.571
that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait,

00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:55.314
for 80 dollars retail.

00:03:55.314 --> 00:03:58.878
(Applause)

00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:01.432
But the key is, you can have this great invention,

00:04:01.432 --> 00:04:03.418
you can have this great design, but how do you get it

00:04:03.418 --> 00:04:05.190
to the people who most need it?

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.496
How do you ensure it gets to them
and it improves their lives?

00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:11.432
So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects,

00:04:11.432 --> 00:04:13.816
and we looked at three things that we really believe

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:17.788
gets technologies to customers, to users,

00:04:17.788 --> 00:04:19.164
to people who need it.

00:04:19.164 --> 00:04:21.885
And the first thing is that the product 
needs to be world class.

00:04:21.885 --> 00:04:23.536
It needs to perform on par

00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:26.381
or better than the best products on the market.

00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:28.527
Regardless of your income level,

00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:30.065
you want the most beautiful,

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:32.753
the best product that there is.

00:04:32.753 --> 00:04:36.242
I'm going to show you a video now

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:37.888
of a man named Ash. You can see him walking.

00:04:37.888 --> 00:04:39.800
He's wearing the same knee system here

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.406
with a single axis knee.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.498
And he's doing a 10-meter walk test.

00:04:43.498 --> 00:04:47.313
And you'll notice that he's struggling 
with stability as he's walking.

00:04:47.313 --> 00:04:49.968
And something that's not obvious, that you can't see,

00:04:49.968 --> 00:04:52.555
is that it's psychologically draining

00:04:52.555 --> 00:04:56.337
to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.

00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:58.041
Now this is a video of Kamal.

00:04:58.041 --> 00:05:00.774
You remember Kamal earlier,
holding the bamboo staff.

00:05:00.774 --> 00:05:03.482
He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee,

00:05:03.482 --> 00:05:06.582
and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.

00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:09.998
And you can see his stability is much better.

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.968
So world class isn't just about
technical performance.

00:05:14.968 --> 00:05:18.308
It's also about human performance.

00:05:18.308 --> 00:05:20.166
And most medical devices, we've learned,

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:22.694
as we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners,

00:05:22.694 --> 00:05:24.357
for wealthier economies.

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:27.619
But the reality is our users, our customers,

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:30.172
they do different things. They sit cross-legged more.

00:05:30.172 --> 00:05:33.014
We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.

00:05:33.014 --> 00:05:35.762
And we designed our knee to have
the greatest range of motion

00:05:35.762 --> 00:05:39.846
of almost any other knee on the market.

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:41.576
So the second thing we learned, and this leads

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:43.836
into my second point, which is that we believe

00:05:43.836 --> 00:05:46.553
that products need to be
designed to be user-centric.

00:05:46.553 --> 00:05:49.153
And at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say

00:05:49.153 --> 00:05:51.053
you need to be user-obsessed.

00:05:51.053 --> 00:05:53.773
So it's not just the end user
that you're thinking about,

00:05:53.773 --> 00:05:55.749
but everyone who interacts with the product,

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:58.463
so, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee,

00:05:58.463 --> 00:06:01.631
but also the context in which the knee is being fit.

00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:03.215
What is the local market like?

00:06:03.215 --> 00:06:05.133
How do all these components get to the clinic?

00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:07.455
Do they all get there on time? The supply chain.

00:06:07.455 --> 00:06:09.558
Everything that goes into ensuring

00:06:09.558 --> 00:06:11.541
that this product gets to the end user,

00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:15.962
and it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.

00:06:15.962 --> 00:06:17.828
So I wanted to show you some of the iterations

00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:22.421
we did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee,

00:06:22.421 --> 00:06:24.242
so this is it right here.

00:06:24.242 --> 00:06:25.968
(Clicking)

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:28.186
Notice anything about it?

00:06:28.186 --> 00:06:30.747
It clicks.

00:06:30.747 --> 00:06:33.613
We'd seen that users had actually modified it.

00:06:33.613 --> 00:06:37.125
So do you see that black strip right there?

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:40.117
That's a homemade noise dampener.

00:06:40.117 --> 00:06:42.335
We also saw that our users had modified it

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:43.769
in other ways.

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:45.559
You can see there that that particular amputee,

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:47.788
he had wrapped bandages around the knee.

00:06:47.788 --> 00:06:49.512
He'd made a cosmesis.

00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:51.708
And if you look at the knee,

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:55.162
it's got those pointy edges, right?

00:06:55.162 --> 00:06:57.365
So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt

00:06:57.365 --> 00:06:59.625
or a sari, it's really obvious

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:01.221
that you're wearing a prosthetic limb,

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:05.413
and in societies where there's social
stigma around being disabled,

00:07:05.413 --> 00:07:08.370
people are particularly acute about this.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.686
So I'm going to show you some
of the modifications we did.

00:07:10.686 --> 00:07:13.601
We did a lot of iterations, not just 
around this, but some other things.

00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:16.029
But here we have the version three, 
the ReMotion Knee,

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:17.848
but if you look in here, you can see

00:07:17.848 --> 00:07:22.566
the noise dampener. It's quieter.

00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:26.219
The other thing we did is that
we smoothed the profile.

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:27.651
We made it thinner.

00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:29.359
And something that's not obvious is that we

00:07:29.359 --> 00:07:32.560
designed it for mass production.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.256
And this goes into my last point.

00:07:34.256 --> 00:07:36.227
We really, truly believe that if a product

00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:38.564
is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed,

00:07:38.564 --> 00:07:40.399
it needs to be market-driven,

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:43.644
and market-driven means that products are sold.

00:07:43.644 --> 00:07:46.767
They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:48.980
Our product needs to be designed to offer value

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.281
to the end user.

00:07:50.281 --> 00:07:52.460
It also has to be designed to be very affordable.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.634
But a product that is valued by a customer

00:07:54.634 --> 00:07:56.345
is used by a customer,

00:07:56.345 --> 00:07:58.518
and use is what creates impact.

00:07:58.518 --> 00:08:00.277
And we believe that as designers,

00:08:00.277 --> 00:08:03.507
it holds us accountable to our customers.

00:08:03.507 --> 00:08:06.123
And with centralized manufacturing,

00:08:06.123 --> 00:08:08.150
you can control the quality control,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.878
and you can hit that $80 price point

00:08:09.878 --> 00:08:12.368
with profit margins built in.

00:08:12.368 --> 00:08:14.524
And now, those profit margins are critical,

00:08:14.524 --> 00:08:16.193
because if you want to scale, if you want to reach

00:08:16.193 --> 00:08:18.452
all the people in the world who possibly need a knee,

00:08:18.452 --> 00:08:21.609
it needs to be economically sustainable.

00:08:21.609 --> 00:08:24.205
So I want to give you a sense of where we are at.

00:08:24.205 --> 00:08:27.781
We have fit over 5,000 amputees,

00:08:27.781 --> 00:08:30.000
and one of the big indicators
we're looking at, of course,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.913
is, does it improve lives?

00:08:31.913 --> 00:08:33.649
Well, the standard is, is someone

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:36.174
still wearing their knee six months later?

00:08:36.174 --> 00:08:38.877
The industry average is about 65 percent.

00:08:38.877 --> 00:08:41.169
Ours is 79 percent,

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.113
and we're hoping to get that higher.

00:08:44.113 --> 00:08:47.126
Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:48.736
This is where we want to get, though,

00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:50.254
in the next three years.

00:08:50.254 --> 00:08:52.754
We'll double the impact in 2015,

00:08:52.754 --> 00:08:55.872
and we'll double it each of
the following years after that.

00:08:55.872 --> 00:08:57.705
But then we hit a new challenge,

00:08:57.705 --> 00:08:59.724
and that's the number of skilled prosthetists

00:08:59.724 --> 00:09:02.832
who are able to fit knees.

00:09:02.832 --> 00:09:05.513
So I want to end with a story of Pournima.

00:09:05.513 --> 00:09:07.160
Pournima was 18 years old

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.028
when she was in a car accident
where she lost her leg,

00:09:10.028 --> 00:09:13.469
and she traveled 12 hours by train

00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:15.896
to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee,

00:09:15.896 --> 00:09:18.489
and while all of the amputees who wear our knees

00:09:18.489 --> 00:09:20.665
affect us as the designers,

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:24.932
she's particularly meaningful to me 
as an engineer and as a woman,

00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:26.496
because she was in school,

00:09:26.496 --> 00:09:29.220
she had just started school to study engineering.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.375
And she said, "Well, now that I can walk again,

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.783
I can go back and complete my studies."

00:09:33.783 --> 00:09:36.953
And to me she represents the next generation

00:09:36.953 --> 00:09:39.985
of engineers solving problems

00:09:39.985 --> 00:09:42.430
and ensuring meaningful technologies

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.214
reach their users.

00:09:44.214 --> 00:09:46.252
So thank you.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:50.056
(Applause)
