00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.576
The conventional wisdom
about our world today

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.720
is that this is a time
of terrible decline.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.696
And that's not surprising,
given the bad news all around us,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.816
from ISIS to inequality,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.256
political dysfunction, climate change,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.320
Brexit, and on and on.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.680
But here's the thing,
and this may sound a little weird.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.000
I actually don't buy
this gloomy narrative,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.736
and I don't think you should either.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.256
Look, it's not that
I don't see the problems.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.120
I read the same headlines that you do.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.816
What I dispute is the conclusion
that so many people draw from them,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.736
namely that we're all screwed

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.856
because the problems are unsolvable

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.216
and our governments are useless.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.616
Now, why do I say this?

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.336
It's not like I'm particularly
optimistic by nature.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.056
But something about the media's
constant doom-mongering

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.776
with its fixation on problems
and not on answers

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.936
has always really bugged me.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.056
So a few years ago I decided,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.976
well, I'm a journalist,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.976
I should see if I can do any better

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.536
by going around the world
and actually asking folks

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.816
if and how they've tackled

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.320
their big economic
and political challenges.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.600
And what I found astonished me.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.200
It turns out that there are remarkable
signs of progress out there,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.776
often in the most unexpected places,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.976
and they've convinced me
that our great global challenges

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.016
may not be so unsolvable after all.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.736
Not only are there theoretical fixes;

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.856
those fixes have been tried.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.616
They've worked.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.640
And they offer hope for the rest of us.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.016
I'm going to show you what I mean

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.896
by telling you about
how three of the countries I visited --

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.536
Canada, Indonesia and Mexico --

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.880
overcame three supposedly
impossible problems.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.816
Their stories matter because they contain
tools the rest of us can use,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.776
and not just for those
particular problems,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.160
but for many others, too.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.336
When most people think
about my homeland, Canada, today,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.980
if they think about Canada at all,

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:22.616
they think cold, they think boring,
they think polite.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.840
They think we say "sorry" too much
in our funny accents.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.016
And that's all true.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.576
(Laughter)

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.816
Sorry.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.336
(Laughter)

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.080
But Canada's also important

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.056
because of its triumph over a problem

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.736
currently tearing
many other countries apart:

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.056
immigration.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.496
Consider, Canada today is among
the world's most welcoming nations,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.176
even compared to other
immigration-friendly countries.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.936
Its per capita immigration rate
is four times higher than France's,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.136
and its percentage
of foreign-born residents

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.056
is double that of Sweden.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.816
Meanwhile, Canada admitted

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.576
10 times more Syrian refugees
in the last year

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.296
than did the United States.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.560
(Applause)

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.936
And now Canada is taking even more.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.816
And yet, if you ask Canadians

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.496
what makes them proudest of their country,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.976
they rank "multiculturalism,"

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.216
a dirty word in most places,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.456
second,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.040
ahead of hockey.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.936
Hockey.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.000
(Laughter)

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.136
In other words,
at a time when other countries

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.416
are now frantically building
new barriers to keep foreigners out,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.320
Canadians want even more of them in.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.496
Now, here's the really interesting part.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.936
Canada wasn't always like this.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.400
Until the mid-1960s, Canada followed
an explicitly racist immigration policy.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.776
They called it "White Canada,"

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.720
and as you can see, they were not
just talking about the snow.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.280
So how did that Canada
become today's Canada?

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.736
Well, despite what my mom
in Ontario will tell you,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.736
the answer had nothing to do with virtue.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.136
Canadians are not inherently
better than anyone else.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.816
The real explanation involves the man
who became Canada's leader in 1968,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.096
Pierre Trudeau, who is also
the father of the current prime minister.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.520
(Applause)

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.016
The thing to know about that first Trudeau

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.935
is that he was very different
from Canada's previous leaders.

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:34.456
He was a French speaker in a country
long-dominated by its English elite.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.056
He was an intellectual.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.856
He was even kind of groovy.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.536
I mean, seriously, the guy did yoga.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.941
He hung out with the Beatles.

00:04:42.965 --> 00:04:44.056
(Laughter)

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.040
And like all hipsters,
he could be infuriating at times.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.416
But he nevertheless pulled off

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.120
one of the most progressive
transformations any country has ever seen.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.696
His formula, I've learned,
involved two parts.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.696
First, Canada threw out
its old race-based immigration rules,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.536
and it replaced them
with new color-blind ones

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.736
that emphasized education,
experience and language skills instead.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.256
And what that did
was greatly increase the odds

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.960
that newcomers would
contribute to the economy.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.216
Then part two, Trudeau
created the world's first policy

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.416
of official multiculturalism
to promote integration

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.600
and the idea that diversity
was the key to Canada's identity.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.016
Now, in the years that followed,
Ottawa kept pushing this message,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.816
but at the same time, ordinary Canadians

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.336
soon started to see the economic,
the material benefits of multiculturalism

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.616
all around them.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.256
And these two influences soon combined

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.880
to create the passionately
open-minded Canada of today.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.136
Let's now turn to another country
and an even tougher problem,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.360
Islamic extremism.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.696
In 1998, the people of Indonesia
took to the streets

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.600
and overthrew
their longtime dictator, Suharto.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.616
It was an amazing moment,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.376
but it was also a scary one.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.096
With 250 million people,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.216
Indonesia is the largest
Muslim-majority country on Earth.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.216
It's also hot, huge and unruly,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.536
made up of 17,000 islands,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.846
where people speak
close to a thousand languages.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.176
Now, Suharto had been a dictator,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.816
and a nasty one.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.936
But he'd also been
a pretty effective tyrant,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.256
and he'd always been careful
to keep religion out of politics.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.856
So experts feared that without
him keeping a lid on things,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.616
the country would explode,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.536
or religious extremists would take over

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.440
and turn Indonesia
into a tropical version of Iran.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.336
And that's just what seemed
to happen at first.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.456
In the country's
first free elections, in 1999,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.856
Islamist parties scored
36 percent of the vote,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.536
and the islands burned

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.480
as riots and terror attacks
killed thousands.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.040
Since then, however,
Indonesia has taken a surprising turn.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.496
While ordinary folks have grown
more pious on a personal level --

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.696
I saw a lot more headscarves
on a recent visit

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.656
than I would have a decade ago --

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.160
the country's politics
have moved in the opposite direction.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.480
Indonesia is now
a pretty decent democracy.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.256
And yet, its Islamist parties
have steadily lost support,

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.616
from a high of about 38 percent in 2004

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.880
down to 25 percent in 2014.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.016
As for terrorism, it's now extremely rare.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.416
And while a few Indonesians
have recently joined ISIS,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.640
their number is tiny,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.816
far fewer in per capita terms

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.040
than the number of Belgians.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.736
Try to think of one other
Muslim-majority country

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.176
that can say all those same things.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.096
In 2014, I went to Indonesia
to ask its current president,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.696
a soft-spoken technocrat
named Joko Widodo,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.160
"Why is Indonesia thriving when
so many other Muslim states are dying?"

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.936
"Well, what we realized," he told me,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.816
"is that to deal with extremism,
we needed to deal with inequality first."

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.376
See, Indonesia's religious parties,
like similar parties elsewhere,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.280
had tended to focus on things like
reducing poverty and cutting corruption.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.616
So that's what Joko
and his predecessors did too,

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.560
thereby stealing the Islamists' thunder.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.096
They also cracked down hard on terrorism,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.696
but Indonesia's democrats
have learned a key lesson

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.656
from the dark years of dictatorship,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.320
namely that repression
only creates more extremism.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.976
So they waged their war
with extraordinary delicacy.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.056
They used the police instead of the army.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.096
They only detained suspects
if they had enough evidence.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.696
They held public trials.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.416
They even sent
liberal imams into the jails

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.960
to persuade the jihadists
that terror is un-Islamic.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.856
And all of this paid off
in spectacular fashion,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.360
creating the kind of country
that was unimaginable 20 years ago.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.696
So at this point,
my optimism should, I hope,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.536
be starting to make a bit more sense.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.640
Neither immigration nor Islamic extremism
are impossible to deal with.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.496
Join me now on one last trip,

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.160
this time to Mexico.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.136
Now, of our three stories,
this one probably surprised me the most,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.576
since as you all know,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.696
the country is still struggling
with so many problems.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.376
And yet, a few years ago,
Mexico did something

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.536
that many other countries
from France to India to the United States

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.456
can still only dream of.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.040
It shattered the political paralysis
that had gripped it for years.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.176
To understand how,
we need to rewind to the year 2000,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.776
when Mexico finally became a democracy.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.976
Rather than use their new freedoms
to fight for reform,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.336
Mexico's politicians used them
to fight one another.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.296
Congress deadlocked,
and the country's problems --

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.376
drugs, poverty, crime, corruption --

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.976
spun out of control.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.616
Things got so bad that in 2008,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.520
the Pentagon warned
that Mexico risked collapse.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.056
Then in 2012, this guy
named Enrique Peña Nieto

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.960
somehow got himself elected president.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.680
Now, this Peña hardly inspired
much confidence at first.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.920
Sure, he was handsome,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.856
but he came from Mexico's
corrupt old ruling party, the PRI,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.720
and he was a notorious womanizer.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.576
In fact, he seemed
like such a pretty boy lightweight

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.376
that women called him "bombón," sweetie,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.600
at campaign rallies.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.976
And yet this same bombón
soon surprised everyone

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.256
by hammering out a truce

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.296
between the country's
three warring political parties.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.896
And over the next 18 months,
they together passed

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.856
an incredibly comprehensive
set of reforms.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.936
They busted open Mexico's
smothering monopolies.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.600
They liberalized
its rusting energy sector.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.416
They restructured
its failing schools, and much more.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.656
To appreciate the scale
of this accomplishment,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.896
try to imagine the US Congress
passing immigration reform,

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.856
campaign finance reform
and banking reform.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.320
Now, try to imagine Congress
doing it all at the same time.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.120
That's what Mexico did.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.520
Not long ago, I met with Peña
and asked how he managed it all.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.416
The President flashed me
his famous twinkly smile --

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.200
(Laughter)

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.576
and told me that the short answer
was "compromiso," compromise.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.336
Of course, I pushed him for details,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.896
and the long answer
that came out was essentially

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.520
"compromise, compromise
and more compromise."

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.056
See, Peña knew that he needed
to build trust early,

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.856
so he started talking to the opposition
just days after his election.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.216
To ward off pressure
from special interests,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.016
he kept their meetings small and secret,

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.336
and many of the participants
later told me that it was this intimacy,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.016
plus a lot of shared tequila,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.960
that helped build confidence.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.456
So did the fact that all decisions
had to be unanimous,

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.616
and that Peña even agreed to pass
some of the other party's priorities

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.840
before his own.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.856
As Santiago Creel,
an opposition senator, put it to me,

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.536
"Look, I'm not saying that I'm special
or that anyone is special,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.400
but that group, that was special."

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.256
The proof?

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.616
When Peña was sworn in, the pact held,

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.800
and Mexico moved forward
for the first time in years.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.736
Bueno.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.056
So now we've seen
how these three countries

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.616
overcame three of their great challenges.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.456
And that's very nice for them, right?

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.160
But what good does it do the rest of us?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.576
Well, in the course of studying these
and a bunch of other success stories,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.736
like the way Rwanda pulled itself
back together after civil war

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.496
or Brazil has reduced inequality,

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.256
or South Korea has kept its economy
growing faster and for longer

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.216
than any other country on Earth,

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.696
I've noticed a few common threads.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.816
Now, before describing them,
I need to add a caveat.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.456
I realize, of course,
that all countries are unique.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.176
So you can't simply
take what worked in one,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.896
port it to another
and expect it to work there too.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.256
Nor do specific solutions work forever.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.040
You've got to adapt them
as circumstances change.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.496
That said, by stripping
these stories to their essence,

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.176
you absolutely can distill
a few common tools for problem-solving

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.136
that will work in other countries

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.456
and in boardrooms

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.800
and in all sorts of other contexts, too.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.936
Number one, embrace the extreme.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.896
In all the stories we've just looked at,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.840
salvation came at a moment
of existential peril.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.616
And that was no coincidence.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.960
Take Canada: when Trudeau took office,
he faced two looming dangers.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.296
First, though his vast,
underpopulated country

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.936
badly needed more bodies,

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.576
its preferred source
for white workers, Europe,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.656
had just stopped exporting them
as it finally recovered from World War II.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.176
The other problem was
that Canada's long cold war

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.016
between its French
and its English communities

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.680
had just become a hot one.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.456
Quebec was threatening to secede,

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.256
and Canadians were actually
killing other Canadians over politics.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.736
Now, countries face
crises all the time. Right?

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.000
That's nothing special.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.736
But Trudeau's genius
was to realize that Canada's crisis

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.320
had swept away all the hurdles
that usually block reform.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.240
Canada had to open up. It had no choice.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.816
And it had to rethink its identity.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.536
Again, it had no choice.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.096
And that gave Trudeau
a once-in-a-generation opportunity

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.720
to break the old rules and write new ones.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.840
And like all our other heroes,
he was smart enough to seize it.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.120
Number two, there's power
in promiscuous thinking.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.136
Another striking similarity
among good problem-solvers

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.176
is that they're all pragmatists.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.376
They'll steal the best answers
from wherever they find them,

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.776
and they don't let details

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:03.136
like party or ideology
or sentimentality get in their way.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.456
As I mentioned earlier,
Indonesia's democrats were clever enough

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.256
to steal many of the Islamists'
best campaign promises for themselves.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.176
They even invited some of the radicals
into their governing coalition.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.720
Now, that horrified
a lot of secular Indonesians.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.696
But by forcing the radicals
to actually help govern,

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.576
it quickly exposed the fact
that they weren't any good at the job,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.616
and it got them mixed up
in all of the grubby compromises

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.696
and petty humiliations
that are part of everyday politics.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.120
And that hurt their image so badly
that they've never recovered.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.616
Number three,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.480
please all of the people some of the time.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.296
I know I just mentioned how crises
can grant leaders extraordinary freedoms.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.296
And that's true, but problem-solving
often requires more than just boldness.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.896
It takes showing restraint, too,

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.576
just when that's
the last thing you want to do.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.536
Take Trudeau: when he took office,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.136
he could easily have put
his core constituency,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.816
that is Canada's French community, first.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.280
He could have pleased
some of the people all of the time.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.456
And Peña could have used his power
to keep attacking the opposition,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.256
as was traditional in Mexico.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.416
Yet he chose to embrace
his enemies instead,

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.936
while forcing his own party to compromise.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.136
And Trudeau pushed everyone
to stop thinking in tribal terms

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.656
and to see multiculturalism,
not language and not skin color,

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.160
as what made them
quintessentially Canadian.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.456
Nobody got everything they wanted,

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.800
but everyone got just enough
that the bargains held.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.976
So at this point you may be thinking,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.216
"OK, Tepperman,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.976
if the fixes really are out there
like you keep insisting,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.520
then why aren't more countries
already using them?"

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.216
It's not like they require
special powers to pull off.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.816
I mean, none of the leaders
we've just looked at were superheroes.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.976
They didn't accomplish
anything on their own,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.176
and they all had plenty of flaws.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.616
Take Indonesia's
first democratic president,

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.296
Abdurrahman Wahid.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.536
This man was so powerfully uncharismatic

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.656
that he once fell asleep

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.456
in the middle of his own speech.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.096
(Laughter)

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.320
True story.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.656
So what this tells us
is that the real obstacle is not ability,

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.496
and it's not circumstances.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.576
It's something much simpler.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:31.576
Making big changes
involves taking big risks,

00:17:31.599 --> 00:17:33.640
and taking big risks is scary.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.816
Overcoming that fear requires guts,

00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:39.175
and as you all know,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.640
gutsy politicians are painfully rare.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.216
But that doesn't mean we voters

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.976
can't demand courage
from our political leaders.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.810
I mean, that's why we put them
in office in the first place.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.960
And given the state of the world today,
there's really no other option.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.696
The answers are out there,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.056
but now it's up to us

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.616
to elect more women and men

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.016
brave enough to find them,

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.416
to steal them

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.056
and to make them work.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.456
Thank you.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.791
(Applause)
