00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'd like to begin with a thought experiment.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Civilization as we know it

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
has ceased to exist --

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
no books,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
no electronic devices,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
no Facebook or Twitter.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
has been lost.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Now imagine archeologists

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
digging through the rubble of one of our cities.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
What might they find?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
with strange symbols on them.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Perhaps some circular pieces of metal.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Maybe some cylindrical containers

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
with some symbols on them.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
when she discovers --

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
buried in the hills somewhere in North America --

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
massive versions of these same symbols.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Now let's ask ourselves,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
what could such artifacts say about us

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
to people 4,000 years into the future?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
This is no hypothetical question.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
In fact, this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
which existed 4,000 years ago.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
It occupied the area

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
of approximately one million square kilometers,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
covering what is now Pakistan,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Northwestern India

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and parts of Afghanistan and Iran.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Given that it was such a vast civilization,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.260
you might expect to find really powerful rulers, kings,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
In fact,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
what archeologists have found is none of that.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
They've found small objects such as these.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Here's an example of one of these objects.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Well obviously this is a replica.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
But who is this person?

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
A king? A god?

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
A priest?

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Or perhaps an ordinary person

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
like you or me?

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
We don't know.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Well no, not pieces of plastic,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
but stone seals, copper tablets,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
pottery and, surprisingly,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
one large sign board,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
which was found buried near the gate of a city.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Now we don't know if it says Hollywood,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
or even Bollywood for that matter.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
In fact, we don't even know

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
what any of these objects say,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and that's because the Indus script is undeciphered.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
We don't know what any of these symbols mean.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
The symbols are most commonly found on seals.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
So you see up there one such object.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
It's the square object with the unicorn-like animal on it.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Now that's a magnificent piece of art.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
So how big do you think that is?

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Perhaps that big?

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Or maybe that big?

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Well let me show you.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Here's a replica of one such seal.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
It's only about one inch by one inch in size --

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
pretty tiny.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
So what were these used for?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
We know that these were used for stamping clay tags

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
These were used to make those kinds of packing slips.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
You might wonder what these objects contain

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
in terms of their text.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Perhaps they're the name of the sender

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
or some information about the goods

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
that are being sent from one place to the other -- we don't know.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
We need to decipher the script to answer that question.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Deciphering the script

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
is not just an intellectual puzzle;

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
it's actually become a question

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
that's become deeply intertwined

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
In fact, the script has become a battleground of sorts

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
between three different groups of people.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
First, there's a group of people

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
who are very passionate in their belief

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
that the Indus script

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
does not represent a language at all.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
These people believe that the symbols

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
or the emblems you find on shields.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
There's a second group of people

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
If you look at a map of India today,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
belong to the Indo-European language family.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
So some people believe that the Indus script

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
represents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
There's a last group of people

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
who believe that the Indus people

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
were the ancestors of people living in South India today.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
These people believe that the Indus script

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
represents an ancient form

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
of the Dravidian language family,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
which is the language family spoken in much of South India today.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And the proponents of this theory

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
point to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
actually near Afghanistan,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
and they say that perhaps, sometime in the past,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Dravidian languages were spoken all over India

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and that this suggests

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Which of these hypotheses can be true?

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
We don't know, but perhaps if you deciphered the script,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
you would be able to answer this question.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
But deciphering the script is a very challenging task.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
First, there's no Rosetta Stone.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
I don't mean the software;

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
I mean an ancient artifact

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
that contains in the same text

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
both a known text and an unknown text.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
We don't have such an artifact for the Indus script.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
And furthermore, we don't even know what language they spoke.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And to make matters even worse,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
most of the text that we have are extremely short.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
So as I showed you, they're usually found on these seals

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
that are very, very tiny.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And so given these formidable obstacles,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
one might wonder and worry

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
whether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
In the rest of my talk,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and love the challenge posed by the Indus script.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
I've always been fascinated by the Indus script

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And why was I fascinated?

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
so in my day job,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
I create computer models of the brain

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
to try to understand how the brain makes predictions,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
how the brain makes decisions,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
how the brain learns and so on.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
But in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
That's when I was in India,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
and I had the wonderful opportunity

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
to meet with some Indian scientists

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
who were using computer models to try to analyze the script.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And so it was then that I realized

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and so I jumped at that opportunity.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Or better yet, let's all collectively decipher.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Are you ready?

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
is try to figure out the direction of writing.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Can you tell me

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right?

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
I'll give you a couple of seconds.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Okay. Right to left, how many? Okay.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
Okay. Left to right?

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
The answer is:

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
if you look at the left-hand side of the two texts,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
you'll notice that there's a cramping of signs,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
and it seems like 4,000 years ago,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
when the scribe was writing from right to left,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
they ran out of space.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And so they had to cram the sign.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
One of the signs is also below the text on the top.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
This suggests the direction of writing

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
was probably from right to left,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
and so that's one of the first things we know,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And the Indus script now has

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
this particular property.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
What other properties of language does the script show?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Languages contain patterns.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
If I give you the letter Q

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
and ask you to predict the next letter, what do you think that would be?

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
Most of you said U, which is right.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Now if I asked you to predict one more letter,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
what do you think that would be?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Now there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
but certainly not B, C or D, right?

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
There's a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And this in turn tends to be followed

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
by this quotation marks-like symbol.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
And this is very similar to a Q and U example.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
This symbol can in turn be followed

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
by these fish-like symbols and some other signs,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
but never by these other signs at the bottom.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And furthermore, there's some signs

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
that really prefer the end of texts,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
such as this jar-shaped sign,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and this sign, in fact, happens to be

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
the most frequently occurring sign in the script.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Given such patterns, here was our idea.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
The idea was to use a computer

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
to learn these patterns,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
and so we gave the computer the existing texts.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And the computer learned a statistical model

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
of which symbols tend to occur together

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and which symbols tend to follow each other.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Given the computer model,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
we can test the model by essentially quizzing it.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
So we could deliberately erase some symbols,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Here are some examples.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
You may regard this

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
as perhaps the most ancient game

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
of Wheel of Fortune.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
What we found

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
was that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
in predicting the correct symbol.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
In the rest of the cases,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
There's also practical use

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
for this particular procedure.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
There's a lot of these texts that are damaged.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Here's an example of one such text.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
and make a best guess prediction.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
Here's an example of a symbol that was predicted.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
by generating more data that we can analyze.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
Now here's one other thing you can do with the computer model.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
So imagine a monkey

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
sitting at a keyboard.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Such a random jumble of letters

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
is said to have a very high entropy.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
This is a physics and information theory term.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
But just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.260
How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard?

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
You might have encountered the stuck-key problem --

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
because there's no variation at all.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
Language, on the other hand, has an intermediate level of entropy;

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
it's neither too rigid,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
nor is it too random.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
What about the Indus script?

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.260
Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
which is a random jumble of letters --

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and interestingly, we also find

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
And both of these are very, very flexible,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
which is why you find them in the very high range.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
At the lower end of the scale,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
you find a rigid sequence, a sequence of all A's,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and you also find a computer program,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
in this case in the language Fortran,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
which obeys really strict rules.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
Linguistic scripts

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
occupy the middle range.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
Now what about the Indus script?

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
We found that the Indus script

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
When this result was first published,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
it was highly controversial.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
There were people who raised a hue and cry,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and these people were the ones who believed

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
that the Indus script does not represent language.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
I even started to get some hate mail.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
My students said

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
that I should really seriously consider getting some protection.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
Who'd have thought

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
that deciphering could be a dangerous profession?

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
What does this result really show?

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
It shows that the Indus script

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
shares an important property of language.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
So, as the old saying goes,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
if it looks like a linguistic script

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
and it acts like a linguistic script,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
What other evidence is there

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
that the script could actually encode language?

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
So for example, here's the same sentence written in English

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
and the same sentence written in Dutch

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
using the same letters of the alphabet.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
If you don't know Dutch and you only know English

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
and I give you some words in Dutch,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
you'll tell me that these words contain

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
some very unusual patterns.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
Some things are not right,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
and you'll say these words are probably not English words.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
The computer found several texts --

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
two of them are shown here --

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
that have very unusual patterns.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
So for example the first text:

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
there's a doubling of this jar-shaped sign.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
in the Indus script,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
and it's only in this text

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
that it occurs as a doubling pair.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
Why is that the case?

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
and it turns out that they were found

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
very, very far away from the Indus Valley.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
They were found in present day Iraq and Iran.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And why were they found there?

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
What I haven't told you is that

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
the Indus people were very, very enterprising.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
and so in this case, they were traveling by sea

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
all the way to Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
And what seems to have happened here

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
is that the Indus traders, the merchants,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
were using this script to write a foreign language.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
It's just like our English and Dutch example.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
And that would explain why we have these strange patterns

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
that are found within the Indus Valley.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
This suggests that the same script, the Indus script,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
could be used to write different languages.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
that the Indus script probably does represent language.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
If it does represent language,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
then how do we read the symbols?

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
That's our next big challenge.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
So you'll notice that many of the symbols

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
look like pictures of humans, of insects,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
of fishes, of birds.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
Most ancient scripts

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
use the rebus principle,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
which is, using pictures to represent words.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
So as an example, here's a word.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
Can you write it using pictures?

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
I'll give you a couple seconds.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Got it?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Okay. Great.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
Here's my solution.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf --

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
and that's "belief," right.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
There could be other solutions.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
In the case of the Indus script,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
the problem is the reverse.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
such that the entire sequence makes sense.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
So this is just like a crossword puzzle,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.260
because the stakes are so high if you solve it.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
My colleagues, Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
have been making some headway on this particular problem.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
And I'd like to give you a quick example of Parpola's work.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
Here's a really short text.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
And I want to mention that these seals were used

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
for stamping clay tags

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
that were attached to bundles of goods,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
so it's quite likely that these tags, at least some of them,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
contain names of merchants.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
And it turns out that in India

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
there's a long tradition

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
of names being based on horoscopes

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
and star constellations present at the time of birth.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
In Dravidian languages,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
the word for fish is "meen"

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
which happens to sound just like the word for star.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
And so seven stars

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
would stand for "elu meen,"

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
which is the Dravidian word

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
for the Big Dipper star constellation.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
Similarly, there's another sequence of six stars,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and that translates to "aru meen,"

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
which is the old Dravidian name

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
for the star constellation Pleiades.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
And finally, there's other combinations,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
And that could be translated into "mey meen,"

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
So that was pretty exciting.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
It looks like we're getting somewhere.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
But does this prove

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
that these seals contain Dravidian names

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
based on planets and star constellations?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
Well not yet.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
So we have no way of validating

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
these particular readings,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
but if more and more of these readings start making sense,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
and if longer and longer sequences

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
appear to be correct,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
then we know that we are on the right track.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
Today,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
we can write a word such as TED

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
because both of these were deciphered

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
in the 19th century.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
The decipherment of these two scripts

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
The Mayans

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
started speaking to us in the 20th century,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
but the Indus civilization remains silent.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
Why should we care?

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
The Indus civilization does not belong

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
to just the South Indians or the North Indians

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
or the Pakistanis;

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
it belongs to all of us.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
These are our ancestors --

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
yours and mine.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
They were silenced

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
by an unfortunate accident of history.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
If we decipher the script,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
we would enable them to speak to us again.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
What would they tell us?

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
What would we find out about them? About us?

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
I can't wait to find out.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
Thank you.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.260
(Applause)
