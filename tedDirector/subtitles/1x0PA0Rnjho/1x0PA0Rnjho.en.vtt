00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.381
I'm going to present
three projects in rapid fire.

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:30.976
I don't have much time to do it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.334
And I want to reinforce three ideas
with that rapid-fire presentation.

00:00:34.358 --> 00:00:37.334
The first is what I like to call
a hyper-rational process.

00:00:37.358 --> 00:00:41.255
It's a process that takes rationality
almost to an absurd level,

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:43.184
and it transcends all the baggage

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:45.852
that normally comes
with what people would call,

00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:47.976
sort of a rational
conclusion to something.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.286
And it concludes in something
that you see here,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.091
that you actually wouldn't expect
as being the result of rationality.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.766
The second --

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.780
the second is that this process
does not have a signature.

00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:04.180
There is no authorship.

00:01:04.204 --> 00:01:06.216
Architects are obsessed with authorship.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.724
This is something that has
editing and it has teams,

00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:11.111
but in fact, we no longer
see within this process,

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:12.665
the traditional master architect

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.405
creating a sketch
that his minions carry out.

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:18.575
And the third is that it challenges --

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:21.976
and this is, in the length of this,
very hard to support why,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.302
connect all these things --

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:26.529
but it challenges the high modernist
notion of flexibility.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:30.193
High modernists said we will create
sort of singular spaces that are generic,

00:01:30.217 --> 00:01:32.106
almost anything can happen within them.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.156
I call it sort of "shotgun flexibility" --

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.341
turn your head this way; shoot;
and you're bound to kill something.

00:01:37.365 --> 00:01:39.440
So, this is the promise of high modernism:

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:42.687
within a single space, actually,
any kind of activity can happen.

00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:44.976
But as we're seeing,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.976
operational costs are starting
to dwarf capital costs

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.039
in terms of design parameters.

00:01:50.063 --> 00:01:51.783
And so, with this sort of idea,

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:55.065
what happens is, whatever actually
is in the building on opening day,

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:57.352
or whatever seems to be
the most immediate need,

00:01:57.376 --> 00:02:00.648
starts to dwarf the possibility
and sort of subsume it,

00:02:00.672 --> 00:02:02.600
of anything else could ever happen.

00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:05.221
And so we're proposing
a different kind of flexibility,

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:09.379
something that we call
"compartmentalized flexibility."

00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:11.742
And the idea is that you,
within that continuum,

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:14.894
identify a series of points,
and you design specifically to them.

00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:16.935
They can be pushed
off-center a little bit,

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.072
but in the end you actually
still get as much

00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:21.976
of that original spectrum
as you originally had hoped.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.976
With high modernist flexibility,
that doesn't really work.

00:02:25.463 --> 00:02:26.905
Now I'm going to talk about --

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.238
I'm going to build up
the Seattle Central Library

00:02:29.262 --> 00:02:32.043
in this way before your eyes
in about five or six diagrams,

00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:34.884
and I truly mean this is the design
process that you'll see.

00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:37.212
With the library staff
and the library board,

00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:38.976
we settled on two core positions.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.445
This is the first one, and this
is showing, over the last 900 years,

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.088
the evolution of the book,
and other technologies.

00:02:46.112 --> 00:02:48.976
This diagram was our sort
of position piece about the book,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.516
and our position was,
books are technology --

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.128
that's something people forget --

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:56.314
but it's a form of technology
that will have to share its dominance

00:02:56.338 --> 00:02:59.757
with any other form of truly potent
technology or media.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.282
The second premise --

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.797
and this was something
that was very difficult for us

00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:05.787
to convince the librarians of at first --

00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:09.594
is that libraries, since the inception
of Carnegie Library tradition in America,

00:03:09.618 --> 00:03:12.501
had a second responsibility,
and that was for social roles.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.113
Ok, now, this I'll come back
to later, but something --

00:03:15.137 --> 00:03:18.344
actually, the librarians at first said,
"No, this isn't our mandate.

00:03:18.368 --> 00:03:21.074
Our mandate is media,
and particularly the book."

00:03:22.463 --> 00:03:25.533
So what you're seeing now
is actually the design of the building.

00:03:25.557 --> 00:03:28.009
The upper diagram is what we had seen

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:32.574
in a whole host of contemporary libraries
that used high modernist flexibility.

00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:35.000
Sort of, any activity
could happen anywhere.

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:39.381
We don't know the future of the library;
we don't know the future of the book;

00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:40.984
and so, we'll use this approach.

00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:44.188
And what we saw were buildings
that were very generic, and worse --

00:03:44.212 --> 00:03:45.910
not only were they very generic --

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.676
so, not only does the reading room
look like the copy room

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.198
look like the magazine area --

00:03:50.222 --> 00:03:53.948
but it meant that whatever issue
was troubling the library at that moment

00:03:53.972 --> 00:03:57.487
was starting to engulf every other
activity that was happening in it.

00:03:57.511 --> 00:03:59.760
And in this case,
what was getting engulfed

00:03:59.784 --> 00:04:02.800
were these social responsibilities
by the expansion of the book.

00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:05.039
And so we proposed
what's at the lower diagram.

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:08.150
Very dumb approach:
simply compartmentalize.

00:04:08.174 --> 00:04:10.627
Put those things whose evolution
we could predict --

00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:14.234
and I don't mean that we could say
what would actually happen in the future,

00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:18.144
but we have some certainty of the spectrum
of what would happen in the future --

00:04:18.168 --> 00:04:20.418
put those in boxes designed
specifically for it,

00:04:20.442 --> 00:04:23.136
and put the things that we can't
predict on the rooftops.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.407
So that was the core idea.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.125
Now, we had to convince the library

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:29.815
that social roles were
equally important to media,

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.618
in order to get them to accept this.

00:04:31.642 --> 00:04:34.642
What you're seeing here is actually
their program on the left.

00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:38.703
That's as it was given to us
in all of its clarity and glory.

00:04:38.727 --> 00:04:43.015
Our first operation was to re-digest it
back to them, show it to them and say,

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.976
"You know what? We haven't touched it,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.387
but only one-third of your own program
is dedicated to media and books.

00:04:48.411 --> 00:04:50.360
Two-thirds of it is already dedicated --

00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:53.495
that's the white band below,
the thing you said isn't important --

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:55.528
is already dedicated to social functions."

00:04:55.552 --> 00:04:57.733
So once we had presented
that back to them,

00:04:57.757 --> 00:05:00.328
they agreed that this sort
of core concept could work.

00:05:00.352 --> 00:05:02.706
We got the right to go back
to first principles --

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.940
that's the third diagram.

00:05:03.964 --> 00:05:05.170
We recombined everything.

00:05:05.194 --> 00:05:07.152
And then we started making new decisions.

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:10.049
What you're seeing on the right
is the design of the library,

00:05:10.073 --> 00:05:11.994
specifically in terms of square footage.

00:05:12.018 --> 00:05:16.976
On the left of that diagram, here,
you'll see a series of five platforms --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.976
sort of combs, collective programs.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.405
And on the right are the more
indeterminate spaces;

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:22.680
things like reading rooms,

00:05:22.704 --> 00:05:25.389
whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years
we can't predict.

00:05:25.413 --> 00:05:27.722
So that literally was the design
of the building.

00:05:27.746 --> 00:05:29.881
They signed it, and to their chagrin,

00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:32.976
we came back a week later,
and we presented them this.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.897
And as you can see, it is literally
the diagram on the right.

00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:36.922
(Laughter)

00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:39.376
We just sized -- no, really,
I mean that, literally.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.762
The things on the left-hand side
of the diagram,

00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:42.976
those are the boxes.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.929
We sized them into five compartments.
They're super-efficient.

00:05:45.953 --> 00:05:47.825
We had a very low budget to work with.

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.429
We pushed them around on the site

00:05:49.453 --> 00:05:51.666
to make very literal
contextual relationships.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.003
The reading room
should be able to see the water.

00:05:54.027 --> 00:05:56.808
The main entrance should have
a public plaza in front of it

00:05:56.832 --> 00:05:58.953
to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.

00:05:59.397 --> 00:06:01.850
So, you see the five platforms,
those are the boxes.

00:06:01.874 --> 00:06:04.303
within each one, a very discrete
thing is happening.

00:06:04.327 --> 00:06:06.674
The area in between
is sort of an urban continuum,

00:06:06.698 --> 00:06:10.048
these things that we can't predict
their evolution to the same degree.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.976
To give you some sense
of the power of this idea,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.976
the biggest block
is what we call the book spiral.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.334
It's literally built
in a very inexpensive way --

00:06:18.358 --> 00:06:20.976
it is a parking garage for books.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.487
It just so happens to be on the 6th
through 10th floors of the building,

00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:27.786
but that is not necessarily
an expensive approach.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.636
And it allows us to organize
the entire Dewey Decimal System

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.531
on one continuous run; no matter how it
grows or contracts within the building,

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:38.976
it will always have its clarity
to end the sort of trail of tears

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.729
that we've all experienced
in public libraries.

00:06:41.753 --> 00:06:42.976
(Laughter)

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.731
And so this was the final operation,

00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:47.876
which was to take these blocks
as they were all pushed off kilter,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.976
and to hold onto them with a skin.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.976
That skin serves double duty,
again, for economics.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.976
One, it is the lateral stability
for the entire building;

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.262
it's a structural element.

00:06:57.286 --> 00:06:59.913
But its dimensions were designed
not only for structure,

00:06:59.937 --> 00:07:02.188
but also for holding on
every piece of glass.

00:07:02.212 --> 00:07:04.976
The glass was then --
I'll use the word impregnated --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.412
but it had a layer of metal
that was called "stretched metal."

00:07:08.436 --> 00:07:10.274
That metal acts as a microlouver,

00:07:10.298 --> 00:07:13.679
so from the exterior of the building,
the sun sees it as totally opaque,

00:07:13.703 --> 00:07:16.377
but from the interior,
it's entirely transparent.

00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:19.148
So now I'm going to take you
on a tour of the building.

00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:21.245
Let me see if I can find it.

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:24.538
For anyone who gets
motion sickness, I apologize.

00:07:25.233 --> 00:07:26.661
So, this is the building.

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:32.886
And I think what's important is,
when we first unveiled the building,

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.976
the public saw it as being
totally about our whim and ego.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.842
And it was defended,
believe it or not, by the librarians.

00:07:39.866 --> 00:07:41.890
They said, "Look,
we don't know what it is,

00:07:41.914 --> 00:07:44.279
but we know it's everything
that we need it to be,

00:07:44.303 --> 00:07:47.439
based on the observations
that we've done about the program."

00:07:50.085 --> 00:07:52.069
This is going into one of the entries.

00:07:52.093 --> 00:07:55.454
So, it's an unusual building
for a public library, obviously.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.601
So now we're going
into what we call the living room.

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:05.497
This is actually a program
that we invented with the library.

00:08:05.521 --> 00:08:07.438
It was recognizing that public libraries

00:08:07.462 --> 00:08:10.247
are the last vestige of public free space.

00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:13.699
There are plenty of shopping malls
that allow you to get out of the rain

00:08:13.723 --> 00:08:14.879
in downtown Seattle,

00:08:14.903 --> 00:08:17.830
but there are not so many free places

00:08:17.854 --> 00:08:19.675
that allow you to get out of the rain.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:23.285
So this was an unprogrammed area where
people could pretty much do anything,

00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:25.418
including eat, yell,
play chess and so forth.

00:08:25.442 --> 00:08:29.448
Now we're moving up into what we call
the mixing chamber.

00:08:29.472 --> 00:08:32.400
That was the main
technology area in the building.

00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:35.000
You'll have to tell me
if I'm going too fast for you.

00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:40.351
And now up.

00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:48.195
This is actually the place
that we put into the building

00:08:48.219 --> 00:08:50.252
so I could propose
to my wife, right there.

00:08:50.276 --> 00:08:52.395
(Laughter)

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.159
She said yes.

00:08:54.183 --> 00:08:56.183
(Laughter)

00:08:57.593 --> 00:09:00.174
I'm running out of time,
so I'm actually going to stop.

00:09:00.198 --> 00:09:01.976
I can show this to you later.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.283
But let's see if I can very quickly
get into the book spiral,

00:09:05.307 --> 00:09:07.371
because I think it's,
as I said, the most --

00:09:07.395 --> 00:09:10.712
this is the main reading room --
the most unique part of the building.

00:09:11.768 --> 00:09:12.934
You dizzy yet?

00:09:14.141 --> 00:09:15.966
Ok, so here, this is the book spiral.

00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.328
So, it's very indiscernible,

00:09:23.352 --> 00:09:26.853
but it's actually
a continuous stair-stepping.

00:09:26.877 --> 00:09:28.869
It allows you to, on one city block,

00:09:28.893 --> 00:09:31.588
go up one full floor,
so that it's on a continuum.

00:09:36.491 --> 00:09:39.976
Ok, now I'm going to go back,
and I'm going to hit a second project.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.263
I'm going to go very,
very quickly through this.

00:09:42.287 --> 00:09:43.967
Now this is the Dallas Theater.

00:09:43.991 --> 00:09:47.339
It was an unusual client for us,
because they came to us and they said,

00:09:47.363 --> 00:09:49.069
"We need you to do a new building.

00:09:49.093 --> 00:09:52.519
We've been working
in a temporary space for 30 years,

00:09:52.543 --> 00:09:54.266
but because of that temporary space,

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.153
we've become an infamous theater company.

00:09:57.177 --> 00:10:00.138
Theater is really focused in New York,
Chicago and Seattle,

00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:03.259
with the exception
of the Dallas Theater Company."

00:10:03.283 --> 00:10:05.979
And the very fact that they worked
in a provisional space

00:10:06.003 --> 00:10:08.446
meant that for Beckett,
they could blow out a wall;

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.212
they could do "Cherry Orchard" and blow
a hole through the floor, and so forth.

00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:15.268
So it was a very daunting task
for us to do a brand-new building

00:10:15.292 --> 00:10:17.346
that could be a pristine building,

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.389
but keep this kind of experimental nature.

00:10:19.413 --> 00:10:20.611
And the second is,

00:10:20.635 --> 00:10:23.513
they were what we call
a multi-form theater,

00:10:23.537 --> 00:10:26.143
they do different kinds
of performances in repertory.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.976
So they in the morning
will do something in arena,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.493
then they'll do something
in proscenium and so forth.

00:10:31.517 --> 00:10:33.866
And so they needed to be able
to quickly transform

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.816
between different theater organizations,

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.525
and for operational budget reasons,

00:10:37.549 --> 00:10:39.712
this actually no longer
happens in pretty much

00:10:39.736 --> 00:10:41.976
any multi-form theater
in the United States,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.475
so we needed to figure out
a way to overcome that.

00:10:44.499 --> 00:10:47.322
So our thought was to literally
put the theater on its head:

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:49.656
to take those things
that were previously defined

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.355
as front-of-house and back-of-house

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:53.387
and stack them above house
and below house,

00:10:53.411 --> 00:10:55.610
and to create what we called
a theater machine.

00:10:55.634 --> 00:10:58.117
We invest the money
in the operation of the building.

00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:00.963
It's almost as though the building
could be placed anywhere,

00:11:00.987 --> 00:11:02.139
wherever you place it,

00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:04.893
the area under it is charged
for theatrical performances.

00:11:04.917 --> 00:11:07.239
And it allowed us to go back
to first principles,

00:11:07.263 --> 00:11:10.845
and redefine fly tower, acoustic
enclosure, light enclosure and so forth.

00:11:10.869 --> 00:11:12.339
And at the push of a button,

00:11:12.363 --> 00:11:15.990
it allows the artistic director
to move between proscenium, thrust,

00:11:16.014 --> 00:11:19.805
and in fact, arena
and traverse and flat floor,

00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:22.224
in a very quick transfiguration.

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:25.670
So in fact, using
operational budget, we can --

00:11:25.694 --> 00:11:27.886
sorry, capital cost --
we can actually achieve

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.381
what was no longer achievable
in operational cost.

00:11:30.898 --> 00:11:32.851
And that means that the artistic director

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:35.240
now has a palette that he or she
can choose from,

00:11:35.264 --> 00:11:38.762
between a series of forms
and a series of processions,

00:11:38.786 --> 00:11:41.910
because that enclosure around the theater
that is normally trapped

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:44.976
with front-of-house and back-of-house
spaces has been liberated.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.269
So an artistic director has the ability
to have a performance

00:11:48.293 --> 00:11:50.408
that enters in a Wagnerian procession,

00:11:50.432 --> 00:11:52.767
shows the first act in thrust,

00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:55.976
the intermission in a Greek procession,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.818
second act in arena, and so forth.

00:11:58.254 --> 00:12:00.605
So I'm going to show you
what this actually means.

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:02.397
This is the theater up close.

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:05.507
Any portion around the theater
actually can be opened discretely.

00:12:07.515 --> 00:12:11.413
The light enclosure can be lifted
separate to the acoustic enclosure,

00:12:11.437 --> 00:12:13.921
so you can do Beckett
with Dallas as the backdrop.

00:12:15.146 --> 00:12:16.311
Portions can be opened,

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:19.978
so you can now actually have motorcycles
drive directly into the performance,

00:12:20.002 --> 00:12:22.404
or you can even just have
an open-air performance,

00:12:22.428 --> 00:12:23.594
or for intermissions.

00:12:24.094 --> 00:12:26.827
The balconies all move to go
between those configurations,

00:12:26.851 --> 00:12:28.136
but they also disappear.

00:12:28.517 --> 00:12:30.637
The proscenium line can also disappear.

00:12:31.129 --> 00:12:32.970
You can bring enormous objects in,

00:12:32.994 --> 00:12:34.985
so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company --

00:12:35.009 --> 00:12:37.660
their first show will be a play
about Charles Lindbergh,

00:12:37.684 --> 00:12:39.976
and they'll want to bring in
a real aircraft.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.611
And then it also provides them,
in the off-season,

00:12:42.635 --> 00:12:47.841
the ability to actually rent out
their space for entirely different things.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.655
This is it from a distance.

00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:56.909
Open up entire portions
for different kinds of events.

00:12:56.933 --> 00:12:58.084
And at night.

00:13:00.092 --> 00:13:03.970
Again, remove the light enclosure;
keep the acoustic enclosure.

00:13:04.676 --> 00:13:06.554
This is a monster truck show.

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:08.469
I'm going to show now the last project.

00:13:08.493 --> 00:13:09.976
This also is an unusual client.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.473
They inverted the whole idea
of development.

00:13:12.497 --> 00:13:15.324
They came to us and they said --
unlike normal developers --

00:13:15.348 --> 00:13:16.885
they said, "We want to start out

00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:19.658
by providing a contemporary
art museum in Louisville.

00:13:19.682 --> 00:13:20.886
That's our main goal."

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.505
And so instead of being a developer
that sees an opportunity to make money,

00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:27.550
they saw an ability to be
a catalyst in their downtown.

00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:31.154
And the fact that they wanted to support
the contemporary art museum

00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:32.735
actually built their pro forma,

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:34.076
so they worked in reverse.

00:13:34.431 --> 00:13:35.976
And that pro forma led us

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.976
to a mixed-use building
that was very large,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.304
in order to support
their aspirations of the art,

00:13:41.328 --> 00:13:43.875
but it also opened up opportunities
for the art itself

00:13:43.899 --> 00:13:46.119
to collaborate, interact
with commercial spaces

00:13:46.143 --> 00:13:48.903
that actually artists more
and more want to work within.

00:13:49.356 --> 00:13:52.381
And it also charged us
with thinking about how to have

00:13:52.405 --> 00:13:54.369
something that was both a single building

00:13:54.393 --> 00:13:56.976
and a credible sort of sub-building.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.543
So this is Louisville's skyline,

00:13:59.567 --> 00:14:02.247
and I'm going to take
you through the various constraints

00:14:02.271 --> 00:14:03.464
that led to the project.

00:14:03.488 --> 00:14:05.027
First: the physical constraints.

00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:07.452
We actually had to operate
on three discrete sites,

00:14:07.476 --> 00:14:10.357
all of them well smaller
than the size of the building.

00:14:10.381 --> 00:14:14.064
We had to operate next to the new
Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it.

00:14:14.088 --> 00:14:16.386
We had to operate
within the 100-year floodplain.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.725
Now, this area floods
three to four times a year,

00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:20.486
and there's a levee behind our site,

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.790
similar to the ones
that broke in New Orleans.

00:14:23.687 --> 00:14:27.889
Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor,

00:14:27.913 --> 00:14:30.829
a street that cuts through the middle
of these separate sites.

00:14:30.853 --> 00:14:35.419
So we're starting to build a sort of
nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.

00:14:35.443 --> 00:14:38.832
Underneath the bathtub
are the city's main power lines.

00:14:39.699 --> 00:14:42.500
And there is a pedestrian corridor
that they wanted to add,

00:14:42.524 --> 00:14:45.474
that would link a series
of cultural buildings,

00:14:45.498 --> 00:14:48.464
and a view corridor --
because this is the historic district --

00:14:48.488 --> 00:14:51.036
that they didn't want to obstruct
with a new building.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.100
(Laughter)

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:54.697
And now we're going to add
1.1 million square feet.

00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:58.340
And if we did the traditional thing,
that 1.1 million square feet --

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.036
these are the different programs --

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.024
the traditional thing would be to identify
the public elements, place them on sites,

00:15:04.048 --> 00:15:06.223
and now we'd have a really
terrible situation:

00:15:06.247 --> 00:15:08.976
a public thing in the middle
of a bathtub that floods.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.597
And then we would size
all the other elements --

00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.276
the different commercial elements:

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.443
hotel, luxury housing,
offices and so forth --

00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:17.672
and dump it on top.

00:15:17.696 --> 00:15:20.660
And we would create
something that was unviable.

00:15:20.684 --> 00:15:24.429
In fact -- and you know this -- this
is called the Time Warner Building.

00:15:24.453 --> 00:15:26.127
(Laughter)

00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:27.976
So our strategy was very simple.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.111
Just lift the entire block,

00:15:31.135 --> 00:15:32.770
flip some of the elements over,

00:15:32.794 --> 00:15:35.604
reposition them
so they have appropriate views

00:15:35.628 --> 00:15:37.264
and relationships to downtown,

00:15:37.288 --> 00:15:40.741
and make circulation connections
and reroute the road.

00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:42.292
So that's the basic concept,

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:44.646
and now I'm going to show you
what it leads to.

00:15:45.916 --> 00:15:48.471
Ok, it seems a very formal,
willful gesture,

00:15:48.495 --> 00:15:51.043
but something derived entirely
out of the constraints.

00:15:51.067 --> 00:15:54.048
And again, when we unveiled it,
there was a sort of nervousness

00:15:54.072 --> 00:15:56.509
that this was about an architect
making a statement,

00:15:56.533 --> 00:16:00.125
not an architect who was attempting
to solve a series of problems.

00:16:00.149 --> 00:16:02.443
Now, within that center zone, as I said,

00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:04.622
we have the ability to mix
a series of things.

00:16:04.646 --> 00:16:07.369
So here, this is sort of an x-ray --

00:16:07.393 --> 00:16:09.328
the towers are totally developer-driven.

00:16:09.352 --> 00:16:11.802
They told us the dimensions,
the sizes and so forth,

00:16:11.826 --> 00:16:14.323
and we focused on taking
all the public components --

00:16:14.347 --> 00:16:15.639
the lobbies, the bars --

00:16:15.663 --> 00:16:18.976
everything that different commercial
elements would have,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.976
and combined it in the center,
in the sort of subway map,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.718
in the transfer zone that would also
include the contemporary art museum.

00:16:25.742 --> 00:16:29.807
So it creates a situation like this,
where you have artists who can operate

00:16:29.831 --> 00:16:33.709
within an art space that also has
an amazing view on the 22nd floor,

00:16:33.733 --> 00:16:37.190
but it also has proximity that the curator
can either open or close.

00:16:37.214 --> 00:16:40.420
It allows people
on exercise bicycles to be seen,

00:16:40.444 --> 00:16:42.119
or to see the art, and so forth.

00:16:42.143 --> 00:16:45.863
It also means that if an artist wants
to invade something like a swimming pool,

00:16:45.887 --> 00:16:48.597
they can begin to do their exhibition
in a swimming pool,

00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:51.258
so they're not forced to always
work within the confines

00:16:51.282 --> 00:16:52.817
of a contemporary gallery space.

00:16:52.841 --> 00:16:54.008
So, how to build this.

00:16:54.032 --> 00:16:55.976
It's very simple: it's a chair.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.432
So, we begin by building the cores.

00:16:59.456 --> 00:17:03.000
As we're building the cores, we build
the contemporary art museum at grade.

00:17:03.024 --> 00:17:06.090
That allows us to have
incredible efficiency and cost efficiency.

00:17:06.114 --> 00:17:07.815
This is not a high-budget building.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.688
The moment the cores get to mid level,

00:17:09.712 --> 00:17:12.907
we finish the art museum; we put
all the mechanical equipment in it;

00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:14.676
and then we jack it up into the air.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.189
This is how they build
really large aircraft hangars,

00:17:17.213 --> 00:17:19.573
for instance, the ones
that they did for the A380.

00:17:19.597 --> 00:17:21.437
Finish the cores, finish the meat

00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:23.474
and you get something
that looks like this.

00:17:23.498 --> 00:17:25.076
Now I only have about 30 seconds,

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.998
so I want to start an animation,

00:17:27.022 --> 00:17:28.417
and we'll conclude with that.

00:17:28.441 --> 00:17:29.829
Thank you.

00:17:29.853 --> 00:17:33.976
(Applause)

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.976
Chris asked me to add --
