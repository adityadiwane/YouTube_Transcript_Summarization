00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.841
I'd like to tell you a story
about death and architecture.

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:21.471
A hundred years ago, we tended to die
of infectious diseases like pneumonia,

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:24.768
that, if they took hold,
would take us away quite quickly.

00:00:24.768 --> 00:00:28.502
We tended to die at home,
in our own beds, looked after by family,

00:00:28.502 --> 00:00:30.294
although that was the default option

00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:32.884
because a lot of people
lacked access to medical care.

00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:36.393
And then in the 20th century
a lot of things changed.

00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:38.490
We developed new medicines like penicillin

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.975
so we could treat
those infectious diseases.

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:44.249
New medical technologies
like x-ray machines were invented.

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:46.501
And because they were
so big and expensive,

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.519
we needed large, centralized
buildings to keep them in,

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.818
and they became our modern hospitals.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.241
After the Second World War,

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:55.881
a lot of countries set up 
universal healthcare systems

00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:58.528
so that everyone who needed
treatment could get it.

00:00:58.528 --> 00:01:02.777
The result was that lifespans extended
from about 45 at the start of the century

00:01:02.777 --> 00:01:04.960
to almost double that today.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.058
The 20th century was this time of huge 
optimism about what science could offer,

00:01:09.058 --> 00:01:12.785
but with all of the focus on life,
death was forgotten,

00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:15.190
even as our approach to death
changed dramatically.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.783
Now, I'm an architect,

00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:20.025
and for the past year and a half
I've been looking at these changes

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:23.179
and at what they mean for architecture
related to death and dying.

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.412
We now tend to die
of cancer and heart disease,

00:01:26.412 --> 00:01:30.408
and what that means is that many of us
will have a long period of chronic illness

00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:32.382
at the end of our lives.

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:33.495
During that period,

00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:38.558
we'll likely spend a lot of time 
in hospitals and hospices and care homes.

00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:40.764
Now, we've all been in a modern hospital.

00:01:40.764 --> 00:01:44.154
You know those fluorescent lights
and the endless corridors

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:47.172
and those rows of uncomfortable chairs.

00:01:47.172 --> 00:01:50.934
Hospital architecture
has earned its bad reputation.

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:54.091
But the surprising thing is,
it wasn't always like this.

00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:58.425
This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti,
built in 1419 by Brunelleschi,

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:02.172
who was one of the most famous
and influential architects of his time.

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:05.515
And when I look at this building
and then think about hospitals today,

00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:08.603
what amazes me is
this building's ambition.

00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:10.252
It's just a really great building.

00:02:10.252 --> 00:02:12.086
It has these courtyards in the middle

00:02:12.086 --> 00:02:14.619
so that all of the rooms
have daylight and fresh air,

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.032
and the rooms are big
and they have high ceilings,

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:19.516
so they just feel
more comfortable to be in.

00:02:19.516 --> 00:02:21.281
And it's also beautiful.

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:25.112
Somehow, we've forgotten
that that's even possible for a hospital.

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:29.135
Now, if we want better buildings
for dying, then we have to talk about it,

00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:31.706
but because we find the subject
of death uncomfortable,

00:02:31.706 --> 00:02:33.146
we don't talk about it,

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:36.458
and we don't question how we
as a society approach death.

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:39.632
One of the things that surprised me
most in my research, though,

00:02:39.632 --> 00:02:42.317
is how changeable attitudes actually are.

00:02:42.317 --> 00:02:44.709
This is the first crematorium in the U.K.,

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.518
which was built in Woking in the 1870s.

00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:50.925
And when this was first built,
there were protests in the local village.

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:55.808
Cremation wasn't socially acceptable,
and 99.8 percent of people got buried.

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:59.584
And yet, only a hundred years later,
three quarters of us get cremated.

00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:02.111
People are actually really open
to changing things

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.512
if they're given the chance
to talk about them.

00:03:04.512 --> 00:03:07.835
So this conversation
about death and architecture

00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:10.994
was what I wanted to start
when I did my first exhibition on it

00:03:10.994 --> 00:03:14.220
in Venice in June,
which was called "Death in Venice."

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.494
It was designed to be quite playful

00:03:17.494 --> 00:03:19.692
so that people would
literally engage with it.

00:03:19.692 --> 00:03:22.947
This is one of our exhibits,
which is an interactive map of London

00:03:22.947 --> 00:03:25.622
that shows just how much
of the real estate in the city

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.501
is given over to death and dying,

00:03:27.501 --> 00:03:29.870
and as you wave your hand across the map,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.699
the name of that piece of real estate,
the building or cemetery, is revealed.

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.207
Another of our exhibits
was a series of postcards

00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:39.204
that people could take away with them.

00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:41.665
And they showed people's homes
and hospitals

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:44.080
and cemeteries and mortuaries,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.541
and they tell the story
of the different spaces

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:49.374
that we pass through
on either side of death.

00:03:49.374 --> 00:03:51.719
We wanted to show
that where we die

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.970
is a key part of how we die.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.753
Now, the strangest thing was the way
that visitors reacted to the exhibition,

00:03:59.753 --> 00:04:02.121
especially the audio-visual works.

00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:05.813
We had people dancing
and running and jumping

00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:08.808
as they tried to activate
the exhibits in different ways,

00:04:08.808 --> 00:04:11.252
and at a certain point
they would kind of stop

00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:13.986
and remember that they were in
an exhibition about death,

00:04:13.986 --> 00:04:16.610
and that maybe that's not
how you're supposed to act.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.257
But actually, I would question
whether there is one way

00:04:19.257 --> 00:04:21.532
that you're supposed to act around death,

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:26.083
and if there's not, I'd ask you to think
about what you think a good death is,

00:04:26.083 --> 00:04:29.752
and what you think that architecture
that supports a good death might be like,

00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:34.480
and mightn't it be a little less like this
and a little more like this?

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.694
Thank you.

00:04:36.694 --> 00:04:38.714
(Applause)
