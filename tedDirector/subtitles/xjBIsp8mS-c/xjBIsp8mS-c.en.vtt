00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:17.076
There is nothing bigger
or older than the universe.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.588
The questions
I would like to talk about are:

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.898
one, where did we come from?

00:00:29.977 --> 00:00:32.413
How did the universe come into being?

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.136
Are we alone in the universe?

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:39.304
Is there alien life out there?

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:42.773
What is the future of the human race?

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:46.136
Up until the 1920s,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.136
everyone thought the universe
was essentially static

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.136
and unchanging in time.

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:55.815
Then it was discovered
that the universe was expanding.

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:59.989
Distant galaxies were moving away from us.

00:01:01.664 --> 00:01:05.413
This meant they must have been
closer together in the past.

00:01:06.413 --> 00:01:08.516
If we extrapolate back,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.136
we find we must have
all been on top of each other

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.682
about 15 billion years ago.

00:01:15.856 --> 00:01:19.547
This was the Big Bang,
the beginning of the universe.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.572
But was there anything
before the Big Bang?

00:01:24.643 --> 00:01:27.460
If not, what created the universe?

00:01:28.483 --> 00:01:32.874
Why did the universe emerge
from the Big Bang the way it did?

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.136
We used to think
that the theory of the universe

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.620
could be divided into two parts.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.136
First, there were the laws

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.824
like Maxwell's equations
and general relativity

00:01:45.848 --> 00:01:48.813
that determined the evolution
of the universe,

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:52.135
given its state
over all of space at one time.

00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:58.136
And second, there was no question
of the initial state of the universe.

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:03.136
We have made good progress
on the first part,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.136
and now have the knowledge
of the laws of evolution

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.136
in all but the most extreme conditions.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.136
But until recently,
we have had little idea

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.286
about the initial conditions
for the universe.

00:02:16.397 --> 00:02:21.826
However, this division into laws
of evolution and initial conditions

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.771
depends on time and space
being separate and distinct.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:31.635
Under extreme conditions,
general relativity and quantum theory

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.160
allow time to behave
like another dimension of space.

00:02:39.772 --> 00:02:43.359
This removes the distinction
between time and space,

00:02:43.383 --> 00:02:48.506
and means the laws of evolution
can also determine the initial state.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.506
The universe can spontaneously
create itself out of nothing.

00:02:58.757 --> 00:03:03.136
Moreover, we can calculate
a probability that the universe

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.560
was created in different states.

00:03:06.593 --> 00:03:08.922
These predictions
are in excellent agreement

00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:15.118
with observations by the WMAP satellite
of the cosmic microwave background,

00:03:15.142 --> 00:03:18.136
which is an imprint
of the very early universe.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.160
We think we have solved
the mystery of creation.

00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:26.928
Maybe we should patent the universe

00:03:26.952 --> 00:03:30.404
and charge everyone royalties
for their existence.

00:03:33.562 --> 00:03:36.514
I now turn to the second big question:

00:03:36.538 --> 00:03:40.160
are we alone, or is there
other life in the universe?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.825
We believe that life arose
spontaneously on the Earth,

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.699
so it must be possible for life
to appear on other suitable planets,

00:03:52.723 --> 00:03:56.317
of which there seem to be
a large number in the galaxy.

00:03:58.888 --> 00:04:01.685
But we don't know how life first appeared.

00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:07.136
We have two pieces
of observational evidence

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
on the probability of life appearing.

00:04:12.062 --> 00:04:18.160
The first is that we have fossils of algae
from 3.5 billion years ago.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.316
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.828
and was probably too hot
for about the first half billion years.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.415
So life appeared on Earth

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:39.091
within half a billion years
of it being possible,

00:04:39.115 --> 00:04:42.791
which is short compared
to the 10-billion-year lifetime

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:44.433
of a planet of Earth type.

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:50.275
This suggests that the probability
of life appearing is reasonably high.

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:54.654
If it was very low,
one would have expected it

00:04:54.678 --> 00:04:58.136
to take most
of the ten billion years available.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.890
On the other hand, we don't seem
to have been visited by aliens.

00:05:04.858 --> 00:05:07.731
I am discounting the reports of UFOs.

00:05:08.818 --> 00:05:12.034
Why would they appear
only to cranks and weirdos?

00:05:14.637 --> 00:05:18.702
If there is a government conspiracy
to suppress the reports

00:05:18.726 --> 00:05:23.136
and keep for itself the scientific
knowledge the aliens bring,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.556
it seems to have been a singularly
ineffective policy so far.

00:05:32.446 --> 00:05:37.136
Furthermore, despite an extensive search
by the SETI project,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.136
we haven't heard any alien
television quiz shows.

00:05:42.294 --> 00:05:46.581
This probably indicates
that there are no alien civilizations

00:05:46.605 --> 00:05:48.851
at our stage of development

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:52.160
within a radius
of a few hundred light years.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.136
Issuing an insurance policy

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.833
against abduction by aliens
seems a pretty safe bet.

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:05.555
This brings me to the last
of the big questions:

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:07.705
the future of the human race.

00:06:08.821 --> 00:06:12.480
If we are the only intelligent
beings in the galaxy,

00:06:12.504 --> 00:06:15.789
we should make sure
we survive and continue.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.380
But we are entering an increasingly
dangerous period of our history.

00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:32.958
Our population and our use
of the finite resources of planet Earth

00:06:32.982 --> 00:06:35.054
are growing exponentially,

00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:40.077
along with our technical ability
to change the environment for good or ill.

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:46.615
But our genetic code

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.646
still carries the selfish
and aggressive instincts

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.750
that were of survival
advantage in the past.

00:06:57.091 --> 00:07:00.112
It will be difficult enough
to avoid disaster

00:07:00.136 --> 00:07:01.852
in the next hundred years,

00:07:01.876 --> 00:07:04.399
let alone the next thousand or million.

00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:11.778
Our only chance of long-term survival

00:07:11.802 --> 00:07:15.136
is not to remain inward-looking
on planet Earth,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.388
but to spread out into space.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.580
The answers to these big questions

00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:27.376
show that we have made remarkable progress
in the last hundred years.

00:07:28.456 --> 00:07:32.479
But if we want to continue
beyond the next hundred years,

00:07:32.503 --> 00:07:34.666
our future is in space.

00:07:36.723 --> 00:07:39.136
That is why I am in favor of manned --

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.873
or should I say, 
personned -- space flight.

00:07:48.066 --> 00:07:52.136
All of my life I have sought
to understand the universe

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.649
and find answers to these questions.

00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:57.498
I have been very lucky

00:07:57.522 --> 00:08:01.579
that my disability has not been
a serious handicap.

00:08:01.603 --> 00:08:06.242
Indeed, it has probably given me
more time than most people

00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:08.536
to pursue the quest for knowledge.

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:16.136
The ultimate goal is a complete
theory of the universe,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.414
and we are making good progress.

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:24.080
Thank you for listening.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.974
Chris Anderson: Professor,
if you had to guess either way,

00:08:29.998 --> 00:08:33.804
do you now believe
that it is more likely than not

00:08:33.828 --> 00:08:37.146
that we are alone in the Milky Way,

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:42.873
as a civilization of our level
of intelligence or higher?

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:03.136
This answer took seven minutes,
and really gave me an insight

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:08.212
into the incredible act of generosity
this whole talk was for TED.

00:09:18.643 --> 00:09:23.136
Stephen Hawking: I think it quite likely
that we are the only civilization

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.495
within several hundred light years;

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:29.932
otherwise we would have heard radio waves.

00:09:32.632 --> 00:09:37.112
The alternative is that civilizations
don't last very long,

00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:39.297
but destroy themselves.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.136
CA: Professor Hawking,
thank you for that answer.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.109
We will take it
as a salutary warning, I think,

00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:49.423
for the rest of our conference this week.

00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:54.427
Professor, we really thank you
for the extraordinary effort you made

00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:57.364
to share your questions with us today.

00:09:57.388 --> 00:09:59.040
Thank you very much indeed.

00:09:59.064 --> 00:10:00.876
(Applause)
