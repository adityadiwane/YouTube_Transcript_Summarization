00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:16.955
Fifty-four percent of the world's population

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:19.536
lives in our cities.

00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:21.181
In developing countries,

00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:23.461
one third of that population

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:26.408
is living in slums.

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:31.040
Seventy-five percent of global energy consumption

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.090
occurs in our cities,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.599
and 80 percent of gas emissions

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:38.354
that cause global warming

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:41.392
come from our cities.

00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:44.417
So things that you and I might think about

00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:46.532
as global problems,

00:00:46.532 --> 00:00:49.180
like climate change, the energy crisis

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.842
or poverty,

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:55.702
are really, in many ways, city problems.

00:00:55.702 --> 00:00:57.564
They will not be solved

00:00:57.564 --> 00:01:00.582
unless people who live in cities,

00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:02.501
like most of us,

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:05.293
actually start doing a better job,

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:09.249
because right now, we are 
not doing a very good one.

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:12.585
And that becomes very clear

00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:16.479
when we look into three aspects of city life:

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.605
first, our citizens' willingness to engage

00:01:20.605 --> 00:01:23.417
with democratic institutions;

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:28.221
second, our cities' ability to really include

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.763
all of their residents;

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:33.940
and lastly, our own ability

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.405
to live fulfilling and happy lives.

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:40.184
When it comes to engagement,

00:01:40.184 --> 00:01:43.114
the data is very clear.

00:01:43.114 --> 00:01:45.195
Voter turnout around the world

00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:47.636
peaked in the late '80s,

00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:49.481
and it has been declining at a pace

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:52.543
that we have never seen before,

00:01:52.543 --> 00:01:56.138
and if those numbers are bad at the national level,

00:01:56.138 --> 00:01:58.147
at the level of our cities,

00:01:58.147 --> 00:02:01.236
they are just dismal.

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:02.830
In the last two years,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.331
two of the world's most consolidated,

00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:09.166
oldest democracies, the U.S. and France,

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:12.971
held nationwide municipal elections.

00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:16.871
In France, voter turnout hit a record low.

00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:20.933
Almost 40 percent of voters decided

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:23.621
not to show up.

00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:26.710
In the U.S., the numbers were even scarier.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.987
In some American cities,

00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:33.981
voter turnout was close to five percent.

00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:35.770
I'll let that sink in for a second.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.188
We're talking about democratic cities

00:02:38.188 --> 00:02:41.563
in which 95 percent of people

00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:43.981
decided that it was not important

00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:46.726
to elect their leaders.

00:02:46.726 --> 00:02:50.380
The city of L.A., a city of four million people,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.309
elected its mayor with just a bit over 200,000 votes.

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.795
That was the lowest turnout the city had seen

00:02:57.795 --> 00:03:00.676
in 100 years.

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:03.720
Right here, in my city of Rio,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.794
in spite of mandatory voting,

00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:10.292
almost 30 percent of the voting population

00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:12.857
chose to either annul their votes

00:03:12.857 --> 00:03:15.489
or stay home and pay a fine

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.820
in the last mayoral elections.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.139
When it comes to inclusiveness,

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.244
our cities are not the best cases of success either,

00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:27.134
and again, you don't need to look very far

00:03:27.134 --> 00:03:28.889
in order to find proof of that.

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.388
The city of Rio is incredibly unequal.

00:03:33.388 --> 00:03:35.357
This is Leblon.

00:03:35.357 --> 00:03:38.461
Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood.

00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:40.900
And this is Complexo do Alemão.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.164
This is where over 70,000

00:03:43.164 --> 00:03:46.415
of the city's poorest residents live.

00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:50.001
Leblon has an HDI, a Human Development Index,

00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:53.390
of .967.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.211
That is higher than Norway, Switzerland

00:03:57.211 --> 00:03:59.452
or Sweden.

00:03:59.452 --> 00:04:03.181
Complexo do Alemão has an HDI of .711.

00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:06.111
It sits somewhere in between the HDI

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:09.328
of Algeria and Gabon.

00:04:09.328 --> 00:04:14.109
So Rio, like so many cities across the global South,

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.080
is a place where you can go from northern Europe

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.980
to sub-Saharan Africa

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.984
in the space of 30 minutes.

00:04:21.984 --> 00:04:23.693
If you drive, that is.

00:04:23.693 --> 00:04:28.440
If you take public transit, it's about two hours.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.299
And lastly, perhaps most importantly,

00:04:32.299 --> 00:04:34.780
cities, with the incredible wealth

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.282
of relations that they enable,

00:04:37.282 --> 00:04:41.160
could be the ideal places for human happiness

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.562
to flourish.

00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:44.987
We like being around people.

00:04:44.987 --> 00:04:47.383
We are social animals.

00:04:47.383 --> 00:04:50.006
Instead, countries where urbanization

00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:54.228
has already peaked seem to be the very countries

00:04:54.228 --> 00:04:58.880
in which cities have stopped making us happy.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.484
The United States population has suffered

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:04.464
from a general decrease in happiness

00:05:04.464 --> 00:05:07.666
for the past three decades,

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:10.640
and the main reason is this.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.542
The American way of building cities

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:16.253
has caused good quality public spaces

00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:18.237
to virtually disappear in many,

00:05:18.237 --> 00:05:19.992
many American cities,

00:05:19.992 --> 00:05:21.989
and as a result, they have seen

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:24.544
a decline of relations,

00:05:24.544 --> 00:05:26.748
of the things that make us happy.

00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:28.795
Many studies show an increase

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:33.486
in solitude and a decrease in solidarity,

00:05:33.486 --> 00:05:38.142
honesty, and social and civic participation.

00:05:38.142 --> 00:05:41.506
So how do we start building cities

00:05:41.506 --> 00:05:44.116
that make us care?

00:05:44.116 --> 00:05:48.750
Cities that value their most important asset:

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.349
the incredible diversity

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.555
of the people who live in them?

00:05:53.555 --> 00:05:57.212
Cities that make us happy?

00:05:57.212 --> 00:05:59.719
Well, I believe that if we want to change

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.271
what our cities look like,

00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:04.961
then we really have to change

00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:07.504
the decision-making processes

00:06:07.504 --> 00:06:11.328
that have given us the results 
that we have right now.

00:06:11.328 --> 00:06:14.500
We need a participation revolution,

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.374
and we need it fast.

00:06:17.374 --> 00:06:22.712
The idea of voting as our 
only exercise in citizenship

00:06:22.712 --> 00:06:25.670
does not make sense anymore.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.199
People are tired of only being treated

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.372
as empowered individuals every few years

00:06:32.372 --> 00:06:35.522
when it's time to delegate that power

00:06:35.522 --> 00:06:37.897
to someone else.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:40.842
If the protests that swept Brazil

00:06:40.842 --> 00:06:45.814
in June 2013 have taught us anything,

00:06:45.814 --> 00:06:48.649
it's that every time we try

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:51.101
to exercise our power

00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:53.958
outside of an electoral context,

00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:59.212
we are beaten up, humiliated or arrested.

00:06:59.212 --> 00:07:02.419
And this needs to change,

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.633
because when it does,

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:06.894
not only will people re-engage

00:07:06.894 --> 00:07:09.380
with the structures of representation,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.654
but also complement these structures

00:07:12.654 --> 00:07:19.572
with direct, effective, and 
collective decision making,

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.496
decision making of the kind

00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:23.542
that attacks inequality

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:26.782
by its very inclusive nature,

00:07:26.782 --> 00:07:28.605
decision making of the kind

00:07:28.605 --> 00:07:30.821
that can change our cities

00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:33.937
into better places for us to live.

00:07:33.937 --> 00:07:37.416
But there is a catch, obviously:

00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:40.157
Enabling widespread participation

00:07:40.157 --> 00:07:42.115
and redistributing power

00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:44.840
can be a logistical nightmare,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.129
and there's where technology can play

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.306
an incredibly helpful role,

00:07:49.306 --> 00:07:52.388
by making it easier for people to organize,

00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:54.452
communicate and make decisions

00:07:54.452 --> 00:07:56.690
without having to be in the same room

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.952
at the same time.

00:07:58.952 --> 00:08:00.853
Unfortunately for us,

00:08:00.853 --> 00:08:03.879
when it comes to fostering democratic processes,

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:06.964
our city governments have not used technology

00:08:06.964 --> 00:08:09.942
to its full potential.

00:08:09.942 --> 00:08:13.159
So far, most city governments have been effective

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:17.742
at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors

00:08:17.742 --> 00:08:21.450
who serve authorities with data on the city:

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.456
potholes, fallen trees or broken lamps.

00:08:25.456 --> 00:08:27.886
They have also, to a lesser extent,

00:08:27.886 --> 00:08:31.486
invited people to participate in improving

00:08:31.486 --> 00:08:33.100
the outcome of decisions

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.412
that were already made for them,

00:08:36.412 --> 00:08:37.987
just like my mom when I was eight

00:08:37.987 --> 00:08:39.753
and she told me that I had a choice:

00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:41.330
I had to be in bed by 8 p.m.,

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.243
but I could choose my pink
pajamas or my blue pajamas.

00:08:45.243 --> 00:08:47.482
That's not participation,

00:08:47.482 --> 00:08:51.227
and in fact, governments have not been very good

00:08:51.227 --> 00:08:54.130
at using technology to enable participation

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.080
on what matters —

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.393
the way we allocate our budget,

00:08:58.393 --> 00:09:00.615
the way we occupy our land,

00:09:00.615 --> 00:09:04.164
and the way we manage our natural resources.

00:09:04.164 --> 00:09:06.278
Those are the kinds of decisions

00:09:06.278 --> 00:09:09.158
that can actually impact global problems

00:09:09.158 --> 00:09:12.980
that manifest themselves in our cities.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.506
The good news is,

00:09:14.506 --> 00:09:16.369
and I do have good news to share with you,

00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:20.666
we don't need to wait for governments to do this.

00:09:20.666 --> 00:09:22.636
I have reason to believe

00:09:22.636 --> 00:09:25.224
that it's possible for citizens to build

00:09:25.224 --> 00:09:29.757
their own structures of participation.

00:09:29.757 --> 00:09:32.558
Three years ago, I cofounded an organization

00:09:32.558 --> 00:09:35.045
called Meu Rio,

00:09:35.045 --> 00:09:38.125
and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:41.704
to organize around causes and places

00:09:41.704 --> 00:09:44.301
that they care about in their own city,

00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:46.990
and have an impact on those causes and places

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.318
every day.

00:09:49.318 --> 00:09:52.060
In these past three years, Meu Rio grew

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.928
to a network of 160,000 citizens of Rio.

00:09:57.928 --> 00:10:01.833
About 40 percent of those 
members are young people

00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:04.072
aged 20 to 29.

00:10:04.072 --> 00:10:08.996
That is one in every 15 young people

00:10:08.996 --> 00:10:12.828
of that age in Rio today.

00:10:12.828 --> 00:10:16.460
Amongst our members is this adorable little girl,

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.509
Bia, to your right,

00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:21.636
and Bia was just 11 years old

00:10:21.636 --> 00:10:24.572
when she started a campaign using one of our tools

00:10:24.572 --> 00:10:28.161
to save her model public school from demolition.

00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:30.253
Her school actually ranks among the best

00:10:30.253 --> 00:10:32.525
public schools in the country,

00:10:32.525 --> 00:10:34.257
and it was going to be demolished

00:10:34.257 --> 00:10:36.811
by the Rio de Janeiro state government

00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:38.701
to build, I kid you not,

00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:41.524
a parking lot for the World Cup

00:10:41.524 --> 00:10:43.870
right before the event happened.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.364
Bia started a campaign, and we even watched

00:10:46.364 --> 00:10:49.747
her school 24/7 through webcam monitoring,

00:10:49.747 --> 00:10:51.761
and many months afterwards,

00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:53.392
the government changed their minds.

00:10:53.392 --> 00:10:56.316
Bia's school stayed in place.

00:10:56.316 --> 00:10:58.487
There's also Jovita.

00:10:58.487 --> 00:11:00.759
She's an amazing woman whose daughter

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:03.420
went missing about 10 years ago,

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.855
and since then, she has been looking

00:11:05.855 --> 00:11:07.039
for her daughter.

00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:09.815
In that process, she found out

00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:12.368
that first, she was not alone.

00:11:12.368 --> 00:11:14.956
In the last year alone, 2013,

00:11:14.956 --> 00:11:16.830
6,000 people disappeared

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.706
in the state of Rio.

00:11:18.706 --> 00:11:21.334
But she also found out that in spite of that,

00:11:21.334 --> 00:11:25.285
Rio had no centralized intelligence system

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:28.590
for solving missing persons cases.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.160
In other Brazilian cities, those systems

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.550
have helped solve up to 80 percent

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.586
of missing persons cases.

00:11:35.586 --> 00:11:37.329
She started a campaign,

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:41.311
and after the secretary of 
security got 16,000 emails

00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:44.124
from people asking him to do this,

00:11:44.124 --> 00:11:47.106
he responded, and started to build a police unit

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:48.930
specializing in those cases.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.286
It was open to the public at the end of last month,

00:11:52.286 --> 00:11:54.137
and Jovita was there

00:11:54.137 --> 00:11:57.161
giving interviews and being very fancy.

00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:59.000
And then, there is Leandro.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.723
Leandro is an amazing guy

00:12:00.723 --> 00:12:02.639
in a slum in Rio,

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:06.062
and he created a recycling project in the slum.

00:12:06.062 --> 00:12:08.512
At the end of last year, December 16,

00:12:08.512 --> 00:12:10.604
he received an eviction order

00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:12.584
by the Rio de Janeiro state government

00:12:12.584 --> 00:12:16.504
giving him two weeks to leave the space

00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:20.244
that he had been using for two years.

00:12:20.244 --> 00:12:22.809
The plan was to hand it over to a developer,

00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:26.229
who planned to turn it into a construction site.

00:12:26.229 --> 00:12:29.297
Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools,

00:12:29.297 --> 00:12:30.875
the Pressure Cooker,

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.214
the same one that Bia and Jovita used,

00:12:33.214 --> 00:12:36.270
and the state government changed their minds

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.536
before Christmas Eve.

00:12:39.536 --> 00:12:42.608
These stories make me happy,

00:12:42.608 --> 00:12:45.655
but not just because they have happy endings.

00:12:45.655 --> 00:12:48.401
They make me happy because they are

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:51.100
happy beginnings.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.519
The teacher and parent community at Bia's school

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:55.475
is looking for other ways they could improve

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:58.952
that space even further.

00:12:58.952 --> 00:13:00.663
Leandro has ambitious plans

00:13:00.663 --> 00:13:03.616
to take his model to other
low-income communities in Rio,

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.827
and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit

00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:09.667
that she helped created.

00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:12.415
Bia, Jovita and Leandro

00:13:12.415 --> 00:13:14.475
are living examples of something

00:13:14.475 --> 00:13:18.057
that citizens and city 
governments around the world

00:13:18.057 --> 00:13:20.461
need to know:

00:13:20.461 --> 00:13:23.788
We are ready.

00:13:23.788 --> 00:13:26.716
As citizens, we are ready

00:13:26.716 --> 00:13:30.271
to decide on our common destinies,

00:13:30.271 --> 00:13:34.290
because we know that the way we distribute power

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:39.130
says a lot about how we actually value everyone,

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.360
and because we know

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.855
that enabling and participating in local politics

00:13:44.855 --> 00:13:46.978
is a sign that we truly care

00:13:46.978 --> 00:13:49.168
about our relations to one another,

00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:50.890
and we are ready to do this

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.907
in cities around the world right now.

00:13:54.907 --> 00:13:57.303
With the Our Cities network,

00:13:57.303 --> 00:13:58.640
the Meu Rio team

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.666
hopes to share what we have learned

00:14:00.666 --> 00:14:02.622
with other people who want to create

00:14:02.622 --> 00:14:05.884
similar initiatives in their own cities.

00:14:05.884 --> 00:14:08.441
We have already started doing it in São Paulo

00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:10.137
with incredible results,

00:14:10.137 --> 00:14:13.444
and want to take it to cities around the world

00:14:13.444 --> 00:14:16.369
through a network of citizen-centric,

00:14:16.369 --> 00:14:18.746
citizen-led organizations

00:14:18.746 --> 00:14:20.932
that can inspire us,

00:14:20.932 --> 00:14:24.396
challenge us, and remind us to demand

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:29.447
real participation in our city lives.

00:14:29.447 --> 00:14:31.409
It is up to us

00:14:31.409 --> 00:14:33.894
to decide whether we want schools

00:14:33.894 --> 00:14:36.180
or parking lots,

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.513
community-driven recycling projects

00:14:38.513 --> 00:14:41.116
or construction sites,

00:14:41.116 --> 00:14:43.536
loneliness or solidarity, cars or buses,

00:14:43.536 --> 00:14:47.235
and it is our responsibility to do that now,

00:14:47.235 --> 00:14:50.659
for ourselves, for our families,

00:14:50.659 --> 00:14:54.753
for the people who make our lives worth living,

00:14:54.753 --> 00:14:57.620
and for the incredible creativity,

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.027
beauty, and wonder that make our cities,

00:15:01.027 --> 00:15:03.614
in spite of all of their problems,

00:15:03.614 --> 00:15:07.330
the greatest invention of our time.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.810
Obrigado. Thank you.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:13.081
(Applause)
