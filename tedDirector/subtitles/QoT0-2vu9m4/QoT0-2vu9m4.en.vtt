00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:15.286
I've noticed something interesting
about society and culture.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.868
Everything risky requires a license.

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:22.848
So, learning to drive,
owning a gun, getting married.

00:00:23.177 --> 00:00:24.511
There's a certain --

00:00:24.535 --> 00:00:26.835
(Laughter)

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.580
That's true in everything risky,
except technology.

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:32.939
For some reason,
there's no standard syllabus,

00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:34.929
there's no basic course.

00:00:34.953 --> 00:00:38.572
They just sort of give you your computer
and then kick you out of the nest.

00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:40.873
You're supposed to learn
this stuff -- how?

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:42.124
Just by osmosis.

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:45.040
Nobody ever sits down and tells you,
"This is how it works."

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:48.017
So today I'm going to tell you ten things

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:51.407
that you thought everybody knew,
but it turns out they don't.

00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:54.217
First of all, on the web,
if you want to scroll down,

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:56.482
don't pick up the mouse
and use the scroll bar.

00:00:56.506 --> 00:00:58.033
That's a terrible waste of time.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.097
Do that only if you're paid by the hour.

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:01.998
Instead, hit the space bar.

00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:05.861
The space bar scrolls down one page.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:08.766
Hold down the Shift key
to scroll back up again.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.702
So, space bar to scroll down one page;
works in every browser,

00:01:11.726 --> 00:01:12.979
in every kind of computer.

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:16.725
Also on the web, when you're filling in
one of these forms like your addresses,

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:18.958
I assume you know
that you can hit the Tab key

00:01:18.982 --> 00:01:20.561
to jump from box to box to box.

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:23.355
But what about the pop-up menu
where you put in your state?

00:01:23.755 --> 00:01:25.660
Don't open the pop-up menu.

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:27.548
That's a terrible waste of calories.

00:01:27.572 --> 00:01:31.142
Type the first letter of your state
over and over and over.

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.394
So if you want Connecticut, go, C, C, C.

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:36.830
If you want Texas, go T, T,
and you jump right to that thing

00:01:36.854 --> 00:01:38.918
without even opening the pop-up menu.

00:01:39.278 --> 00:01:42.162
Also on the web,
when the text is too small,

00:01:42.186 --> 00:01:45.686
what you do is hold down the Control key
and hit plus, plus, plus.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.529
You make the text larger with each tap.

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:50.985
Works on every computer,
every web browser,

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.979
or minus, minus, to get smaller again.

00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.569
If you're on the Mac,
it might be Command instead.

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:59.433
When you're typing
on your Blackberry, Android, iPhone,

00:01:59.457 --> 00:02:02.719
don't bother switching layouts
to the punctuation layout

00:02:02.743 --> 00:02:04.577
to hit the period and then a space,

00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:06.506
then try to capitalize the next letter.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.533
Just hit the space bar twice.

00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:11.986
The phone puts the period,
the space, and the capital for you.

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:13.726
Go space, space.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.631
It is totally amazing.

00:02:15.938 --> 00:02:18.952
Also when it comes
to cell phones, on all phones,

00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:22.562
if you want to redial
somebody that you've dialed before,

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:25.107
all you have to do is hit the call button,

00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:28.702
and it puts the last phone number
into the box for you,

00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:31.857
and at that point you can hit
call again to actually dial it.

00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:35.405
No need to go to the recent calls list
if you're trying to call somebody

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:36.920
just hit the call button again.

00:02:36.944 --> 00:02:38.427
Something that drives me crazy:

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:41.046
When I call you and leave a message
on your voice mail,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.840
I hear you saying, "Leave a message,"

00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:46.221
and then I get these 15 seconds
of freaking instructions,

00:02:46.245 --> 00:02:49.909
like we haven't had
answering machines for 45 years!

00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:53.597
(Laughter)

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:55.074
I'm not bitter.

00:02:55.098 --> 00:02:56.105
(Laughter)

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.341
So it turns out
there's a keyboard shortcut

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:00.723
that lets you jump directly
to the beep like this.

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.334
Phone: At the tone, please...

00:03:02.358 --> 00:03:03.359
(Beep)

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.873
David Pogue: Unfortunately,
the carriers didn't adopt

00:03:05.897 --> 00:03:08.338
the same keystroke,
so it's different by carrier,

00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:11.403
so it devolves upon you
to learn the keystroke

00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:13.285
for the person you're calling.

00:03:14.058 --> 00:03:16.107
I didn't say these were going
to be perfect.

00:03:16.656 --> 00:03:18.306
So most of you think of Google

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.582
as something that lets you
look up a web page,

00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:21.976
but it is also a dictionary.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.592
Type the word "define"
and the word you want to know.

00:03:24.616 --> 00:03:26.441
You don't even have to click anything.

00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:28.521
There's the definition as you type.

00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:30.576
It's also a complete FAA database.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.684
Type the name of the airline
and the flight.

00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:35.407
It shows you where the flight is,
the gate, the terminal,

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:36.717
how long until it lands.

00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:38.152
You don't need an app.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.143
It's also unit and currency conversion.

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:42.790
Again, you don't have to click
one of the results.

00:03:42.814 --> 00:03:45.419
Just type it into the box,
and there's your answer.

00:03:45.443 --> 00:03:47.134
While we're talking about text --

00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:49.959
When you want to highlight --

00:03:50.712 --> 00:03:52.078
this is just an example --

00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:53.966
(Laughter)

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.249
When you want to highlight a word,

00:03:56.273 --> 00:03:59.243
please don't waste your life
dragging across it

00:03:59.267 --> 00:04:00.677
with the mouse like a newbie.

00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.335
Double click the word.

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.020
Watch "200" -- I go double-click,

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:05.753
it neatly selects just that word.

00:04:05.777 --> 00:04:08.494
Also, don't delete
what you've highlighted.

00:04:08.518 --> 00:04:09.891
You can just type over it.

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:11.445
This is in every program.

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.460
Also, you can go double-click, drag,

00:04:13.484 --> 00:04:16.366
to highlight in one-word
increments as you drag.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.630
Much more precise.

00:04:17.654 --> 00:04:19.489
Again, don't bother deleting.

00:04:19.513 --> 00:04:20.819
Just type over it.

00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:24.551
(Laughter)

00:04:24.575 --> 00:04:28.056
Shutter lag is the time
between your pressing the shutter button

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.414
and the moment the camera actually snaps.

00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:33.382
It's extremely frustrating
on any camera under $1,000.

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:35.016
(Camera click)

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.579
(Laughter)

00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:42.357
So, that's because the camera needs time
to calculate the focus and exposure,

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:45.242
but if you pre-focus with a half-press,

00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:47.032
leave your finger down --

00:04:47.056 --> 00:04:48.300
no shutter lag!

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.414
You get it every time.

00:04:51.438 --> 00:04:55.622
I've just turned your $50 camera
into a $1,000 camera with that trick.

00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:58.955
And finally, it often happens
that you're giving a talk,

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.011
and for some reason,
the audience is looking at the slide

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.293
instead of at you!

00:05:03.317 --> 00:05:05.691
(Laughter)

00:05:05.715 --> 00:05:08.618
So when that happens --
this works in Keynote, PowerPoint,

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:11.653
it works in every program
-- all you do is hit the letter B key,

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:15.230
B for blackout, to black out the slide,
make everybody look at you,

00:05:15.254 --> 00:05:17.733
and then when you're ready
to go on, you hit B again,

00:05:17.757 --> 00:05:22.220
and if you're really on a roll,
you can hit the W key for "whiteout,"

00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:23.955
and you white out the slide,

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.620
and then you can hit W again
to un-blank it.

00:05:26.644 --> 00:05:28.254
So I know I went super fast.

00:05:28.278 --> 00:05:31.722
If you missed anything, I'll be happy
to send you the list of these tips.

00:05:31.746 --> 00:05:33.321
In the meantime, congratulations.

00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:35.778
You all get your California
Technology License.

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.014
Have a great day.

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:39.772
(Applause)
