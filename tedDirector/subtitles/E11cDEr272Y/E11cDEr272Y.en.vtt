00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
among the smartest of the smart.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
There's a Jewish saying that I love.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.160
What is truer than truth? Answer: The story.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160
I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.160
about our common humanity.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
All stories interest me, and some haunt me

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
until I end up writing them.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160
Certain themes keep coming up:

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.160
justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.160
freedom.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
I'm aware of the mystery around us,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
so I write about coincidences, premonitions,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.160
emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
In the last 20 years I have published a few books,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.160
but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.160
That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.160
(Laughter)

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160
of the opening ceremony,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
called me and said that I had been selected

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.160
to be one of the flag-bearers.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.160
without a walker.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
(Laughter)

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
I was told that this was no laughing matter.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160
This would be the first time

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
that only women would carry the Olympic flag.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
Five women, representing five continents,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
and three Olympic gold medal winners.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
My first question was, naturally,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160
what was I going to wear?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160
(Laughter)

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160
A uniform, she said,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.160
and asked for my measurements.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.160
My measurements.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
looking like the Michelin Man.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.160
(Laughter)

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160
By the middle of February,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
I found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.160
cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.160
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160
A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
can determine the result of a race or a game.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.160
However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.160
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160
It is all about passion.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.160
The streets of Turin were covered with red posters

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
announcing the slogan of the Olympics.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.160
Passion lives here. Isn't it always true?

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
That is what I need for my characters in my books:

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160
a passionate heart.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.160
I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.160
who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
People like all of you in this room.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.160
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160
(Laughter)

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
They only make good former spouses.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
(Laughter)

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
(Applause)

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
In the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers:

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
three athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
Also, two women with passionate hearts:

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Wangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
who has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
she has changed the soil, the weather,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
in some places in Africa, and of course

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
the economic conditions in many villages.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.160
And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.160
against child prostitution.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.160
When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160
She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.160
And of brothels where children are forced to receive five,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
15 clients per day,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
In the green room I received my uniform.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
but it was far from the Michelin Man suit

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
that I had anticipated. Not bad, really.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.160
I looked like a refrigerator.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.160
(Laughter)

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.160
the universal symbol of beauty and passion.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.160
She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.160
I don't know.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.160
When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.160
She replied, "Posture. My back is always straight,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
and I don't make old people's noises."

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
(Laughter)

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
So, there you have some free advice

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
from one of the most beautiful women on earth.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
no talking to yourselves, no farting.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.160
(Laughter)

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.160
Well, she didn't say that exactly.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
(Laughter)

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
At some point around midnight,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
we were summoned to the wings of the stadium,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.160
and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started --

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
by the way, the same music that starts here,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160
the Aida March.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.160
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
not counting the poofy hair.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.160
(Laughter)

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160
She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.160
holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.160
(Laughter)

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
-- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
so that my head was actually under the damn flag.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
(Laughter)

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
All the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
That was fortunate for me, because in most press photos

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.160
I appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
(Laughter)

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
A place where most men would love to be.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.160
(Laughter)

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
(Applause)

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
The best four minutes of my entire life

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
were those in the Olympic stadium.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
My husband is offended when I say this --

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
although I have explained to him that what we do in private

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
usually takes less than four minutes --

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.160
(Laughter)

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
-- so he shouldn't take it personally.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.160
I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
because I don't want to forget them

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
when old age destroys my brain cells.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.160
I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics --

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
passion.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
So here's a tale of passion.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
for Tutsi refugees in Congo.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.160
By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.160
are women and girls.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
We can call this place in Congo a death camp,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.160
because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
The protagonists of this story

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
are a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
She's pregnant and a widow.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
Soldiers have forced her to watch

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
as her husband was tortured and killed.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.160
Two tiny little boys.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
and ties it with her own hair.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
She names the twins after the camp's commanders

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
to gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
because her milk cannot sustain them.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.160
she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
even when they hold a gun to her head.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
Somehow, the family survives for 16 months,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.160
and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.160
of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160
who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.160
Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
where they're now living and thriving.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.160
Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160
like Rose Mapendo.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
I don't make them up. There's no need for that.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
I look around and I see them everywhere.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.160
I have worked with women and for women all my life.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.160
I know them well.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist --

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
although the term had not reached Chile yet,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
(Laughter)

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
for my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160
But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
I was able to deliver two.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.160
(Laughter)

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
Once, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.160
she said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.160
Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.160
but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
who are still forced into premature marriage,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
prostitution, forced labor --

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
They have no control over their bodies or their lives.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160
They have no education and no freedom.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.160
They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
For most Western young women of today,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
being called a feminist is an insult.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
that it never stopped me from flirting,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
(Laughter)

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160
Feminism is not dead, by no means.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
It has evolved. If you don't like the term,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160
change it, for Goddess' sake.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.160
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want;

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.160
the name doesn't matter,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.160
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160
The year is 2005.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
Jenny is a young American dental hygienist

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
during her three-week vacation.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.160
She's prepared to clean teeth,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160
but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.160
no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
Outside, there is a line of women

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
who have waited several hours to be treated.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
The first patient is in excruciating pain

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
because she has several rotten molars.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.160
Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
She risks a lot and she's terrified.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160
She doesn't even have the proper instruments,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160
At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.160
The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
The woman's face looks like a watermelon.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.160
The husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
Jenny is horrified at what she has done,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
but then the translator explains

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.160
The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
in time to prepare dinner for him.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
Millions of women live like this today.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
They are the poorest of the poor.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
they own less than one percent of the world's assets.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
They are paid less than men for the same work

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
if they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
because they have no economic independence,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
and they are constantly threatened by exploitation,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.160
violence and abuse.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
It is a fact that giving women education, work,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
the ability to control their own income,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.160
inherit and own property, benefits the society.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.160
If a woman is empowered,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
her children and her family will be better off.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.160
If families prosper, the village prospers,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
and eventually so does the whole country.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.160
She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
because they have cut and sold the trees.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.160
She gets the women to plant new trees and water them,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.160
drop by drop.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.160
In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.160
the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
The poorest and most backward societies

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.160
are always those that put women down.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160
and also by philanthropy.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
For every dollar given to a women's program,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160
20 dollars are given to men's programs.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
Women are 51 percent of humankind.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160
Empowering them will change everything --

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.160
more than technology and design and entertainment.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.160
I can promise you that women working together --

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
linked, informed and educated --

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.160
can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.160
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
mainly women and children. They are collateral damage.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
Men run the world, and look at the mess we have.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
What kind of world do we want?

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.160
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.160
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
We want a world where life is preserved

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
and the quality of life is enriched for everybody,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160
not only for the privileged.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.160
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.160
at the UC Berkeley library.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.160
No museum or gallery in the United States,

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.160
except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
has dared to show the paintings because the theme

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
is the Abu Ghraib prison.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.160
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.160
in the voluminous Botero style.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.160
or my heart.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160
What I fear most is power with impunity.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.160
I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
In our species, the alpha males define reality,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.160
and follow the rules.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
and in this case, the trickle-down effect,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160
which does not work in economics, works perfectly.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.160
Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.160
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse --

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.160
a woman or a child.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.160
I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.160
through gender, income, race, and class.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.160
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.160
in our civilization.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.160
But for real change, we need feminine energy

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.160
in the management of the world.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
We need a critical number of women in positions of power,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.160
I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.160
(Laughter)

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.160
Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
and legendary breasts.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.160
But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.160
of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160
I want to make this world good.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
Not better, but to make it good.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.160
Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room --

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.160
all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.160
Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.160
and get to work, passionately,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.160
in creating an almost perfect world.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
Thank you.
