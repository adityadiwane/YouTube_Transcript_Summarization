00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So when I thought about compassion,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
where he's lying there and he says,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
"I really understand, and I really appreciate

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This, in a way, is one of the challenges

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
of how to interpret a really good idea.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We all, I think, believe in compassion.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And all the main religions have similar teachings.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And again, within Judaism,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we have a teaching about God,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
so we too have to be compassionate.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Sometimes, of course, being compassionate

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
or when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the challenge that is there for the family, for the person.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I wouldn't be doing my job --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
because I have to actually be there for them

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and give up being a rabbi.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Who cannot be touched by compassion

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I know some people who say

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
"Well, you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I'm not going to even begin to try."

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and so they turn off the television and don't watch.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and be of help to people.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
which says that when God created the world,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
God thought that it would be best to create the world

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
only with the divine attribute of justice.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Because, after all, God is just.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And then God looked to the future and realized,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So, God thought, "Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion."

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And then God looked to the future and realized that,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
there would be anarchy and chaos.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
There had to be limits to all things.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The rabbis describe this as being like a king

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
There is something more though that has to be there.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And that is the translation of the feelings

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
that we may have about compassion

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
into the wider world, into action.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and think great thoughts about our neighbors.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We actually have to do something about it.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
that becomes very important: "chesed."

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
All these three things, then, have to be melded together.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
what should we be doing, social justice.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
There has to be a willingness to do good deeds,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
but not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
if you overdo things.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
This idea of compassion comes to us

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
because we're made in the image of God,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
who is ultimately the compassionate one.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
What does this compassion entail?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
It entails understanding the pain of the other.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But even more than that,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000
it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation:

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
understanding that one is part of that creation,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that there is a unity that underlies all that we see,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
all that we hear, all that we feel.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I call that unity God.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And that unity is something that connects all of creation.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
that something I do here actually does matter in Africa,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
that if I use too much of my carbon allowance,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
it seems to be that we are causing

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000
a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So there is a connectivity,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
as part of me being made in the image of God.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And I have to understand that my needs

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
This "18 minutes" business, I find quite fascinating.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
stands for life -- the word "life."

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
"In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion."

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
But, something else as well:

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
actually, 18 minutes is important.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or "matzah"?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And they say "It's 18 minutes."

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
What does it mean, "dough becomes leaven"?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
It means it gets filled with hot air.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
What's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and that everything should revolve round us.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So we try and get rid of those,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
that enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
so we don't see the needs of others --

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and free ourselves and free ourselves from that.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And that too is a basis for having compassion,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
for understanding our place in the world.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the priests used to have bread,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000
which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
The man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
He said, "God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants."

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
opened the ark and said, "God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are."

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Then he went home.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
The cleaner came into the synagogue.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?"

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
He goes into the synagogue. "God, will you please help me?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Ah, what a wonderful smell."

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
"There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question."

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Takes the bread and goes home.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
"I'm an idiot. God wants bread?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
He goes in there, and it's not there.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And he says, "God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Next week, with raisins."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
This went on for years.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Every week, the cleaner would come. "God you've answered my plea again."

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Take the bread. Take it home.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And he called the two of them to his office.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And he said, you know, "This is what's happening."

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And the rich man -- oh, dear -- crestfallen.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
"You mean God didn't want my bread?"

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And the poor man said, "And you mean God didn't answer my pleas?"

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And the rabbi said, "You've misunderstood me.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
You've misunderstood totally," he said.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
"Of course, what you are doing," he said to the rich man,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
"is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And God," he said to the poor man, "is answering your plea

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that people should be compassionate and give."

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
"Don't you understand?" He said, "These are the hands of God."

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
So that is the way I feel:

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world;

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
that I want to try and serve that unity,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
trying to understand something of the pain of others;

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
for some of the problems that come upon them;

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
to the giving I can give.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I have to reevaluate them,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
try and separate out the material things

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and my emotions that may be enslaving me,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
so that I can see the world clearly.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And then I have to try to see in what ways

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I can make these the hands of God.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And so try to bring compassion to life in this world.
