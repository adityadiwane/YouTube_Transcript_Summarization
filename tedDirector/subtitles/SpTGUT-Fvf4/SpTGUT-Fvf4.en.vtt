00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm going to talk

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
about some of my discoveries

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
around the world through my work.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
These are not discoveries of planets

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
or new technologies

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
or science.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
They're discoveries of people

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and the way people are, and new leadership.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
This is Benki.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
His people live in Brazil

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and in Peru.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Benki comes from a village

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
so remote up in the Amazon

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
that to get there, either you have to fly

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
and land on water,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
or go by canoe for several days.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
when I'd brought him and other leaders

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
from indigenous peoples

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
to meet with me and leaders from around the world,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
because we wanted to learn from each other.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
We wanted to share our stories with each other.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
The Ashaninka people

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
are known throughout South America

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
for their dignity, their spirit

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and their resistance,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
starting with the Incas

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and continuing through the 19th century

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
with the rubber tappers.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Today's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and to Benki

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
comes from illegal logging --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
the people who come into the beautiful forest

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and cut down ancient mahogany trees,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
float them down the river to world markets.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Benki knew this.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
He could see what was happening to his forest, to his environment,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
because he was taken under his grandfather's wing

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
when he was only two years old

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
to begin to learn about the forest

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and the way of life of his people.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
His grandfather died when he was only 10.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And at that young age, 10 years old,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Benki became the paje of his community.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Now, in the Ashaninka tradition and culture,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
the paje is the most important

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
person in the community.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
This is the person who contains within him

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
all the knowledge, all the wisdom

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
of centuries and centuries of life,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
and not just about his people,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
but about everything that his people's survival depended on:

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
the trees, the birds,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
the water, the soil, the forest.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
So when he was only 10 and he became the paje,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
he began to lead his people.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
He began to talk to them

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
about the forest that they needed to protect,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
the way of life they needed to nurture.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
He explained to them

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
that it was not a question of survival of the fittest;

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
it was a question of understanding

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
what they needed to survive

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
and to protect that.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Eight years later,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
when he was a young man of 18,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Benki left the forest for the first time.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
He went 3,000 miles on an odyssey to Rio

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
to the Earth Summit

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
to tell the world what was happening

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
in his tiny, little corner.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And he went because he hoped the world would listen.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Some did, not everybody.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
But if you can imagine this young man

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
with his headdress and his flowing robe,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
learning a new language, Portuguese,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
not to mention English,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
going to Rio,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
building a bridge

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
to reach out to people he'd never met before --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
a pretty hostile world.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
But he wasn't dismayed.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Benki came back to his village full of ideas --

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
new technologies, new research,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
new ways of understanding what was going on.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Since that time,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
he's continued to work with his people,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and not only the Ashaninka Nation,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
but all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
He's built schools

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
to teach children to care for the forest.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Together, he's led the reforestation

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
of over 25 percent of the land

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
that had been destroyed by the loggers.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
He's created a cooperative

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
to help people diversify their livelihoods.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And he's brought the internet and satellite technology

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
to the forest --

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
both so that people themselves

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
could monitor the deforestation,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
but also that he could speak from the forest

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
to the rest of the world.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
If you were to meet Benki

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and ask him, "Why are you doing this?

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
Why are you putting yourself at risk?

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Why are you making yourself vulnerable

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
to what is often a hostile world?"

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
he would tell you,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
as he told me,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
"I asked myself," he said,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
"What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
to protect the forest for me?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And what am I doing?"

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
So when I think of that,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
I wonder what our grandchildren

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and our great-grandchildren,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
when they ask themselves that question,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
I wonder how they will answer.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
For me, the world is veering

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
towards a future we don't much want

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
when we really think about it deep inside.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
It's a future we don't know the details of,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
but it's a future that has signs,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
just like Benki saw the signs around him.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
We know we are running out of what we need.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
We're running out of fresh water.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
We're running out of fossil fuels.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
We're running out of land.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
We know climate change is going to affect all of us.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
We don't know how, but we know it will.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And we know that there will be more of us than ever before --

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
five times as many people in 40 years

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
than 60 years ago.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
We are running out of what we need.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And we also know

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
that the world has changed in other ways,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
that since 1960

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
there are one-third as many new countries

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
that exist as independent entities on the planet.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Egos, systems of government --

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
figuring it out --

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
massive change.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
And in addition to that,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
we know that five other really big countries

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
are going to have a say in the future,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
a say we haven't even really started to hear yet --

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
China, India,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Russia, South Africa

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
and Benki's own Brazil,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
where Benki got his civil rights

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
only in the 1988 constitution.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
But you know all that.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and went 3,000 miles.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
You also know

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
that we can't just keep doing what we've always done,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
because we'll get the results

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
we've always gotten.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And this reminds me of something I understand

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
when she was pressing him, "Please change."

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
He said, "Change?

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Why change?

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Things are bad enough as they are."

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
We have to change.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
It's imperative to me, when I look around the world,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
that we need to change ourselves.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
We need new models of what it means to be a leader.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
We need new models

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
of being a leader and a human in the world.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
I started life as a banker.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Now I don't admit to that

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
to anybody but my very close friends.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
But for the past eight years,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
I've done something completely different.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
My work has taken me around the world,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
where I've had the real privilege

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
of meeting people like Benki

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and many others who are making change happen

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
in their communities --

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
people who see the world differently,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
who are asking different questions,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
who have different answers,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
who understand the filters that they wear

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
when they go out into the world.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
This is Sanghamitra.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
I met Sanghamitra eight years ago

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
when I was in Bangalore

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
organizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
working in some of the hardest aspects of society.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Sanghamitra didn't start life

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
as a leader of an NGO,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
she started her career as university professor,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
teaching English literature.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
She loved it, but she was too detached.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
And so in 1993,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
a long time ago,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
she decided to start a new organization

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
called Samraksha

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
focused on one of the hardest areas,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
one of the hardest issues in India --

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
anywhere in the world at the time --

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
HIV/AIDS.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
Since that time, Samraksha has grown

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
from strength to strength

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
But if you just think about the state of the world

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and knowledge of HIV/AIDS

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
in 1993 --

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
in India at that time it was skyrocketing

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and nobody understood why,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and everyone was actually very, very afraid.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Today there are still three million

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
HIV-positive people in India.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
That's the second largest population in the world.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
When I asked Sanghamitra,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
"How did you get from English literature

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
to HIV/AIDS?"

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
not an obvious path,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
she said to me,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
"It's all connected.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Literature makes one sensitive,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
sensitive to people,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
to their dreams and to their ideas."

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
Since that time, under her leadership,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
Samraksha has been a pioneer

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
in all fields related

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
to HIV/AIDS.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
They have respite homes, the first,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
the first care centers,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
the first counseling services --

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
and not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
but in the hardest to reach villages

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
in the state of Karnataka.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Even that wasn't enough.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
She wanted to change policy at the government level.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
10 of their programs that she pioneered

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
are now government policy and funded by the government.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
They take care of 20,000-odd people today

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
in over 1,000 villages around Karnataka.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
She works with people like Murali Krishna.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
and he's HIV-positive.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
But he saw the work, the care,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
the compassion

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and he wanted to be part of it.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
He's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
They've pioneered a different approach to villages.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Instead of handing out information in pamphlets,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
as is so often the case,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
they bring theater troupes,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
songs, music, dance.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
And they sit around,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and they talk about dreams.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
Sanghamitra told me just last week --

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
she had just come back from two weeks in the villages,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
and she had a real breakthrough.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
They were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
And the young women in the village

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
spoke up and said, "We've changed our dream.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Our dream

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
is for our partners, our husbands,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
not to be given to us because of a horoscope,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
but to be given to us

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
because they've been tested for HIV."

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
and ask her why and how,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
how have you achieved so much?

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
She would look at you

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
and very quietly, very softly say,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
"It just happened.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
It's the spirit inside."

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
in southwest China.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
He was born in 1957,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
and you can imagine what his childhood

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
looked like and felt like,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
and what his life has been like

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
over the last 50 tumultuous years.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
He's been a soldier, a teacher,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
a politician, a vice-mayor

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
and a business man.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
But if you sat down and asked him, "Who are you really,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
and what do you do?"

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
He would tell you, "I'm a collector,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
and I curate a museum."

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
I was lucky; I had heard about him for years,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
and I finally met him earlier this year

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
at his museum in Chengdu.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
He's been a collector all of his life,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
starting when he was four or five in the early 1960's.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Now, just think of the early 1960's in China.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Over a lifetime, through everything,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
he's kept collecting,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
so that he now has over eight million pieces

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
in his museums

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
documenting contemporary Chinese history.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
in part because they document parts of history

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Chinese choose to forget.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
For example, he's got over one million pieces

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
documenting the Sino-Japanese War,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
a war that's not talked about in China very much

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
and whose heroes are not honored.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Why did he do all this?

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Because he thought

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
So, from commissioning

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
slightly larger than life bronze statues

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
of the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
including those Chinese

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
who then fought with each other

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
and left mainland China to go to Taiwan,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
to commemorating all the unknown,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
ordinary soldiers who survived,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
by asking them to take prints of their hands,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
he is making sure -- one man is making sure --

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
that history is not forgotten.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
This building contains the world's largest collection

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
of documents and artifacts

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
commemorating the U.S. role

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
in fighting on the Chinese side

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
in that long war --

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
the Flying Tigers.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
He has nine other buildings --

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
that are already open to the public --

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
filled to the rafters with artifacts

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
documenting contemporary Chinese history.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Two of the most sensitive buildings

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
include a lifetime of collection

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
about the Cultural Revolution,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
a period that actually most Chinese

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
would prefer to forget.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
But he doesn't want his nation

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
ever to forget.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
These people inspire me,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and they inspire me because they show us

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
what is possible when you change the way

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
you look at the world,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
change the way you look at your place in the world.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
They looked outside,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
and then they changed what was on the inside.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
They didn't go to business school.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
They didn't read a manual, "How to Be a Good Leader

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
in 10 Easy Steps."

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
But they have qualities we'd all recognize.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
They have drive, passion, commitment.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
They've gone away

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
from what they did before,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
and they've gone

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
to something they didn't know.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
They've tried to connect worlds

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
they didn't know existed before.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
They've built bridges, and they've walked across them.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
They have a sense of the great arc of time

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and their tiny place in it.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
They know people have come before them

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
and will follow them.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
And they know that they're part of a whole,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
that they depend on other people.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
It's not about them, they know that,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
but it has to start with them.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
And they have humility.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
It just happens.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
But we know it doesn't just happen, don't we?

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
We know it takes a lot to make it happen,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
and we know the direction the world is going in.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
So I think we need succession planning

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
on a global basis.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
We can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
I think it has to start with us.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
And we know, just like they knew,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
how hard it is.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along;

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
we have models, we have examples,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
We can look at what they've done, if we look.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
We can learn from what they've learned.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.260
We can change the way we see ourselves in the world.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
And if we're lucky,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
we can change the way

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
our great-grandchildren

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
will answer Benki's question.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
Thank you.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
(Applause)
