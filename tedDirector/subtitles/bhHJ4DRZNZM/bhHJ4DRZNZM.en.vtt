00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
For years I've been feeling frustrated,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
because as a religious historian,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
I've become acutely aware

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
of the centrality of compassion

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
in all the major world faiths.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
Every single one of them

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
has evolved their own version

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
of what's been called the Golden Rule.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Sometimes it comes in a positive version --

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.160
"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
And equally important

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
is the negative version --

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.160
"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
Look into your own heart,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
discover what it is that gives you pain

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.160
and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
to inflict that pain on anybody else.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.160
And people have emphasized the importance of compassion,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
not just because it sounds good,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
but because it works.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
People have found that when they have

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
implemented the Golden Rule

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
as Confucius said, "all day and every day,"

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
not just a question of doing your good deed for the day

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
and then returning to a life of greed

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
and egotism,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
but to do it all day and every day,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.160
you dethrone yourself from the center of your world,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
put another there, and you transcend yourself.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
And it brings you into the presence

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.160
of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
Something that goes beyond

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.160
what we know in our ego-bound existence.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
that this was so central to the religious life.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
Because with a few wonderful exceptions,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
very often when religious people come together,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.160
religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.160
or uttering a council of hatred

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.160
or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
Often people don't really want to be compassionate.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
I sometimes see

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.160
because people often want to be right instead.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.160
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160
Now why was I so grateful to TED?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.160
Because they took me very gently

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
from my book-lined study

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
and brought me into the 21st century,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
than I could have ever conceived.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
Because I feel an urgency about this.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
If we don't manage to implement

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.160
the Golden Rule globally,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.160
so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
as though they were as important as ourselves,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
I doubt that we'll have

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
a viable world to hand on to the next generation.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
The task of our time,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
one of the great tasks of our time,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
is to build a global society, as I said,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
where people can live together in peace.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.160
And the religions that should be making a major contribution

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.160
are instead seen as part of the problem.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.160
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
This is the source of all morality,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
this imaginative act of empathy,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
putting yourself in the place of another.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.160
And so we have a choice, it seems to me.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.160
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.160
the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.160
or we can go back to

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.160
the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
who, when asked by a pagan

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.160
to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.160
said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.160
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary."

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.160
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
any interpretation of scripture

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160
that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
And we need to revive that spirit.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
And it's not just going to happen

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
because a spirit of love wafts us down.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
We have to make this happen,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
and we can do it

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
with the modern communications

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
that TED has introduced.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
Already I've been tremendously heartened

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
at the response of all our partners.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.160
In Singapore, we have a group

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.160
going to use the Charter to heal divisions

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.160
recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
and some members of the parliament want

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
to implement it politically.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.160
In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
in which leading artists are going to be

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160
taking people, young people,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
and showing them that compassion also lies

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.160
at the root of all art.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.160
Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
are holding events and discussions,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
are discussing the centrality of compassion

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
in Islam and in all faiths.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.160
concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.160
Religious teaching must always lead to action.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.160
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160
And I want to continue with our partners

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
to do two things --

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:25.160
educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
Education because we've so

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160
dropped out of compassion.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
People often think it simply means

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
feeling sorry for somebody.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
But of course you don't understand compassion

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
if you're just going to think about it.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
You also have to do it.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
I want them to get the media involved

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
because the media are crucial

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
we have of other people,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
which are dividing us from one another.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
The same applies to educators.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.160
I'd like youth to get a sense of

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.160
the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
of a compassionate lifestyle.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
And also see that it demands acute intelligence,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
not just a gooey feeling.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
I'd like to call upon scholars to explore

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
the compassionate theme

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.160
in their own and in other people's traditions.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
And perhaps above all,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.160
to encourage a sensitivity about

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
uncompassionate speaking,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
so that because people have this Charter,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
whatever their beliefs or lack of them,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
they feel empowered

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160
to challenge uncompassionate speech,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
disdainful remarks

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
from their religious leaders, their political leaders,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
from the captains of industry.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
Because we can change the world,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
we have the ability.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
I would never have thought of putting the Charter online.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
I was still stuck in the old world

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
and issuing yet another arcane statement.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
And TED introduced me to a whole new way

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
of thinking and presenting ideas.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.160
In this room, all this expertise,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
if we joined it all together,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
we could change the world.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.160
And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.160
with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
whom I don't quote very often,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
C.S. Lewis.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
It's in his book "The Four Loves."

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.160
He said that he distinguished between erotic love,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.160
when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
And then he compared that to friendship,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.160
when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.160
with their eyes fixed on a common goal.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.160
We don't have to fall in love with each other,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
but we can become friends.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
And I am convinced.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
I felt it very strongly

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.160
during our little deliberations at Vevey,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.160
that when people of all different persuasions

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.160
come together, working side by side

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
for a common goal,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
differences melt away.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
And we learn amity.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.160
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
Thank you very much.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.160
(Applause)
