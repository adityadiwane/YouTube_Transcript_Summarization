00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I run a design studio in New York.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.160
Every seven years, I close it for one year

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
to pursue

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
some little experiments, things that

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
are always difficult to accomplish

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
during the regular working year.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
In that year, we are not available

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
for any of our clients.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
We are totally closed.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
And as you can imagine,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.160
it is a lovely and very energetic time.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
I originally had opened the studio in New York

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
to combine my two loves, music and design.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
And we created videos and packaging

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
for many musicians that you know,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
and for even more that you've never heard of.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
As I realized, just like with many many things in my life

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
that I actually love,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
I adapt to it.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
And I get, over time, bored by them.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
And for sure, in our case,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
our work started to look the same.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
Quite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.160
in a book, in a die cut.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.160
So I decided to close it down for one year.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Also is the knowledge that

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
right now we spend about

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.160
in the first 25 years of our lives learning,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
then there is another 40 years

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
that's really reserved for working.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
And then tacked on at the end of it

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
are about 15 years for retirement.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
And I thought it might be helpful

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160
to basically cut off five of those retirement years

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.160
and intersperse them in between those working years.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.160
(Applause)

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
That's clearly enjoyable for myself.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
But probably even more important is

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
that the work that comes out of these years

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
flows back into the company

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
and into society at large,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.160
rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Jonathan Haidt,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.160
who defined his work into three different levels.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
And they rang very true for me.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
I can see my work as a job. I do it for money.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.160
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.160
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
In a career I'm definitely more engaged.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
But at the same time, there will be periods when I think

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160
is all that really hard work really worth my while?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
While in the third one, in the calling,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
very much likely I would do it also

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.160
if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
I am not a religious person myself,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
but I did look for nature.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.160
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
Looked for something different for the second one.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
because I knew them too well. So Asia it was.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
were Sri Lanka and Bali.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.160
It's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.160
I arrived there in September 2008,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
and pretty much started to work right away.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.160
There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
However the first thing that I needed was

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
mosquito repellent typography

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
because they were definitely around heavily.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
And then I needed some sort of way

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
to be able to get back to all the wild dogs

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
that surround my house,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
and attacked me during my morning walks.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.160
So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.160
Every single dog on one tee shirt.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
As a little retaliation

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.160
with a just ever so slightly menacing message

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.160
(Laughter)

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
on the back of the shirt.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
(Laughter)

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
Just before I left New York

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160
I decided I could actually renovate my studio.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
And then just leave it all to them.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
And I don't have to do anything.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
So I looked for furniture.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
And it turned out that

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
all the furniture that I really liked,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
I couldn't afford.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
And all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
So one of the things that we pursued in Bali

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.160
was pieces of furniture.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
It's not quite finished yet.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
And I think by the time this lamp came about,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
(Laughter)

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.160
I had finally made peace with those dogs.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.160
(Laughter)

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
It's called Be Here Now.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.160
It includes 330 compasses.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
And we had custom espresso cups made

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
that hide a magnet inside,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
and make those compasses go crazy,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
always centering on them.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:42.160
Then this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.160
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
And at the same time, I'm extremely aware

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.160
how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.160
So I will not really go too far into it.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
Many of you will know this TEDster,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
Danny Gilbert, whose book, actually,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
I got it through the TED book club.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
I think it took me four years

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
to finally read it, while on sabbatical.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
And I was pleased to see

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160
that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
And I'll show you a couple of people

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.160
that did well by pursuing sabbaticals.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
This is Ferran Adria. Many people think

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
he is right now the best chef in the world

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
with his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
His restaurant is open seven months every year.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
He closes it down for five months

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
to experiment with a full kitchen staff.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
His latest numbers are fairly impressive.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.160
He can seat, throughout the year,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
he can seat 8,000 people.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
If I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
it's 12.5 percent of my time.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.160
And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
3M since the 1930s

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
is giving all their engineers

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.160
15 percent to pursue whatever they want.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
There is some good successes.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
Scotch tape came out of this program,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.160
as well as Art Fry developed

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.160
sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
Google, of course, very famously

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
gives 20 percent for their software engineers

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.160
to pursue their own personal projects.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.160
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical?

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.160
That's about five percent of everybody.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.160
So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.160
Talk to them about if it was successful or not.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
I've found that

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.160
finding out about what I'm going to like in the future,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
my very best way is to talk to people

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
who have actually done it

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.160
much better than myself envisioning it.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
When I had the idea of doing one,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:14.160
the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.160
And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
(Laughter)

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
In the beginning, on the first sabbatical,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.160
it was rather disastrous.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.160
I had thought that I should do this without any plan,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.160
that this vacuum of time somehow would

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
be wonderful and enticing

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
for idea generation. It was not.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.160
I just, without a plan, I just reacted

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
to little requests, not work requests,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
those I all said no to, but other little requests.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
So I became my own intern.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
(Laughter)

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
And I very quickly

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.160
made a list of the things I was interested in,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
put them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.160
and then made a plan, very much like in grade school.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.160
What does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
9 to 10: future thinking.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
Was not very successful. And so on and so forth.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
And that actually, specifically as a starting point

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
of the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
What came out of it?

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
I really got close to design again.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
I had fun.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
Financially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.160
Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
And probably most importantly,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
basically everything we've done

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
in the seven years following the first sabbatical

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.160
came out of thinking of that one single year.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
And I'll show you a couple of projects

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.160
that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.160
One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
that sameness is so incredibly overrated.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.160
This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
works for a very very few strand of companies,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
and not for everybody else.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.160
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
the Rem Koolhaas-built music center

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
in Porto, in Portugal.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.160
And even though I desired to do an identity

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.160
that doesn't use the architecture,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
I failed at that.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
And mostly also because I realized

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.160
he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.160
Which I understood after I

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
translated it from architecture speech

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
in to regular English,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
basically as logo making.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
And I understood that the building itself was a logo.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
So then it became quite easy.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
We put a mask on it,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
looked at it deep down in the ground,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
checked it out from all sides,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
west, north, south, east,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
top and bottom.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
Colored them in a very particular way

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
by having a friend of mine write a piece of software,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
the Casa da Musica Logo Generator.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
That's connected to a scanner.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
You put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
And the software, in a second,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.160
comes in handy, because the visual information of the logo

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
and the actual poster is exactly the same.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
So it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.160
If Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
who all performed there, get their own

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
Casa da Musica logo.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.160
It works the same internally with the president or the musical director,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.160
whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
There is a full-blown orchestra

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
living inside the building.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.160
It has a more transparent identity.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
The truck they go on tour with.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.160
12 people that remixes its own title.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
And one of the handy things that came about

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.160
was that you could take the logo type

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
and create advertising out of it.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
Like this Donna Toney poster,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
or Chopin, or Mozart,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
or La Monte Young.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.160
You can take the shape and make typography out of it.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160
You can grow it underneath the skin.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.160
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
or a rave underneath the house

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
or a weekly program,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.160
as well as educational services.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
Second insight. So far, until that point I had

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
been mostly involved

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
or used the language of design

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
for promotional purposes,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
which was fine with me.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160
On one hand I have nothing against selling.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
My parents are both salespeople.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160
But I did feel that

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
I spent so much time learning this language,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
why do I only promote with it?

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.160
There must be something else.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160
And the whole series of work came out of it.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
Some of you might have seen it.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
I showed some of it

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
at earlier TEDs before,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
under the title "Things I've Learned in My Life So Far."

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
I'll just show two now.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
This is a whole wall of bananas

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
at different ripenesses

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
on the opening day in this gallery in New York.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.160
It says, "Self-confidence produces fine results."

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
This is after a week.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
After two weeks,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
three weeks, four weeks, five weeks.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
And you see the self confidence almost comes back,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.160
but not quite.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160
These are some pictures visitors sent to me.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.160
(Laughter)

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
And then the city of Amsterdam

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
gave us a plaza and asked us to do something.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.160
We used the stone plates as a grid

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
for our little piece.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160
We got 250,000 coins from the central bank,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
at different darknesses.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
So we got brand new ones, shiny ones,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.160
medium ones, and very old, dark ones.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.160
And with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.160
created this fairly floral typography

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
that spelled, "Obsessions make my life worse

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
and my work better."

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
And the idea of course was to

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
make the type so precious

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
that as an audience

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.160
you would be in between,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160
"Should I really take as much money as I can?

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.160
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?"

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
While we built all this up

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
during that week, with the 100 volunteers,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.160
a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
got very close to it and quite loved it.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
So when it was finally done,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
and in the first night

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
a guy came with big plastic bags

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.160
and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
one of the neighbors called the police.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
And the Amsterdam police

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.160
in all their wisdom,

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
came, saw,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
and they wanted to protect the artwork.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.160
And they swept it all up and put it into custody

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160
at police headquarters.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
(Laughter)

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
I think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.160
That's the police, getting rid of it all.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.160
So after eight hours

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
that's pretty much all that was left

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
of the whole thing.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
(Laughter)

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160
We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
It's a movie about happiness.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160
And here we asked some nearby pigs

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
to do the titles for us.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
They weren't quite slick enough.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
So we asked the goose to do it again,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
and hoped she would do somehow,

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.160
a more elegant or pretty job.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
And I think she overdid it.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
Just a bit too ornamental.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.160
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
And the monkeys in that monkey forest

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.160
looked, actually, fairly happy.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.160
So we asked those guys to do it again.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.160
They did a fine job, but had

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.160
a couple of readability problems.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160
So of course whatever you don't really do yourself

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.160
doesn't really get done properly.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.160
That film we'll be working on for the next two years.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
So it's going to be a while.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.160
And of course you might think that

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160
doing a film on happiness

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.160
might not really be worthwhile.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.160
Then you can of course always

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.160
go and see this guy.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:16.160
Video: (Laughter)

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
And I'm happy I'm alive.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.160
I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.160
Stefan Sagmeister: Thank you.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.160
(Applause)
