00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm a contemporary artist

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
with a bit of an unexpected background.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I was in my 20s before I ever went to an art museum.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I grew up in the middle of nowhere

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
on a dirt road in rural Arkansas,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
an hour from the nearest movie theater.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
because I grew up around quirky, colorful characters

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
who were great at making with their hands.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And my childhood is more hick

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
than I could ever possibly relate to you,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and also more intellectual than you would ever expect.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
For instance, me and my sister, when we were little,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
(Laughter)

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
But on the other side of that, though,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
we were big readers in our house.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And if the TV was on, we were watching a documentary.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And my dad is the most voracious reader I know.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
He can read a novel or two a day.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
But when I was little, I remember,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
he would kill flies in our house with my BB gun.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And what was so amazing to me about that --

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
well he would be in his recliner, would holler for me to fetch the BB gun,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and I'd go get it.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And what was amazing to me --

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
well it was pretty kickass; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun --

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
but what was so amazing to me

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
was that he knew just enough how to pump it.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
And he could shoot it from two rooms away

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
and not damage what it was on

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and not damage what it landed on.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
So I should talk about art.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
(Laughter)

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Or we'll be here all day with my childhood stories.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I love contemporary art,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
but I'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and the contemporary art scene.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
A few years ago,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
I spent months in Europe

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
to see the major international art exhibitions

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that have the pulse

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
of what is supposed to be going on in the art world.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
And I was struck

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
by going to so many, one after the other,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
with some clarity of what it was

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
that I was longing for.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
And I was longing for several things that I wasn't getting,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
or not getting enough of.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
But two of the main things:

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
one of it, I was longing for more work

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
that was appealing to a broad public,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
that was accessible.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And the second thing that I was longing for

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
was some more exquisite craftsmanship

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and technique.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
So I started thinking and listing

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
what all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So I decided,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
I'm going to start my own biennial.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
I'm going to organize it and direct it

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and get it going in the world.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
So I thought, okay,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
I have to have some criteria of how to choose work.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
So amongst all the criteria I have,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
there's two main things.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
One of them, I call my Mimaw's Test.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And what that is

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
is I imagine explaining a work of art

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
to my grandmother in five minutes,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and if I can't explain it in five minutes,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
then it's too obtuse

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
or esoteric

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and it hasn't been refined enough yet.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
It needs to worked on

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
until it can speak fluently.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And then my other second set of rules --

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
I hate to say "rules" because it's art --

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
my criteria would be

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
the three H's,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
which is head, heart and hands.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And great art would have "head":

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
it would have interesting intellectual ideas

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and concepts.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
It would have "heart" in that it would have passion

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and heart and soul.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And it would have "hand" in that it would be greatly crafted.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
So I started thinking about

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
how am I going to do this biennial,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
how am I going to travel the world

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and find these artists?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
And then I realized one day, there's an easier solution to this.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
I'm just going to make the whole thing myself.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
(Laughter)

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And so this is what I did.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
So I thought, a biennial needs artists.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
I'm going to do an international biennial; I need artists from all around the world.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
So what I did was

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
I invented a hundred artists from around the world.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
I figured out their bios, their passions in life

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and their art styles,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and I started making their work.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
(Laughter)

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
(Applause)

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
I felt, oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
So I decided, I'm going to make this a real biennial.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
It's going to be two years of studio work.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
And I'm going to create this in two years,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and I have.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
So I should start to talk about these guys.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Well the range is quite a bit.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And I'm such a technician, so I loved this project,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
getting to play with all the techniques.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
So for example, in realist paintings,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
it ranges from this,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
which is kind of old masters style,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
to really realistic still-life,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
to this type of painting where I'm painting with a single hair.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
And then at the other end, there's performance and short films

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
and indoor installations

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
like this indoor installation

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
and this one,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.260
and outdoor installations like this one

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
and this one.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
I know I should mention: I'm making all these things.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
This isn't Photoshopped.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
I'm under the river with those fish.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
So now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
This is Nell Remmel.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Nell is interested in agricultural processes,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and her work is based in these practices.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
This piece, which is called "Flipped Earth" --

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
she was interested in taking the sky

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
and using it to cleanse barren ground.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And by taking giant mirrors --

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
(Applause)

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
and here she's taking giant mirrors

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and pulling them into the dirt.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And this is 22 feet long.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
And what I loved about her work

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
is, when I would walk around it

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
and look down into the sky,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
looking down to watch the sky,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and it unfolded in a new way.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And probably the best part of this piece

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
is at dusk and dawn

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
but there's still the light above, bright above.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
And so you're standing there and everything else is dark,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
but there's this portal that you want to jump in.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
This piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
And I love to dig a hole.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
So this piece was great fun

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
because it was two days of digging in soft dirt.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
The next artist is Kay Overstry,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
and she's interested in ephemerality and transience.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
And in her most recent project,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
it's called "Weather I Made."

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
And she's making weather

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
on her body's scale.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And this piece is "Frost."

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And what she did was she went out on a cold, dry night

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and breathed back and forth on the lawn

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
to leave --

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
to leave her life's mark,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
the mark of her life.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.260
(Applause)

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
And so this is five-foot, five-inches of frost

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
that she left behind.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
The sun rises, and it melts away.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
And that was played by my mom.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
So the next artist, this is a group of Japanese artists,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
a collective of Japanese artists --

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
(Laughter)

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
in Tokyo.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And they were interested in developing a new, alternative art space,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and they needed funding for it,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
One of these is scratch-off masterpieces.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
(Laughter)

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
And so what they're doing --

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
each of these artists on a nine-by-seven-inch card,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
which they sell for 10 bucks,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
they drew original works of art.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
And you buy one, and maybe you get a real piece, and maybe not.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Well this has sparked a craze in Japan,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
because everyone's wanting a masterpiece.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And the ones that are the most sought after

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
are the ones that are only barely scratched off.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And all these works, in some way,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
talk about luck or fate or chance.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Those first two

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
are portraits of mega-jackpot winners years before and after their win.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
And in this one it's called "Drawing the Short Stick."

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
(Laughter)

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
I love this piece because I have a little cousin at home

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
who introduced me -- which I think is such a great introduction --

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
to a friend one day as, "This is my cousin Shea.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
He draws sticks real good."

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
(Laughter)

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
Which is one of the best compliments ever.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
This artist is Gus Weinmueller,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and he's doing a project, a large project, called "Art for the Peoples."

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
And within this project, he's doing a smaller project

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
called "Artists in Residence."

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And what he does is --

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
(Laughter)

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
he spends a week at a time with a family.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.260
And he shows up on their porch, their doorstep,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
with a toothbrush and pajamas,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and he's ready to spend the week with them.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And using only what's present,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And he spends that week talking to the family

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
about what do they think great art is.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
He has all these discussions with their family,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and he digs through everything they have,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
and he finds materials to make work.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
And he makes a work

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
that answers what they think great art is.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
For this family, he made this still-life painting.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And whatever he makes

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
somehow references nesting and space

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and personal property.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
This next project,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
this is by Jaochim Parisvega,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
and he's interested in --

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
he believes art is everywhere waiting --

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
And he provides this push by harnessing natural forces,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.260
like in his series where he used rain to make paintings.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
This project is called "Love Nests."

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
What he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
So he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and they crafted his nests for him.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
And this one's called "Lovelock's Nest."

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
This one's called "Mixtape Love Song's Nest."

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
(Laughter)

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
And this one's called "Lovemaking Nest."

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.260
(Laughted)

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Next is Sylvia Slater.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Sylvia's interested in art training.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
She's a very serious Swiss artist.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
(Laughter)

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
And she was thinking about her friends and family

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
who work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
and she was thinking,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
what can I make that would be of value to them,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
in case something bad happens

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and they have to buy their way across the border

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
or pay off a gunman?

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
And so she came up with creating

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
these pocket-sized artworks

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
that are portraits of the person that would carry them.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
And you would carry this around with you,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
and if everything went to hell, you could make payments

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and buy your life.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
So this life price

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
is for an irrigation non-profit director.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
So hopefully what happens is you never use it,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
and it's an heirloom that you pass down.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
or they could be like these, which are leaves that can be payments.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
And so they're valuable. This is precious metals and gemstones.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
And this one had to get broken up.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.260
He had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
This is by a duo, Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
And they're interested in creating culture,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
just tradition.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
So what they do is they move into an area

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
So this is in Eastern Tennessee,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
and what they decided was

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
that we need a positive tradition

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
that goes with death.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
So they came up with "dig jigs."

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
And a dig jig --

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
a dig jig is where,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
for a milestone anniversary or a birthday,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
you gather all your friends and family together

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
and you dance on where you're going to be buried.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
(Laughter)

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And we got a lot of attention when we did it.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
I talked my family into doing this, and they didn't know what I was doing.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And I was like, "Get dressed for a funeral. We're going to go do some work."

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
And so we got to the grave and made this, which was hilarious --

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
the attention that we got.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
So what happens is you dance on the grave,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and after you've done your dance,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
And you in essence have a funeral

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
that you get to be present for.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
That's my mom and dad.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
This is by Jason Birdsong.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
He is interested in how we see as an animal,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
You know, we look down a dark alley

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
or a jungle path,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
trying to make out a face or a creature.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
We just have that natural way of seeing.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
And he plays with this idea.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
And this piece: those aren't actually leaves.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
They're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
So he pairs these up.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
There's another pile of leaves.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Those are actually all real butterfly specimens.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And he pairs these up with paintings.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Like this is a painting of a snake in a box.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
So you open the box and you think, "Whoa, there's a snake in there."

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
But it's actually a painting.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
So he makes these interesting conversations

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
about realism and mimicry

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
(Laughter)

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
The next artist is Hazel Clausen.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
Hazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
and decided, "You know, I would learn a lot about culture

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
if I created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch."

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
So that's what she did.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
She created the Swiss people named the Uvulites,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
and they have this distinctive yodeling song

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
that they use the uvula for.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
And also they reference how the uvula --

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
everything they say is fallen

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
because of the forbidden fruit.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
And that's the symbol of their culture.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
And this is from a documentary

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
called "Sexual Practices and Populations Control

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
Among the Uvulites."

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.260
This is a typical angora embroidery for them.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
This is one of their founders, Gert Schaeffer.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
(Laughter)

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
And actually this is my Aunt Irene.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
It was so funny having a fake person

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
who was making fake things.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
And I crack up at this piece,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
because when I see it I know that's French angora

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
and all antique German ribbons

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
and wool that I got in a Nebraska mill

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
and carried around for 10 years

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
and then antique Chinese skirts.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
The next is a collective of artists

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
called the Silver Dobermans,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
and their motto is to spread pragmatism

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
one person at a time.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
(Laughter)

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
And they're really interested

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
in how over-coddled we've become.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.260
So this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we've become.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
And what they've done

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
(Laughter)

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:19.260
(Applause)

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
And this is called "Horse Sense Fence."

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
The next artist is K. M. Yoon,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
a really interesting South Korean artist.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
And he's reworking a Confucian art tradition

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
of scholar stones.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
Next is Maynard Sipes.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
And I love Maynard Sipes,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
but he's off in his own world,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
and, bless his heart, he's so paranoid.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Next is Roy Penig,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
a really interesting Kentucky artist,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
and he's the nicest guy.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
He even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
because the person wanted it so badly.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
Next is an Australian artist, Janeen Jackson,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
and this is from a project of hers

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
called "What an Artwork Does When We're Not Watching."

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
(Laughter)

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
Next is by a Lithuanian fortune teller, Jurgi Petrauskas.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
Next is Ginger Cheshire.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
This is from a short film of hers called "The Last Person."

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
And that's my cousin and my sister's dog, Gabby.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
The next, this is by Sam Sandy.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
He's an Australian Aboriginal elder,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
and he's also an artist.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
And this is from a large traveling sculpture project

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
that he's doing.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
This is from Estelle Willoughsby.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
She heals with color.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
And she's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
even though she's going to be 90 next year.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
(Laughter)

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
This is by Z. Zhou,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
and he's interested in stasis.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Next is by Hilda Singh,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
and she's doing a whole project called "Social Outfits."

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
Next is by Vera Sokolova.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
And I have to say, Vera kind of scares me.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
You can't look her directly in the eyes

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
because she's kind of scary.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
And it's good that she's not real;

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
she'd be mad that I said that.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
(Laughter)

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
And she's an optometrist in St. Petersburg,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
and she plays with optics.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
Next, this is by Thomas Swifton.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
This is from a short film, "Adventures with Skinny."

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
(Laughter)

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
And this is by Cicily Bennett,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
and it's from a series of short films.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
And after this one, there's 77 other artists.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
And all together with those other 77 you're not seeing,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
that's my biennial.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
Thank you. Thank you.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
Thanks.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:37.260
(Applause)
