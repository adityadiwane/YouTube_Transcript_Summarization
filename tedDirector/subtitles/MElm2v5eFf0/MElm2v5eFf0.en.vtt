I’d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.330
who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
But apparently he was a very nice dog

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.330
♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.330
♫ I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along. ♫

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:53.330
♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong. ♫

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
♫ My life was lonely and blue. ♫

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
♫ Yeah, I was sad as a sailor, ♫

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
♫ I was an angry 'un too. ♫

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.330
♫ Then there was you -- appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear, ♫

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.330
♫ and nerves jingle jangled, vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up. ♫

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
♫ But then I looked in your eyes ♫

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
♫ and I was no more a failure. ♫

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
♫ You looked so wacky and wise. ♫

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.330
♫ And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, ♫

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.330
♫ catching some sun. We can't go wrong." ♫

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.330
♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, singing our song, strolling along. ♫

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
♫ 'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
♫ and I don't care what the politicians spout. ♫

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
♫ and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
♫ 'cause that's what it's all about. ♫

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.330
♫ My life was tragic and sad. ♫

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
♫ I was the archetypal loser. ♫

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.330
♫ I was a pageant gone bad. ♫

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.330
♫ And then there was you -- on time, and wagging your tail ♫

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
♫ in the cutest mime that you was in jail. ♫

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.330
♫ I said, "Woof, be mine!" and you gave a wail and then ♫

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
♫ I was no longer alone. ♫

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
♫ And I was no more a boozer. ♫

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
♫ We'll make the happiest home. ♫

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.330
♫ And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I’m just a'walking my dog, ♫

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.330
♫ singing my song, strolling along." ♫

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.330
♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong, ♫

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
♫ 'cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.330
♫ and I don’t care what the politicians spout. ♫

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330

Thank you.
