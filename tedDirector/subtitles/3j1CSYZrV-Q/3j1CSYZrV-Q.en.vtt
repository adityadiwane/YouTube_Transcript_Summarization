00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started [Jet Propulsion Lab].

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
When they were a bunch of kids,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
they were kind of very imaginative, very adventurous,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
as they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
and see which one blows up more.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
Well, I don't recommend that you try to do that now.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
Naturally, they blew up a shack, and Caltech, well, then,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.160
hey, you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
So, that's what we call our first five employees

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
during the tea break, you know, in here.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
As I said, they were adventurous people.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
As a matter of fact, one of them, who was, kind of, part of a cult

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
which was not too far from here on Orange Grove,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
So, that gives you a kind of flavor

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.160
of the kind of people we have there.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
We try to avoid blowing ourselves up.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
This one I thought I'd show you.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
I tried to come like him this morning,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
but as I walked out, then it was too cold,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
and I said, I'd better put my shirt back on.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
But more importantly, the reason I wanted to show this picture:

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
look where the other people are looking,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
and look where he is looking.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
Wherever anybody else looks, look somewhere else,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
and go do something different, you know, and doing that.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
And that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
that one of my colleagues, you know, put on my wall in my office,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
and it says, "Do not go where the path may lead.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
Go instead where there is no path, and leave a trail."

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
And that's my recommendation to all of you:

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
look what everybody is doing, what they are doing;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
go do something completely different.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
because that doesn't get you very far.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
but we also used to have a lot of parties, you know.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.160
As you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
But then a big difference happened about 50 years ago,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.160
after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
and that's the one you see on the left in there.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
And here we made 180 degrees change:

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
And that was done over a period of a couple of years,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
and now we are the leading organization, you know,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
exploring space on all of your behalf.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
But even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
sometimes there are setbacks.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
So you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward;

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
somehow it ended going sideways.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
So that's what we call the misguided missile.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
But then also, just to celebrate that,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
we started an event at JPL for "Miss Guided Missile."

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
So, we used to have a celebration every year and select --

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
there used to be competition and parades and so on.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
It's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it;

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
I think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
So, we do something a little bit more serious.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
when we entered one of the floats.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
That's more on the play side. And on the right side,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
that's the Rover just before we finished its testing

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
to take it to the Cape to launch it.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
So that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
you know, and the serious things that we try to do.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
But I said I'm going to show you a short clip

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
about some of the talent that we have.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Video: Morgan Hendry: Beware of Safety is

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
an instrumental rock band.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
It branches on more the experimental side.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
There's the improvisational side of jazz.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
There's the heavy-hitting sound of rock.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.160
Being able to treat sound as an instrument, and be able to dig

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
for more abstract sounds and things to play live,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
mixing electronics and acoustics.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.160
The music's half of me, but the other half --

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
I landed probably the best gig of all.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
Some of the most brilliant engineers I know

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.160
are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
You've got to do what you want to do.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
And anyone who tells you you can't, you don't listen to them.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
Maybe they're right - I doubt it.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
Tell them where to put it, and then just do what you want to do.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
I'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
Charles Elachi: Now, moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
always people ask, why do we explore?

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Well, the way I think about it is fairly simple.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
Somehow, 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang, and you've heard

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
a little bit about, you know, the origin of the universe.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
But somehow what strikes everybody's imagination --

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
or lots of people's imagination -- somehow from that original Big Bang

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
we have this beautiful world that we live in today.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
You look outside: you have all that beauty that you see,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
all that life that you see around you,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
and here we have intelligent people like you and I

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
who are having a conversation here.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
All that started from that Big Bang. So, the question is:

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.160
How did that happen? How did that evolve? How did the universe form?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
How did the galaxies form? How did the planets form?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved?

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
Is that very common?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
So we literally are all made out of stardust.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
We started from those stars; we are made of stardust.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
So, next time you are really depressed, look in the mirror

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
and you can look and say, hi, I'm looking at a star here.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
You can skip the dust part.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
But literally, we are all made of stardust.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
So, what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.160
write the book of how things have came about as they are today.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
And one of the first, or the easiest, places we can go

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
and explore that is to go towards Mars.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
And the reason Mars takes particular attention:

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
it's not very far from us.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
You know, it'll take us only six months to get there.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
Six to nine months at the right time of the year.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160
but the land mass on Mars is about the same

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.160
as the land mass on Earth, you know,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
if you don't take the oceans into account.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160
It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
so it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
and you can see some of the features on it,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.160
like the Grand Canyon on Mars,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.160
It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth, except a hell of a lot larger.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
So it's about the size, you know, of the United States.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160
It has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
And if you look at the height of it

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.160
and you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.160
an idea of how large that Mount Olympus, you know, is,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
relative to Mount Everest.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
So, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.160
So, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
which have happened on that planet.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
Recently from one of our satellites, this shows that it's Earth-like --

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
So it is a dynamic planet,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
and activity is going on as we speak today.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
And these Rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.160
so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
This is one very large crater. Geologists love craters,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
without really working at it,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
and you can see what's below the surface.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
So, this is called Victoria Crater,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160
which is about a few football fields in size.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.160
And if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
If I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
So, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
and we actually saw the Rover on the surface.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160
And we actually used the combination of the satellite images

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
and the Rover to actually conduct science,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
because we can observe large areas

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
and then you can get those Rovers to move around

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
and basically go to a certain location.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
So, specifically what we are doing now is

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
that Rover is going down in that crater.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
As I told you, geologists love craters.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
And the reason is, many of you went to the Grand Canyon,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.160
and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
And what these layers -- that's what the surface used to be

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
a million years ago, 10 million years ago,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
100 million years ago, and you get deposits on top of them.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
So if you can read the layers it's like reading your book,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
and you can learn the history of what happened in the past

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
in that location.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.160
of that crater, and the Rover is going down now, measuring, you know,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
the properties and analyzing the rocks

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
as it's going down, you know, that canyon.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
Now, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
down a slope like this.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.160
If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
But we really made sure we tested those Rovers

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.160
before we got them down -- or that Rover --

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
and made sure that it's all working well.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
Now, when I came last time, shortly after the landing --

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
I think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing --

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
I told you I was surprised that those Rovers

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
are lasting even a hundred days.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
Well, here we are four years later, and they're still working.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
Now you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.160
90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
and Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
would start accumulating on the surface, and after a while

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
we wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
Well, I always say it's important that you are smart,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
but every once in a while it's good to be lucky.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.160
there are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.160
and when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.160
It is like a brand new car that you have,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
and that's literally why they have lasted so long.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
And now we designed them reasonably well,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.160
but that's exactly why they are lasting that long

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.160
and still providing all the science data.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
Now, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
You know, one of them, one of the wheels is stuck, is not working,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
one of the front wheels, so what we are doing,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
we are driving it backwards.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint, you know,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
it's not working very well, so it's walking like this,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
and we can move the arm, you know, that way.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
But still they are producing a lot of scientific data.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
Now, during that whole period, a number of people got excited,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.160
you know, outside the science community about these Rovers,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.160
so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
about how these Rovers are being viewed by people

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.160
other than the science community.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.160
So let me go on the next short video.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.160
By the way, this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place, you know,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.160
about four years ago.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
Video: Okay, we have parachute aligned.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.160
Okay, deploy the airbags. Open.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
Camera. We have a picture right now.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
Yeah!

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.160
CE: That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.160
Video: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
What is he doing?

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
What is that?

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.160
CE: Not too bad.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160
So anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.160
about the beauty of that planet.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
As I said earlier, it looked very much like Earth,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
so you see sand dunes.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
from the Sahara Desert or somewhere, and you'd have believed me,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.160
but these are pictures taken from Mars.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
But one area which is particularly intriguing for us

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
is the northern region, you know, of Mars, close to the North Pole,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
because we see ice caps, and we see the ice caps shrinking

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.160
and expanding, so it's very much like you have in northern Canada.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160
And we wanted to find out -- and we see all kinds of glacial features on it.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
So, we wanted to find out, actually,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.160
what is that ice made of, and could that have embedded in it

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
some organic, you know, material.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
So we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
called Phoenix, and that spacecraft will land

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.160
17 days, seven hours and 20 seconds from now,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
so you can adjust your watch.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.160
So it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
on the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.160
And as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
in 17 days, I'll show you, kind of,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160
a little bit of what's going to happen.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
Video: That's what we call the seven minutes of terror.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
that we put them in an oven and actually heat them

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
and look what gases will come from it.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.160
So this was launched about nine months ago.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.160
We'll be coming in at 12,000 miles per hour, and in seven minutes

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.160
we have to stop and touch the surface very softly

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.160
so we don't break that lander.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
Ben Cichy: Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
It's the first mission that's going to try to land

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.160
near the North Pole of Mars, and it's the first mission

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.160
on the surface of another planet.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
Lynn Craig: Where there tends to be water, at least on Earth,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
there tends to be life, and so it's potentially a place

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.160
where life could have existed on the planet in the past.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.160
Erik Bailey: The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:12.160
at 12,500 miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.160
in a soft way in a very short amount of time.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
BC: We enter the Martian atmosphere.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
We're 70 miles above the surface of Mars.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.160
And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
EB: Looks kind of like an ice cream cone, more or less.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
BC: And on the front of it is this heat shield,

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.160
this saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160
of essentially what's cork on the front of it,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.160
which is our heat shield.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.160
Now, this is really special cork,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
and this cork is what's going to protect us

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
from the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
Rob Grover: Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
and we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
to our advantage to slow us down.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160
BC: From this point, we're going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
down to 900 miles an hour.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
EB: The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.160
RG: The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.160
EB: The inside doesn't get very hot.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
It probably gets about room temperature.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
Richard Kornfeld: There is this window of opportunity

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
within which we can deploy the parachute.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
EB: If you fire the 'chute too early, the parachute itself could fail.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
And that would be bad.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.160
BC: In the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
we'll decelerate from 900 miles an hour

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.160
to a relatively slow 250 miles an hour.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.160
We no longer need the heat shield to protect us

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.160
from the force of atmospheric entry, so we jettison the heat shield,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.160
LC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.160
the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.160
how far Phoenix really is from the ground.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160
BC: We've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.160
So, we're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.160
But that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
EB: Now the spacecraft actually has to decide

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
when it's going to get rid of its parachute.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160
BC: We separate from the lander going 125 miles an hour

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.160
at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars: 3,200 feet.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
That's like taking two Empire State Buildings

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.160
and stacking them on top of one another.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
EB: That's when we separate from the back shell,

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
and we're now in free-fall.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.160
It's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.160
in a very short amount of time.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160
LC: So it's in a free-fall,

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.160
but it's also trying to use all of its actuators

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160
to make sure that it's in the right position to land.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.160
EB: And then it has to light up its engines, right itself,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.160
and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.160
BC: Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.160
for a signal from Mars to get to Earth.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.160
And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.160
So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.160
it'll already be over.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160
EB: We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.160
so that it can land itself safely.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.160
BC: EDL is this immense, technically challenging problem.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.160
It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.160
and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.160
how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160
It's this immensely exciting and challenging problem.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.160
CE: Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.160
So it will be a very tense moment, you know,

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.160
as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.160
So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.160
So we are in the process, as we speak, of actually designing

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160
the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.160
So I thought I would go a little bit and tell you, kind of,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
the steps we go through.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.160
It's very similar to what you do when you design your product.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160
As you saw a little bit earlier,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.160
when we were doing the Phoenix one,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160
we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.160
So we have to study all kinds of different materials,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.160
the shape that we want to do.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.160
In general we don't try to please the customer here.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.160
What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective, you know,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.160
an efficient kind of machine.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.160
First we start by we want to have our employees

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.160
to be as imaginative as they can.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.160
And we really love being close to the art center, because we have,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
as a matter of fact, one of the alumni from the art center,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.160
Eric Nyquist, had put a series of displays,

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.160
far-out displays, you know,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.160
in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room,

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
just to get people to think wildly about things.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160
We have a bunch of Legos. So, as I said,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.160
this is a playground for adults, where they sit down and try to play

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.160
with different shapes and different designs.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.160
Then we get a little bit more serious, so we have

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.160
what we call our CAD/CAMs and all the engineers who are involved,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.160
or scientists who are involved, who know about thermal properties,

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.160
know about design, know about atmospheric interaction, parachutes,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.160
all of these things, which they work in a team effort

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.160
and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.160
so to see, does that meet the requirement that we need.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.160
On the right, also, we have to take into account

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.160
the environment of the planet where we are going.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.160
If you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.160
you know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.160
close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.160
So just imagine: you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.160
and it still has to work.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.160
So these are kind of some of the little challenges, you know,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.160
that we have to face.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.160
If we are doing entry, we have to do tests of parachutes.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.160
You saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day,

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.160
you know, if that happened, so we have to test,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.160
because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.160
We are coming at extremely high speeds, and we are deploying them

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.160
to slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.160
To give you an idea of the size, you know, of that parachute

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.160
relative to the people standing there.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.160
Next step, we go and actually build some kind of test models

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.160
and actually test them, you know, in the lab at JPL,

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.160
in what we call our Mars Yard.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.160
We kick them, we hit them, we drop them,

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.160
just to make sure we understand how, where would they break.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:09.160
And then we back off, you know, from that point.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.160
And then we actually do the actual building and the flight.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.160
And this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.160
That big shield that you see outside,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.160
that's a heat shield which is going to protect it.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.160
And that will be basically built over the next year,

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.160
and it will be launched June a year from now.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.160
Now, in that case, because it was a very big Rover,

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.160
we couldn't use airbags.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.160
And I know many of you, kind of, last time afterwards said

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.160
well, that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.160
Unfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.160
mass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.160
So we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.160
another ingenious idea of how do we land it.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.160
And we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.160
because we didn't want to contaminate the surface;

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.160
we wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.160
So we came up with this ingenious idea,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.160
which is used here on Earth for helicopters.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.160
Actually, the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.160
above that surface for 100 feet, and then we have a sky crane

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.160
which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.160
Hopefully it all will work, you know, it will work that way.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.160
And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.160
What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.160
it's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.160
So it will have an arm which will take samples,

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.160
put them in an oven, crush and analyze them.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.160
But also, if there is something that we cannot reach

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.160
because it is too high on a cliff, we have a little laser system

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.160
which will actually zap the rock, evaporate some of it,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.160
and actually analyze what's coming from that rock.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.160
So it's a little bit like "Star Wars," you know, but it's real.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.160
It's real stuff.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.160
And also to help you, to help the community

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.160
so you can do ads on that Rover, we are going to train that Rover

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.160
to actually in addition to do this, to actually serve cocktails,

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.160
you know, also on Mars.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.160
So that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of, you know,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.160
fun things we are doing on Mars.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.160
I thought I'd go to "The Lord of the Rings" now

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.160
and show you some of the things we have there.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.160
Now, "The Lord of the Rings" has two things played through it.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.160
One, it's a very attractive planet --

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.160
it just has the beauty of the rings and so on.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.160
But for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning,

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.160
because we believe they represent, on a small scale,

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.160
how the Solar System actually formed.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.160
Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed,

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.160
that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun,

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.160
a lot of the dust around it created rings

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.160
and then the particles in those rings accumulated together,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.160
and they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.160
you know, were formed.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.160
So, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.160
our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale,

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.160
so it's like a test bed for it.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.160
So, let me show you a little bit

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.160
on what that Saturnian system looks like.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.160
First, I'm going to fly you over the rings.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.160
By the way, all of this is real stuff.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.160
This is not animation or anything like this.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.160
This is actually taken from the satellite

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.160
that we have in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.160
And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings,

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.160
which are the particles.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.160
Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.160
So that's why you have these gaps, is because a small satellite, you know,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.160
is being formed in that location.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.160
Now, you think that those rings are very large objects.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.160
Yes, they are very large in one dimension;

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.160
in the other dimension they are paper thin. Very, very thin.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.160
What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.160
And that's one of the satellites

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.160
which was actually formed on that one.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.160
So, think about it as a paper-thin,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.160
huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles, which is rotating.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.160
And we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form,

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.160
each one looking very different and very odd, and that keeps

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.160
scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this,

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.160
and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.160
what these things look like, or why they formed that way.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.160
Well, there were two satellites which were particularly interesting.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.160
One of them is called Enceladus.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.160
It's a satellite which was all made of ice,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.160
and we measured it from orbit. Made of ice.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.160
But there was something bizarre about it.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.160
If you look at these stripes in here, what we call tiger stripes,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.160
when we flew over them, all of a sudden we saw

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.160
an increase in the temperature, which said that those stripes

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.160
are warmer than the rest of the planet.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:21.160
So as we flew by away from it, we looked back. And guess what?

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.160
We saw geysers coming out.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.160
So this is a Yellowstone, you know, of Saturn.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.160
We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet,

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.160
which indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know,

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.160
below the surface.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.160
And somehow, through some dynamic effect, we're having these geysers

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.160
which are being, you know, emitted from it.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.160
And the reason I showed the little arrow there,

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.160
I think that should say 30 miles,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.160
we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.160
through the plume of that geyser

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.160
so we can actually measure the material that it is made of.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.160
That was [unclear] also -- you know, because we were worried

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.160
about the risk of it, but it worked pretty well.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.160
We flew at the top of it, and we found that there is a fair amount of

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.160
organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.160
And over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn,

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.160
we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.160
and make more accurate measurements.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.160
Now, another satellite also attracted a lot of attention,

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.160
and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting,

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:24.160
it's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.160
And that atmosphere is very -- as dense as our own atmosphere.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.160
So if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.160
that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder,

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.160
and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.160
Now, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material,

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.160
so immediately people start thinking,

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.160
could life have evolved in that location,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.160
when you have a lot of organic material.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.160
So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:57.160
a pre-biotic planet, because it's so cold organic material did not get

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.160
to the stage of becoming biological material,

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.160
and therefore life could have evolved on it.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.160
So it could be Earth, frozen three billion years ago

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.160
before life actually started on it.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.160
So that's getting a lot of interest, and to show you some example

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.160
of what we did in there, we actually dropped a probe,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.160
which was developed by our colleagues in Europe, we dropped a probe

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.160
as we were orbiting Saturn.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.160
We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.160
And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.160
Just looked like the coast of California for me.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.160
You see the rivers which are coming along the coast,

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.160
and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island,

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.160
and that looks like an ocean.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.160
And then with an instrument we have on board, a radar instrument,

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.160
we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.160
so it looks very much like Earth.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.160
It looks like there are rivers on it, there are oceans or lakes,

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.160
we know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.160
So it's very much like the cycle on Earth except

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.160
because it's so cold, it could not be water, you know,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.160
because water would have frozen.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.160
What it turned out, that all that we are seeing, all this liquid,

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.160
[is made of] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.160
similar to what you put in your car.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.160
So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth,

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.160
but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.160
So if you were on Mars -- sorry, on Titan,

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.160
you don't have to worry about four-dollar gasoline.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.160
You just drive to the nearest lake, stick your hose in it,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.160
and you've got your car filled up.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.160
On the other hand, if you light a match

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.160
the whole planet will blow up.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.160
So in closing, I said I want to close by a couple of pictures.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.160
And just to kind of put us in perspective,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.160
this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.160
from behind Saturn, looking towards the Sun.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.160
The Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call "forward scattering,"

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.160
so it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.160
There is a -- I'm not sure you can see it very well,

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.160
but on the top left, around 10 o'clock,

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.160
there is a little teeny dot, and that's Earth.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.160
You barely can see ourselves. So what I did, I thought I'd zoom on it.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.160
So as you zoom in, you know, you can see Earth, you know,

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.160
just in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.160
So thank you very much.
