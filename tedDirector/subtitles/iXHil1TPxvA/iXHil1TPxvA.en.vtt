00:00:13.354 --> 00:00:17.950
Virtual reality started for me
in sort of an unusual place.

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:21.173
It was the 1970s.

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:24.383
I got into the field very young:
I was seven years old.

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:29.245
And the tool that I used 
to access virtual reality

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:32.810
was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.201
This is a commercial for 
that particular item:

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.776
(Video) Voice-over: What a jump!

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:38.767
Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.536
That gyro-power sends him 
over 100 feet at top speed.

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:43.628
Chris Milk: So this was my joy back then.

00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:46.587
I rode this motorcycle everywhere.

00:00:46.587 --> 00:00:50.847
And I was there with Evel Knievel; we 
jumped the Snake River Canyon together.

00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:52.216
I wanted the rocket.

00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:54.996
I never got the rocket,
I only got the motorcycle.

00:00:57.626 --> 00:01:00.203
I felt so connected to this world.

00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:04.440
I didn't want to be a storyteller 
when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.644
I was there. Evel Knievel was my friend.

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:10.027
I had so much empathy for him.

00:01:10.747 --> 00:01:13.358
But it didn't work out. (Laughter)

00:01:13.358 --> 00:01:15.382
I went to art school.

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:17.792
I started making music videos.

00:01:17.792 --> 00:01:20.866
And this is one of the early
music videos that I made:

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:26.756
(Music: "Touch the Sky" by Kanye West)

00:01:26.756 --> 00:01:30.032
CM: You may notice 
some slight similarities here.

00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:31.818
(Laughter)

00:01:31.818 --> 00:01:34.461
And I got that rocket.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.104
(Laughter)

00:01:37.104 --> 00:01:41.509
So, now I'm a filmmaker,
or, the beginning of a filmmaker,

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.243
and I started using the tools that are
available to me as a filmmaker

00:01:45.243 --> 00:01:49.831
to try to tell the most compelling stories
that I can to an audience.

00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:52.980
And film is this incredible medium
that allows us to feel empathy

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.006
for people that are very different than us

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:57.838
and worlds completely 
foreign from our own.

00:01:57.838 --> 00:01:58.668
Unfortunately,

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:03.527
Evel Knievel did not feel the same 
empathy for us that we felt for him,

00:02:03.527 --> 00:02:06.330
and he sued us for this video --

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.061
(Laughter) --

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.110
shortly thereafter.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.950
On the upside, the man 
that I worshipped as a child,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.066
the man that I wanted 
to become as an adult,

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:21.906
I was finally able to get his autograph.

00:02:22.556 --> 00:02:25.902
(Applause)

00:02:29.832 --> 00:02:34.849
Let's talk about film now.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.745
Film, it's an incredible medium,

00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:41.060
but essentially, it's the same
now as it was then.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.529
It's a group of rectangles that are
played in a sequence.

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:48.362
And we've done incredible things
with those rectangles.

00:02:48.362 --> 00:02:51.247
But I started thinking about,

00:02:51.247 --> 00:02:55.616
is there a way that I can use modern
and developing technologies

00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:57.741
to tell stories in different ways

00:02:57.741 --> 00:02:59.482
and tell different kinds of stories

00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:03.793
that maybe I couldn't tell using
the traditional tools of filmmaking

00:03:03.793 --> 00:03:05.964
that we've been using for 100 years?

00:03:05.964 --> 00:03:08.785
So I started experimenting,

00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:13.874
and what I was trying to do was
to build the ultimate empathy machine.

00:03:15.054 --> 00:03:17.588
And here's one of the early experiments:

00:03:17.588 --> 00:03:20.412
(Music)

00:03:20.412 --> 00:03:22.656
So this is called
"The Wilderness Downtown."

00:03:22.656 --> 00:03:24.712
It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.

00:03:24.712 --> 00:03:28.362
It asked you to put in the address
where you grew up at the beginning of it.

00:03:28.362 --> 00:03:29.359
It's a website.

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.275
And out of it starts growing these little
boxes with different browser windows.

00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:36.657
And you see this teenager 
running down a street,

00:03:36.657 --> 00:03:39.415
and then you see Google Street View
and Google Maps imagery

00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:41.939
and you realize the street
he's running down is yours.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.048
And when he stops in front of a house,
he stops in front of your house.

00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:51.417
And this was great, and I saw people 
having an even deeper emotional reaction

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:54.631
to this than the things that 
I had made in rectangles.

00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:58.562
And I'm essentially taking 
a piece of your history

00:03:58.562 --> 00:04:01.981
and putting it inside 
the framing of the story.

00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:03.578
But then I started thinking,

00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:05.430
okay, well that's a part of you,

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.731
but how do I put all of you
inside of the frame?

00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:13.834
So to do that, I started
making art installations.

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:16.374
And this is one called 
"The Treachery of Sanctuary."

00:04:16.374 --> 00:04:19.392
It's a triptych. I'm going to show
you the third panel.

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:23.230
(Music)

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.848
So now I've got you inside of the frame,

00:04:46.848 --> 00:04:51.403
and I saw people having even more
visceral emotional reactions

00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:54.080
to this work than the previous one.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.230
But then I started thinking about frames,
and what do they represent?

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.487
And a frame is just a window.

00:05:00.487 --> 00:05:03.566
I mean, all the media that we watch --
television, cinema --

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:05.819
they're these windows into 
these other worlds.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.507
And I thought, well, great. 
I got you in a frame.

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:11.634
But I don't want you in the frame,
I don't want you in the window,

00:05:11.634 --> 00:05:14.523
I want you through the window,
I want you on the other side,

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:17.598
in the world, inhabiting the world.

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:21.123
So that leads me back to virtual reality.

00:05:21.123 --> 00:05:23.344
Let's talk about virtual reality.

00:05:24.634 --> 00:05:25.934
Unfortunately,

00:05:25.934 --> 00:05:30.423
talking about virtual reality
is like dancing about architecture.

00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:37.340
And this is actually someone dancing
about architecture in virtual reality.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.823
(Laughter)

00:05:39.823 --> 00:05:43.084
So, it's difficult to explain.
Why is it difficult to explain?

00:05:43.084 --> 00:05:46.782
It's difficult because it's a very 
experiential medium.

00:05:46.782 --> 00:05:48.698
You feel your way inside of it.

00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:50.496
It's a machine, but inside of it,

00:05:50.496 --> 00:05:53.945
it feels like real life,
it feels like truth.

00:05:53.945 --> 00:05:56.466
And you feel present in the world
that you're inside

00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:59.689
and you feel present with the people
that you're inside of it with.

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.785
So, I'm going to show you a demo
of a virtual reality film:

00:06:03.785 --> 00:06:06.006
a full-screen version of
all the information

00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:08.209
that we capture when
we shoot virtual reality.

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:10.034
So we're shooting in every direction.

00:06:10.034 --> 00:06:12.210
This is a camera system that we built

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.235
that has 3D cameras that look
in every direction

00:06:15.235 --> 00:06:17.987
and binaural microphones
that face in every direction.

00:06:17.987 --> 00:06:23.333
We take this and we build, basically,
a sphere of a world that you inhabit.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:26.736
So what I'm going to show you
is not a view into the world,

00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:30.107
it's basically the whole world
stretched into a rectangle.

00:06:30.107 --> 00:06:33.495
So this film is called 
"Clouds Over Sidra,"

00:06:33.495 --> 00:06:37.989
and it was made in conjunction with 
our virtual reality company called VRSE

00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:39.755
and the United Nations,

00:06:39.755 --> 00:06:42.788
and a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.

00:06:42.788 --> 00:06:46.625
And we went to a Syrian refugee camp
in Jordan in December

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:50.982
and shot the story of a 12-year-old
girl there named Sidra.

00:06:50.982 --> 00:06:54.473
And she and her family fled Syria
through the desert into Jordan

00:06:54.473 --> 00:06:58.567
and she's been living in this
camp for the last year and a half.

00:07:00.207 --> 00:07:02.720
(Video) Sidra: My name is Sidra.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.616
I am 12 years old.

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:06.418
I am in the fifth grade.

00:07:06.418 --> 00:07:11.605
I am from Syria,
in the Daraa Province, Inkhil City.

00:07:11.605 --> 00:07:16.843
I have lived here in the Zaatari camp
in Jordan for the last year and a half.

00:07:18.923 --> 00:07:20.931
I have a big family:

00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:23.697
three brothers, one is a baby.

00:07:23.697 --> 00:07:27.142
He cries a lot.

00:07:27.142 --> 00:07:32.197
I asked my father if I cried when 
I was a baby and he says I did not.

00:07:32.197 --> 00:07:35.821
I think I was a stronger baby
than my brother.

00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:38.731
CM: So, when you're inside 
of the headset.

00:07:38.731 --> 00:07:40.351
you're not seeing it like this.

00:07:40.351 --> 00:07:42.423
You're looking around through this world.

00:07:42.423 --> 00:07:47.711
You'll notice you see full
360 degrees, in all directions.

00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:50.702
And when you're sitting there
in her room, watching her,

00:07:50.702 --> 00:07:53.115
you're not watching it through
a television screen,

00:07:53.115 --> 00:07:56.523
you're not watching it through a window,
you're sitting there with her.

00:07:56.523 --> 00:08:00.896
When you look down, you're sitting
on the same ground that she's sitting on.

00:08:00.915 --> 00:08:02.666
And because of that,

00:08:02.666 --> 00:08:07.054
you feel her humanity in a deeper way.

00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:11.590
You empathize with her in a deeper way.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:17.917
And I think that we can change
minds with this machine.

00:08:17.917 --> 00:08:21.690
And we've already started
to try to change a few.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:26.536
So we took this film to the World Economic
Forum in Davos in January.

00:08:26.536 --> 00:08:29.022
And we showed it to a group of people

00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:33.102
whose decisions affect the lives
of millions of people.

00:08:33.102 --> 00:08:35.220
And these are people 
who might not otherwise

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:41.484
be sitting in a tent 
in a refugee camp in Jordan.

00:08:41.484 --> 00:08:47.813
But in January, one afternoon
in Switzerland,

00:08:47.813 --> 00:08:51.429
they suddenly all found themselves there.

00:08:52.309 --> 00:08:56.489
(Applause)

00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:01.058
And they were affected by it.

00:09:01.058 --> 00:09:04.374
So we're going to make more of them.

00:09:04.374 --> 00:09:07.460
We're working with the 
United Nations right now

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.515
to shoot a whole series of these films.

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:12.187
We just finished shooting
a story in Liberia.

00:09:12.187 --> 00:09:15.633
And now, we're going 
to shoot a story in India.

00:09:15.633 --> 00:09:17.511
And we're taking these films,

00:09:17.511 --> 00:09:20.036
and we're showing them 
at the United Nations

00:09:20.036 --> 00:09:23.023
to people that work there and people
that are visiting there.

00:09:23.023 --> 00:09:24.810
And we're showing 
them to the people

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.274
that can actually change the lives
of the people inside of the films.

00:09:29.274 --> 00:09:32.955
And that's where I think we just
start to scratch the surface

00:09:32.955 --> 00:09:36.614
of the true power of virtual reality.

00:09:36.614 --> 00:09:38.835
It's not a video game peripheral.

00:09:38.835 --> 00:09:43.408
It connects humans to other humans
in a profound way

00:09:43.408 --> 00:09:46.873
that I've never seen before 
in any other form of media.

00:09:46.873 --> 00:09:50.612
And it can change people's
perception of each other.

00:09:50.612 --> 00:09:52.298
And that's how I think

00:09:52.298 --> 00:09:55.734
virtual reality has the potential
to actually change the world.

00:09:58.604 --> 00:10:01.151
So, it's a machine,

00:10:01.151 --> 00:10:06.074
but through this machine
we become more compassionate,

00:10:06.074 --> 00:10:11.667
we become more empathetic,
and we become more connected.

00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:15.521
And ultimately, we become more human.

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:17.651
Thank you.

00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:20.771
(Applause)
