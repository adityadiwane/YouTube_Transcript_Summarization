00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.112
I worked as a war reporter for 15 years

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:20.601
before I realized
that I really had a problem.

00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:23.207
There was something really wrong with me.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:26.569
This was about a year before 9/11,
and America wasn't at war yet.

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:29.824
We weren't talking about PTSD.

00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:34.044
We were not yet talking
about the effect of trauma and war

00:00:34.068 --> 00:00:35.852
on the human psyche.

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:38.956
I'd been in Afghanistan
for a couple of months

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.988
with the Northern Alliance
as they were fighting the Taliban.

00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:45.269
And at that point the Taliban
had an air force,

00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:48.522
they had fighter planes,
they had tanks, they had artillery,

00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:51.837
and we really got hammered
pretty badly a couple of times.

00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:53.827
We saw some very ugly things.

00:00:55.104 --> 00:00:57.074
But I didn't really think it affected me.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:58.626
I didn't think much about it.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.601
I came home to New York, where I live.

00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:03.506
Then one day I went down into the subway,

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.941
and for the first time in my life,

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:08.799
I knew real fear.

00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:11.162
I had a massive panic attack.

00:01:12.058 --> 00:01:14.937
I was way more scared
than I had ever been in Afghanistan.

00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:19.493
Everything I was looking at seemed like
it was going to kill me,

00:01:19.517 --> 00:01:21.810
but I couldn't explain why.

00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:24.095
The trains were going too fast.

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.473
There were too many people.

00:01:25.497 --> 00:01:27.285
The lights were too bright.

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:30.108
Everything was too loud,
everything was moving too quickly.

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:33.460
I backed up against a support column
and just waited for it.

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:38.311
When I couldn't take it any longer,
I ran out of the subway station

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:40.064
and walked wherever I was going.

00:01:41.648 --> 00:01:45.827
Later, I found out that what I had
was short-term PTSD:

00:01:45.851 --> 00:01:47.754
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:52.221
We evolved as animals, as primates,
to survive periods of danger,

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:55.166
and if your life has been in danger,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.831
you want to react to unfamiliar noises.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:01.607
You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.

00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:03.825
You want to have nightmares and flashbacks

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:05.658
of the thing that could kill you.

00:02:06.756 --> 00:02:09.813
You want to be angry because it makes you
predisposed to fight,

00:02:09.837 --> 00:02:13.210
or depressed, because it keeps you out
of circulation a little bit.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:14.922
Keeps you safe.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.458
It's not very pleasant,
but it's better than getting eaten.

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.923
Most people recover
from that pretty quickly.

00:02:22.947 --> 00:02:25.037
It takes a few weeks, a few months.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:28.176
I kept having panic attacks,
but they eventually went away.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.850
I had no idea it was connected
to the war that I'd seen.

00:02:30.874 --> 00:02:32.470
I just thought I was going crazy,

00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:35.628
and then I thought, well,
now I'm not going crazy anymore.

00:02:37.197 --> 00:02:39.827
About 20 percent of people, however,

00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:43.142
wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.560
They are not adapted to temporary danger.

00:02:45.584 --> 00:02:48.345
They are maladapted for everyday life,

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:49.547
unless they get help.

00:02:49.994 --> 00:02:53.533
We know that the people
who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD

00:02:53.557 --> 00:02:56.273
are people who were abused as children,

00:02:56.297 --> 00:02:58.028
who suffered trauma as children,

00:02:58.052 --> 00:03:00.670
people who have low education levels,

00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:03.252
people who have psychiatric
disorders in their family.

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:04.554
If you served in Vietnam

00:03:04.578 --> 00:03:07.272
and your brother is schizophrenic,

00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:11.412
you're way more likely to get
long-term PTSD from Vietnam.

00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:15.199
So I started to study this
as a journalist,

00:03:15.868 --> 00:03:19.391
and I realized that there was something
really strange going on.

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:22.158
The numbers seemed to be going
in the wrong direction.

00:03:22.597 --> 00:03:24.969
Every war that we have
fought as a country,

00:03:24.993 --> 00:03:26.967
starting with the Civil War,

00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:30.047
the intensity of the combat has gone down.

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:34.258
As a result, the casualty rates
have gone down.

00:03:34.707 --> 00:03:36.662
But disability rates have gone up.

00:03:36.686 --> 00:03:38.888
They should be going
in the same direction,

00:03:39.702 --> 00:03:41.951
but they're going in different directions.

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:48.713
The recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
have produced, thank God,

00:03:48.737 --> 00:03:54.081
a casualty rate about one third
of what it was in Vietnam.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.089
But they've also created --

00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:02.024
they've also produced
three times the disability rates.

00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:09.499
Around 10 percent of the US military
is actively engaged in combat,

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.777
10 percent or under.

00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:14.075
They're shooting at people,
killing people,

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.437
getting shot at,
seeing their friends get killed.

00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:18.014
It's incredibly traumatic.

00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:20.848
But it's only about 10 percent
of our military.

00:04:20.872 --> 00:04:23.105
But about half of our military has filed

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:27.351
for some kind of PTSD compensation
from the government.

00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:33.617
And suicide doesn't even fit into this
in a very logical way.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:39.959
We've all heard the tragic statistic
of 22 vets a day, on average,

00:04:39.983 --> 00:04:42.590
in this country, killing themselves.

00:04:43.564 --> 00:04:45.054
Most people don't realize

00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:50.715
that the majority of those suicides
are veterans of the Vietnam War,

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:52.617
that generation,

00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:57.139
and their decision to take their own lives
actually might not be related

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.861
to the war they fought 50 years earlier.

00:05:01.122 --> 00:05:04.814
In fact, there's no statistical connection
between combat and suicide.

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:07.905
If you're in the military
and you're in a lot of combat,

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:10.939
you're no more likely to kill yourself
than if you weren't.

00:05:11.614 --> 00:05:12.940
In fact, one study found

00:05:12.964 --> 00:05:14.988
that if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,

00:05:15.012 --> 00:05:18.432
you're actually slightly less likely
to commit suicide later.

00:05:20.626 --> 00:05:22.896
I studied anthropology in college.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.939
I did my fieldwork
on the Navajo reservation.

00:05:25.963 --> 00:05:29.358
I wrote a thesis on Navajo
long-distance runners.

00:05:30.473 --> 00:05:34.477
And recently, while
I was researching PTSD,

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.606
I had this thought.

00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:41.404
I thought back to the work
I did when I was young,

00:05:41.428 --> 00:05:45.497
and I thought, I bet the Navajo,
the Apache, the Comanche --

00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:48.085
I mean, these are very warlike nations --

00:05:48.109 --> 00:05:51.891
I bet they weren't getting
PTSD like we do.

00:05:52.814 --> 00:05:55.806
When their warriors came back
from fighting the US military

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.438
or fighting each other,

00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:02.184
I bet they pretty much just slipped
right back into tribal life.

00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:05.889
And maybe what determines

00:06:05.913 --> 00:06:08.607
the rate of long-term PTSD

00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:10.619
isn't what happened out there,

00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:14.347
but the kind of society you come back to.

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:20.061
And maybe if you come back
to a close, cohesive, tribal society,

00:06:20.823 --> 00:06:23.148
you can get over trauma pretty quickly.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.176
And if you come back
to an alienating, modern society,

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:32.224
you might remain traumatized
your entire life.

00:06:32.248 --> 00:06:35.359
In other words, maybe the problem
isn't them, the vets;

00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:37.147
maybe the problem is us.

00:06:39.325 --> 00:06:43.768
Certainly, modern society
is hard on the human psyche

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:46.563
by every metric that we have.

00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:51.404
As wealth goes up in a society,

00:06:53.523 --> 00:06:57.094
the suicide rate goes up instead of down.

00:06:58.066 --> 00:07:00.156
If you live in modern society,

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.316
you're up to eight times more likely

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:06.700
to suffer from depression in your lifetime

00:07:06.724 --> 00:07:09.612
than if you live in a poor,
agrarian society.

00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:14.514
Modern society has probably produced
the highest rates of suicide

00:07:14.538 --> 00:07:17.792
and depression and anxiety
and loneliness and child abuse

00:07:17.816 --> 00:07:19.561
ever in human history.

00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:22.268
I saw one study

00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:25.334
that compared women in Nigeria,

00:07:25.358 --> 00:07:27.855
one of the most chaotic
and violent and corrupt

00:07:28.627 --> 00:07:30.833
and poorest countries in Africa,

00:07:31.358 --> 00:07:32.649
to women in North America.

00:07:32.673 --> 00:07:37.863
And the highest rates of depression
were urban women in North America.

00:07:37.887 --> 00:07:39.882
That was also the wealthiest group.

00:07:40.637 --> 00:07:44.486
So let's go back to the US military.

00:07:45.096 --> 00:07:47.614
Ten percent are in combat.

00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:52.377
Around 50 percent have filed
for PTSD compensation.

00:07:53.602 --> 00:07:58.704
So about 40 percent of veterans
really were not traumatized overseas

00:07:59.734 --> 00:08:04.040
but have come home to discover
they are dangerously alienated

00:08:04.563 --> 00:08:05.889
and depressed.

00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:11.278
So what is happening with them?

00:08:11.302 --> 00:08:13.119
What's going on with those people,

00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:18.786
the phantom 40 percent that are troubled
but don't understand why?

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.134
Maybe it's this:

00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:24.802
maybe they had an experience
of sort of tribal closeness

00:08:24.826 --> 00:08:27.056
in their unit when they were overseas.

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:30.708
They were eating together,
sleeping together,

00:08:30.732 --> 00:08:33.031
doing tasks and missions together.

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:35.594
They were trusting each other
with their lives.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.833
And then they come home

00:08:38.857 --> 00:08:40.857
and they have to give all that up

00:08:41.851 --> 00:08:45.590
and they're coming back
to a society, a modern society,

00:08:45.614 --> 00:08:49.147
which is hard on people
who weren't even in the military.

00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:50.796
It's just hard on everybody.

00:08:51.494 --> 00:08:55.417
And we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.

00:08:56.685 --> 00:08:58.377
But for a lot of these people,

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.537
maybe it's not trauma.

00:09:00.561 --> 00:09:03.116
I mean, certainly,
soldiers are traumatized

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.509
and the ones who are
have to be treated for that.

00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:06.727
But a lot of them --

00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:09.981
maybe what's bothering them
is actually a kind of alienation.

00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:13.091
I mean, maybe we just have
the wrong word for some of it,

00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:15.504
and just changing our language,
our understanding,

00:09:15.528 --> 00:09:16.702
would help a little bit.

00:09:16.726 --> 00:09:19.438
"Post-deployment alienation disorder."

00:09:19.462 --> 00:09:22.340
Maybe even just calling it that
for some of these people

00:09:23.634 --> 00:09:26.212
would allow them to stop imagining

00:09:26.236 --> 00:09:29.002
trying to imagine a trauma
that didn't really happen

00:09:29.707 --> 00:09:32.478
in order to explain a feeling
that really is happening.

00:09:32.502 --> 00:09:35.019
And in fact, it's an extremely
dangerous feeling.

00:09:35.043 --> 00:09:37.783
That alienation and depression
can lead to suicide.

00:09:37.807 --> 00:09:39.804
These people are in danger.

00:09:39.828 --> 00:09:41.950
It's very important to understand why.

00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:47.441
The Israeli military has a PTSD rate
of around one percent.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:53.249
The theory is that everyone in Israel
is supposed to serve in the military.

00:09:53.273 --> 00:09:55.383
When soldiers come back
from the front line,

00:09:55.407 --> 00:09:59.845
they're not going from a military
environment to a civilian environment.

00:10:00.741 --> 00:10:04.448
They're coming back to a community
where everyone understands

00:10:05.698 --> 00:10:06.853
about the military.

00:10:06.877 --> 00:10:09.032
Everyone's been in it
or is going to be in it.

00:10:09.056 --> 00:10:11.412
Everyone understands
the situation they're all in.

00:10:11.436 --> 00:10:13.705
It's as if they're all in one big tribe.

00:10:14.282 --> 00:10:16.316
We know that if you take a lab rat

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.012
and traumatize it and put it
in a cage by itself,

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:23.193
you can maintain its trauma symptoms
almost indefinitely.

00:10:23.717 --> 00:10:28.804
And if you take that same lab rat
and put it in a cage with other rats,

00:10:30.018 --> 00:10:33.374
after a couple of weeks,
it's pretty much OK.

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:36.771
After 9/11,

00:10:38.549 --> 00:10:41.842
the murder rate in New York City
went down by 40 percent.

00:10:41.866 --> 00:10:43.688
The suicide rate went down.

00:10:44.756 --> 00:10:49.260
The violent crime rate in New York
went down after 9/11.

00:10:49.284 --> 00:10:54.603
Even combat veterans of previous wars
who suffered from PTSD

00:10:54.627 --> 00:10:59.124
said that their symptoms went down
after 9/11 happened.

00:10:59.148 --> 00:11:02.584
The reason is that if you traumatize
an entire society,

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.669
we don't fall apart
and turn on one another.

00:11:07.693 --> 00:11:09.807
We come together. We unify.

00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:11.878
Basically, we tribalize,

00:11:11.902 --> 00:11:17.455
and that process of unifying
feels so good and is so good for us,

00:11:17.479 --> 00:11:18.896
that it even helps people

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.214
who are struggling
with mental health issues.

00:11:22.238 --> 00:11:24.003
During the blitz in London,

00:11:24.027 --> 00:11:29.040
admissions to psychiatric wards
went down during the bombings.

00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:33.828
For a while, that was the kind of country

00:11:33.852 --> 00:11:37.723
that American soldiers came
back to -- a unified country.

00:11:38.288 --> 00:11:39.559
We were sticking together.

00:11:39.583 --> 00:11:42.194
We were trying to understand
the threat against us.

00:11:42.218 --> 00:11:46.297
We were trying to help
ourselves and the world.

00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:49.122
But that's changed.

00:11:50.392 --> 00:11:52.738
Now, American soldiers,

00:11:52.762 --> 00:11:56.582
American veterans are coming back
to a country that is so bitterly divided

00:11:57.716 --> 00:12:01.138
that the two political parties
are literally accusing each other

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.510
of treason, of being
an enemy of the state,

00:12:06.265 --> 00:12:11.025
of trying to undermine the security
and the welfare of their own country.

00:12:11.049 --> 00:12:15.182
The gap between rich and poor
is the biggest it's ever been.

00:12:15.206 --> 00:12:16.391
It's just getting worse.

00:12:16.415 --> 00:12:18.823
Race relations are terrible.

00:12:18.847 --> 00:12:21.703
There are demonstrations
and even riots in the streets

00:12:21.727 --> 00:12:23.706
because of racial injustice.

00:12:24.727 --> 00:12:28.988
And veterans know that any tribe
that treated itself that way -- in fact,

00:12:29.012 --> 00:12:33.942
any platoon that treated itself
that way -- would never survive.

00:12:35.068 --> 00:12:36.959
We've gotten used to it.

00:12:36.983 --> 00:12:40.836
Veterans have gone away
and are coming back

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.301
and seeing their own country
with fresh eyes.

00:12:45.325 --> 00:12:46.982
And they see what's going on.

00:12:47.738 --> 00:12:49.593
This is the country they fought for.

00:12:50.433 --> 00:12:52.111
No wonder they're depressed.

00:12:52.135 --> 00:12:53.709
No wonder they're scared.

00:12:55.371 --> 00:12:59.248
Sometimes, we ask ourselves
if we can save the vets.

00:13:00.248 --> 00:13:03.418
I think the real question
is if we can save ourselves.

00:13:03.905 --> 00:13:05.595
If we can,

00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:07.593
I think the vets are going to be fine.

00:13:08.697 --> 00:13:11.834
It's time for this country to unite,

00:13:13.818 --> 00:13:18.610
if only to help the men and women
who fought to protect us.

00:13:19.182 --> 00:13:20.413
Thank you very much.

00:13:20.437 --> 00:13:27.103
(Applause)
