00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:19.814
"I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,

00:00:19.838 --> 00:00:22.216
and Mourners to and fro

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.043
kept treading -- treading --
till [it seemed]

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:27.386
that Sense was breaking through --

00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:29.581
And when they all were seated,

00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:31.579
a Service, like a Drum --

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:35.055
kept beating -- beating --
till I [thought]

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.845
my Mind was going numb --

00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.970
And then I heard them lift a Box
and creak across my Soul

00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:45.029
with those same Boots of Lead, again,

00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:48.046
then Space -- began to toll,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.177
As [all] the Heavens were a Bell,
and Being, [but] an Ear,

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.260
and I, and Silence, some strange Race,

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:57.864
wrecked, solitary, here --

00:00:58.493 --> 00:01:01.646
[And] then a Plank in Reason, broke,

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.987
and I fell down and down --

00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:07.662
and hit a World, at every plunge,

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:10.245
and Finished knowing -- then --"

00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:15.012
We know depression through metaphors.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.365
Emily Dickinson was able
to convey it in language,

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:21.704
Goya in an image.

00:01:22.238 --> 00:01:26.833
Half the purpose of art
is to describe such iconic states.

00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:31.851
As for me, I had always
thought myself tough,

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.677
one of the people who could survive

00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:36.024
if I'd been sent to a concentration camp.

00:01:36.614 --> 00:01:39.279
In 1991, I had a series of losses.

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:41.174
My mother died,

00:01:41.198 --> 00:01:43.300
a relationship I'd been in ended,

00:01:43.324 --> 00:01:47.244
I moved back to the United States
from some years abroad,

00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:49.982
and I got through all of those
experiences intact.

00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:53.516
But in 1994, three years later,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.282
I found myself losing interest
in almost everything.

00:01:58.059 --> 00:02:01.935
I didn't want to do any of the things
I had previously wanted to do,

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.419
and I didn't know why.

00:02:03.987 --> 00:02:08.548
The opposite of depression
is not happiness, but vitality.

00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:10.571
And it was vitality

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:13.558
that seemed to seep away
from me in that moment.

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:17.908
Everything there was to do
seemed like too much work.

00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:20.034
I would come home

00:02:20.058 --> 00:02:23.386
and I would see the red light
flashing on my answering machine,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.950
and instead of being thrilled
to hear from my friends,

00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:27.163
I would think,

00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:29.782
"What a lot of people that is
to have to call back."

00:02:30.368 --> 00:02:32.930
Or I would decide I should have lunch,

00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:35.691
and then I would think,
but I'd have to get the food out

00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:37.477
and put it on a plate

00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:41.365
and cut it up and chew it and swallow it,

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.723
and it felt to me
like the Stations of the Cross.

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:49.419
And one of the things that often gets lost
in discussions of depression

00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:51.501
is that you know it's ridiculous.

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:54.744
You know it's ridiculous
while you're experiencing it.

00:02:54.768 --> 00:02:56.657
You know that most people manage

00:02:56.681 --> 00:02:58.971
to listen to their messages and eat lunch

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:00.901
and organize themselves to take a shower

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:02.143
and go out the front door

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:03.795
and that it's not a big deal,

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.961
and yet you are nonetheless in its grip

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:10.422
and you are unable to figure out
any way around it.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.212
And so I began to feel myself doing less

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.522
and thinking less

00:03:17.546 --> 00:03:18.861
and feeling less.

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.567
It was a kind of nullity.

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.044
And then the anxiety set in.

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:28.259
If you told me that I'd have to be
depressed for the next month,

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:31.522
I would say, "As long I know it'll be over
in November, I can do it."

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:32.792
But if you said to me,

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:36.129
"You have to have acute anxiety
for the next month,"

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:38.472
I would rather slit my wrist
than go through it.

00:03:38.496 --> 00:03:40.054
It was the feeling all the time

00:03:40.078 --> 00:03:42.282
like that feeling you have
if you're walking

00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:45.827
and you slip or trip
and the ground is rushing up at you,

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:48.563
but instead of lasting half a second,
the way that does,

00:03:48.587 --> 00:03:50.468
it lasted for six months.

00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:53.421
It's a sensation
of being afraid all the time

00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:56.430
but not even knowing
what it is that you're afraid of.

00:03:57.057 --> 00:03:59.668
And it was at that point
that I began to think

00:03:59.692 --> 00:04:03.452
that it was just too painful to be alive,

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:06.036
and that the only reason
not to kill oneself

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.755
was so as not to hurt other people.

00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:12.176
And finally one day, I woke up

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.397
and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke,

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.915
because I lay in bed completely frozen,

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:18.864
looking at the telephone, thinking,

00:04:18.888 --> 00:04:22.427
"Something is wrong
and I should call for help,"

00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:24.162
and I couldn't reach out my arm

00:04:24.186 --> 00:04:26.428
and pick up the phone and dial.

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:30.852
And finally, after four full hours
of my lying and staring at it,

00:04:30.876 --> 00:04:32.140
the phone rang,

00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:34.543
and somehow I managed to pick it up,

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:37.495
and it was my father, and I said,

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:40.965
"I'm in serious trouble.
We need to do something."

00:04:41.528 --> 00:04:46.219
The next day I started
with the medications and the therapy.

00:04:47.352 --> 00:04:51.555
And I also started reckoning
with this terrible question:

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:53.683
If I'm not the tough person

00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:56.207
who could have made it
through a concentration camp,

00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:57.719
then who am I?

00:04:57.743 --> 00:04:59.604
And if I have to take medication,

00:04:59.628 --> 00:05:03.541
is that medication making me
more fully myself,

00:05:03.565 --> 00:05:05.783
or is it making me someone else?

00:05:05.807 --> 00:05:09.267
And how do I feel about it
if it's making me someone else?

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.005
I had two advantages
as I went into the fight.

00:05:13.585 --> 00:05:16.256
The first is that I knew that,
objectively speaking,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.877
I had a nice life,

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.762
and that if I could only get well,

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:22.986
there was something at the other end
that was worth living for.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.827
And the other was
that I had access to good treatment.

00:05:26.343 --> 00:05:29.792
But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed,

00:05:29.816 --> 00:05:32.327
and emerged and relapsed,

00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:35.345
and emerged and relapsed,

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:37.309
and finally understood

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:41.254
I would have to be on medication
and in therapy forever.

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:42.936
And I thought,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.746
"But is it a chemical problem
or a psychological problem?

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.703
And does it need a chemical cure
or a philosophical cure?"

00:05:49.727 --> 00:05:51.854
And I couldn't figure out which it was.

00:05:51.878 --> 00:05:53.978
And then I understood that actually,

00:05:54.002 --> 00:05:57.989
we aren't advanced enough in either area
for it to explain things fully.

00:05:58.013 --> 00:06:01.340
The chemical cure
and the psychological cure

00:06:01.364 --> 00:06:03.038
both have a role to play,

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:07.036
and I also figured out
that depression was something

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.284
that was braided so deep into us

00:06:09.308 --> 00:06:12.996
that there was no separating it
from our character and personality.

00:06:13.552 --> 00:06:18.014
I want to say that the treatments we have
for depression are appalling.

00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:19.641
They're not very effective.

00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.728
They're extremely costly.

00:06:21.752 --> 00:06:24.249
They come with innumerable side effects.

00:06:24.273 --> 00:06:25.710
They're a disaster.

00:06:26.027 --> 00:06:30.694
But I am so grateful that I live now
and not 50 years ago,

00:06:30.718 --> 00:06:33.638
when there would have been
almost nothing to be done.

00:06:33.662 --> 00:06:36.045
I hope that 50 years hence,

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:38.091
people will hear about my treatments

00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:41.783
and be appalled that anyone endured
such primitive science.

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:46.127
Depression is the flaw in love.

00:06:47.441 --> 00:06:50.558
If you were married
to someone and thought,

00:06:50.582 --> 00:06:54.292
"Well, if my wife dies,
I'll find another one,"

00:06:54.316 --> 00:06:56.565
it wouldn't be love as we know it.

00:06:57.364 --> 00:07:01.931
There's no such thing as love
without the anticipation of loss,

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:07.511
and that specter of despair
can be the engine of intimacy.

00:07:08.204 --> 00:07:11.035
There are three things
people tend to confuse:

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:14.148
depression, grief and sadness.

00:07:14.966 --> 00:07:18.305
Grief is explicitly reactive.

00:07:18.329 --> 00:07:21.210
If you have a loss
and you feel incredibly unhappy,

00:07:21.234 --> 00:07:22.909
and then, six months later,

00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:26.018
you are still deeply sad,
but you're functioning a little better,

00:07:26.042 --> 00:07:27.827
it's probably grief,

00:07:27.851 --> 00:07:31.586
and it will probably ultimately
resolve itself in some measure.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.415
If you experience a catastrophic loss,

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:35.741
and you feel terrible,

00:07:35.765 --> 00:07:38.554
and six months later
you can barely function at all,

00:07:38.578 --> 00:07:41.092
then it's probably a depression
that was triggered

00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:43.299
by the catastrophic circumstances.

00:07:43.648 --> 00:07:46.818
The trajectory tells us a great deal.

00:07:47.196 --> 00:07:50.556
People think of depression
as being just sadness.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.751
It's much, much too much sadness,

00:07:52.775 --> 00:07:54.526
much too much grief

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.659
at far too slight a cause.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.255
As I set out to understand depression,

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:02.926
and to interview people
who had experienced it,

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.743
I found that there were people
who seemed, on the surface,

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:09.980
to have what sounded like
relatively mild depression

00:08:10.004 --> 00:08:12.742
who were nonetheless
utterly disabled by it.

00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:15.710
And there were other people
who had what sounded

00:08:15.734 --> 00:08:18.796
as they described it
like terribly severe depression

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.560
who nonetheless had good lives

00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:23.290
in the interstices
between their depressive episodes.

00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:27.850
And I set out to find out
what it is that causes some people

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:30.103
to be more resilient than other people.

00:08:30.127 --> 00:08:33.343
What are the mechanisms
that allow people to survive?

00:08:33.652 --> 00:08:36.850
And I went out and I interviewed
person after person

00:08:36.874 --> 00:08:38.850
who was suffering with depression.

00:08:38.874 --> 00:08:41.065
One of the first people I interviewed

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:45.943
described depression
as a slower way of being dead,

00:08:45.967 --> 00:08:48.301
and that was a good thing
for me to hear early on

00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:51.432
because it reminded me
that that slow way of being dead

00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:53.736
can lead to actual deadness,

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.717
that this is a serious business.

00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:58.130
It's the leading disability worldwide,

00:08:58.154 --> 00:09:00.236
and people die of it every day.

00:09:01.184 --> 00:09:04.903
One of the people I talked to
when I was trying to understand this

00:09:04.927 --> 00:09:08.788
was a beloved friend
who I had known for many years,

00:09:08.812 --> 00:09:13.265
and who had had a psychotic episode
in her freshman year of college,

00:09:13.289 --> 00:09:16.091
and then plummeted
into a horrific depression.

00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:17.754
She had bipolar illness,

00:09:17.778 --> 00:09:20.265
or manic depression, as it was then known.

00:09:20.289 --> 00:09:24.074
And then she did very well
for many years on lithium,

00:09:24.098 --> 00:09:27.247
and then eventually,
she was taken off her lithium

00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:29.082
to see how she would do without it,

00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:31.057
and she had another psychosis,

00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:35.441
and then plunged into the worst depression
that I had ever seen

00:09:35.465 --> 00:09:38.282
in which she sat
in her parents' apartment,

00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:41.578
more or less catatonic,
essentially without moving,

00:09:41.602 --> 00:09:43.515
day after day after day.

00:09:43.943 --> 00:09:47.427
And when I interviewed her
about that experience some years later --

00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:50.552
she's a poet and psychotherapist
named Maggie Robbins --

00:09:50.576 --> 00:09:53.622
when I interviewed her, she said,

00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:57.165
"I was singing 'Where Have
All The Flowers Gone,'

00:09:57.189 --> 00:10:00.086
over and over, to occupy my mind.

00:10:00.555 --> 00:10:03.351
I was singing to blot out
the things my mind was saying,

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:08.135
which were, 'You are nothing.
You are nobody.

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:10.090
You don't even deserve to live.'

00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:13.097
And that was
when I really started thinking

00:10:13.121 --> 00:10:14.475
about killing myself."

00:10:15.193 --> 00:10:19.103
You don't think in depression
that you've put on a gray veil

00:10:19.127 --> 00:10:22.491
and are seeing the world
through the haze of a bad mood.

00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:25.991
You think that the veil
has been taken away,

00:10:26.015 --> 00:10:27.619
the veil of happiness,

00:10:27.643 --> 00:10:29.580
and that now you're seeing truly.

00:10:30.247 --> 00:10:33.007
It's easier to help
schizophrenics who perceive

00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:37.005
that there's something foreign
inside of them that needs to be exorcised,

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:39.355
but it's difficult with depressives,

00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:42.181
because we believe
we are seeing the truth.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.585
But the truth lies.

00:10:45.987 --> 00:10:47.961
I became obsessed with that sentence:

00:10:47.985 --> 00:10:50.117
"But the truth lies."

00:10:50.435 --> 00:10:52.875
And I discovered,
as I talked to depressive people,

00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:55.471
that they have
many delusional perceptions.

00:10:55.815 --> 00:10:57.553
People will say, "No one loves me."

00:10:57.577 --> 00:10:58.789
And you say, "I love you,

00:10:58.813 --> 00:11:01.311
your wife loves you,
your mother loves you."

00:11:01.335 --> 00:11:04.696
You can answer that one pretty readily,
at least for most people.

00:11:05.124 --> 00:11:07.290
But people who are depressed
will also say,

00:11:07.314 --> 00:11:11.361
"No matter what we do,
we're all just going to die in the end."

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:13.614
Or they'll say,
"There can be no true communion

00:11:13.638 --> 00:11:15.000
between two human beings.

00:11:15.024 --> 00:11:17.408
Each of us is trapped in his own body."

00:11:17.805 --> 00:11:19.425
To which you have to say,

00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:20.928
"That's true,

00:11:20.952 --> 00:11:24.460
but I think we should focus right now
on what to have for breakfast."

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:26.645
(Laughter)

00:11:26.669 --> 00:11:28.314
A lot of the time,

00:11:28.338 --> 00:11:31.312
what they are expressing
is not illness, but insight,

00:11:31.336 --> 00:11:33.867
and one comes to think
what's really extraordinary

00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:37.023
is that most of us know
about those existential questions

00:11:37.047 --> 00:11:39.091
and they don't distract us very much.

00:11:39.428 --> 00:11:41.250
There was a study I particularly liked

00:11:41.274 --> 00:11:45.017
in which a group of depressed
and a group of non-depressed people

00:11:45.041 --> 00:11:47.765
were asked to play a video
game for an hour,

00:11:47.789 --> 00:11:49.409
and at the end of the hour,

00:11:49.433 --> 00:11:53.043
they were asked how many little monsters
they thought they had killed.

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:57.052
The depressive group was usually accurate
to within about 10 percent,

00:11:57.076 --> 00:11:58.647
and the non-depressed people

00:11:58.671 --> 00:12:03.125
guessed between 15 and 20 times
as many little monsters --

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:04.300
(Laughter)

00:12:04.324 --> 00:12:06.076
as they had actually killed.

00:12:07.945 --> 00:12:11.161
A lot of people said, when I chose
to write about my depression,

00:12:11.185 --> 00:12:14.650
that it must be very difficult
to be out of that closet,

00:12:14.674 --> 00:12:15.983
to have people know.

00:12:16.007 --> 00:12:18.276
They said, "Do people
talk to you differently?"

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.379
I said, "Yes, people
talk to me differently.

00:12:20.403 --> 00:12:22.165
They talk to me differently insofar

00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:24.856
as they start telling me
about their experience,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.691
or their sister's experience,

00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:28.356
or their friend's experience.

00:12:28.729 --> 00:12:30.927
Things are different because now I know

00:12:30.951 --> 00:12:35.056
that depression is the family secret
that everyone has.

00:12:35.715 --> 00:12:39.341
I went a few years ago to a conference,

00:12:39.365 --> 00:12:41.796
and on Friday of the three-day conference,

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.825
one of the participants
took me aside, and she said,

00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:51.098
"I suffer from depression
and I'm a little embarrassed about it,

00:12:51.122 --> 00:12:52.964
but I've been taking this medication,

00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:56.102
and I just wanted to ask you
what you think?"

00:12:56.126 --> 00:12:58.746
And so I did my best to give her
such advice as I could.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:03.257
And then she said, "You know,
my husband would never understand this.

00:13:03.281 --> 00:13:06.549
He's really the kind of guy to whom
this wouldn't make any sense,

00:13:06.573 --> 00:13:08.697
so, you know, it's just between us."

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:10.273
And I said, "Yes, that's fine."

00:13:10.733 --> 00:13:12.592
On Sunday of the same conference,

00:13:12.616 --> 00:13:14.492
her husband took me aside,

00:13:14.516 --> 00:13:15.830
(Laughter)

00:13:15.854 --> 00:13:17.615
and he said, "My wife wouldn't think

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:19.950
that I was really much
of a guy if she knew this,

00:13:19.974 --> 00:13:23.732
but I've been dealing with this depression
and I'm taking some medication,

00:13:23.756 --> 00:13:26.181
and I wondered what you think?"

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:28.495
They were hiding the same medication

00:13:28.519 --> 00:13:31.894
in two different places
in the same bedroom.

00:13:31.918 --> 00:13:33.116
(Laughter)

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.078
And I said that I thought
communication within the marriage

00:13:36.102 --> 00:13:38.150
might be triggering
some of their problems.

00:13:38.174 --> 00:13:40.666
(Laughter)

00:13:42.593 --> 00:13:44.156
But I was also struck

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.698
by the burdensome nature
of such mutual secrecy.

00:13:48.141 --> 00:13:50.002
Depression is so exhausting.

00:13:50.026 --> 00:13:52.972
It takes up so much
of your time and energy,

00:13:52.996 --> 00:13:54.527
and silence about it,

00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:56.808
it really does make the depression worse.

00:13:57.276 --> 00:13:58.485
And then I began thinking

00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:00.832
about all the ways
people make themselves better.

00:14:00.856 --> 00:14:03.317
I'd started off as a medical conservative.

00:14:03.341 --> 00:14:05.975
I thought there were a few
kinds of therapy that worked,

00:14:05.999 --> 00:14:07.444
it was clear what they were --

00:14:07.468 --> 00:14:08.968
there was medication,

00:14:08.992 --> 00:14:10.659
there were certain psychotherapies,

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:13.104
there was possibly
electroconvulsive treatment,

00:14:13.128 --> 00:14:15.717
and that everything else was nonsense.

00:14:15.741 --> 00:14:17.669
But then I discovered something.

00:14:17.693 --> 00:14:19.326
If you have brain cancer,

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.538
and you say that standing on your head
for 20 minutes every morning

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:23.715
makes you feel better,

00:14:23.739 --> 00:14:26.717
it may make you feel better,
but you still have brain cancer,

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:28.814
and you'll still probably die from it.

00:14:29.387 --> 00:14:31.673
But if you say that you have depression,

00:14:31.697 --> 00:14:34.037
and standing on your head
for 20 minutes every day

00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:36.257
makes you feel better, then it's worked,

00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:38.722
because depression
is an illness of how you feel,

00:14:38.746 --> 00:14:40.076
and if you feel better,

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.659
then you are effectively
not depressed anymore.

00:14:43.112 --> 00:14:45.199
So I became much more tolerant

00:14:45.223 --> 00:14:47.611
of the vast world
of alternative treatments.

00:14:47.936 --> 00:14:50.248
And I get letters,
I get hundreds of letters

00:14:50.272 --> 00:14:53.082
from people writing to tell me
about what's worked for them.

00:14:53.106 --> 00:14:56.671
Someone was asking me
backstage today about meditation.

00:14:56.695 --> 00:15:00.367
My favorite of the letters that I got
was the one that came from a woman

00:15:00.391 --> 00:15:03.312
who wrote and said
that she had tried therapy, medication,

00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:05.166
she had tried pretty much everything,

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:08.096
and she had found a solution
and hoped I would tell the world,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.692
and that was making
little things from yarn.

00:15:11.716 --> 00:15:14.609
(Laughter)

00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:16.169
She sent me some of them.

00:15:16.193 --> 00:15:18.223
(Laughter)

00:15:18.247 --> 00:15:20.112
And I'm not wearing them right now.

00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:21.286
(Laughter)

00:15:21.845 --> 00:15:24.336
I suggested to her
that she also should look up

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.766
obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM.

00:15:28.979 --> 00:15:31.669
And yet, when I went to look
at alternative treatments,

00:15:31.693 --> 00:15:34.121
I also gained perspective
on other treatments.

00:15:34.605 --> 00:15:37.323
I went through
a tribal exorcism in Senegal

00:15:37.347 --> 00:15:39.336
that involved a great deal of ram's blood

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.398
and that I'm not going
to detail right now,

00:15:41.422 --> 00:15:43.422
but a few years afterwards
I was in Rwanda,

00:15:43.446 --> 00:15:45.343
working on a different project,

00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:47.952
and I happened to describe
my experience to someone,

00:15:47.976 --> 00:15:49.135
and he said,

00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:51.617
"Well, that's West Africa,
and we're in East Africa,

00:15:51.641 --> 00:15:53.898
and our rituals are
in some ways very different,

00:15:53.922 --> 00:15:55.223
but we do have some rituals

00:15:55.247 --> 00:15:58.047
that have something in common
with what you're describing."

00:15:58.071 --> 00:15:59.238
And he said,

00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:02.473
"But we've had a lot of trouble
with Western mental health workers,

00:16:02.497 --> 00:16:05.115
especially the ones who came
right after the genocide."

00:16:05.139 --> 00:16:07.189
I said, "What kind
of trouble did you have?"

00:16:07.213 --> 00:16:10.965
And he said, "Well,
they would do this bizarre thing.

00:16:10.989 --> 00:16:13.037
They didn't take people out
in the sunshine

00:16:13.061 --> 00:16:14.550
where you begin to feel better.

00:16:14.574 --> 00:16:17.726
They didn't include drumming
or music to get people's blood going.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.656
They didn't involve the whole community.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.916
They didn't externalize
the depression as an invasive spirit.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.953
Instead what they did was they took people
one at a time into dingy little rooms

00:16:27.977 --> 00:16:29.358
and had them talk for an hour

00:16:29.382 --> 00:16:31.526
about bad things
that had happened to them."

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.593
(Laughter)

00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:36.986
(Applause)

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.439
He said, "We had to ask them
to leave the country."

00:16:39.463 --> 00:16:42.405
(Laughter)

00:16:42.429 --> 00:16:45.007
Now at the other end
of alternative treatments,

00:16:45.031 --> 00:16:47.126
let me tell you about Frank Russakoff.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:52.852
Frank Russakoff had the worst depression
perhaps that I've ever seen in a man.

00:16:52.876 --> 00:16:54.845
He was constantly depressed.

00:16:54.869 --> 00:16:56.314
He was, when I met him,

00:16:56.338 --> 00:17:00.144
at a point at which every month,
he would have electroshock treatment.

00:17:00.168 --> 00:17:02.719
Then he would feel
sort of disoriented for a week.

00:17:02.743 --> 00:17:04.522
Then he would feel okay for a week.

00:17:04.546 --> 00:17:06.640
Then he would have a week
of going downhill.

00:17:06.664 --> 00:17:09.254
And then he would have another
electroshock treatment.

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:10.851
And he said to me when I met him,

00:17:10.875 --> 00:17:13.240
"It's unbearable to go
through my weeks this way.

00:17:13.264 --> 00:17:14.711
I can't go on this way,

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:16.845
and I've figured out
how I'm going to end it

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.202
if I don't get better."

00:17:18.226 --> 00:17:22.328
"But," he said to me,
"I heard about a protocol at Mass General

00:17:22.352 --> 00:17:25.574
for a procedure called a cingulotomy,
which is a brain surgery,

00:17:25.598 --> 00:17:27.867
and I think I'm going to give that a try."

00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:31.184
And I remember being amazed
at that point to think that someone

00:17:31.208 --> 00:17:34.205
who clearly had so many bad experiences

00:17:34.229 --> 00:17:36.365
with so many different treatments

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.429
still had buried in him,
somewhere, enough optimism

00:17:39.453 --> 00:17:41.238
to reach out for one more.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.957
And he had the cingulotomy,
and it was incredibly successful.

00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:47.593
He's now a friend of mine.

00:17:47.617 --> 00:17:50.942
He has a lovely wife
and two beautiful children.

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:53.891
He wrote me a letter
the Christmas after the surgery,

00:17:53.915 --> 00:17:55.080
and he said,

00:17:55.104 --> 00:17:57.707
"My father sent me two presents this year,

00:17:57.731 --> 00:18:00.258
First, a motorized CD rack
from The Sharper Image

00:18:00.282 --> 00:18:01.680
that I didn't really need,

00:18:01.704 --> 00:18:03.941
but I knew he was giving it
to me to celebrate

00:18:03.965 --> 00:18:07.214
the fact that I'm living on my own
and have a job I seem to love.

00:18:07.635 --> 00:18:10.876
And the other present
was a photo of my grandmother,

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.376
who committed suicide.

00:18:12.955 --> 00:18:15.860
As I unwrapped it, I began to cry,

00:18:15.884 --> 00:18:17.741
and my mother came over and said,

00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:20.757
'Are you crying because
of the relatives you never knew?'

00:18:21.162 --> 00:18:24.710
And I said, 'She had
the same disease I have.'

00:18:25.242 --> 00:18:27.854
I'm crying now as I write to you.

00:18:27.878 --> 00:18:31.165
It's not that I'm so sad,
but I get overwhelmed,

00:18:31.189 --> 00:18:33.386
I think, because I could
have killed myself,

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.838
but my parents kept me going,
and so did the doctors,

00:18:36.862 --> 00:18:38.692
and I had the surgery.

00:18:38.716 --> 00:18:40.798
I'm alive and grateful.

00:18:41.531 --> 00:18:46.132
We live in the right time,
even if it doesn't always feel like it."

00:18:47.856 --> 00:18:49.775
I was struck by the fact that depression

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:54.805
is broadly perceived to be
a modern, Western, middle-class thing,

00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:58.960
and I went to look at how it operated
in a variety of other contexts,

00:18:58.984 --> 00:19:01.175
and one of the things
I was most interested in

00:19:01.199 --> 00:19:03.114
was depression among the indigent.

00:19:03.138 --> 00:19:04.686
And so I went out to try to look

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.463
at what was being done
for poor people with depression.

00:19:07.487 --> 00:19:09.614
And what I discovered is that poor people

00:19:09.638 --> 00:19:12.166
are mostly not being
treated for depression.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.864
Depression is the result
of a genetic vulnerability,

00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:18.238
which is presumably
evenly distributed in the population,

00:19:18.262 --> 00:19:19.975
and triggering circumstances,

00:19:19.999 --> 00:19:23.753
which are likely to be more severe
for people who are impoverished.

00:19:23.777 --> 00:19:27.280
And yet it turns out that if you have
a really lovely life

00:19:27.304 --> 00:19:28.886
but feel miserable all the time,

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.696
you think, "Why do I feel like this?

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.989
I must have depression."

00:19:32.013 --> 00:19:34.149
And you set out to find treatment for it.

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:36.105
But if you have a perfectly awful life,

00:19:36.129 --> 00:19:37.872
and you feel miserable all the time,

00:19:37.896 --> 00:19:40.906
the way you feel
is commensurate with your life,

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.785
and it doesn't occur to you to think,

00:19:42.809 --> 00:19:44.346
"Maybe this is treatable."

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.572
And so we have an epidemic in this country

00:19:47.596 --> 00:19:50.254
of depression among impoverished people

00:19:50.278 --> 00:19:52.850
that's not being picked up
and that's not being treated

00:19:52.874 --> 00:19:54.822
and that's not being addressed,

00:19:54.846 --> 00:19:56.917
and it's a tragedy of a grand order.

00:19:57.219 --> 00:19:58.819
And so I found an academic

00:19:58.843 --> 00:20:02.068
who was doing a research project
in slums outside of D.C.,

00:20:02.092 --> 00:20:05.235
where she picked up women
who had come in for other health problems

00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:07.014
and diagnosed them with depression,

00:20:07.038 --> 00:20:10.110
and then provided six months
of the experimental protocol.

00:20:10.134 --> 00:20:12.439
One of them, Lolly, came in,

00:20:12.463 --> 00:20:14.736
and this is what she said
the day she came in.

00:20:15.069 --> 00:20:19.634
She said, and she was a woman,
by the way, who had seven children.

00:20:19.658 --> 00:20:22.443
She said, "I used to have a job
but I had to give it up

00:20:22.467 --> 00:20:24.682
because I couldn't go out of the house.

00:20:25.134 --> 00:20:27.074
I have nothing to say to my children.

00:20:27.447 --> 00:20:29.929
In the morning,
I can't wait for them to leave,

00:20:29.953 --> 00:20:33.155
and then I climb in bed
and pull the covers over my head,

00:20:33.179 --> 00:20:35.054
and three o'clock when they come home,

00:20:35.078 --> 00:20:36.520
it just comes so fast."

00:20:36.544 --> 00:20:38.838
She said, "I've been taking
a lot of Tylenol,

00:20:38.862 --> 00:20:41.365
anything I can take
so that I can sleep more.

00:20:41.389 --> 00:20:45.386
My husband has been telling me
I'm stupid, I'm ugly.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.164
I wish I could stop the pain."

00:20:48.935 --> 00:20:51.531
Well, she was brought
into this experimental protocol,

00:20:51.555 --> 00:20:53.746
and when I interviewed her
six months later,

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.995
she had taken a job working in childcare

00:20:58.019 --> 00:21:02.069
for the U.S. Navy,
she had left the abusive husband,

00:21:02.093 --> 00:21:04.116
and she said to me,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.395
"My kids are so much happier now."

00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:09.101
She said, "There's one room
in my new place for the boys

00:21:09.125 --> 00:21:11.012
and one room for the girls,

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:13.375
but at night, they're just
all up on my bed,

00:21:13.399 --> 00:21:15.987
and we're doing homework
all together and everything.

00:21:16.011 --> 00:21:17.685
One of them wants to be a preacher,

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.602
one of them wants to be a firefighter,

00:21:19.626 --> 00:21:22.326
and one of the girls says
she's going to be a lawyer.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.554
They don't cry like they used to,

00:21:24.578 --> 00:21:26.388
and they don't fight like they did.

00:21:27.144 --> 00:21:29.969
That's all I need now, is my kids.

00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:32.771
Things keep on changing,

00:21:32.795 --> 00:21:37.171
the way I dress,
the way I feel, the way I act.

00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:41.710
I can go outside not being afraid anymore,

00:21:41.734 --> 00:21:45.222
and I don't think
those bad feelings are coming back,

00:21:45.246 --> 00:21:48.182
and if it weren't
for Dr. Miranda and that,

00:21:48.206 --> 00:21:51.728
I would still be at home
with the covers pulled over my head,

00:21:51.752 --> 00:21:53.605
if I were still alive at all.

00:21:54.097 --> 00:21:57.603
I asked the Lord to send me an angel,

00:21:57.627 --> 00:21:59.404
and He heard my prayers."

00:22:02.308 --> 00:22:05.288
I was really moved by these experiences,

00:22:05.312 --> 00:22:07.827
and I decided that I wanted
to write about them

00:22:07.851 --> 00:22:10.668
not only in a book I was working on,
but also in an article,

00:22:10.692 --> 00:22:13.271
and I got a commission
from The New York Times Magazine

00:22:13.295 --> 00:22:15.414
to write about depression
among the indigent.

00:22:15.438 --> 00:22:16.675
And I turned in my story,

00:22:16.699 --> 00:22:20.159
and my editor called me and said,
"We really can't publish this."

00:22:20.668 --> 00:22:21.827
And I said, "Why not?"

00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:23.922
And she said, "It just is too far-fetched.

00:22:23.946 --> 00:22:27.609
These people who are sort of
at the very bottom rung of society

00:22:27.633 --> 00:22:29.648
and then they get
a few months of treatment

00:22:29.672 --> 00:22:32.045
and they're virtually ready
to run Morgan Stanley?

00:22:32.069 --> 00:22:33.585
It's just too implausible."

00:22:34.013 --> 00:22:36.594
She said, "I've never even heard
of anything like it."

00:22:36.618 --> 00:22:39.071
And I said, "The fact
that you've never heard of it

00:22:39.095 --> 00:22:41.198
is an indication that it is news."

00:22:41.907 --> 00:22:45.930
(Laughter)

00:22:45.954 --> 00:22:49.293
(Applause)

00:22:49.317 --> 00:22:51.434
"And you are a news magazine."

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:55.010
So after a certain amount of negotiation,
they agreed to it.

00:22:55.034 --> 00:22:58.920
But I think a lot of what they said
was connected in some strange way

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:02.525
to this distaste that people still have
for the idea of treatment,

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:04.407
the notion that somehow if we went out

00:23:04.431 --> 00:23:07.254
and treated a lot of people
in indigent communities,

00:23:07.278 --> 00:23:09.134
that would be exploitative,

00:23:09.158 --> 00:23:10.856
because we would be changing them.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.687
There is this false moral imperative
that seems to be all around us,

00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:16.819
that treatment of depression,

00:23:16.843 --> 00:23:19.118
the medications and so on,
are an artifice,

00:23:19.142 --> 00:23:21.465
and that it's not natural.

00:23:21.489 --> 00:23:24.432
And I think that's very misguided.

00:23:24.456 --> 00:23:27.789
It would be natural
for people's teeth to fall out,

00:23:27.813 --> 00:23:31.001
but there is nobody militating
against toothpaste,

00:23:31.025 --> 00:23:32.495
at least not in my circles.

00:23:33.915 --> 00:23:35.159
People then say,

00:23:35.183 --> 00:23:38.444
"But isn't depression part of what people
are supposed to experience?

00:23:38.468 --> 00:23:40.200
Didn't we evolve to have depression?

00:23:40.224 --> 00:23:41.975
Isn't it part of your personality?"

00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:44.438
To which I would say, mood is adaptive.

00:23:44.462 --> 00:23:47.539
Being able to have sadness and fear

00:23:47.563 --> 00:23:49.469
and joy and pleasure

00:23:49.493 --> 00:23:53.248
and all of the other moods that we have,
that's incredibly valuable.

00:23:53.272 --> 00:23:55.186
And major depression

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:58.572
is something that happens
when that system gets broken.

00:23:58.596 --> 00:24:00.200
It's maladaptive.

00:24:00.224 --> 00:24:01.839
People will come to me and say,

00:24:01.863 --> 00:24:04.665
"I think, though, if I just
stick it out for another year,

00:24:04.689 --> 00:24:06.542
I think I can just get through this."

00:24:06.566 --> 00:24:09.090
And I always say to them,
"You may get through it,

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:11.304
but you'll never be 37 again.

00:24:11.733 --> 00:24:15.442
Life is short, and that's a whole year
you're talking about giving up.

00:24:15.982 --> 00:24:17.133
Think it through."

00:24:17.694 --> 00:24:20.342
It's a strange poverty
of the English language,

00:24:20.366 --> 00:24:22.450
and indeed of many other languages,

00:24:22.474 --> 00:24:24.844
that we use this same word, depression,

00:24:24.868 --> 00:24:28.582
to describe how a kid feels
when it rains on his birthday,

00:24:28.606 --> 00:24:32.965
and to describe how somebody feels
the minute before they commit suicide.

00:24:33.495 --> 00:24:36.501
People say to me, "Well, is it
continuous with normal sadness?"

00:24:36.525 --> 00:24:39.632
And I say, in a way it's continuous
with normal sadness.

00:24:39.656 --> 00:24:41.830
There is a certain amount of continuity,

00:24:41.854 --> 00:24:43.791
but it's the same way there's continuity

00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:46.021
between having an iron fence
outside your house

00:24:46.045 --> 00:24:47.465
that gets a little rust spot

00:24:47.489 --> 00:24:50.087
that you have to sand off
and do a little repainting,

00:24:50.111 --> 00:24:52.939
and what happens if you leave
the house for 100 years

00:24:52.963 --> 00:24:56.762
and it rusts through
until it's only a pile of orange dust.

00:24:57.082 --> 00:24:58.935
And it's that orange dust spot,

00:24:58.959 --> 00:25:00.724
that orange dust problem,

00:25:00.748 --> 00:25:03.334
that's the one
we're setting out to address.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.254
So now people say,

00:25:06.278 --> 00:25:08.957
"You take these happy pills,
and do you feel happy?"

00:25:08.981 --> 00:25:10.171
And I don't.

00:25:10.594 --> 00:25:13.562
But I don't feel sad
about having to eat lunch,

00:25:13.586 --> 00:25:16.427
and I don't feel sad
about my answering machine,

00:25:16.451 --> 00:25:18.649
and I don't feel sad
about taking a shower.

00:25:19.324 --> 00:25:21.927
I feel more, in fact, I think,

00:25:21.951 --> 00:25:24.357
because I can feel
sadness without nullity.

00:25:24.704 --> 00:25:28.910
I feel sad about professional
disappointments,

00:25:28.934 --> 00:25:31.218
about damaged relationships,

00:25:31.242 --> 00:25:32.759
about global warming.

00:25:33.114 --> 00:25:35.815
Those are the things
that I feel sad about now.

00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:38.549
And I said to myself, well,
what is the conclusion?

00:25:38.573 --> 00:25:41.110
How did those people who have better lives

00:25:41.134 --> 00:25:43.664
even with bigger depression
manage to get through?

00:25:43.964 --> 00:25:46.115
What is the mechanism of resilience?

00:25:46.583 --> 00:25:48.545
And what I came up with over time

00:25:48.569 --> 00:25:51.395
was that the people
who deny their experience,

00:25:51.419 --> 00:25:53.435
and say, "I was depressed a long time ago,

00:25:53.459 --> 00:25:55.230
I never want to think about it again,

00:25:55.254 --> 00:25:56.548
I'm not going to look at it

00:25:56.572 --> 00:25:58.595
and I'm just going
to get on with my life,"

00:25:58.619 --> 00:26:03.217
ironically, those are the people
who are most enslaved by what they have.

00:26:03.241 --> 00:26:05.439
Shutting out the depression
strengthens it.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.470
While you hide from it, it grows.

00:26:09.185 --> 00:26:11.723
And the people who do better

00:26:11.747 --> 00:26:16.300
are the ones who are able to tolerate
the fact that they have this condition.

00:26:16.324 --> 00:26:20.196
Those who can tolerate their depression
are the ones who achieve resilience.

00:26:20.516 --> 00:26:22.128
So Frank Russakoff said to me,

00:26:22.152 --> 00:26:25.874
"If I had a do-over,
I suppose I wouldn't do it this way,

00:26:25.898 --> 00:26:29.366
but in a strange way,
I'm grateful for what I've experienced.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.714
I'm glad to have been
in the hospital 40 times.

00:26:33.023 --> 00:26:35.634
It taught me so much about love,

00:26:35.658 --> 00:26:38.579
and my relationship
with my parents and my doctors

00:26:38.603 --> 00:26:42.149
has been so precious to me,
and will be always."

00:26:42.772 --> 00:26:44.674
And Maggie Robbins said,

00:26:44.698 --> 00:26:47.663
"I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic,

00:26:47.687 --> 00:26:50.677
and I would just talk and talk and talk,

00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:54.734
and the people I was dealing with
weren't very responsive, and I thought,

00:26:54.758 --> 00:26:57.254
'That's not very friendly
or helpful of them.'"

00:26:57.278 --> 00:26:58.518
(Laughter)

00:26:58.542 --> 00:27:00.160
"And then I realized,

00:27:00.184 --> 00:27:02.327
I realized that
they weren't going to do more

00:27:02.351 --> 00:27:04.834
than make those first
few minutes of small talk.

00:27:04.858 --> 00:27:06.897
It was simply going to be an occasion

00:27:06.921 --> 00:27:09.870
where I didn't have AIDS
and I wasn't dying,

00:27:09.894 --> 00:27:12.772
but could tolerate the fact that they did

00:27:12.796 --> 00:27:14.011
and they were.

00:27:14.503 --> 00:27:17.646
Our needs are our greatest assets.

00:27:18.202 --> 00:27:22.367
It turns out I've learned to give
all the things I need."

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.021
Valuing one's depression
does not prevent a relapse,

00:27:28.045 --> 00:27:30.682
but it may make the prospect of relapse

00:27:30.706 --> 00:27:34.219
and even relapse itself
easier to tolerate.

00:27:35.004 --> 00:27:38.662
The question is not so much
of finding great meaning

00:27:38.686 --> 00:27:41.257
and deciding your depression
has been very meaningful.

00:27:41.281 --> 00:27:45.272
It's of seeking that meaning
and thinking, when it comes again,

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:48.613
"This will be hellish,
but I will learn something from it."

00:27:49.487 --> 00:27:51.727
I have learned in my own depression

00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:53.949
how big an emotion can be,

00:27:53.973 --> 00:27:57.033
how it can be more real than facts,

00:27:57.057 --> 00:27:59.786
and I have found that that experience

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.678
has allowed me to experience
positive emotion

00:28:02.702 --> 00:28:05.601
in a more intense and more focused way.

00:28:06.222 --> 00:28:09.805
The opposite of depression
is not happiness,

00:28:09.829 --> 00:28:11.139
but vitality,

00:28:11.163 --> 00:28:14.118
and these days, my life is vital,

00:28:14.142 --> 00:28:16.434
even on the days when I'm sad.

00:28:16.823 --> 00:28:19.938
I felt that funeral in my brain,

00:28:19.962 --> 00:28:24.502
and I sat next to the colossus
at the edge of the world,

00:28:24.526 --> 00:28:28.413
and I have discovered
something inside of myself

00:28:28.437 --> 00:28:30.501
that I would have to call a soul

00:28:30.525 --> 00:28:34.038
that I had never formulated
until that day 20 years ago

00:28:34.062 --> 00:28:37.363
when hell came to pay me a surprise visit.

00:28:38.841 --> 00:28:42.654
I think that while I hated being depressed

00:28:42.678 --> 00:28:45.180
and would hate to be depressed again,

00:28:45.204 --> 00:28:47.267
I've found a way to love my depression.

00:28:47.894 --> 00:28:52.077
I love it because it has forced me
to find and cling to joy.

00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:56.270
I love it because each day I decide,

00:28:56.294 --> 00:28:57.683
sometimes gamely,

00:28:57.707 --> 00:29:00.252
and sometimes against the moment's reason,

00:29:00.276 --> 00:29:02.415
to cleave to the reasons for living.

00:29:02.978 --> 00:29:06.655
And that, I think,
is a highly privileged rapture.

00:29:07.076 --> 00:29:08.332
Thank you.

00:29:08.356 --> 00:29:12.357
(Applause)

00:29:12.381 --> 00:29:13.532
Thank you.

00:29:13.556 --> 00:29:15.928
(Applause)
