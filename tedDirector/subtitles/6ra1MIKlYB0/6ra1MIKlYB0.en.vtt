00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.570
When my first children's book was published

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.293
in 2001,

00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:18.506
I returned to my old elementary school

00:00:18.506 --> 00:00:20.446
to talk to the students about being an author

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:22.162
and an illustrator,

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:24.895
and when I was setting up my slide projector

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:28.100
in the cafetorium,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.148
I looked across the room,

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:32.759
and there she was:

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.603
my old lunch lady.

00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:36.570
She was still there at the school

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.456
and she was busily preparing lunches for the day.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.100
So I approached her to say hello,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.987
and I said, "Hi, Jeannie! How are you?"

00:00:42.987 --> 00:00:44.557
And she looked at me, and I could tell

00:00:44.557 --> 00:00:46.284
that she recognized me,

00:00:46.284 --> 00:00:49.369
but she couldn't quite place me,
and she looked at me and she said,

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:52.130
"Stephen Krosoczka?"

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.272
And I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka,

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:57.703
but Stephen is my uncle who
is 20 years older than I am,

00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:00.840
and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.345
And she started telling me about her grandkids,

00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:06.050
and that blew my mind.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.844
My lunch lady had grandkids,

00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:08.808
and therefore kids,

00:01:08.808 --> 00:01:12.063
and therefore left school at the end of the day?

00:01:12.063 --> 00:01:13.806
I thought she lived in the cafeteria

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:14.679
with the serving spoons.

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:16.622
I had never thought about any of that before.

00:01:16.622 --> 00:01:20.354
Well, that chance encounter inspired my imagination,

00:01:20.354 --> 00:01:23.905
and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series,

00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:26.082
a series of comics about a lunch lady

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:28.680
who uses her fish stick nunchucks

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.582
to fight off evil cyborg substitutes,

00:01:31.582 --> 00:01:34.889
a school bus monster, and mutant mathletes,

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:36.356
and the end of every book,

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:37.862
they get the bad guy with their hairnet,

00:01:37.862 --> 00:01:41.616
and they proclaim, "Justice is served!"

00:01:41.616 --> 00:01:45.869
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.476
And it's been amazing, because the series

00:01:48.476 --> 00:01:51.369
was so welcomed into the reading lives of children,

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.608
and they sent me the most amazing letters

00:01:53.608 --> 00:01:55.765
and cards and artwork.

00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:58.239
And I would notice as I would visit schools,

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.793
the lunch staff would be involved in the programming

00:02:00.793 --> 00:02:02.939
in a very meaningful way.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.685
And coast to coast,

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:06.780
all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing:

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.675
"Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness."

00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:13.444
Because the lunch lady has not been treated

00:02:13.444 --> 00:02:16.966
very kindly in popular culture over time.

00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:19.138
But it meant the most to Jeannie.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.828
When the books were first published,

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:22.932
I invited her to the book launch party,

00:02:22.932 --> 00:02:24.743
and in front of everyone there,

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:26.040
everyone she had fed over the years,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.980
I gave her a piece of artwork and some books.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.549
And two years after this photo was taken,

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.360
she passed away,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.447
and I attended her wake,

00:02:34.447 --> 00:02:37.286
and nothing could have prepared
me for what I saw there,

00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:40.774
because next to her casket was this painting,

00:02:40.774 --> 00:02:44.340
and her husband told me it meant so much to her

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.758
that I had acknowledged her hard work,

00:02:46.758 --> 00:02:49.624
I had validated what she did.

00:02:49.624 --> 00:02:51.516
And that inspired me to create a day

00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:53.766
where we could recreate that feeling

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:56.781
in cafeterias across the country:

00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:58.434
School Lunch Hero Day, a day where kids

00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:01.292
can make creative projects for their lunch staff.

00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:03.496
And I partnered with the
School Nutrition Association,

00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:06.624
and did you know that a little over 30 million kids

00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:08.446
participate in school lunch programs every day.

00:03:08.446 --> 00:03:11.798
That equals up to a little over five billion lunches

00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:13.305
made every school year.

00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:15.691
And the stories of heroism go well beyond

00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:17.678
just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets

00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:18.843
on their lunch tray.

00:03:18.843 --> 00:03:20.552
There is Ms. Brenda in California,

00:03:20.552 --> 00:03:23.341
who keeps a close eye on every
student that comes through her line

00:03:23.341 --> 00:03:25.826
and then reports back to the guidance counselor

00:03:25.826 --> 00:03:27.176
if anything is amiss.

00:03:27.176 --> 00:03:28.600
There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.235
who realized that 67 percent of their students

00:03:31.235 --> 00:03:33.208
relied on those meals every day,

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:35.324
and they were going without food over the summer,

00:03:35.324 --> 00:03:37.348
so they retrofitted a school bus

00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:39.100
to create a mobile feeding unit,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.335
and they traveled around the neighborhoods

00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:43.134
feedings 500 kids a day during the summer.

00:03:43.134 --> 00:03:45.729
And kids made the most amazing projects.

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:46.779
I knew they would.

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:48.391
Kids made hamburger cards

00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:50.385
that were made out of construction paper.

00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:52.286
They took photos of their lunch lady's head

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:54.094
and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady

00:03:54.094 --> 00:03:55.887
and fixed that to a milk carton

00:03:55.887 --> 00:03:58.373
and presented them with flowers.

00:03:58.373 --> 00:04:00.376
And they made their own comics,

00:04:00.376 --> 00:04:01.737
starring the cartoon lunch lady

00:04:01.737 --> 00:04:03.960
alongside their actual lunch ladies.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.896
And they made thank you pizzas,

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:07.811
where every kid signed a different topping

00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:10.770
of a construction paper pizza.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.370
For me, I was so moved by the response

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.349
that came from the lunch ladies,

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.228
because one woman said to me, she said,

00:04:18.228 --> 00:04:20.763
"Before this day, I felt like I was

00:04:20.763 --> 00:04:23.200
at the end of the planet at this school.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.575
I didn't think that anyone noticed us down here."

00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:27.442
Another woman said to me,

00:04:27.442 --> 00:04:29.990
"You know, what I got out of this

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.944
is that what I do is important."

00:04:32.944 --> 00:04:35.284
And of course what she does is important.

00:04:35.284 --> 00:04:37.388
What they all do is important.

00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:40.777
They're feeding our children every single day,

00:04:40.777 --> 00:04:43.236
and before a child can learn,

00:04:43.236 --> 00:04:45.766
their belly needs to be full,

00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:47.544
and these women and men

00:04:47.544 --> 00:04:49.467
are working on the front lines to create

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:51.670
an educated society.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.440
So I hope that

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.341
you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day

00:04:56.341 --> 00:04:58.376
to say thank you to your lunch staff,

00:04:58.376 --> 00:05:00.424
and I hope that you remember

00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:03.270
how powerful a thank you can be.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.265
A thank you can change a life.

00:05:05.265 --> 00:05:08.467
It changes the life of the person who receives it,

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:10.751
and it changes the life of the person

00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:12.377
who expresses it.

00:05:12.377 --> 00:05:14.733
Thank you.

00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:18.733
(Applause)
