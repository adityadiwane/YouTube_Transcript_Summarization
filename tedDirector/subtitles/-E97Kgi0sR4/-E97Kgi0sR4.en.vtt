00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.362
I study the future

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:22.647
of crime and terrorism,

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:25.007
and frankly, I'm afraid.

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:26.969
I'm afraid by what I see.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.114
I sincerely want to believe

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:31.906
that technology can bring us

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.963
the techno-utopia that we've been promised,

00:00:34.963 --> 00:00:36.699
but, you see,

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.812
I've spent a career in law enforcement,

00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:42.585
and that's informed my perspective on things.

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:44.218
I've been a street police officer,

00:00:44.218 --> 00:00:46.289
an undercover investigator,

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.297
a counter-terrorism strategist,

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:50.522
and I've worked in more than 70 countries

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:51.988
around the world.

00:00:51.988 --> 00:00:53.644
I've had to see more than my fair share

00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:56.889
of violence and the darker underbelly of society,

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:01.350
and that's informed my opinions.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.937
My work with criminals and terrorists

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:05.057
has actually been highly educational.

00:01:05.057 --> 00:01:07.766
They have taught me a lot, and I'd like to be able

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:11.665
to share some of these observations with you.

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.984
Today I'm going to show you the flip side

00:01:13.984 --> 00:01:17.999
of all those technologies that we marvel at,

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:19.862
the ones that we love.

00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:21.728
In the hands of the TED community,

00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:24.641
these are awesome tools which will bring about

00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:28.100
great change for our world,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.826
but in the hands of suicide bombers,

00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:34.262
the future can look quite different.

00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:36.415
I started observing

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:38.311
technology and how criminals were using it

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.302
as a young patrol officer.

00:01:40.302 --> 00:01:44.758
In those days, this was the height of technology.

00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:46.327
Laugh though you will,

00:01:46.327 --> 00:01:47.622
all the drug dealers and gang members

00:01:47.622 --> 00:01:49.823
with whom I dealt had one of these

00:01:49.823 --> 00:01:54.114
long before any police officer I knew did.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.974
Twenty years later, criminals are still using

00:01:56.974 --> 00:02:00.857
mobile phones, but they're also building

00:02:00.857 --> 00:02:03.206
their own mobile phone networks,

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:05.438
like this one, which has been deployed

00:02:05.438 --> 00:02:09.238
in all 31 states of Mexico by the narcos.

00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:11.374
They have a national encrypted

00:02:11.374 --> 00:02:14.583
radio communications system.

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:16.693
Think about that.

00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:20.075
Think about the innovation that went into that.

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:22.972
Think about the infrastructure to build it.

00:02:22.972 --> 00:02:24.377
And then think about this:

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:28.427
Why can't I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco? (Laughter)

00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:33.514
How is this possible? (Laughter) It makes no sense. (Applause)

00:02:33.514 --> 00:02:34.872
We consistently underestimate

00:02:34.872 --> 00:02:38.176
what criminals and terrorists can do.

00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:39.784
Technology has made our world

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:41.864
increasingly open, and for the most part,

00:02:41.864 --> 00:02:44.217
that's great, but all of this openness

00:02:44.217 --> 00:02:46.262
may have unintended consequences.

00:02:46.262 --> 00:02:50.978
Consider the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai.

00:02:50.978 --> 00:02:54.136
The men that carried that attack out were armed

00:02:54.136 --> 00:02:57.606
with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades.

00:02:57.606 --> 00:02:59.438
They threw these hand grenades

00:02:59.438 --> 00:03:02.638
at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes

00:03:02.638 --> 00:03:07.491
and waited to catch trains on their way home from work.

00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:10.844
But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations.

00:03:10.844 --> 00:03:13.248
Guns and bombs are nothing new.

00:03:13.248 --> 00:03:14.484
What was different this time

00:03:14.484 --> 00:03:17.172
is the way that the terrorists used

00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:19.908
modern information communications technologies

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:25.264
to locate additional victims and slaughter them.

00:03:25.264 --> 00:03:27.477
They were armed with mobile phones.

00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:29.076
They had BlackBerries.

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:31.313
They had access to satellite imagery.

00:03:31.313 --> 00:03:36.278
They had satellite phones, and they even had night vision goggles.

00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:39.265
But perhaps their greatest innovation was this.

00:03:39.265 --> 00:03:41.353
We've all seen pictures like this

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:44.709
on television and in the news. This is an operations center.

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.136
And the terrorists built their very own op center

00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:50.567
across the border in Pakistan,

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:51.848
where they monitored the BBC,

00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:56.438
al Jazeera, CNN and Indian local stations.

00:03:56.438 --> 00:04:01.466
They also monitored the Internet and social media

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:03.588
to monitor the progress of their attacks

00:04:03.588 --> 00:04:05.958
and how many people they had killed.

00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.026
They did all of this in real time.

00:04:09.026 --> 00:04:12.364
The innovation of the terrorist operations center

00:04:12.364 --> 00:04:16.338
gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness

00:04:16.338 --> 00:04:18.564
and tactical advantage over the police

00:04:18.564 --> 00:04:21.207
and over the government.

00:04:21.207 --> 00:04:22.472
What did they do with this?

00:04:22.472 --> 00:04:24.448
They used it to great effect.

00:04:24.448 --> 00:04:26.497
At one point during the 60-hour siege,

00:04:26.497 --> 00:04:28.160
the terrorists were going room to room

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.221
trying to find additional victims.

00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:32.872
They came upon a suite on the top floor

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:34.777
of the hotel, and they kicked down the door

00:04:34.777 --> 00:04:37.664
and they found a man hiding by his bed.

00:04:37.664 --> 00:04:39.691
And they said to him, "Who are you,

00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:41.080
and what are you doing here?"

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.800
And the man replied,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.474
"I'm just an innocent schoolteacher."

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:48.638
Of course, the terrorists knew

00:04:48.638 --> 00:04:52.483
that no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj.

00:04:52.483 --> 00:04:54.075
They picked up his identification,

00:04:54.075 --> 00:04:57.598
and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room,

00:04:57.598 --> 00:05:00.422
where the terrorist war room Googled him,

00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:03.063
and found a picture and called their operatives

00:05:03.063 --> 00:05:04.256
on the ground and said,

00:05:04.256 --> 00:05:08.935
"Your hostage, is he heavyset?

00:05:08.935 --> 00:05:13.413
Is he bald in front? Does he wear glasses?"

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:18.019
"Yes, yes, yes," came the answers.

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:20.006
The op center had found him and they had a match.

00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:21.373
He was not a schoolteacher.

00:05:21.373 --> 00:05:25.247
He was the second-wealthiest businessman in India,

00:05:25.247 --> 00:05:26.892
and after discovering this information,

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:29.947
the terrorist war room gave the order

00:05:29.947 --> 00:05:32.573
to the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai.

00:05:32.573 --> 00:05:35.699
("Kill him.")

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.140
We all worry about our privacy settings

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.876
on Facebook,

00:05:40.876 --> 00:05:43.301
but the fact of the matter is,

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:46.763
our openness can be used against us.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.669
Terrorists are doing this.

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.175
A search engine can determine

00:05:52.175 --> 00:05:56.130
who shall live and who shall die.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.159
This is the world that we live in.

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.728
During the Mumbai siege,

00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:03.354
terrorists were so dependent on technology

00:06:03.354 --> 00:06:05.600
that several witnesses reported that

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.479
as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand,

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.855
they were checking their mobile phone messages

00:06:10.855 --> 00:06:13.310
in the very other hand.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.460
In the end, 300 people were gravely wounded

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.365
and over 172 men, women and children

00:06:20.365 --> 00:06:24.716
lost their lives that day.

00:06:24.716 --> 00:06:26.481
Think about what happened.

00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.492
During this 60-hour siege on Mumbai,

00:06:29.492 --> 00:06:33.907
10 men armed not just with weapons,

00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:35.801
but with technology,

00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:39.331
were able to bring a city of 20 million people

00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:41.493
to a standstill.

00:06:41.493 --> 00:06:43.463
Ten people brought 20 million people

00:06:43.463 --> 00:06:47.657
to a standstill, and this traveled around the world.

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:53.967
This is what radicals can do with openness.

00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:56.485
This was done nearly four years ago.

00:06:56.485 --> 00:06:58.026
What could terrorists do today

00:06:58.026 --> 00:07:00.939
with the technologies available that we have?

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:04.274
What will they do tomorrow?

00:07:04.274 --> 00:07:06.653
The ability of one to affect many

00:07:06.653 --> 00:07:09.069
is scaling exponentially,

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:13.350
and it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.604
It's not just about terrorism, though.

00:07:15.604 --> 00:07:17.914
There's also been a big paradigm shift in crime.

00:07:17.914 --> 00:07:22.207
You see, you can now commit more crime as well.

00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:24.487
In the old days, it was a knife and a gun.

00:07:24.487 --> 00:07:26.879
Then criminals moved to robbing trains.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:30.506
You could rob 200 people on a train, a great innovation.

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:32.220
Moving forward, the Internet

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.388
allowed things to scale even more.

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:35.940
In fact, many of you will remember

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.676
the recent Sony PlayStation hack.

00:07:37.676 --> 00:07:44.173
In that incident, over 100 million people were robbed.

00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:45.899
Think about that.

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:47.365
When in the history of humanity

00:07:47.365 --> 00:07:49.567
has it ever been possible for one person

00:07:49.567 --> 00:07:54.966
to rob 100 million?

00:07:54.966 --> 00:07:56.765
Of course, it's not just about stealing things.

00:07:56.765 --> 00:07:59.052
There are other avenues of technology

00:07:59.052 --> 00:08:00.497
that criminals can exploit.

00:08:00.497 --> 00:08:03.789
Many of you will remember this super cute video

00:08:03.789 --> 00:08:06.181
from the last TED,

00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:11.251
but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute.

00:08:11.251 --> 00:08:13.398
They don't all have drumsticks.

00:08:13.398 --> 00:08:15.256
Some can be armed with HD cameras

00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:17.759
and do countersurveillance on protesters,

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:20.655
or, as in this little bit of movie magic,

00:08:20.655 --> 00:08:24.358
quadcopters can be loaded with firearms

00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:27.916
and automatic weapons.

00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:30.629
Little robots are cute when they play music to you.

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:33.397
When they swarm and chase you down the block

00:08:33.397 --> 00:08:37.029
to shoot you, a little bit less so.

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:39.078
Of course, criminals and terrorists weren't the first

00:08:39.078 --> 00:08:41.916
to give guns to robots. We know where that started.

00:08:41.916 --> 00:08:43.252
But they're adapting quickly.

00:08:43.252 --> 00:08:45.232
Recently, the FBI arrested

00:08:45.232 --> 00:08:47.039
an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States,

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:48.960
who was planning on using these remote-controlled

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.887
drone aircraft to fly C4 explosives

00:08:51.887 --> 00:08:54.496
into government buildings in the United States.

00:08:54.496 --> 00:08:59.883
By the way, these travel at over 600 miles an hour.

00:08:59.883 --> 00:09:02.257
Every time a new technology is being introduced,

00:09:02.257 --> 00:09:04.898
criminals are there to exploit it.

00:09:04.898 --> 00:09:06.345
We've all seen 3D printers.

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.777
We know with them that you can print

00:09:07.777 --> 00:09:10.609
in many materials ranging from plastic

00:09:10.609 --> 00:09:14.974
to chocolate to metal and even concrete.

00:09:14.974 --> 00:09:16.360
With great precision

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.419
I actually was able to make this

00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:19.968
just the other day, a very cute little ducky.

00:09:25.343 --> 00:09:27.187
But I wonder to myself,

00:09:27.187 --> 00:09:34.100
for those people that strap bombs to their chests

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.181
and blow themselves up,

00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:38.938
how might they use 3D printers?

00:09:38.938 --> 00:09:43.051
Perhaps like this.

00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:45.244
You see, if you can print in metal,

00:09:45.244 --> 00:09:48.591
you can print one of these,

00:09:48.591 --> 00:09:51.058
and in fact

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.993
you can also print one of these too.

00:10:00.793 --> 00:10:05.344
The UK I know has some very strict firearms laws.

00:10:05.344 --> 00:10:07.465
You needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore.

00:10:07.465 --> 00:10:09.120
You just bring the 3D printer

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.955
and print the gun while you're here,

00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:15.060
and, of course, the magazines for your bullets.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.596
But as these get bigger in the future,

00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:18.741
what other items will you be able to print?

00:10:18.741 --> 00:10:22.029
The technologies are allowing bigger printers.

00:10:22.029 --> 00:10:23.377
As we move forward,

00:10:23.377 --> 00:10:26.069
we'll see new technologies also, like the Internet of Things.

00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:28.100
Every day we're connecting more and more of our lives

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.693
to the Internet, which means

00:10:30.693 --> 00:10:34.919
that the Internet of Things will soon be

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:36.683
the Internet of Things To Be Hacked.

00:10:36.683 --> 00:10:38.706
All of the physical objects in our space

00:10:38.706 --> 00:10:41.570
are being transformed into information technologies,

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.125
and that has a radical implication for our security,

00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:48.135
because more connections to more devices

00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:50.714
means more vulnerabilities.

00:10:50.714 --> 00:10:52.462
Criminals understand this.

00:10:52.462 --> 00:10:54.341
Terrorists understand this. Hackers understand this.

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:57.504
If you control the code, you control the world.

00:10:57.504 --> 00:11:02.175
This is the future that awaits us.

00:11:02.175 --> 00:11:05.012
There has not yet been an operating system

00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:07.612
or a technology that hasn't been hacked.

00:11:07.612 --> 00:11:10.350
That's troubling, since the human body itself

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.448
is now becoming an information technology.

00:11:13.448 --> 00:11:17.015
As we've seen here, we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs.

00:11:17.015 --> 00:11:19.567
Every year, thousands of cochlear implants,

00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:21.785
diabetic pumps, pacemakers

00:11:21.785 --> 00:11:24.000
and defibrillators are being implanted in people.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.648
In the United States, there are 60,000 people

00:11:26.648 --> 00:11:29.610
who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.974
The defibrillators allow a physician at a distance

00:11:32.974 --> 00:11:34.764
to give a shock to a heart

00:11:34.764 --> 00:11:37.114
in case a patient needs it.

00:11:37.114 --> 00:11:39.205
But if you don't need it,

00:11:39.205 --> 00:11:40.981
and somebody else gives you the shock,

00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:44.372
it's not a good thing.

00:11:44.372 --> 00:11:47.994
Of course, we're going to go even deeper than the human body.

00:11:47.994 --> 00:11:50.244
We're going down to the cellular level these days.

00:11:50.244 --> 00:11:52.387
Up until this point, all the technologies

00:11:52.387 --> 00:11:56.175
I've been talking about have been silicon-based, ones and zeroes,

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:58.873
but there's another operating system out there:

00:11:58.873 --> 00:12:03.569
the original operating system, DNA.

00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:08.009
And to hackers, DNA is just another operating system

00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:10.008
waiting to be hacked.

00:12:10.008 --> 00:12:11.504
It's a great challenge for them.

00:12:11.504 --> 00:12:12.905
There are people already working on hacking the software of life,

00:12:14.804 --> 00:12:17.761
and while most of them are doing this to great good

00:12:17.761 --> 00:12:19.162
and to help us all,

00:12:19.162 --> 00:12:22.698
some won't be.

00:12:22.698 --> 00:12:24.360
So how will criminals abuse this?

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.643
Well, with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things.

00:12:26.643 --> 00:12:29.839
For example, I predict that we will move away

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:32.950
from a plant-based narcotics world

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.009
to a synthetic one. Why do you need the plants anymore?

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:39.126
You can just take the DNA code from marijuana

00:12:39.126 --> 00:12:43.918
or poppies or coca leaves

00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:46.238
and cut and past that gene

00:12:46.238 --> 00:12:48.915
and put it into yeast,

00:12:48.915 --> 00:12:50.317
and you can take those yeast

00:12:50.317 --> 00:12:53.589
and make them make the cocaine for you,

00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:57.373
or the marijuana, or any other drug.

00:12:57.373 --> 00:12:59.157
So how we use yeast in the future

00:12:59.157 --> 00:13:01.047
is going to be really interesting.

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:03.391
In fact, we may have some really interesting bread and beer

00:13:03.391 --> 00:13:07.214
as we go into this next century.

00:13:07.214 --> 00:13:11.212
The cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously.

00:13:11.212 --> 00:13:13.600
It was proceeding at Moore's Law pace,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.566
but then in 2008, something changed.

00:13:15.566 --> 00:13:17.238
The technologies got better,

00:13:17.238 --> 00:13:21.084
and now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace

00:13:21.084 --> 00:13:24.202
five times that of Moore's Law.

00:13:24.202 --> 00:13:28.026
That has significant implications for us.

00:13:28.026 --> 00:13:30.769
It took us 30 years to get from

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:32.925
the introduction of the personal computer

00:13:32.925 --> 00:13:35.154
to the level of cybercrime we have today,

00:13:35.154 --> 00:13:38.781
but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly,

00:13:38.781 --> 00:13:40.445
and knowing criminals and terrorists as I do,

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:43.314
we may get there a lot faster

00:13:43.314 --> 00:13:45.183
with biocrime in the future.

00:13:45.183 --> 00:13:47.222
It will be easy for anybody to go ahead

00:13:47.222 --> 00:13:49.102
and print their own bio-virus,

00:13:49.102 --> 00:13:51.864
enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax,

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:53.622
weaponized flu.

00:13:53.622 --> 00:13:56.411
We recently saw a case where some researchers

00:13:56.411 --> 00:14:01.437
made the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent.

00:14:01.437 --> 00:14:04.903
It already has a 70 percent mortality rate

00:14:04.903 --> 00:14:06.493
if you get it, but it's hard to get.

00:14:06.493 --> 00:14:09.301
Engineers, by moving around a small number

00:14:09.301 --> 00:14:10.957
of genetic changes,

00:14:10.957 --> 00:14:12.656
were able to weaponize it

00:14:12.656 --> 00:14:15.918
and make it much more easy for human beings to catch,

00:14:15.918 --> 00:14:18.101
so that not thousands of people would die,

00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:19.814
but tens of millions.

00:14:19.814 --> 00:14:22.304
You see, you can go ahead and create

00:14:22.304 --> 00:14:24.285
new pandemics, and the researchers who did this

00:14:24.285 --> 00:14:25.797
were so proud of their accomplishments,

00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:27.686
they wanted to publish it openly

00:14:27.686 --> 00:14:29.789
so that everybody could see this

00:14:29.789 --> 00:14:33.933
and get access to this information.

00:14:33.933 --> 00:14:35.728
But it goes deeper than that.

00:14:35.728 --> 00:14:37.670
DNA researcher Andrew Hessel

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.067
has pointed out quite rightly

00:14:39.067 --> 00:14:41.350
that if you can use cancer treatments,

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.478
modern cancer treatments,

00:14:42.478 --> 00:14:45.427
to go after one cell while leaving all the other cells

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:47.083
around it intact,

00:14:47.083 --> 00:14:51.227
then you can also go after any one person's cell.

00:14:51.227 --> 00:14:53.205
Personalized cancer treatments

00:14:53.205 --> 00:14:55.819
are the flip side of personalized bioweapons,

00:14:55.819 --> 00:14:59.205
which means you can attack any one individual,

00:14:59.205 --> 00:15:03.388
including all the people in this picture.

00:15:03.388 --> 00:15:07.516
How will we protect them in the future?

00:15:07.516 --> 00:15:10.326
What to do? What to do about all this?

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.821
That's what I get asked all the time.

00:15:12.821 --> 00:15:14.408
For those of you who follow me on Twitter,

00:15:14.408 --> 00:15:18.938
I will be tweeting out the answer later on today. (Laughter)

00:15:18.938 --> 00:15:21.573
Actually, it's a bit more complex than that,

00:15:21.573 --> 00:15:23.652
and there are no magic bullets.

00:15:23.652 --> 00:15:25.364
I don't have all the answers,

00:15:25.364 --> 00:15:27.028
but I know a few things.

00:15:27.028 --> 00:15:29.725
In the wake of 9/11,

00:15:29.725 --> 00:15:32.515
the best security minds

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.499
put together all their innovation

00:15:34.499 --> 00:15:38.638
and this is what they created for security.

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:42.659
If you're expecting the people who built this to protect you

00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:46.375
from the coming robopocalypse — (Laughter)

00:15:46.375 --> 00:15:49.327
— uh, you may want to have a backup plan. (Laughter)

00:15:49.327 --> 00:15:55.526
Just saying. Just think about that. (Applause)

00:15:55.526 --> 00:15:58.445
Law enforcement is currently a closed system.

00:15:58.445 --> 00:16:01.247
It's nation-based, while the threat is international.

00:16:01.247 --> 00:16:05.195
Policing doesn't scale globally. At least, it hasn't,

00:16:05.195 --> 00:16:09.478
and our current system of guns, border guards, big gates and fences

00:16:09.478 --> 00:16:12.589
are outdated in the new world into which we're moving.

00:16:12.589 --> 00:16:14.865
So how might we prepare for some of these specific threats,

00:16:14.865 --> 00:16:17.288
like attacking a president or a prime minister?

00:16:17.288 --> 00:16:19.425
This would be the natural government response,

00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:21.702
to hide away all our government leaders

00:16:21.702 --> 00:16:23.513
in hermetically sealed bubbles.

00:16:23.513 --> 00:16:25.345
But this is not going to work.

00:16:25.345 --> 00:16:28.481
The cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be trivial.

00:16:28.481 --> 00:16:31.726
Anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future.

00:16:31.726 --> 00:16:35.179
So maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this.

00:16:35.183 --> 00:16:37.111
What happens if we were to take

00:16:37.111 --> 00:16:40.311
the President's DNA, or a king or queen's,

00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:42.647
and put it out to a group of a few hundred

00:16:42.647 --> 00:16:44.543
trusted researchers so they could

00:16:44.543 --> 00:16:47.479
study that DNA and do penetration testing against it

00:16:47.479 --> 00:16:49.687
as a means of helping our leaders?

00:16:49.687 --> 00:16:51.944
Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand?

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:54.606
Or, controversially, and not without its risks,

00:16:54.606 --> 00:16:57.465
what happens if we just gave it to the whole public?

00:16:57.465 --> 00:17:01.030
Then we could all be engaged in helping.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.646
We've already seen examples of this working well.

00:17:03.646 --> 00:17:06.574
The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project

00:17:06.574 --> 00:17:08.246
is staffed by journalists and citizens

00:17:08.246 --> 00:17:09.982
where they are crowd-sourcing

00:17:09.982 --> 00:17:12.595
what dictators and terrorists are doing

00:17:12.595 --> 00:17:14.277
with public funds around the world,

00:17:14.277 --> 00:17:15.944
and, in a more dramatic case,

00:17:15.944 --> 00:17:18.248
we've seen in Mexico,

00:17:18.248 --> 00:17:19.872
a country that has been racked

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:23.885
by 50,000 narcotics-related murders

00:17:23.885 --> 00:17:25.651
in the past six years.

00:17:25.651 --> 00:17:27.026
They're killing so many people

00:17:27.026 --> 00:17:29.306
they can't even afford to bury them all

00:17:29.306 --> 00:17:31.075
in anything but these unmarked graves

00:17:31.075 --> 00:17:34.480
like this one outside of Ciudad Juarez.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.588
What can we do about this? The government has proven ineffective.

00:17:37.588 --> 00:17:40.725
So in Mexico, citizens, at great risk to themselves,

00:17:40.725 --> 00:17:44.804
are fighting back to build an effective solution.

00:17:44.804 --> 00:17:48.988
They're crowd-mapping the activities of the drug dealers.

00:17:48.988 --> 00:17:50.780
Whether or not you realize it,

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.465
we are at the dawn of a technological arms race,

00:17:54.465 --> 00:17:56.243
an arms race between people

00:17:56.243 --> 00:17:58.005
who are using technology for good

00:17:58.005 --> 00:18:00.213
and those who are using it for ill.

00:18:00.213 --> 00:18:04.574
The threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now.

00:18:04.574 --> 00:18:08.007
I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are.

00:18:08.007 --> 00:18:10.110
My personal belief is that,

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.055
rather than having a small, elite force

00:18:12.055 --> 00:18:14.095
of highly trained government agents

00:18:14.095 --> 00:18:15.816
here to protect us all,

00:18:15.816 --> 00:18:17.519
we're much better off

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:19.598
having average and ordinary citizens

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:22.022
approaching this problem as a group

00:18:22.022 --> 00:18:23.335
and seeing what we can do.

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:24.584
If we all do our part,

00:18:24.584 --> 00:18:26.911
I think we'll be in a much better space.

00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:28.378
The tools to change the world

00:18:28.378 --> 00:18:30.071
are in everybody's hands.

00:18:30.071 --> 00:18:32.910
How we use them is not just up to me,

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.392
it's up to all of us.

00:18:35.392 --> 00:18:38.025
This was a technology I would frequently deploy

00:18:38.025 --> 00:18:39.946
as a police officer.

00:18:39.946 --> 00:18:43.721
This technology has become outdated in our current world.

00:18:43.734 --> 00:18:46.446
It doesn't scale, it doesn't work globally,

00:18:46.446 --> 00:18:48.518
and it surely doesn't work virtually.

00:18:48.518 --> 00:18:51.786
We've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism.

00:18:51.786 --> 00:18:56.133
They call for a shift to a more open form

00:18:56.133 --> 00:19:01.030
and a more participatory form of law enforcement.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.669
So I invite you to join me.

00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:08.857
After all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals.
