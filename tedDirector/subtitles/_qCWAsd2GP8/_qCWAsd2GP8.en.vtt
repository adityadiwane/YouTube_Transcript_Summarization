00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:14.642
Puzzles

00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:16.941
and magic.

00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:19.085
I work in what most people think

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.523
are two distinct fields,

00:00:21.523 --> 00:00:24.594
but I believe they are the same.

00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:26.570
I am both a magician and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.406
a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor,

00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:31.770
which basically means I've taken

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.392
the world's two nerdiest hobbies

00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:36.320
and combined them into one career.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.443
And I believe that magic and puzzles are the same

00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:41.369
because they both key into one of

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.030
the most important human drives:

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.116
the urge to solve.

00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:49.249
Human beings are wired to solve,

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.253
to make order out of chaos.

00:00:52.253 --> 00:00:53.760
It's certainly true for me.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.599
I've been solving my whole life.

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:59.903
High school consisted of epic
Scrabble matches in the cafeteria

00:00:59.903 --> 00:01:01.612
and not really talking to girls,

00:01:01.612 --> 00:01:03.435
and then at about that time

00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:05.130
I started learning magic tricks

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.597
and definitely not talking to girls.

00:01:07.597 --> 00:01:09.644
There's nothing like starting a conversation with,

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:12.200
"Hey, did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.224
20 points in Scrabble?"

00:01:15.224 --> 00:01:18.011
But back then, I noticed an intersection

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.736
between puzzles and illusion.

00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:22.682
When you do the crossword puzzle

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:24.628
or when you watch a magic show,

00:01:24.628 --> 00:01:26.880
you become a solver,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.658
and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos,

00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:33.898
the chaos of, say, a black-and-white puzzle grid,

00:01:33.898 --> 00:01:36.042
a mixed-up bag of Scrabble tiles,

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:38.850
or a shuffled pack of playing cards.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.864
And today, as a cruciverbalist —

00:01:41.864 --> 00:01:43.450
23 points —

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.207
and an illusion designer, I create that chaos.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:50.552
I test your ability to solve.

00:01:50.552 --> 00:01:52.962
Now, it turns out research tells us

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:56.960
that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.695
From birth, we are wired to solve.

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:04.532
In one UCLA study, newborns still in the hospital

00:02:04.532 --> 00:02:07.220
were shown patterns, patterns like this:

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.831
circle, cross, circle, cross.

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:15.150
And then the pattern was changed: triangle, square.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.806
And by tracking an infant's gaze,

00:02:17.806 --> 00:02:21.110
we know that newborns as young as a day old

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.722
can notice and respond to disruptions in order.

00:02:23.722 --> 00:02:25.140
It's remarkable.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.738
So from infancy through old age,

00:02:27.738 --> 00:02:30.110
the urge to solve unites us all,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.750
and I even found this photo on Instagram

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.904
of pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle

00:02:35.904 --> 00:02:38.130
with her morning coffee.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.801
Like.

00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:43.669
(Laughter)

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:48.210
Now, solving exists across all cultures.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.154
The American invention is the crossword puzzle,

00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:52.553
and this year we are celebrating

00:02:52.553 --> 00:02:55.226
the 100th anniversary of the crossword puzzle,

00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:57.733
first published in The New York World.

00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:00.372
But many other cultures have
their signature puzzles as well.

00:03:00.372 --> 00:03:02.382
China gives us tangrams,

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.427
which would test solvers' abilities

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:07.567
to form shapes from the jumbled pieces.

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:10.570
Chaos. Order.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.628
Order.

00:03:12.628 --> 00:03:15.823
And order.

00:03:15.823 --> 00:03:18.393
That one's my favorite, let's hear it again.

00:03:18.393 --> 00:03:20.064
Okay.

00:03:20.064 --> 00:03:21.840
And how about this puzzle

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.279
invented in 18th-century England:

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:26.330
the jigsaw puzzle.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.144
Is this not making order out of chaos?

00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:31.613
So as you can see,

00:03:31.613 --> 00:03:33.392
we are always solving.

00:03:33.392 --> 00:03:37.354
We are always trying to decode our world.

00:03:37.354 --> 00:03:38.884
It's an eternal quest.

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:41.528
It's just like the one Cervantes wrote about

00:03:41.528 --> 00:03:42.979
in "Don Quixote,"

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.981
which by the way is the root of the word "quixotry,"

00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:46.804
the highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time,

00:03:46.804 --> 00:03:48.660
365 points.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.877
But anyway, "Don Quixote" is an important book.

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:53.914
You guys have read "Don Quixote," yes?

00:03:53.914 --> 00:03:55.420
I'm seeing some heads nod.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.702
Come on guys, really?

00:03:56.702 --> 00:03:59.239
Who's read "Don Quixote?" Let's do this.
Raise your hands if you've read "Don Quixote."

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.349
There we go. Smart audience.

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.063
Who's read "Don Quixote?" Get them up.

00:04:02.063 --> 00:04:06.276
Okay, good, because I need somebody smart here

00:04:06.276 --> 00:04:07.478
because now I'm going to demonstrate

00:04:07.478 --> 00:04:09.350
with the help of one of you

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.686
just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is,

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:15.185
just how wired to solve all of you really are,

00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:16.627
so I'm going to come into the audience

00:04:16.627 --> 00:04:19.625
and find somebody to help me.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.747
Let's see.

00:04:21.747 --> 00:04:25.639
Everybody's looking away all of a sudden.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.556
Can I? Would you? What is your name? Gwen.

00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:31.997
I'm not a mind reader, I can see your name tag.

00:04:31.997 --> 00:04:36.310
Come with me, Gwen. Everyone give her 
a round of applause, make her feel welcome.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.982
Gwen, after you.

00:04:37.982 --> 00:04:39.864
(Applause)

00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:43.275
Are you so excited?

00:04:43.275 --> 00:04:44.730
Did you know that your name is worth

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.328
eight points in Scrabble?

00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:50.615
Okay, stand right here, Gwen, right here.

00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:53.117
Now, Gwen, before we begin,

00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:55.726
I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle,

00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:57.263
which is here in this envelope,

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:58.883
and I will not go near it. Okay?

00:04:58.883 --> 00:05:00.891
And over here we have a
drawing of some farm animals.

00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:02.251
You can see we have an owl, we have a horse,

00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:04.480
a donkey, a rooster, an ox, and a sheep,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.690
and then here, Gwen, we have

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.110
some fancy art store markers,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.450
colors like, can you see that word right there?

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.789
Gwen: Cobalt.
David Kwong: Cobalt, yes. Cobalt.

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.407
But we have a silver, a red, an emerald,

00:05:15.407 --> 00:05:16.865
and an amber marker,

00:05:16.865 --> 00:05:19.130
and Gwen, you are going to color this drawing

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.607
just like you were five years old,

00:05:20.607 --> 00:05:21.715
one marker at a time.

00:05:21.715 --> 00:05:23.234
It's going to be a lot of fun.

00:05:23.234 --> 00:05:24.255
But I'm going to go over here.

00:05:24.255 --> 00:05:26.342
I don't want to see what you're doing.

00:05:26.342 --> 00:05:27.412
Okay, so don't start yet.

00:05:27.412 --> 00:05:28.839
Wait for me to get over here and close my eyes.

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:30.717
Now Gwen, are you ready?

00:05:30.717 --> 00:05:34.227
Pick up just one marker, pick up just one marker,

00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:35.612
and why don't you color in the horse for me?

00:05:35.612 --> 00:05:39.165
Color in the horse — big, big, big scribbles,

00:05:39.165 --> 00:05:42.123
broad strokes, don't worry about staying in the lines.

00:05:42.123 --> 00:05:43.399
All right. Great.

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:44.975
And why don't you take that marker and recap it

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:46.905
and place it on the table for me.

00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:50.125
Okay, and pick up another marker out of the cup

00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:52.575
and take off the cap

00:05:52.575 --> 00:05:54.641
and color in the donkey for me, color in the donkey.

00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:57.709
Big scribbles.

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:59.943
Okay, cool, and re-cap that marker

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.445
and place it on the table.

00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:03.723
And pick up another marker for me

00:06:03.723 --> 00:06:06.186
and take off the cap. Isn't this fun?

00:06:06.186 --> 00:06:07.513
And color in the owl for me.

00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:10.564
Color in the owl.

00:06:10.564 --> 00:06:13.050
Okay, and recap that marker

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.838
and pick up another marker out of the cup

00:06:14.838 --> 00:06:18.414
and color in the rooster for me, color in the rooster.

00:06:18.414 --> 00:06:19.838
Good, good, good, good, good.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:20.931
Big, big, big strokes. Good, good.

00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.196
Pick up another marker out of the cup

00:06:23.196 --> 00:06:26.693
and color in the ox for me. Color in the ox.

00:06:26.693 --> 00:06:27.956
Okay, good.

00:06:27.956 --> 00:06:30.406
A lot of color on that, and recap,
and place it on the table,

00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:33.110
and pick up another marker out of the cup.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.849
Oh, I'm out? Okay, I'm going to turn around.

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:41.109
Did I forget? Oh, I forgot my purple marker.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.452
This is still going to work, though.

00:06:42.452 --> 00:06:44.735
I think this is still going to work, mostly.

00:06:44.735 --> 00:06:47.888
So Gwen, I'm going to hand you this envelope.

00:06:47.888 --> 00:06:50.840
Don't open it yet. Do not open it yet,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.231
but I am going to write down your choices

00:06:53.231 --> 00:06:55.390
so that everybody can see

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.663
the choices that you made.

00:06:56.663 --> 00:07:05.046
Okay, great. So we have a cobalt horse,

00:07:05.046 --> 00:07:10.452
amber owl,

00:07:10.452 --> 00:07:15.233
a silver ox,

00:07:15.233 --> 00:07:18.675
yes, okay, a red donkey,

00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:22.050
and what was the emerald color? A rooster.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.120
An emerald rooster. Okay.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.286
Now for the moment of truth, Gwen,

00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:29.971
we're going to take a look in that envelope.

00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:31.886
Why don't you open it up and remove

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:33.178
the one piece of paper from inside

00:07:33.178 --> 00:07:34.207
and hand it to me,

00:07:34.207 --> 00:07:38.910
and we will see if it matches your choices.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.345
Yes, I think it does.

00:07:40.345 --> 00:07:41.909
We have a cobalt horse, we have a red donkey,

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:44.206
we have an amber owl, we have
an emerald rooster, a silver ox,

00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:46.217
I forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep,

00:07:46.217 --> 00:07:48.932
but that's a pretty amazing
coincidence, don't you think?

00:07:48.932 --> 00:07:53.113
Gwen, well done. That's beautiful. (Applause)

00:07:53.113 --> 00:07:54.880
I'll take that back from you.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.744
So ladies and gentlemen, how is this possible?

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:01.561
How is this possible? Well, could it be

00:08:01.561 --> 00:08:05.823
that Gwen's brain is so wired to solve

00:08:05.823 --> 00:08:08.669
that she decoded hidden messages?

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:10.716
Well this is the puzzle I present to you.

00:08:10.716 --> 00:08:12.696
Could there be order

00:08:12.696 --> 00:08:15.700
in the chaos that I created?

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.440
Let's take a closer look.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.451
Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces?

00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:27.208
What image did it ultimately become? A cobalt horse.

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:28.985
The plot thickens.

00:08:28.985 --> 00:08:31.190
And then we played a game of tangrams

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:36.180
with an emerald rooster.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.378
That one's my favorite.

00:08:38.378 --> 00:08:44.633
And then we had an experiment with a silver ox.

00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:47.333
And Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee

00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:51.162
out of an amber owl.

00:08:51.162 --> 00:08:52.841
Thank you, Katy, for taking that photo for me.

00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:54.806
Oh, and there's one more, there's one more.

00:08:54.806 --> 00:08:58.234
I believe you colored a red donkey, Gwen.

00:08:58.234 --> 00:08:59.864
Ladies and gentlemen, could you raise your hands

00:08:59.864 --> 00:09:02.284
for me if you've read "Don Quixote?"

00:09:02.284 --> 00:09:05.179
Who's read "Don Quixote?" (Laughter)

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:06.955
But wait, but wait, wait, wait, wait, there's more.

00:09:06.955 --> 00:09:08.450
There's more.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.209
Gwen, I was so confident

00:09:11.209 --> 00:09:13.133
that you were going to make these choices

00:09:13.133 --> 00:09:15.771
that I made another prediction,

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:19.101
and I put it in an even more indelible place,

00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:21.519
and it's right here.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.801
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:26.379
we have today's New York Times.

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:30.204
The date is March 18th, 2014.

00:09:30.204 --> 00:09:32.050
Many of you in the first couple of rows

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.170
have it underneath your seats as well.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.380
Really dig. We hid them under there.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.921
See if you can fish out the newspaper

00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:40.319
and open up to the arts section

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:43.782
and you will find the crossword puzzle,

00:09:43.782 --> 00:09:45.345
and the crossword puzzle today

00:09:45.345 --> 00:09:47.404
was written by yours truly.

00:09:47.404 --> 00:09:48.470
You can see my name above the grid.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.003
I'm going to give this to you, Gwen, to take a look.

00:09:51.003 --> 00:09:55.196
And I will also put it up on the screen.

00:09:55.196 --> 00:09:57.078
Now let's take a look

00:09:57.078 --> 00:10:00.385
at another piece of the puzzle.

00:10:00.385 --> 00:10:03.603
If you look at the first clue for 1-across,

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.899
it starts with the letter C, for corrupt,

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:09.825
and just below that we have an O, for outfielder,

00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:12.771
and if you keep reading the
first letters of the clues down,

00:10:12.771 --> 00:10:15.572
you get cobalt horse,

00:10:15.572 --> 00:10:19.060
amber owl, silver ox,

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.558
red donkey, and emerald rooster.

00:10:22.558 --> 00:10:24.164
(Applause)

00:10:24.164 --> 00:10:29.735
That's pretty cool, right?

00:10:29.735 --> 00:10:31.446
It's The New York Times.

00:10:31.446 --> 00:10:33.022
But wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

00:10:33.022 --> 00:10:34.544
Oh, Gwen,

00:10:34.544 --> 00:10:37.148
do you recall how I forgot my purple marker,

00:10:37.148 --> 00:10:40.195
and you were unable to color the sheep?

00:10:40.195 --> 00:10:41.648
Well, if you keep reading

00:10:41.648 --> 00:10:43.279
starting with 25-down,

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.185
it says,

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.958
"Oh, by the way,

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:50.270
the sheep can be left blank."

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.706
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:54.706 --> 00:10:56.280
But wait, wait, wait, there's one more thing,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.483
there's one more thing,

00:10:57.483 --> 00:11:00.322
there's one final piece of the puzzle.

00:11:00.322 --> 00:11:04.641
Gwen, I am so grateful for your choices

00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:06.632
because if we take a look

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:08.863
at the first letters of your combinations,

00:11:08.863 --> 00:11:11.875
we get "C-H-A-O-S" for chaos

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:14.698
and "O-R-D-E-R" for order.

00:11:14.698 --> 00:11:16.228
That's chaos and order.

00:11:16.228 --> 00:11:17.904
We've all made order out of chaos.

00:11:17.904 --> 00:11:19.907
So ladies and gentlemen, the next time

00:11:19.907 --> 00:11:21.459
you find yourself with a puzzle,

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:24.501
whether it's in your life or in your work,

00:11:24.501 --> 00:11:25.682
or maybe it's at the Sunday morning

00:11:25.682 --> 00:11:28.090
breakfast table with The New York Times,

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.932
remember, you are all wired to solve.

00:11:31.932 --> 00:11:33.524
Thank you.

00:11:33.524 --> 00:11:37.524
(Applause)
