00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.636
As the highest military commander
of the Netherlands,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.676
with troops stationed around the world,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.420
I'm really honored to be here today.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.036
When I look around
this TEDxAmsterdam venue,

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.220
I see a very special audience.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.124
You are the reason why I said yes

00:00:40.148 --> 00:00:42.868
to the invitation to come here today.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.740
When I look around, I see people
who want to make a contribution.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.980
I see people who want
to make a better world,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.236
by doing groundbreaking scientific work,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.700
by creating impressive works of art,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.060
by writing critical articles
or inspiring books,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.300
by starting up sustainable businesses.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.996
And you all have chosen
your own instruments

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.340
to fulfill this mission
of creating a better world.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.940
Some chose the microscope
as their instrument.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.280
Others chose dancing or painting,

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.244
or making music like we just heard.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.420
Some chose the pen.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.820
Others work through
the instrument of money.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.740
Ladies and gentlemen,
I made a different choice.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.300
Thanks.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.140
Ladies and gentlemen ...

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.356
(Laughter)

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.900
(Applause)

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:14.354
I share your goals.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.900
I share the goals
of the speakers you heard before.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.739
I did not choose to take up the pen,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.020
the brush,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.060
the camera.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.860
I chose this instrument.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.220
I chose the gun.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.756
For you, and you heard already,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.540
being so close to this gun
may make you feel uneasy.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.340
It may even feel scary.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.620
A real gun at a few feet's distance.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.300
Let us stop for a moment
and feel this uneasiness.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.180
You could even hear it.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.796
Let us cherish the fact

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.580
that probably most of you
have never been close to a gun.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.300
It means the Netherlands
is a peaceful country.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.460
The Netherlands is not at war.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.620
It means soldiers are not needed
to patrol our streets.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.220
Guns are not a part of our lives.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.540
In many countries,
it is a different story.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.196
In many countries,
people are confronted with guns.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.076
They are oppressed.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.380
They are intimidated --

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.700
by warlords,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.060
by terrorists,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.220
by criminals.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.220
Weapons can do a lot of harm.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.540
They are the cause of much distress.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.380
Why then am I standing before you
with this weapon?

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.300
Why did I choose the gun as my instrument?

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.660
Today I want to tell you why.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.996
Today I want to tell you

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.980
why I chose the gun
to create a better world.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.100
And I want to tell you
how this gun can help.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.300
My story starts in the city of Nijmegen

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.380
in the east of the Netherlands,

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.620
the city where I was born.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.580
My father was a hardworking baker,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.916
but when he had finished
work in the bakery,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.660
he often told me and my brother stories.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.516
And most of the time,

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.740
he told me this story
I'm going to share with you now.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.236
The story of what happened

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.596
when he was a conscripted soldier
in the Dutch armed forces

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.020
at the beginning of the Second World War.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.700
The Nazis invaded the Netherlands.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.220
Their grim plans were evident.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.380
They meant to rule by means of repression.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.020
Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.012
Only brute force remained.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.580
It was our last resort.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.980
My father was there to provide it.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.116
As the son of a farmer
who knew how to hunt,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.380
my father was an excellent marksman.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.820
When he aimed, he never missed.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.076
At this decisive moment in Dutch history

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.916
my father was positioned
on the bank of the river Waal

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.540
near the city of Nijmegen.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.220
He had a clear shot at the German soldiers
who came to occupy a free country,

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.756
his country,

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.980
our country.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.220
He fired. Nothing happened.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.166
He fired again.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.300
No German soldier fell to the ground.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.236
My father had been given an old gun

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.740
that could not even reach
the opposite riverbank.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.236
Hitler's troops marched on,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.180
and there was nothing
my father could do about it.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.596
Until the day my father died,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.980
he was frustrated
about missing these shots.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.900
He could have done something.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.676
But with an old gun,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.596
not even the best marksman
in the armed forces

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.900
could have hit the mark.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.940
So this story stayed with me.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.836
Then in high school,

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.420
I was gripped by the stories
of the Allied soldiers --

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.956
soldiers who left the safety
of their own homes and risked their lives

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.300
to liberate a country

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.460
and a people that they didn't know.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.460
They liberated my birth town.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.580
It was then that I decided
I would take up the gun --

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.436
out of respect and gratitude
for those men and women

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.820
who came to liberate us.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.060
From the awareness
that sometimes only the gun

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.220
can stand between good and evil.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.156
And that is why I took up the gun --

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.380
not to shoot,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.556
not to kill,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.900
not to destroy,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.420
but to stop those who would do evil,

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.380
to protect the vulnerable,

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.860
to defend democratic values,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.500
to stand up for the freedom we have
to talk here today in Amsterdam

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.740
about how we can
make the world a better place.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.116
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.820
I do not stand here today
to tell you about the glory of weapons.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.460
I do not like guns.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.220
And once you have been
under fire yourself,

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.876
it brings home even more clearly

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.380
that a gun is not
some macho instrument to brag about.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.356
I stand here today

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:35.740
to tell you about the use of the gun
as an instrument of peace and stability.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.716
The gun may be one of the most important
instruments of peace and stability

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.220
that we have in this world.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.220
Now this may sound contradictory to you.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.395
But not only have I seen with my own eyes

00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:56.442
during my deployments in Lebanon, Sarajevo

00:08:56.466 --> 00:09:00.276
and as the Netherlands' Chief of Defence,

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:06.220
this is also supported
by cold, hard statistics.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.220
Violence has declined dramatically
over the last 500 years.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.700
Despite the pictures
we are shown daily in the news,

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.516
wars between developed countries
are no longer commonplace.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.796
The murder rate in Europe

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.100
has dropped by a factor of 30
since the Middle Ages.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.556
And occurrences
of civil war and repression

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.380
have declined since the end
of the Cold War.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.780
Statistics show that we are living
in a relatively peaceful era.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.890
Why?

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.620
Why has violence decreased?

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.516
Has the human mind changed?

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.187
Well, we were talking
about the human mind this morning.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.516
Did we simply lose
our beastly impulses for revenge,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.796
for violent rituals,

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.100
for pure rage?

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.100
Or is there something else?

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.516
In his latest book,
Harvard professor Steven Pinker --

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.916
and many other thinkers before him --

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.756
concludes that one of the main drivers

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.316
behind less violent societies

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.220
is the spread of the constitutional state

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.524
and the introduction, on a large scale,

00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:29.220
of the state monopoly
on the legitimized use of violence --

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.220
legitimized by a democratically
elected government,

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.860
legitimized by checks and balances
and an independent judicial system.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.956
In other words, a state monopoly

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.460
that has the use of violence
well under control.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:57.860
Such a state monopoly on violence,
first of all, serves as a reassurance.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.236
It removes the incentive for an arms race

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.700
between potentially hostile groups
in our societies.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.556
Secondly, the presence of penalties

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.236
that outweigh the benefits
of using violence

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.380
tips the balance even further.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.396
Abstaining from violence

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.540
becomes more profitable
than starting a war.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.460
Now nonviolence starts to work
like a flywheel.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.660
It enhances peace even further.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.100
Where there is no conflict,
trade flourishes.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.700
And trade is another important
incentive against violence.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:47.580
With trade, there's mutual interdependency
and mutual gain between parties.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.716
And when there is mutual gain,
both sides stand to lose more

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.573
than they would gain
if they started a war.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.596
War is simply no longer the best option,

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.194
and that is why violence has decreased.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.116
This, ladies and gentlemen,

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.980
is the rationale behind the existence
of my armed forces.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.220
The armed forces implement
the state monopoly on violence.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.356
We do this in a legitimized way

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:29.220
only after our democracy
has asked us to do so.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.516
It is this legitimate,
controlled use of the gun

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.356
that has contributed greatly

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.940
to reducing the statistics of war,
conflict and violence around the globe.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.316
It is this participation
in peacekeeping missions

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.220
that has led to the resolution
of many civil wars.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:57.300
My soldiers use the gun
as an instrument of peace.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.660
And this is exactly
why failed states are so dangerous.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.700
Failed states have no legitimized,
democratically controlled use of force.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.111
Failed states do not know of the gun
as an instrument of peace and stability.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:23.220
That is why failed states can drag down
a whole region into chaos and conflict.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.116
That is why spreading the concept
of the constitutional state

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.700
is such an important aspect
of our foreign missions.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.516
That is why we are trying
to build a judicial system

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.580
right now in Afghanistan.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.076
That is why we train
police officers, we train judges,

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.860
we train public prosecutors
around the world.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.196
And that is why --

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.516
and in the Netherlands,
we are very unique in that --

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.276
that is why the Dutch constitution states

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.556
that one of the main tasks
of the armed forces

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.780
is to uphold and promote
the international rule of law.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.956
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:14.043
looking at this gun, we are confronted
with the ugly side of the human mind.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:21.916
Every day I hope that politicians,
diplomats, development workers

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.396
can turn conflict into peace

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.436
and threat

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.682
into hope.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:34.076
And I hope that one day
armies can be disbanded

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.996
and humans will find a way
of living together

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.077
without violence and oppression.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.060
But until that day comes,

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:49.516
we will have to make ideals
and human failure

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.220
meet somewhere in the middle.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:57.196
Until that day comes,
I stand for my father

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.660
who tried to shoot the Nazis
with an old gun.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:07.516
I stand for my men and women
who are prepared to risk their lives

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.460
for a less violent world for all of us.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:18.156
I stand for this soldier
who suffered partial hearing loss

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.316
and sustained permanent
injuries to her leg,

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.490
when she was hit by a rocket
on a mission in Afghanistan.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.636
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.916
until the day comes
when we can do away with the gun,

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.796
I hope we all agree

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.780
that peace and stability
do not come free of charge.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.820
It takes hard work,
often behind the scenes.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:53.580
It takes good equipment
and well-trained, dedicated soldiers.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.476
I hope you will support
the efforts of our armed forces

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.516
to train soldiers like this young captain

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.436
and provide her with a good gun,

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.220
instead of the bad gun
my father was given.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.740
I hope you will support our soldiers
when they are out there,

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.020
when they come home

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
and when they are injured
and need our care.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:25.916
They put their lives on the line,
for us, for you,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.900
and we cannot let them down.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.236
I hope you will respect my soldiers,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.220
this soldier with this gun.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.922
Because she wants a better world.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.620
Because she makes an active
contribution to a better world,

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.220
just like all of us here today.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.596
Thank you very much.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.980
(Applause)
