00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.025
Right when I was 15 was when
I first got interested in solar energy.

00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:24.906
My family had moved from Fort Lee,
New Jersey to California,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.266
from the snow to lots of heat,
and gas lines.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.666
There was gas rationing in 1973.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.746
The energy crisis was in full bore.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.906
I started reading
"Popular Science" magazine,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.786
and I got really excited
about the potential of solar energy

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.546
to try and solve that crisis.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.706
I had just taken
trigonometry in high school,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.106
I learned about the parabola

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.026
and how it could concentrate
rays of light to a single focus.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.626
That got me very excited.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.866
And I really felt
that there would be potential

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.586
to build some kind of thing
that could concentrate light.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.306
So, I started this company
called Solar Devices.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.586
And this was a company
where I built parabolas,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.866
I took metal shop,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.626
and I remember walking into metal shop
building parabolas and Stirling engines.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.266
And I was building a Stirling engine
over on the lathe,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.626
and all the motorcycle guys said,
"You're building a bong, aren't you?"

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.906
And I said, "No, it's a Stirling engine."
But they didn't believe me.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.986
I sold the plans for this engine

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.866
and for this dish in the back
of "Popular Science" magazine,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.306
for four dollars each.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.266
And I earned enough money
to pay for my first year of Caltech.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.026
It was a really big excitement for me
to get into Caltech.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.106
And at my first year at Caltech,
I continued the business.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.066
But then, in the second year of Caltech,
they started grading.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.266
The whole first year was pass/fail,
but the second year was graded.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.346
I wasn't able to keep up
with the business,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.186
and I ended up with a 25-year detour.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.386
My dream had been to convert solar energy
at a very practical cost,

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.946
but then I had this big detour.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.586
First, the coursework at Caltech.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.346
Then, when I graduated from Caltech,
the IBM PC came out,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.426
and I got addicted to the IBM PC in 1981.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.786
And then in 1983, Lotus 1-2-3 came out,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.026
and I was completely blown away
by Lotus 1-2-3.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.226
I began operating my business with 1-2-3,
began writing add-ins for 1-2-3,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.586
wrote a natural language
interface to 1-2-3.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.586
I started an educational software company
after I joined Lotus,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.946
and then I started Idealab
so I could have a roof

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.106
under which I could build
multiple companies in succession.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.510
Much later -- in 2000, very recently --
the new California energy crisis --

00:02:11.534 --> 00:02:14.365
what was purported to be
a big energy crisis -- was coming.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.846
And I was trying to figure out

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.567
if we could build something
that would capitalize on that

00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:21.476
and get people backup energy,
in case the crisis really came.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.611
And I started looking at how
we could build battery backup systems

00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:27.806
that could give people five hours,
10 hours, maybe even a full day,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.746
or three days' worth of backup power.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.786
I'm glad you heard earlier today,
batteries are unbelievably --

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.786
lack density compared to fuel.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.826
So much more energy can be stored
with fuel than with batteries.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.906
You'd have to fill your entire
parking space of one garage space

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.346
just to give yourself
four hours of battery backup.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.066
And I concluded, after researching
every other technology

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.106
that we could deploy for storing energy --

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.466
flywheels, different
formulations of batteries --

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.866
it just wasn't practical to store energy.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.546
So what about making energy?
Maybe we could make energy.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.266
I tried to figure out --
maybe solar's become attractive.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.346
It's been 25 years since I was doing this,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.506
let me go back and look
at what's been happening with solar cells.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.906
And the price had gone down
from 10 dollars a watt

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.586
to about four or five dollars a watt,
but it stabilized.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.106
And it needed to get much lower
to be cost-effective.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.035
I studied all the new things
that had happened in solar cells,

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.426
and was looking for ways we could
make solar cells more inexpensively.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.826
A lot of new things
are happening to do that,

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.186
but fundamentally, the process
requires a tremendous amount of energy.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.906
Some people say it takes
more energy to make a solar cell

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.906
than it will give out in its entire life.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.826
If we reduce the amount of energy
it takes to make the cells,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.426
that will become more practical.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.906
But right now, you pretty much
have to take silicon,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.506
put it in an oven at 1600 F
for 17 hours, to make the cells.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.946
A lot of people are working
to try and reduce that,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.946
but I didn't have anything to contribute.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.426
So I tried to figure out
what other way could we try

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.626
to make cost-effective solar electricity.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.106
What if we collect the sun
with a large reflector --

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.306
like I had been thinking about
in high school,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.146
but maybe with modern technology
we could make it cheaper --

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.226
concentrate it to a small converter,

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.306
and then the conversion device
wouldn't have to be as expensive,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.786
because it's much smaller,
rather than solar cells,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.226
which have to cover the entire surface
that you want to gather sun from.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.506
This seemed practical now,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.266
because a lot of new technologies
had come in the 25 years

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.746
since I had last looked at it.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.026
There was a lot
of new manufacturing techniques,

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.266
not to mention really cheap
miniature motors --

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.466
brushless motors,
servomotors, stepper motors,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.386
that are used in printers and scanners.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.666
So, that's a breakthrough.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.546
Of course, inexpensive microprocessors

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.466
and a very important breakthrough --
genetic algorithms.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.466
I'll be very short on genetic algorithms.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.066
It's a powerful way of solving intractable
problems using natural selection.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.506
You take a problem that you can't solve
with a pure mathematical answer,

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.705
you build an evolutionary system
to try multiple tries at guessing,

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:40.946
you add sex --

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.586
where you take half of one solution
and half of another

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.066
and then make new mutations --

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.146
and you use natural selection
to kill off not-as-good solutions.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.746
Usually, with a genetic algorithm
on a computer today,

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.506
with a three gigahertz processor,

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.259
you can solve many
formerly intractable problems

00:04:55.283 --> 00:04:56.786
in just a matter of minutes.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.866
So we tried to come up with a way
to use genetic algorithms

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.706
to create a new type of concentrator.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.626
And I'll show you what we came up with.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.746
Traditionally,
concentrators look like this.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.106
Those shapes are parabolas.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.506
They take all the parallel incoming rays
and focus it to a single spot.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.826
They have to track the sun,

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.066
because they have to point
directly at the sun.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.466
They usually have
a one degree acceptance angle --

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.226
once they're more than a degree off,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.386
none of the sunlight rays
will hit the focus.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.866
So we tried to come up
with a non-tracking collector

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.426
that would gather much more than
one degree of light, with no moving parts.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.826
So we created a genetic algorithm
to try this out,

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.426
we made a model in Excel
of a multisurface reflector,

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.506
and an amazing thing evolved, literally,

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.346
from trying a billion cycles,
a billion different attempts,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.786
with a fitness function that defined
how can you collect the most light,

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.026
from the most angles,
over a day, from the sun.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.746
And this is the shape that evolved.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.426
It's this non-tracking collector
with these six tuba-like horns,

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.986
and each of them collect light
in the following way --

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.706
if the sunlight strikes right here,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.586
it might bounce right to the center,
the hot spot, directly,

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.026
but if the sun is off axis
and comes from the side,

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.466
it might hit two places
and take two bounces.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.306
So for direct light,
it takes only one bounce,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.226
for off-axis light it might take two,

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.746
and for extreme off-axis,
it might take three.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.866
Your efficiency goes down
with more bounces,

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.306
because you lose about 10 percent
with each bounce,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.186
but this allowed us to collect light
from a plus or minus 25-degree angle.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.386
So, about two and a half hours of the day

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.746
we could collect
with a stationary component.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.546
Solar cells collect light
for four and a half hours though.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.826
On an average adjusted day,
a solar cell --

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.786
because the sun's moving across the sky,

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.066
the solar cell is going down
with a sine wave function of performance

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.346
at the off-axis angles.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.506
It collects about four and a half
average hours of sunlight a day.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.306
So even this, although it was great
with no moving parts --

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.786
we could achieve high
temperatures -- wasn't enough.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.266
We needed to beat solar cells.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.946
So we took a look at another idea.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.828
We looked at a way to break up a parabola
into individual petals that would track.

00:06:46.852 --> 00:06:49.226
So what you see here is 12 separate petals

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.146
that each could be controlled
with individual microprocessors

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.626
that would only cost a dollar.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.666
You can buy a two-megahertz
microprocessor for a dollar now.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.866
And you can buy stepper motors
that pretty much never wear out

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.506
because they have no brushes,

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.746
for a dollar.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.426
So we can control all 12 of these petals
for under 50 dollars

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.946
and what this would allow us to do
is not have to move the focus any more,

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.226
but only move the petals.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.586
The whole system would have
a much lower profile,

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.106
but also we could gather sunlight
for six and a half to seven hours a day.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.026
Now that we have concentrated sunlight,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.546
what are we going to put at the center
to convert sunlight to electricity?

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.066
So we tried to look
at all the different heat engines

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.906
that have been used in history to convert
sunlight or heat to electricity,

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.786
And one of the great ones of all time,

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.986
James Watt's steam engine of 1788
was a major breakthrough.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.346
James Watt didn't actually invent
the steam engine, he just refined it.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.106
But his refinements were incredible.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.466
He added new linear
motion guides to the pistons,

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.346
he added a condenser
to cool the steam outside the cylinder,

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.266
he made the engine double-acting,
so it had double the power.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.426
Those were major breakthroughs.
All of the improvements he made --

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.866
and it's justifiable
that our measure of energy, the watt,

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.426
today is named after him.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.146
So we looked at this engine,
and this had some potential.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.546
Steam engines are dangerous,

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.746
and they had tremendous impact
on the world --

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.026
industrial revolution
and ships and locomotives.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.866
But they're usually good to be large,

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.386
so they're not good
for distributed power generation.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.946
They're also very high-pressure,
so they're dangerous.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.546
Another type of engine
is the hot air engine.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.626
And the hot air engine
also was not invented by Robert Stirling,

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.706
but Robert Stirling came along in 1816
and radically improved it.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.866
This engine, because it was
so interesting --

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.546
it only worked on air, no steam --

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.306
has led to hundreds
of creative designs over the years

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.666
that use the Stirling engine principle.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.906
But after the Stirling engine,
Otto came along,

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.666
and also, he didn't invent
the internal combustion engine,

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:35.906
he just refined it.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.826
He showed it in Paris in 1867,
and it was a major achievement

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.586
because it brought the power density
of the engine way up.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.346
You could now get a lot more power
in a lot smaller space,

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.346
and that allowed the engine
to be used for mobile applications.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.826
So, once you have mobility,

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.906
you're making a lot of engines
because you've got lots of units,

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.930
as opposed to steam ships
or big factories,

00:08:53.954 --> 00:08:57.225
so this was the engine that ended up
benefiting from mass production

00:08:57.249 --> 00:08:58.946
where all the other engines didn't.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.923
So, because it went into mass production,

00:09:00.947 --> 00:09:03.506
costs were reduced,
100 years of refinement,

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.306
emissions were reduced,
tremendous production value.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.826
There have been hundreds of millions
of internal combustion engines built,

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.106
compared to thousands
of Stirling engines built.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.106
And not nearly as many
small steam engines being built anymore,

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.826
only large ones for big operations.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.506
So after looking
at these three, and 47 others,

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.706
we concluded that the Stirling engine
would be the best one to use.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.626
I want to give you a brief explanation
of how we looked at it and how it works.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.306
So we tried to look
at the Stirling engine in a new way,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.866
because it was practical --

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.146
weight no longer mattered
for our application.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.266
The internal combustion engine
took off because weight mattered,

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.826
because you were moving around.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.826
But if you're trying to generate
solar energy in a static place

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.506
the weight doesn't matter so much.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.205
We also discovered that efficiency
doesn't matter so much

00:09:46.229 --> 00:09:47.686
if your energy source is free.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.207
Normally, efficiency is crucial

00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:52.167
because the fuel cost
of your engine over its life

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:53.866
dwarfs the cost of the engine.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.466
But if your fuel source is free,

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.066
then the only thing that matters

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.106
is the up-front
capital cost of the engine.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.266
So you don't want
to optimize for efficiency,

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.306
you want to optimize for power per dollar.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.546
So using that new twist,
with the new criteria,

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.946
we thought we could
relook at the Stirling engine,

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.786
and also bring genetic algorithms in.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.746
Basically, Robert Stirling
didn't have Gordon Moore before him

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:14.906
to get us three gigahertz
of processor power.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.727
So we took the same genetic algorithm

00:10:16.751 --> 00:10:18.968
that we used earlier
to make that concentrator,

00:10:18.992 --> 00:10:20.444
which didn't work out for us,

00:10:20.468 --> 00:10:22.026
to optimize the Stirling engine,

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.266
and make its design sizes
and all of its dimensions

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.386
the exact optimum
to get the most power per dollar,

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.546
irrespective of weight,
irrespective of size,

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.826
just to get the most conversion
of solar energy,

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.066
because the sun is free.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.426
And that's the process we took --
let me show you how the engine works.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.106
The simplest heat engine,
or hot air engine, of all time

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.346
would be this -- take a box,
a steel canister, with a piston.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.666
Put a flame under it, the piston moves up.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.706
Take it off the flame
and pour water on it, or let it cool down,

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.946
the piston moves down.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.186
That's a heat engine.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.826
That's the most fundamental
heat engine you could have.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.906
The problem is the efficiency
is one hundredth of one percent,

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.346
because you're heating
all the metal of the chamber

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.026
and then cooling all the metal
of the chamber each time.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.586
And you're only getting power from the air
that's heating at the same time,

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.266
but you're wasting energy
heating and cooling the metal.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.346
So someone came up
with a very clever idea.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.746
Instead of heating and cooling
the whole cylinder,

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.786
what about if you put
a displacer inside --

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.266
a little thing that shuttles
the air back and forth.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.786
You move that up and down
with a little bit of energy

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.586
but now you're only shifting the air down
to the hot end and up to the cold end.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.786
So, now you're not alternately heating
and cooling the metal, just the air.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.746
That allows you to get the efficiency up

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.186
from a hundredth of a percent
to about two percent.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.946
And then Robert Stirling
came along with this genius idea,

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.466
which was, well, I'm still
not heating the metal now,

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:38.706
with this kind of engine,

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.466
but I'm still reheating all the air.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.706
I'm still heating the air every time
and cooling the air every time.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.346
What about if I put
a thermal sponge in the middle,

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.266
in the passageway between where the air
has to move between hot and cold?

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.946
So he made fine wires, and cracked glass,

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.666
and all different kinds of materials
to be a heat sponge.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.746
So when the air pushes up
to go from the hot end to the cold end,

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.946
it puts some heat into the sponge.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.626
And then when the air comes back
after it's been cooled,

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.026
it picks up that heat again.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.066
So you're reusing your energy
five or six times,

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.066
and that brings the efficiency
up to between 30 and 40 percent.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.426
It's a little known, but brilliant,
genius invention of Robert Stirling

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.466
that takes the hot air engine
from being somewhat impractical --

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.826
like I found out when I made
the real simple version in high school --

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.266
to very potentially possible,

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.826
once you get the efficiency up,

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.986
if you can design this
to be low enough cost.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.426
So we really set out on a path
to try and make the lowest cost possible.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.586
We built a huge mathematical model
of how a Stirling engine works.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.226
We applied the genetic algorithm.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.706
We got the results from that
for the optimal engine.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:37.946
We built engines --

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.706
so we built 100 different engines
over the last two years.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.866
We measured each one, we readjusted
the model to what we measured,

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.066
and then we led that
to the current prototype.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.226
It led to a very compact,
inexpensive engine,

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.146
and this is what the engine looks like.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.410
Let me show you
what it looks like in real life.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.466
So this is the engine.
It's just a small cylinder down here,

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.186
which holds the generator
inside and all the linkage,

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.546
and it's the hot cap --
the hot cylinder on the top --

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.826
this part gets hot, this part is cool,

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.786
and electricity comes out.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.666
The exact converse is also true.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.066
If you put electricity in,
this will get hot and this will get cold,

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.386
you get refrigeration.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.226
So it's a complete reversible cycle,

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.226
a very efficient cycle,
and quite a simple thing to make.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.146
So now you put the two things together.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.386
So you have the engine.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.266
What if you combine
the petals and the engine in the center?

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.266
The petals track and the engine
gets the concentrated sunlight,

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.466
takes that heat
and turns it into electricity.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.226
This is what the first prototype
of our system looked like

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.386
with the petals
and the engine in the center.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.026
This is being run out in the sun,

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.890
and now I want to show you
what the actual thing looks like.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:50.946
(Applause)

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.186
Thank you.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.866
So this is a unit with the 12 petals.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.826
These petals cost about a dollar each --

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.586
they're lightweight,
injection-molded plastic, aluminized.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.273
The mechanism to control
each petal is below there,

00:14:02.297 --> 00:14:04.346
with a microprocessor on each one.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.306
There are thermocouples on the engine --

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.506
little sensors that detect the heat
when the sunlight strikes them.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.386
Each petal adjusts itself separately
to keep the highest temperature on it.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.626
When the sun comes out in the morning,
the petals will seek the sun,

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.986
find it by searching
for the highest temperature.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.946
About a minute and a half or two minutes
after the rays are striking the hot cap

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.866
the engine will be warm enough to start

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.026
and then the engine
will generate electricity

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.946
for about six and a half hours a day --

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.906
six and a half to seven hours
as the sun moves across the sky.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.066
A critical part
that we can take advantage of

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.426
is that we have these
inexpensive microprocessors

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.346
and each of these petals is autonomous,

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.826
and each of these petals figures out
where the sun is with no user setup.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.746
So you don't have to tell
what latitude, longitude you're at,

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.186
what your roof slope angle is,
or what orientation.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.466
It doesn't really care.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.066
What it does is it searches
to find the hottest spot,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.026
it searches again a half an hour later,
a day later, a month later.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.266
It basically figures out
where on Earth you are

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.226
by watching the direction the sun moves,

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.906
so you don't have to
actually enter anything about that.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.226
The way the unit works is,

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.546
when the sun comes out,
the engine will start

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.106
and you get power out here.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.826
We have AC and DC, get 12 volts DC,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.066
so that could be used
for certain applications.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.666
We have an inverter in there,
so you get 117 volts AC.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.266
And you also get hot water.
The hot water's optional.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.546
You don't have to use it,
it will cool itself.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.786
But you can use it
to optionally heat hot water

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.946
and that brings
the efficiency up even higher

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.706
because some of the heat
that you'd normally be rejecting,

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.106
you can now use as useful energy,
whether it's for a pool or hot water.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.050
Let me show you a quick movie
of what this looks like running.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.626
This is the first test
where we took it outside

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.986
and each of the petals
were individually seeking.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.386
And what they do is step,
very coarsely at first,

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.666
and very finely afterward.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.306
Once they get a temperature reading
on the thermocouple

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.786
indicating they found the sun,

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.546
they slow down and do a fine search.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.746
Then the petals will move into position,
and the engine will start.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.146
We've been working on this
for the last two years.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.546
We're very excited about the progress,
we have a long way to go though.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.826
This is how we envision
it would be in a residential installation:

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.306
you'd probably have
more than one unit on your roof.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.146
It could be on your roof,
your backyard, or somewhere else.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.146
You don't have to have enough units
to power your entire house,

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.706
you just save money
with each incremental one you add.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.826
So you're still using
the grid potentially,

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.506
in this type of application,
to be your backup supply --

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.306
of course, you can't use these at night,
and you can't use these on cloudy days.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.746
But by reducing your energy use,
pretty much at the peak times --

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.986
usually when you have
your air conditioning on,

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.346
or other times like that --

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.866
this generates the peak power
at the peak usage time,

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.866
so it's very complementary in that sense.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.546
This is how we would envision
a residential application.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.306
We also think there's
very big potential for energy farms,

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.426
especially in remote land
where there happens to be a lot of sun.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.906
It's a really good combination
of those two factors.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.466
It turns out there's a lot of powerful sun
all around the world, obviously,

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.746
but in special places

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.626
where it happens to be
relatively inexpensive to place these

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.506
and also in many more places
where there is high wind power.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.906
So an example of that is,
here's the map of the United States.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.346
Pretty much everywhere that's
not green or blue is a really ideal place,

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.386
but even the green or blue areas are good,

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.386
just not as good as the places
that are red, orange and yellow.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.746
But the hot spot right around Las Vegas
and Death Valley is very good.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.850
And is only affects the payback period,

00:17:15.874 --> 00:17:18.306
it doesn't mean that you
couldn't use solar energy;

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.026
you could use it anywhere on Earth.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.706
It just affects the payback period

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.066
if you're comparing
to grid-supplied electricity.

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:26.345
But if you don't have
grid-supplied electricity,

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:29.066
then the question of payback
is a different one entirely.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.306
It's just how many watts
do you get per dollar,

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.546
and how could you benefit from that
to change your life in some way.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.656
This is the map of the whole Earth,

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.737
and you can see
a huge swathe in the middle

00:17:38.761 --> 00:17:40.699
where a large part of the population is,

00:17:40.723 --> 00:17:43.276
there's tremendous chances
for solar energy.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.757
And of course, look at Africa.

00:17:44.781 --> 00:17:48.078
The potential to take advantage
of solar energy there is unbelievable,

00:17:48.102 --> 00:17:51.759
and I'm really excited to talk more
about finding ways we can help with that.

00:17:51.783 --> 00:17:55.505
So, in conclusion, I would say
my journey has shown me

00:17:55.529 --> 00:17:58.826
that you can revisit
old ideas in a new light,

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.546
and sometimes ideas
that have been discarded in the past

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.106
can be practical now if you apply
some new technology or new twists.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.626
We believe we're getting very close
to something practical and affordable.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.826
Our short-term goal for this
is to be half the price of solar cells

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.906
and our longer-term goal
is to be less than a five-year payback.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.066
And at less than a five-year payback,
this becomes very economic.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.146
So you don't have to just have
a feel-good attitude about energy

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.586
to want to have one of these.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.026
It just makes economic sense.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.626
Right now, solar paybacks
are between 30 and 50 years.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.386
If you get it down below five years,

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.386
then it's almost a no-brainer
because the interest to own it --

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.106
someone else will finance it for you
and you can just make money from day one.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.706
So that's our real powerful goal

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.906
that we're really
shooting for in the company.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.066
Two other things that I learned
that were very surprising to me --

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.730
one was how casual we are about energy.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.666
I was walking from the elevator over here,

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.906
and even just looking
at the stage right now --

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.466
so there's probably
20,500-watt lights right now.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.906
There's 10,000 watts of light
pouring on the stage,

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.306
one horsepower
is 746 watts, at full power.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:06.066
So there's basically 15 horses running
at full speed just to keep the stage lit.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.186
Not to mention the 200 horses
that are probably running right now

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.906
to keep the air-conditioning going.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.146
And it's just amazing,

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.026
walk in the elevator,
and there's lights on in the elevator.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:18.866
Of course, now I'm very sensitive at home
when we leave the lights on by mistake.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.706
But, everywhere around us
we have insatiable use for energy

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:22.986
because it's so cheap.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.546
And it's cheap because
we've been subsidized by energy

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.306
that's been concentrated by the sun.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.186
Basically, oil is
solar-energy concentrate.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.546
It's been pounded for a billion years
with a lot of energy

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.826
to make it have all that energy
contained in it.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.306
And we don't have a birthright

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.546
to just use that up
as fast as we are, I think.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.746
And it would be great if we could
make our energy usage renewable,

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.986
where as we're using the energy,
we're creating it at the same pace,

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.706
and I really hope we can get there.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.671
Thank you very much,
you've been a great audience.
