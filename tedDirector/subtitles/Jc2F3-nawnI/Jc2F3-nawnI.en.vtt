00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
So I want to tell you a story -- an encouraging story --

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
about addressing

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
desperation, depression and despair in Afghanistan,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and what we have learned from it,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and how to help people

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
to overcome traumatic experiences

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and how to help them to regain some confidence

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
in the time ahead -- in the future --

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
and how to participate again in everyday life.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
So, I am a Jungian psychoanalyst,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
on an assignment for Medica Mondiale.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Jung in Afghanistan --

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
you get the picture.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and 70 percent of the people are illiterate.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
War and malnutrition kills people

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
together with hope.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
You may know this from the media,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
but what you may not know

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
is that the average age of the Afghan people is 17 years old,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
which means they grow up in such an environment

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and -- I repeat myself --

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
in 30 years of war.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
So this translates

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
into ongoing violence,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
foreign interests, bribery,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
drugs, ethnic conflicts,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
bad health, shame, fear

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and cumulative traumatic experiences.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Local and foreign military

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
are supposed to build peace together with the donors

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and the governmental and non-governmental organizations.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And people had hope, yes,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
but until they realized

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
their situation worsens every day --

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
either because they are being killed

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
or because, somehow,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
they are poorer than eight years ago.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
One figure for that:

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
54 percent of the children under the age of five years

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
suffer from malnutrition.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Yet, there is hope.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
One day a man told me,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
"My future does not look brilliant,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.260
but I want to have a brilliant future for my son."

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
This is a picture I took in 2005,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and for me it's a symbolic picture

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
of an open future for a young generation.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
So, doctors prescribe medication.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And donors

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
are supposed to bring peace

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
by building schools and roads.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Military collect weapons,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
and depression stays intact.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Why?

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Because people don't have tools

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
to cope with it, to get over it.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
So, soon after my arrival,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
I had confirmed something which I had already known;

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe, yes.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
However, what can wound us

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
and our reaction to those wounds --

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
they are universal.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And the big challenge

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
was how to understand the meaning of the symptom

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
in this specific cultural context.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
After a counseling session, a woman said to me,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
"Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and I want to participate again

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
in my family life."

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
This was very important,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
because the family is central

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
in Afghans' social system.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
No one can survive alone.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
And if people feel used, worthless and ashamed,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
because something horrible has happened to them,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
then they retreat, and they fall into social isolation,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and they do not dare to tell this evil

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
to other people or to their loved ones,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
because they do not want to burden them.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And very often violence is a way to cope with it.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Traumatized people also easily lose control --

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks --

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
so people are in a constant fear

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
might come back unexpectedly,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
suddenly,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
and they cannot control it.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
To compensate this loss of inner control,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
they try to control the outside,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
very understandably -- mostly the family --

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and unfortunately,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
this fits very well

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
into the traditional side,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
regressive side, repressive side,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
restrictive side of the cultural context.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
So, husbands start beating wives,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
mothers and fathers beat their children,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and afterward, they feel awful.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
They did not want to do this, it just happened --

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
they lost control.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
The desperate try

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
to restore order and normality,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.260
and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
And partly this is already happening.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
So everybody needs a sense for the future,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and the Afghan sense of the future

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
is shattered.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
But let me repeat the words of the woman.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
"Because you have felt me,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
I can feel myself again."

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
So the key here is empathy.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Somebody has to be a witness

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
to what has happened to you.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Somebody has to feel how you felt.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And somebody has to see you and listen to you.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Everybody must be able

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.260
to know what he or she has experienced is true,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and this only goes with another person.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
So everybody must be able to say,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
"This happened to me, and it did this with me,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
but I'm able to live with it, to cope with it,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and to learn from it.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And I want to engage myself

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
in the bright future for my children

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
and the children of my children,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and I will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter," --

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
what happens too often in Afghanistan.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
So something can be done,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
And I started thinking about a counseling program.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
But, of course, I needed help and funds.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
And one evening,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And I explained to him quickly,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
I would train psycho-social counselors,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
I would open centers, and I explained to him why.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and said, "If you want to do this, call me."

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
At that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
So, I was able to launch a three-year project with Caritas Germany,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and we trained 30 Afghan women and men,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and we opened 15 counseling centers in Kabul.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
This was our sign -- it's hand-painted,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
and we had 45 all over Kabul.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
And 70 percent regained their lives.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
This was a very exciting time,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
developing this with my wonderful Afghan team.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
And they are working with me up to today.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
We developed a culturally-sensitive

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
psycho-social counseling approach.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
So, from 2008 up until today,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
a substantial change and step forward

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
has been taking place.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
The European Union delegation in Kabul

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
came into this and hired me to work

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
inside the Ministry of Public Health,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
to lobby this approach --

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
we succeeded.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
We revised the mental health component

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
of the primary health care services

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
by adding psycho-social care

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and psycho-social counselors to the system.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
This means, certainly, to retrain all health staff.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
But for that, we already have the training manuals,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
which are approved by the Ministry

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
and moreover, this approach is now part

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
So we also have implemented it already

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
in some selected clinics in three provinces,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
and you are the first to see the results.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
We wanted to know if what is being done is effective.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And here you can see

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
the patients all had symptoms of depression,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
moderate and severe.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
And the red line is the treatment as usual --

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
medication with a medical doctor.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And all the symptoms

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
stayed the same or even got worse.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
And the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
without medication.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
which is explicable,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
but you can learn how to cope with them.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
So this makes us very happy,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
because now we also have some evidence

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
that this is working.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
So here you see,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and every morning it looks like this all over.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
but now this will change.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
They go to the clinics,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
because they want to cure their immediate symptoms,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
and they will find somebody to talk to

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
and discuss these issues

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and talk about what is burdening them

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
and find solutions, develop their resources,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.260
learn tools to solve their family conflicts

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
and gain some confidence in the future.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And I would like to share one short vignette.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.260
One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
"If we were to have met some years ago,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
then we would have killed each other.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
And now you are helping me

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
to regain some confidence in the future."

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And another counselor said to me after the training,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
"You know, I never knew why I survived the killings in my village,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
but now I know,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
because I am part of a nucleus

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan."

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
So I believe this kept me running.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
to peace and reconciliation.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
And also -- I think --

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
without psycho-social therapy,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
and without considering this

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
in all humanitarian projects,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
we cannot build-up civil societies.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
I thought it was an idea worth spreading,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
and I think it must be,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
can be, could be replicated elsewhere.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
I thank you for your attention.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:32.260
(Applause)
