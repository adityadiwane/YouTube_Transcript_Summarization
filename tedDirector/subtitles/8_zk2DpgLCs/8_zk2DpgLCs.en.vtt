00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:21.236
Imagine a big explosion
as you climb through 3,000 ft.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:24.999
Imagine a plane full of smoke.

00:00:25.622 --> 00:00:28.650
Imagine an engine
going clack, clack, clack.

00:00:29.603 --> 00:00:30.983
It sounds scary.

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:33.343
Well, I had a unique seat that day.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.086
I was sitting in 1D.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.919
I was the only one who could talk
to the flight attendants.

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:39.993
So I looked at them right away,

00:00:40.017 --> 00:00:42.995
and they said, "No problem.
We probably hit some birds."

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.191
The pilot had already
turned the plane around,

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:46.485
and we weren't that far.

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:47.950
You could see Manhattan.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.586
Two minutes later,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.478
three things happened at the same time.

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:57.236
The pilot lines up the plane
with the Hudson River.

00:00:58.453 --> 00:00:59.848
That's usually not the route.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.898
(Laughter)

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:03.653
He turns off the engines.

00:01:04.662 --> 00:01:06.791
Now, imagine being
in a plane with no sound.

00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:10.134
And then he says three words.

00:01:10.158 --> 00:01:12.536
The most unemotional
three words I've ever heard.

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:14.648
He says, "Brace for impact."

00:01:16.473 --> 00:01:19.090
I didn't have to talk
to the flight attendant anymore.

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:21.236
(Laughter)

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:24.388
I could see in her eyes, it was terror.

00:01:24.412 --> 00:01:25.656
Life was over.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.611
Now I want to share with you three things
I learned about myself that day.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.559
I learned that it
all changes in an instant.

00:01:34.942 --> 00:01:36.664
We have this bucket list,

00:01:36.688 --> 00:01:39.031
we have these things
we want to do in life,

00:01:39.055 --> 00:01:42.572
and I thought about all the people
I wanted to reach out to that I didn't,

00:01:42.596 --> 00:01:44.728
all the fences I wanted to mend,

00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:47.367
all the experiences I wanted
to have and I never did.

00:01:48.523 --> 00:01:50.934
As I thought about that later on,

00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.236
I came up with a saying,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.333
which is, "I collect bad wines."

00:01:55.357 --> 00:01:58.666
Because if the wine is ready
and the person is there, I'm opening it.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.342
I no longer want to postpone
anything in life.

00:02:01.932 --> 00:02:05.149
And that urgency, that purpose,
has really changed my life.

00:02:06.498 --> 00:02:08.580
The second thing I learned that day --

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:11.236
and this is as we clear
the George Washington Bridge,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.444
which was by not a lot --

00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:15.043
(Laughter)

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:18.748
I thought about, wow,
I really feel one real regret.

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.236
I've lived a good life.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.236
In my own humanity and mistakes,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.094
I've tried to get better
at everything I tried.

00:02:25.118 --> 00:02:28.236
But in my humanity,
I also allow my ego to get in.

00:02:29.302 --> 00:02:33.553
And I regretted the time I wasted
on things that did not matter

00:02:33.577 --> 00:02:35.150
with people that matter.

00:02:36.057 --> 00:02:38.436
And I thought about
my relationship with my wife,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.071
with my friends, with people.

00:02:41.122 --> 00:02:43.063
And after, as I reflected on that,

00:02:43.087 --> 00:02:45.614
I decided to eliminate
negative energy from my life.

00:02:45.638 --> 00:02:48.018
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:50.782
I've not had a fight
with my wife in two years.

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:52.018
It feels great.

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:54.342
I no longer try to be right;

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:55.783
I choose to be happy.

00:02:57.314 --> 00:02:58.775
The third thing I learned --

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.240
and this is as your mental clock
starts going, "15, 14, 13."

00:03:03.264 --> 00:03:04.700
You can see the water coming.

00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:06.236
I'm saying, "Please blow up."

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.403
I don't want this thing
to break in 20 pieces

00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:10.449
like you've seen in those documentaries.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.521
And as we're coming down,

00:03:13.545 --> 00:03:18.236
I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.236
It's almost like we've been preparing
for it our whole lives.

00:03:21.963 --> 00:03:23.191
But it was very sad.

00:03:23.622 --> 00:03:25.582
I didn't want to go; I love my life.

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:30.692
And that sadness
really framed in one thought,

00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:33.236
which is, I only wish for one thing.

00:03:34.072 --> 00:03:36.113
I only wish I could see my kids grow up.

00:03:37.757 --> 00:03:41.234
About a month later,
I was at a performance by my daughter --

00:03:41.258 --> 00:03:43.965
first-grader, not much artistic talent --

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.063
(Laughter)

00:03:45.087 --> 00:03:46.190
Yet!

00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:48.068
(Laughter)

00:03:48.092 --> 00:03:52.235
And I'm bawling,
I'm crying, like a little kid.

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:55.436
And it made all the sense
in the world to me.

00:03:55.844 --> 00:03:59.585
I realized at that point,
by connecting those two dots,

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.951
that the only thing
that matters in my life

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.236
is being a great dad.

00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:06.859
Above all, above all,

00:04:06.883 --> 00:04:09.251
the only goal I have in life
is to be a good dad.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.105
I was given the gift of a miracle,

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:14.633
of not dying that day.

00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:16.470
I was given another gift,

00:04:16.494 --> 00:04:19.021
which was to be able
to see into the future

00:04:19.045 --> 00:04:20.322
and come back

00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:22.398
and live differently.

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:26.150
I challenge you guys
that are flying today,

00:04:26.174 --> 00:04:28.825
imagine the same thing
happens on your plane --

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.236
and please don't --

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.853
but imagine, and how would you change?

00:04:32.877 --> 00:04:34.157
What would you get done

00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:37.857
that you're waiting to get done
because you think you'll be here forever?

00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:39.828
How would you change your relationships

00:04:39.852 --> 00:04:41.536
and the negative energy in them?

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.536
And more than anything,
are you being the best parent you can?

00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:46.037
Thank you.

00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:49.061
(Applause)
