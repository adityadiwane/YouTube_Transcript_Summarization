00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.150
This picture

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.349
is from my metro card

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:20.413
when I spent a year abroad in Paris
in college in the mid-'90s.

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:23.970
My friend says I look
like a French anarchist --

00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:25.001
(Laughter)

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.372
But this is still what I see

00:00:26.396 --> 00:00:28.563
when I look in the mirror in the morning.

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:31.686
Within a month of living in Paris,
I'd lost 15 pounds

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.745
and I was in the best shape of my life

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:35.766
because I was eating fresh food

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.067
and I was walking wherever I went.

00:00:38.828 --> 00:00:40.639
Having grown up in suburban Atlanta,

00:00:40.663 --> 00:00:44.068
a region built largely
by highways and automobiles

00:00:44.092 --> 00:00:47.753
and with a reputation
as a poster child for sprawl,

00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:50.339
Paris fundamentally changed
the way I understood

00:00:50.363 --> 00:00:53.083
the construction of the world around me,

00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:55.936
and I got obsessed with the role
of infrastructure --

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:00.713
that it's not just the way to move people
from point A to point B,

00:01:00.737 --> 00:01:04.826
it's not just the way to convey water
or sewage or energy,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.420
but it's the foundation for our economy.

00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:10.807
It's the foundation for our social life
and for our culture,

00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:13.539
and it really matters
to the way that we live.

00:01:14.118 --> 00:01:16.702
When I came home,
I was instantly frustrated,

00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:20.652
stuck in traffic as I crossed
the top end of our perimeter highway.

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:22.943
Not only was I not moving a muscle,

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:24.612
I had no social interaction

00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:27.875
with the hundreds of thousands of people
that were hurtling past me,

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.896
like me, with their eyes faced forward
and their music blaring.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:35.562
I wondered if this was
an inevitable outcome,

00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:37.405
or could we do something about it.

00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:41.045
Was it possible to transform
this condition in Atlanta

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.444
into the kind of place
that I wanted to live in?

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:47.045
I went back to grad school
in architecture and city planning,

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.401
developed this interest in infrastructure,

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:52.018
and in 1999 came up with an idea

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:53.607
for my thesis project:

00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:57.948
the adaptation of an obsolete loop
of old railroad circling downtown

00:01:57.972 --> 00:02:01.012
as a new infrastructure
for urban revitalization.

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:02.442
It was just an idea.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.191
I never thought
we would actually build it.

00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:08.699
But I went to work
at an architecture firm,

00:02:08.723 --> 00:02:11.246
and eventually talked
to my coworkers about it,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.038
and they loved the idea.

00:02:13.062 --> 00:02:15.448
And as we started talking
to more people about it,

00:02:15.472 --> 00:02:17.500
more people wanted to hear about it.

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.888
In the summer of 2001,

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.896
we connected with Cathy Woolard,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.051
who was soon elected
city council president.

00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:27.501
And we built a citywide vision
around this idea:

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:30.456
the Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.334
of transit and trails and transformation.

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:38.059
I was doing two and three meetings a week
for two and a half years,

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:41.528
and so was Cathy and her staff
and a handful of volunteers.

00:02:41.552 --> 00:02:45.851
Together, we built this amazing movement
of people and ideas.

00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:49.998
It included community advocates
who were used to fighting against things,

00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:53.335
but found the Atlanta BeltLine
as something that they could fight for;

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.084
developers who saw the opportunity

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:58.043
to take advantage of a lot
of new growth in the city;

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:02.713
and dozens of nonprofit partners
who saw their mission

00:03:02.737 --> 00:03:05.857
at least partly accomplished
by the shared vision.

00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:11.118
Now, usually these groups of people
aren't at the same table

00:03:11.142 --> 00:03:12.710
wanting the same outcome.

00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:16.469
But there we were,
and it was kind of weird,

00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:19.353
but it was really, really powerful.

00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:22.770
The people of Atlanta
fell in love with a vision

00:03:22.794 --> 00:03:26.098
that was better than what they saw
through their car windshields,

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:28.624
and the people of Atlanta made it happen,

00:03:28.648 --> 00:03:31.865
and I guarantee you we would not
be building it otherwise.

00:03:32.476 --> 00:03:35.319
From the beginning,
our coalition was diverse.

00:03:35.343 --> 00:03:38.466
People of all stripes
were part of our story.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.306
People on the lower end
of the economic spectrum loved it, too.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.520
They were just afraid
they weren't going to be able to be there

00:03:45.544 --> 00:03:47.713
when it got built,
that they'd be priced out.

00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:50.820
And we've all heard
that kind of story before, right?

00:03:51.852 --> 00:03:54.914
But we promised that
the Atlanta BeltLine would be different,

00:03:54.938 --> 00:03:56.972
and people took ownership of the idea,

00:03:56.996 --> 00:03:59.570
and they made it better
than anything we ever imagined

00:03:59.594 --> 00:04:00.795
in the beginning,

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.079
including significant
subsidies for housing,

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:08.912
new parks, art, an arboretum --
a list that continues to grow.

00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:10.102
And we put in place

00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:13.749
the organizations and agencies
that were required to make it happen.

00:04:13.773 --> 00:04:16.102
And importantly, it is.

00:04:16.126 --> 00:04:19.894
Now we're in the early stages
of implementation, and it's working.

00:04:19.918 --> 00:04:24.711
The first mainline section
of trail was opened in 2012,

00:04:24.735 --> 00:04:27.392
and it's already generated
over three billion dollars

00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:29.102
of private-sector investment.

00:04:30.784 --> 00:04:33.500
But it's not only changing
the physical form of the city,

00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:35.934
it's changing the way
we think about the city,

00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.659
and what our expectations are
for living there.

00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:41.814
About a month ago,

00:04:41.838 --> 00:04:44.673
I had to take my kids with me
to the grocery store

00:04:44.697 --> 00:04:46.369
and they were complaining about it,

00:04:46.393 --> 00:04:48.441
because they didn't want
to get in the car.

00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:52.465
They were saying, "Dad, if we have to go,

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:54.218
can we at least ride our bikes?"

00:04:54.242 --> 00:04:56.548
And I said, "Of course we can.

00:04:56.572 --> 00:04:58.607
That's what people in Atlanta do.

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.050
We ride our bikes to the grocery store."

00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:02.307
(Laughter)

00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:03.931
(Applause)

00:05:03.955 --> 00:05:05.210
Thank you, yeah.

00:05:05.234 --> 00:05:07.965
Now, they don't know
how ridiculous that is,

00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:09.660
but I do.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:13.693
And I also understand
that their expectations for Atlanta

00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:15.203
are really powerful.

00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:18.996
This kind of transformation
is exactly like sprawl

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.623
in the last century,

00:05:20.647 --> 00:05:24.067
the movement where our investment
in highways and automobiles

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:26.229
fundamentally changed American life.

00:05:26.686 --> 00:05:29.096
That wasn't some grand conspiracy.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.599
There were conspiracies
within it, of course.

00:05:32.044 --> 00:05:34.137
But it was a cultural momentum.

00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:36.730
It was millions of people
making millions of decisions

00:05:36.754 --> 00:05:38.346
over an extended period of time,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.132
that fundamentally changed
not only the way that we build cities,

00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:44.170
but it changed our expectations

00:05:44.194 --> 00:05:45.534
for our lives.

00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:49.864
These changes were the foundations
for urban sprawl.

00:05:49.888 --> 00:05:52.002
We didn't call it sprawl at that time.

00:05:52.026 --> 00:05:53.553
We called it the future.

00:05:53.577 --> 00:05:54.967
And it was.

00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:59.042
And we got all the highways
and strip malls and cul-de-sacs we wanted.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.796
It was a radical transformation,

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.433
but it was built by a cultural momentum.

00:06:04.457 --> 00:06:06.031
So it's important to not separate

00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:08.529
the physical construction
of the places we live

00:06:08.553 --> 00:06:11.244
from other things that
are happening at that time.

00:06:11.268 --> 00:06:12.796
At that time,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.081
in the second half of the last century,

00:06:15.105 --> 00:06:17.097
science was curing disease

00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:18.990
and lifting us to the moon,

00:06:19.014 --> 00:06:21.545
and the sexual revolution
was breaking down barriers,

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:23.681
and the Civil Rights Movement
began its march

00:06:23.705 --> 00:06:26.640
toward the fulfillment
of our nation's promise.

00:06:26.664 --> 00:06:31.401
Television, entertainment, food, travel,
business -- everything was changing,

00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:34.725
and both the public
and private sectors were colluding

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:36.994
to give us the lives we wanted.

00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:39.750
The Federal Highway Administration,

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:43.071
for example, didn't exist
before there were highways.

00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:44.972
Think about it.

00:06:44.996 --> 00:06:46.020
(Laughter)

00:06:46.044 --> 00:06:49.031
Of course, today it's important
to understand and acknowledge

00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:51.850
that those benefits accrued
to some groups of people

00:06:51.874 --> 00:06:53.146
and not to others.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.920
It was not an equitable cultural momentum.

00:06:56.692 --> 00:07:00.358
But when we look today
in wonder and disgust, maybe,

00:07:00.382 --> 00:07:02.845
at the metropolis sprawl before us,

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:04.621
we wonder if we're stuck.

00:07:05.067 --> 00:07:07.708
Are we stuck with the legacy
of that inequity?

00:07:08.234 --> 00:07:11.837
Are we stuck with this dystopian
traffic hellscape?

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:15.455
Are we stuck with rampant
urban displacement,

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:17.861
with environmental degradation?

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:21.037
Are we stuck with social isolation

00:07:21.061 --> 00:07:23.021
or political polarization?

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.165
Are these the inevitable
and permanent outcomes?

00:07:26.744 --> 00:07:29.722
Or are they the result
of our collective cultural decisions

00:07:29.746 --> 00:07:31.462
that we've made for ourselves?

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:33.804
And if they are,

00:07:34.658 --> 00:07:36.071
can't we change them?

00:07:36.803 --> 00:07:39.437
What I have learned
from our experience in Atlanta

00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:40.970
is not an anomaly.

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:43.365
Similar stories
are playing out everywhere,

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:46.202
where people are reclaiming
not only old railroads,

00:07:46.226 --> 00:07:50.085
but also degraded urban waterways
and obsolete roadways,

00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:52.449
reinventing all of the infrastructure

00:07:52.473 --> 00:07:53.812
in their lives.

00:07:53.836 --> 00:07:55.760
Whether here in New York

00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:57.020
or in Houston

00:07:57.044 --> 00:07:58.347
or Miami,

00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:01.034
Detroit, Philadelphia,

00:08:01.058 --> 00:08:03.370
Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore,

00:08:03.394 --> 00:08:05.031
Toronto and Paris,

00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:09.183
cities big and small all over the world
are reclaiming and reinventing

00:08:09.207 --> 00:08:10.880
this infrastructure for themselves,

00:08:10.904 --> 00:08:14.910
including the mother
of all catalyst infrastructure projects,

00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:16.987
the Los Angeles River,

00:08:17.485 --> 00:08:20.255
the revitalization effort
for which similarly started

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:21.653
as a grassroots movement,

00:08:21.677 --> 00:08:24.013
has developed into a cultural momentum,

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:27.479
and is now in the early stages
of being transformed

00:08:27.503 --> 00:08:30.808
into some kind of life-affirming
infrastructure again,

00:08:30.832 --> 00:08:35.227
this one with trails and parks
and fishing and boating

00:08:35.251 --> 00:08:37.186
and community revitalization,

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.266
and of course, water quality
and flood control.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.770
It's already improving
the lives of people.

00:08:42.794 --> 00:08:46.675
It's already changing the way
the rest of us think about Los Angeles.

00:08:47.246 --> 00:08:49.376
This is more than just infrastructure.

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:52.190
We're building new lives for ourselves.

00:08:52.214 --> 00:08:55.768
It's a movement that includes
local food, urban agriculture,

00:08:55.792 --> 00:08:58.038
craft beer, the maker movement,

00:08:58.062 --> 00:09:02.841
tech and design -- all of these things,
early indicators of a really radical shift

00:09:02.865 --> 00:09:04.545
in the way we build cities.

00:09:05.132 --> 00:09:07.082
We're taking places like this

00:09:08.534 --> 00:09:10.654
and transforming them into this.

00:09:12.669 --> 00:09:14.037
And soon this.

00:09:15.063 --> 00:09:17.730
And this is all exciting and good.

00:09:18.436 --> 00:09:20.402
We're changing the world for the better.

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:21.892
Good for us!

00:09:22.263 --> 00:09:24.636
And it is awesome -- I mean that.

00:09:24.956 --> 00:09:26.926
But our history of sprawl,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.886
and from what we can already see
with these catalyst projects today,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.094
we know and must remember

00:09:33.118 --> 00:09:36.476
that big changes like this
don't usually benefit everyone.

00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:40.550
The market forces unleashed
by this cultural momentum

00:09:40.574 --> 00:09:42.999
often include the seemingly unstoppable

00:09:43.023 --> 00:09:47.508
and inevitable cycle of rising taxes,
prices and rents.

00:09:47.933 --> 00:09:49.308
This is urgent.

00:09:49.332 --> 00:09:51.474
If we care, we have to stand up

00:09:51.498 --> 00:09:52.815
and speak out.

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:54.622
This should be a call to action,

00:09:54.646 --> 00:09:57.706
because the answer can't be
to not improve communities.

00:09:58.717 --> 00:10:03.191
The answer can't be to not build parks
and transit and grocery stores.

00:10:03.215 --> 00:10:06.128
The answer can't be
to hold communities down

00:10:06.152 --> 00:10:07.905
just to keep them affordable.

00:10:08.523 --> 00:10:11.800
But we do have to follow through
and address the financial realities

00:10:11.824 --> 00:10:13.054
that we're facing.

00:10:13.078 --> 00:10:15.534
This is hard, and it won't
happen on its own.

00:10:15.897 --> 00:10:18.770
We can do it, and I'm committed
to this goal in Atlanta,

00:10:18.794 --> 00:10:23.496
to sticking up again for people
who made it possible in the first place.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.794
We can't call it a success without them.

00:10:26.105 --> 00:10:27.412
I certainly can't,

00:10:27.436 --> 00:10:30.368
because the people I made
commitments to all those years

00:10:30.392 --> 00:10:32.253
weren't abstract populations.

00:10:32.615 --> 00:10:34.435
They're my friends and neighbors.

00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:36.109
They're people that I love.

00:10:36.974 --> 00:10:39.508
So even though it started
as my graduate thesis

00:10:39.532 --> 00:10:42.504
and I'm working hard for 16 years
with thousands of people

00:10:42.528 --> 00:10:44.678
to help make this thing come to life,

00:10:44.702 --> 00:10:48.619
I know and believe that who
the BeltLine is being built for

00:10:48.643 --> 00:10:51.435
is just as important
as whether it's built at all.

00:10:52.065 --> 00:10:53.391
Not just in Atlanta,

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:55.413
but locally and globally,

00:10:55.437 --> 00:10:56.939
we have to understand

00:10:57.606 --> 00:11:00.967
this accountability to the people
whose lives we are changing,

00:11:01.287 --> 00:11:02.570
because this is us.

00:11:03.418 --> 00:11:05.800
We are the lives we're talking about.

00:11:06.431 --> 00:11:08.068
These places aren't inevitable.

00:11:08.092 --> 00:11:10.234
The places we live aren't inevitable,

00:11:10.797 --> 00:11:13.815
and if we want something different,
we just need to speak up.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:16.413
We have to ensure that change
comes on our terms.

00:11:16.437 --> 00:11:17.592
And to do that,

00:11:17.616 --> 00:11:21.888
we have to participate actively
in the process of shaping change.

00:11:22.547 --> 00:11:23.699
Thank you.

00:11:23.723 --> 00:11:25.636
(Applause)
