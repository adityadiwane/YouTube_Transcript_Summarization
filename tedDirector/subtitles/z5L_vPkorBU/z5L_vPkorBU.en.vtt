00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.670
I'm here to show you

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.371
how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.

00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:22.174
You're about to experience a new, available

00:00:22.174 --> 00:00:25.154
and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink

00:00:25.154 --> 00:00:27.282
how we waterproof our lives.

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:30.002
What I have here is a cinder block

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.498
that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:35.090
that can be applied to almost any material.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.427
It's called Ultra-Ever Dry,

00:00:37.427 --> 00:00:39.853
and when you apply it to any material,

00:00:39.853 --> 00:00:42.958
it turns into a superhydrophobic shield.

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.484
So this is a cinder block, uncoated,

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:49.785
and you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water.

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:52.439
Not anymore.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:56.666
Porous, nonporous.

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.418
So what's superhydrophobic?

00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:01.911
Superhydrophobic is how we measure

00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:04.393
a drop of water on a surface.

00:01:04.393 --> 00:01:06.793
The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is,

00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:09.721
and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic.

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:12.667
A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:15.607
to about 90 degrees.

00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:18.695
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:21.476
But what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees,

00:01:21.476 --> 00:01:25.488
and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic.

00:01:25.488 --> 00:01:27.037
So as part of the demonstration,

00:01:27.037 --> 00:01:29.551
what I have is a pair of gloves,

00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:31.719
and we've coated one of the gloves

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.423
with the nanotechnology coating,

00:01:34.423 --> 00:01:36.223
and let's see if you can tell which one,

00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:38.559
and I'll give you a hint.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.904
Did you guess the one that was dry?

00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:52.606
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience,

00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:55.278
what's occurred is that we're able to now

00:01:55.278 --> 00:01:57.791
look at atoms and molecules and actually control them

00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:00.223
for great benefits.

00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:02.222
And we're talking really small here.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.494
The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers,

00:02:04.494 --> 00:02:08.321
and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter,

00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:09.968
and to put some scale to that,

00:02:09.968 --> 00:02:13.274
if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick,

00:02:13.274 --> 00:02:16.089
and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them,

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:18.937
you'd be the width of a human hair.

00:02:18.937 --> 00:02:21.945
So very small, but very useful.

00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:24.849
And it's not just water that this works with.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.600
It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.769
water-based paint,

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.417
mud,

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:34.800
and also some refined oils as well.

00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:43.605
You can see the difference.

00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:45.095
Moving onto the next demonstration,

00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:47.389
we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it,

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.639
we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating,

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.414
and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle,

00:02:54.414 --> 00:02:56.375
and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:57.925
like you'd normally think it would,

00:02:57.925 --> 00:03:01.519
except when it hits the coating, it stops,

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.304
and I can't even coax it to leave.

00:03:05.304 --> 00:03:06.907
It's that afraid of the water.

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:10.627
(Applause)

00:03:10.627 --> 00:03:12.379
So what's going on here? What's happening?

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.667
Well, the surface of the spray coating

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:17.428
is actually filled with nanoparticles

00:03:17.428 --> 00:03:19.502
that form a very rough and craggly surface.

00:03:19.502 --> 00:03:22.091
You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.

00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:24.862
And it has billions of interstitial spaces,

00:03:24.862 --> 00:03:27.971
and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles,

00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:30.323
reach up and grab the air molecules,

00:03:30.323 --> 00:03:32.386
and cover the surface with air.

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:35.131
It's an umbrella of air all across it,

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:37.771
and that layer of air is what the water hits,

00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:40.819
the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.835
So if I put this inside this water here,

00:03:42.835 --> 00:03:46.955
you can see a silver reflective coating around it,

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:48.411
and that silver reflective coating

00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:50.682
is the layer of air that's protecting the water

00:03:50.682 --> 00:03:54.449
from touching the paddle, and it's dry.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.837
So what are the applications?

00:03:59.837 --> 00:04:02.285
I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.

00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:03.783
Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says,

00:04:03.783 --> 00:04:05.712
"Oh, I could use it for this and this and this."

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.774
The applications in a general sense

00:04:07.774 --> 00:04:10.604
could be anything that's anti-wetting.

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:12.869
We've certainly seen that today.

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.453
It could be anything that's anti-icing,

00:04:15.453 --> 00:04:18.908
because if you don't have water, you don't have ice.

00:04:18.908 --> 00:04:21.180
It could be anti-corrosion.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.206
No water, no corrosion.

00:04:23.206 --> 00:04:25.404
It could be anti-bacterial.

00:04:25.404 --> 00:04:28.113
Without water, the bacteria won't survive.

00:04:28.113 --> 00:04:31.932
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well.

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:37.501
So imagine how something like this

00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:41.622
could help revolutionize your field of work.

00:04:41.622 --> 00:04:44.021
And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration,

00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:46.622
but before I do that, I would like to say thank you,

00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:48.665
and think small.

00:04:57.098 --> 00:05:04.646
(Applause)

00:05:04.646 --> 00:05:09.035
It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.

00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:13.817
Chris Anderson: You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED? (Laughter)

00:05:13.817 --> 00:05:15.567
[Two minutes later...]

00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:18.251
He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.814
It's happening!

00:05:20.814 --> 00:05:24.814
(Applause)
