00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Everyone's familiar with cancer,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
but we don't normally think of cancer

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
as being a contagious disease.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
The Tasmanian devil has shown us

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
that, not only can cancer be a contagious disease,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
but it can also threaten

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
an entire species with extinction.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.260
So first of all, what is a Tasmanian devil?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Many of you might be familiar with Taz, the cartoon character,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
the one that spins around and around and around.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
But not many people know

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
like a kangaroo.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
The Tasmanian devil got its name

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.260
from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:15.260
(Screaming)

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
(Laughter)

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and it uses its powerful jaws

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
and its sharp teeth

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
which is that small island

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
just to the south of the mainland of Australia.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And despite their ferocious appearance,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Tasmanian devils are actually

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
quite adorable little animals.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
In fact, growing up in Tasmania,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
it always was incredibly exciting

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
when we got a chance to see

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
a Tasmanian devil in the wild.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
But the Tasmanian devil population

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.260
has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And in fact, there's concern

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
that the species could go extinct in the wild

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
within 20 to 30 years.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And the reason for that

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
is the emergence of a new disease,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
a contagious cancer.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
The story begins in 1996

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
of a Tasmanian devil

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
with a large tumor on its face.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
At the time, this was thought to be a one-off.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Animals, just like humans,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
sometimes get strange tumors.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
However, we now believe

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
that this is the first sighting of a new disease,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.260
which is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
The disease was first sighted

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
in the northeast of Tasmania in 1996

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Now there's only a small part of the population,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
which remains unaffected.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
This disease appears first as tumors,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
usually on the face or inside the mouth

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
of affected Tasmanian devils.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
such as these ones here.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
And the next image I'm going to show

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
is quite gruesome.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
But inevitably, these tumors progress

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.260
towards being enormous, ulcerating tumors like this one here.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
This one in particular sticks in my mind,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
because this is the first case of this disease

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
that I saw myself.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
with this huge ulcerating, foul-smelling tumor

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
inside her mouth

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.260
that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
She hadn't eaten for days.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And yet, she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
in her pouch.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Of course, they died along with the mother.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
They were too young to survive without their mother.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
In fact, in the area where she comes from,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
more than 90 percent of the Tasmanian devil population

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
has already died of this disease.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Scientists around the world

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
were intrigued by this cancer,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
this infectious cancer,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
which is spread by a virus,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and to the AIDS epidemic,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.260
which is associated with a number of different types of cancer.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
was spread by a virus.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
However, we now know -- and I'll tell you right now --

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.260
In fact, the infectious agent of disease in this cancer

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
is something altogether more sinister,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and something that we hadn't really thought of before.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
But in order for me to explain what that is,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
I need to spend just a couple of minutes

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
talking more about cancer itself.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Cancer is a disease

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
that affects millions of people around the world every year.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
One in three people in this room

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
will develop cancer at some stage in their lives.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
when I was only 14.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Cancer occurs

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
when a single cell in your body

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
acquires a set of random mutations in important genes

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that cause that cell to start to produce

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.260
more and more and more copies of itself.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Paradoxically, once established,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
natural selection actually favors

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
the continued growth of cancer.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Natural selection is survival of the fittest.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
And when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
if one of them acquires new mutations,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
which allow them to grow more quickly,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
acquire nutrients more successfully,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
invade the body,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
they'll be selected for by evolution.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.260
That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
It evolves.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Throw a drug at it,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
and resistant cells will grow back.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
An amazing fact is that,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
given the right environment and the right nutrients,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
a cancer cell has the potential

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
to go on growing forever.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
However cancer is constrained

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
by living inside our bodies,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and its continued growth,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
its spreading through our bodies

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
and eating away at our tissues,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
leads to the death of the cancer patient

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and also to the death of the cancer itself.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
So cancer could be thought of

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.260
as a strange, short-lived, self-destructive life form --

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
an evolutionary dead end.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
has acquired an absolutely amazing

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
evolutionary adaptation.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
And the answer came from studying

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
This was work from many people,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
that I did a few years ago.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
The next slide is going to be gruesome.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
This is Jonas.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
He's a Tasmanian devil that we found

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
with a large tumor on his face.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
And being a geneticist,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
I'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
So I took this opportunity

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
to collect some samples from Jonas' tumor

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and also some samples from other parts of his body.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
I took these back to the lab.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
I extracted DNA from them.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
to that of the rest of his body,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.260
I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
In fact, Jonas and his tumor

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
were as different from each other

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
as you and the person sitting next to you.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
What this told us was that Jonas' tumor

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
did not arise from cells of his own body.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
In fact, more genetic profiling

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
told us that this tumor in Jonas

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
actually probably first arose

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil --

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
and Jonas was clearly a male.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
So how come

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
is growing on Jonas' face?

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Well the next breakthrough

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
from all around Tasmania.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
We found that all of these cancers

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
shared the same DNA.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
Think about that for a minute.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
That means that all of these cancers

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
actually are the same cancer

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
that arose once from one individual devil,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
that have broken free of that first devil's body

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
But how can a cancer spread in a population?

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
Well the final piece of the puzzle came

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
They tend to bite each other,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
often quite ferociously and usually on the face.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
We think that cancer cells

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
actually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
When the devil bites another devil,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
so the tumor continues to grow.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
So this Tasmanian devil cancer

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
is perhaps the ultimate cancer.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
It spreads through the population,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
and it's the only cancer that we know of

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.260
that's threatening an entire species with extinction.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
why hasn't it happened in other animals

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
or even humans?

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Well the answer is, it has.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
This is Kimbo.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.260
He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Last year, his owner noticed some blood

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
trickling from his genital region.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
She took him to the vet

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
and the vet discovered something quite disgusting.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
And if you're squeamish, please look away now.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
He discovered this,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
a huge bleeding tumor

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
at the base of Kimbo's penis.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
a sexually transmitted cancer

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
that affects dogs.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
through the spread of living cancer cells,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
so is this dog cancer.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
But this dog cancer is quite remarkable,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
because it spread all around the world.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And in fact, these same cells

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
that are affecting Kimbo here

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
are also found affecting dogs

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
in New York City,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
in mountain villages in the Himalayas

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and in Outback Australia.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
We also believe this cancer might be very old.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
In fact, genetic profiling tells

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
that it may be tens of thousands of years old,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
which means that this cancer

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
may have first arisen

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
from the cells of a wolf

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
that lived alongside the Neanderthals.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
This cancer is remarkable.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.260
It's the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
It's a living relic

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
of the distant past.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
So we've seen that this can happen in animals.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.260
Could cancers be contagious between people?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
Well this is a question

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
which fascinated Chester Southam,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
a cancer doctor in the 1950s.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
Ad he decided to put this to the test

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
by actually deliberately inoculating people

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
with cancer from somebody else.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.260
And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in 1957

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
injecting cancer into a volunteer,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
who in this case was an inmate

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
in Ohio State Penitentiary.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
Most of the people that Dr. Southam injected

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
did not go on to develop cancer

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
from the injected cells.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
But a small number of them did,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill --

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
whose immune systems were probably compromised.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
What this tells us,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
ethical issues aside,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
is that ...

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
(Laughter)

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
it's probably extremely rare

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
for cancers to be transferred between people.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
However, under some circumstances,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
it can happen.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
And I think that this is something

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
that oncologists and epidemiologists

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
should be aware of in the future.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
So just finally,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
cancer is an inevitable outcome

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
of the ability of our cells

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
to divide

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
and to adapt to their environments.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
But that does not mean that we should give up hope

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
in the fight against cancer.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
In fact, I believe, given more knowledge

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
we can defeat cancer.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
My personal aim

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.260
is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
Let's prevent the Tasmanian devil

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
from being the first animal

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
to go extinct from cancer.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Thank you.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:57.260
(Applause)
