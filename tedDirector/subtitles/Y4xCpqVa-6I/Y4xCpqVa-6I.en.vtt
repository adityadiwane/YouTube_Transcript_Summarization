00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I am passionate about the American landscape

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and how the physical form of the land,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
from the great Central Valley of California

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
to the bedrock of Manhattan,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
has really shaped our history and our character.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
But one thing is clear.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
In the last 100 years alone,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
our country -- and this is a sprawl map of America --

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
our country has systematically

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
flattened and homogenized the landscape

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
to the point where we've forgotten

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
our relationship with the plants and animals

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
that live alongside us

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and the dirt beneath our feet.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And so, how I see my work contributing

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and physically rebuild them.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
This graph represents what we're dealing with now

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
in the built environment.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And it's really a conflux

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
of urban population rising,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
biodiversity plummeting

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and also, of course, sea levels rising

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and climate changing.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
So when I also think about design,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
I think about

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
trying to rework and re-engage

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
the lines on this graph

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
in a more productive way.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
And you can see from the arrow here

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
indicating "you are here,"

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
I'm trying to sort of blend and meld

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
these two very divergent fields

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
of urbanism and ecology,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.260
So the era of big infrastructure is over.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
I mean, these sort of top-down,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
mono-functional, capital-intensive solutions

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
are really not going to cut it.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
We need new tools and new approaches.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Similarly, the idea of architecture

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
as this sort of object in the field,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
devoid of context,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
is really not the --

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
excuse me, it's fairly blatant --

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
is really not the approach

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
that we need to take.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So we need new stories,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
new heroes and new tools.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
So now I want to introduce you to my new hero

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
in the global climate change war,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and that is the eastern oyster.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
So, albeit a very small creature

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
and very modest,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
this creature is incredible,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
because it can agglomerate

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
into these mega-reef structures.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
It can grow; you can grow it;

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and -- did I mention? -- it's quite tasty.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
So the oyster was the basis

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
for a manifesto-like urban design project

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
that I did about the New York Harbor

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
called "oyster-tecture."

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
of mussels, eelgrass and oysters --

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
species that live in the harbor --

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and, at the same time,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
harness the power of people

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
who live in the community

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
towards making change now.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Here's a map of my city, New York City,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
showing inundation in red.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
If you look here at this map,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
showing everything in blue

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
is out in the water,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and everything in yellow is upland.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
But you can see, even just intuit, from this map,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
that the harbor has dredged and flattened,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
in really a matter of years.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly -- I will admit it.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
There are problems of sewage overflow

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and contamination,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
but I would also argue that almost every city

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
has this exact condition,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and it's a condition that we're all facing.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And here's a map of that condition,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
showing the contaminants in yellow and green,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
exacerbated by this new flow of

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
storm-surge and sea-level rise.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So we really had a lot to deal with.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
When we started this project,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
one of the core ideas was to look back in history

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and try to understand what was there.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And you can see from this map,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
there's this incredible geographical signature

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
of a series of islands

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
that were out in the harbor

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
that served as natural wave attenuation

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
for the upland settlement.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
We also learned at this time

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
in the Gowanus Canal itself.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
So our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And the idea has two core stages.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
One is to develop a new artificial ecology,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
a reef out in the harbor,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
that would then protect new settlement patterns

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
inland and the Gowanus.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Because if you have cleaner water and slower water,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
you can imagine a new way of living with that water.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
So the project really addresses these three core issues

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
in a new and exciting way, I think.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
It accepts algae and detritus in one end,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
and through this beautiful, glamorous

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
set of stomach organs,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
out the other end comes cleaner water.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Oyster reefs also covered

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
about a quarter of our harbor

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.260
They were key in our culture and our economy.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Basically, New York was built

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
on the backs of oystermen,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and our streets were literally built over oyster shells.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
This image

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
is an image of an oyster cart,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
So again, we got the short end of the deal there.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
(Laughter)

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Finally, oysters can attenuate

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
and agglomerate onto each other

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and form these amazing natural reef structures.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
They really become nature's wave attenuators.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
And they become the bedrock

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
of any harbor ecosystem.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Many, many species depend on them.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
So we were inspired by the oyster,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
It can move from a fertilized egg

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
to a spat, which is when they're floating through the water,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
to an adult male oyster or female oyster,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
in a number of weeks.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
We reinterpreted this life cycle

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
on the scale of our sight

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and took the Gowanus

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
as a giant oyster nursery

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
then paraded down in their spat stage

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
And so the core idea here

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
was to hit the reset button

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and regenerate an ecology over time

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
that was regenerative and cleaning

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and productive.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
How does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
A core concept here

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
is that climate change

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
isn't something that --

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
the answers won't land down from the Moon.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And with a $20 billion price tag,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
we should simply start and get to work with what we have now

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and what's in front of us.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
So this image is simply showing --

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
it's a field of marine piles

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
What is fuzzy rope, you ask?

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
It's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
available practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
So we imagine that we would actually

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
potentially even host a bake sale

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
to start our new project.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
(Laughter)

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
So in the studio, rather than drawing,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
we began to learn how to knit.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
The concept was to really knit this rope together

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
and develop this new soft infrastructure

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
for the oysters to grow on.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
You can see in the diagram how it grows over time

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
from an infrastructural space

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
into a new public urban space.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And that grows over time dynamically

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
with the threat of climate change.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
It also creates this incredibly interesting, I think,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
new amphibious public space,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
where you can imagine working,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
you can imagine recreating in a new way.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
In the end, what we realized we were making

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
was a new blue-green watery park

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
for the next watery century --

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
an amphibious park, if you will.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
So get your Tevas on.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
So you can imagine scuba diving here.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
This is an image of high school students,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
scuba divers that we worked with on our team.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
with a new relationship with the water,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
in terms of monitoring.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world:

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
this is the word "flupsy" --

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
it's short for "floating upwelling system."

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
And this glorious, readily available device

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
is basically a floating raft

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
with an oyster nursery below.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
So the water is churned through this raft.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
You can see the eight chambers on the side

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
So rather than having 10 oysters,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
you have 10,000 oysters.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
And then those spat are then seeded.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Here's the Gowanus future

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
with the oyster rafts on the shorelines --

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
the flupsification of the Gowanus.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
New word.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
And also showing oyster gardening for the community

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
along its edges.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
And finally, how much fun it would be

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
to watch the flupsy parade

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and cheer on the oyster spats

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
as they go down to the reef.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
I get asked two questions about this project.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
One is: why isn't it happening now?

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
And the second one is: when can we eat the oysters?

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
And the answer is: not yet, they're working.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
But we imagine, with our calculations,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
that by 2050,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
To conclude, this is just one cross-section

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
of one piece of city,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
but my dream is, my hope is,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
that when you all go back to your own cities

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
that we can start to work together and collaborate

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
on remaking and reforming

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
a new urban landscape

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
towards a more sustainable, a more livable

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
and a more delicious future.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Thank you.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:01.260
(Applause)
