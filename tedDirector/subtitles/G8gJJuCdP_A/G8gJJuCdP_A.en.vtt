00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:14.478
OK, so, confession:

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:19.103
I've always been weirdly
obsessed with advertising.

00:00:20.238 --> 00:00:23.306
I remember watching
Saturday morning cartoons,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.463
paying more attention to the commercials

00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:26.794
than to the shows,

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.908
trying to figure out how they were trying
to get inside my head.

00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:32.011
Ultimately, that led me to my dream job.

00:00:32.035 --> 00:00:35.313
I became a partner
at a big New York ad agency.

00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:41.526
But then, all of that suddenly changed
on February 23, 1997,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.898
when my little brother Matt
was shot in the head

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:47.747
in a shooting that happened
on the observation deck

00:00:47.771 --> 00:00:49.887
of the Empire State Building.

00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:55.073
Suddenly, my family was thrown
into the middle of a nightmare,

00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:59.227
being told that my brother
was going to die,

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:02.927
actually being given the opportunity
to say goodbye to him,

00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:05.301
then several emergency brain surgeries

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:07.976
and now what's amounted, for Matt,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.246
to a lifetime spent courageously
recovering from a traumatic brain injury.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.284
He is definitely my hero.

00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:19.443
But as much as (Applause) --
yeah, deserves it --

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:24.573
(Applause)

00:01:24.597 --> 00:01:30.200
But as much as this tragedy
was a nightmare for my family,

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:32.775
I often think about how much worse
it could have been;

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.858
in fact, how much worse
it is for the 90 families every day

00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:39.762
who aren't as fortunate,

00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:45.994
who lose loved ones -- brothers,
sisters, sons, daughters, parents.

00:01:46.018 --> 00:01:48.519
They don't all make national headlines.

00:01:48.543 --> 00:01:50.185
In fact, most of them don't.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.281
They go largely unnoticed,

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:58.904
in a nation that's kind of come to accept
a disgraceful national epidemic

00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:02.326
as some kind of new normal.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.146
So I quit my job in advertising

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.272
to try and do something about
this disgraceful national epidemic,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.493
because I came to realize

00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:14.630
that the challenges
to preventing gun violence

00:02:14.654 --> 00:02:18.319
are actually the same ones
that made me love advertising,

00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:20.826
which is to try to figure out
how to engage people.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.453
Only instead of doing it to sell products,

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.257
doing it to save lives.

00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:30.649
And that comes down to
finding common ground,

00:02:30.673 --> 00:02:34.682
where what I want overlaps
with what you want.

00:02:34.706 --> 00:02:37.912
And you might be surprised to learn,
when it comes to gun violence,

00:02:37.936 --> 00:02:39.983
just how much common ground there is.

00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:42.992
Let's look, for example,
at people who love to hunt,

00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:46.198
a sport enjoyed by millions across the US.

00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:48.862
It's a proud tradition. Families.

00:02:48.886 --> 00:02:50.040
In some places,

00:02:50.064 --> 00:02:53.316
the first day of hunting season
is actually a school holiday.

00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:55.261
What do hunters want?

00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:57.633
Well, they want to hunt.
They love their guns.

00:02:57.657 --> 00:02:58.857
They believe deeply

00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:01.373
in the Second Amendment right
to own those guns.

00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:03.676
But that doesn't mean
there isn't common ground.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.128
In fact, there's a lot of it,

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:10.556
starting with the basic idea
of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.394
This isn't about taking
certain guns away from all people.

00:03:15.418 --> 00:03:18.294
It's about keeping all guns
away from certain people,

00:03:18.318 --> 00:03:21.783
and it's the people that, it turns out,
we all agree shouldn't have guns:

00:03:21.807 --> 00:03:24.287
convicted violent criminals,
domestic abusers,

00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.181
the dangerously mentally ill.

00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:28.356
We can all appreciate

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.287
how Brady background checks
have been incredibly effective

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.579
in keeping guns
out of those dangerous hands.

00:03:33.603 --> 00:03:38.010
In 20 years, Brady background checks
at federally licensed firearm dealers

00:03:38.034 --> 00:03:41.799
have blocked 2.4 million gun sales

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:44.988
to those people that we all agree
shouldn't have guns.

00:03:45.463 --> 00:03:49.386
(Applause)

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.607
And whether you love guns or hate guns,
you probably also appreciate

00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:56.807
that there shouldn't be thousands
of gun sales every day

00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:58.677
at guns shows or online

00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:00.560
without those Brady background checks,

00:04:00.584 --> 00:04:03.584
just like there shouldn't be two lines
to get on an airplane --

00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:06.232
one with security
and one with no security.

00:04:06.256 --> 00:04:07.407
And --

00:04:07.431 --> 00:04:10.933
(Applause)

00:04:10.957 --> 00:04:14.720
And the numbers show the overwhelming
agreement among the American public:

00:04:14.744 --> 00:04:19.027
90 percent of Americans support
expanding Brady background checks

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:21.685
to all gun sales -- including
90 percent of Republicans,

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.629
more than 80 percent of gun owners,

00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:25.905
more than 70 percent of NRA members.

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:27.843
This is not a controversial idea.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:31.443
In fact, only six percent
of the American public disagrees.

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:33.832
That's about the percentage
of the American public

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:36.045
that believes the moon landing was a fake.

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:37.434
(Laughter)

00:04:37.458 --> 00:04:40.430
And it's also about the percentage
that believes the government

00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:44.413
is putting mind-controlling technology
in our TV broadcast signals.

00:04:44.437 --> 00:04:47.264
That's the extent to which we agree
about background checks.

00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:50.836
But what about the 300 million guns

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.256
already out there in homes across America?

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.050
Well first, it's important to realize

00:04:55.074 --> 00:04:59.412
that those guns are mostly
in the hands and homes

00:04:59.436 --> 00:05:02.376
of decent, law-abiding people
like you and me,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.671
who want what we all want --
including keeping our families safe.

00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:10.680
In fact, that's why more and more people
are choosing to own guns.

00:05:10.704 --> 00:05:15.039
Ten years ago, 42 percent
of the American public

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:19.340
believed -- incorrectly -- that a gun
makes your home safer.

00:05:19.364 --> 00:05:23.007
Today, that number is 63 percent.

00:05:23.784 --> 00:05:24.936
Why?

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.158
I kind of hate to say it,

00:05:26.182 --> 00:05:28.772
because it gets to the dark
underbelly of advertising,

00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:31.224
which is if you tell
a big enough lie enough times,

00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:33.089
eventually that lie becomes the truth.

00:05:33.113 --> 00:05:35.060
And that's exactly what's happened here.

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:37.626
The corporate gun lobby
has spent billions of dollars

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.975
blocking the CDC from doing research
into the public health epidemic

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:42.660
of gun violence;

00:05:42.684 --> 00:05:44.844
blocking pediatricians
from talking to parents

00:05:44.868 --> 00:05:46.679
about the dangers of guns in the home;

00:05:46.703 --> 00:05:49.072
blocking smart-gun technology
and other technology

00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:51.767
that would prevent kids
from firing parents' guns

00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:53.354
and would save lives.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.081
They're desperate to hide the truth,

00:05:56.105 --> 00:06:00.383
because they view the truth
as a threat to their bottom line.

00:06:00.407 --> 00:06:01.568
And every day,

00:06:01.592 --> 00:06:03.187
people are dying as a result.

00:06:03.211 --> 00:06:05.702
And a lot of those people are children.

00:06:06.108 --> 00:06:08.445
Every day in the US,

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.658
nine kids are just shot unintentionally.

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:17.452
900 children and teens
take their own lives every year.

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:21.226
And here's the thing:
they're almost all with a parent's gun.

00:06:21.874 --> 00:06:28.235
Even two-thirds of school shootings
happen with a gun taken from the home,

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.944
including the terrible tragedy

00:06:29.968 --> 00:06:31.244
at Sandy Hook.

00:06:31.562 --> 00:06:33.525
I meet so many of these parents;

00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:35.929
it's the most heartbreaking
part of my job.

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:38.913
These are not bad people.

00:06:39.476 --> 00:06:44.691
They're just living with the unimaginable
consequences of a very bad decision,

00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:47.586
made based on very bad information

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.498
that was put into their minds
by very bad people,

00:06:50.522 --> 00:06:53.727
who know good and well
the misery that they're causing,

00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:56.108
but just don't care.

00:06:56.577 --> 00:06:59.039
And the result is a nightmare --

00:06:59.063 --> 00:07:01.633
not only for families like mine,

00:07:01.657 --> 00:07:05.026
but for, really, at the end
of the day, all of us.

00:07:05.472 --> 00:07:08.386
But I'm not here to talk
about the nightmare of gun violence.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.446
I'm here to talk about our dream,
and it's a dream we all share,

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.946
which is the dream
of a better, safer, future.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.672
For my organization,
for the Brady Campaign,

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:19.284
that dream is reflected in the bold goal

00:07:19.308 --> 00:07:24.078
to cut the number of gun deaths
in the US in half by 2025.

00:07:24.102 --> 00:07:26.604
And I hope to leave
all of you here tonight

00:07:26.628 --> 00:07:32.501
with a strong sense of exactly why
that dream is so absolutely within reach.

00:07:32.525 --> 00:07:33.891
Because folks,

00:07:33.915 --> 00:07:36.727
for every great movement around the world,

00:07:36.751 --> 00:07:39.538
there's a moment
where you can look back and say,

00:07:39.562 --> 00:07:42.446
"That's when things
really started to change."

00:07:43.065 --> 00:07:44.289
And I'm here to say

00:07:44.313 --> 00:07:47.234
that for the movement
to end gun violence in America,

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.840
that moment is here.

00:07:50.308 --> 00:07:55.969
(Applause)

00:07:55.993 --> 00:07:58.874
We are so clearly at a tipping point,

00:07:58.898 --> 00:08:02.009
because the American public
has come together by the millions

00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:04.247
like never before,
based on that common ground,

00:08:04.271 --> 00:08:05.666
to say, "Enough."

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.897
Enough of the mass shootings
in malls and movie theaters

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:10.827
and churches and schools.

00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:15.744
Enough of the daily terror
of gun violence in homes and streets

00:08:15.768 --> 00:08:18.975
that's claimed the lives of women
and young black men

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.421
in staggering proportions.

00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:22.228
Enough of easy access to guns

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.728
by the people that we all agree
shouldn't have them.

00:08:24.752 --> 00:08:27.787
And enough of a small group
of craven politicians

00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:30.100
putting the interests
of the corporate gun lobby

00:08:30.124 --> 00:08:33.123
ahead of the people
they have been elected to represent.

00:08:33.147 --> 00:08:34.298
Enough.

00:08:34.322 --> 00:08:40.476
(Applause)

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.404
And the really exciting thing is,
it's not just the usual suspects like me

00:08:44.428 --> 00:08:45.960
that are saying it anymore.

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:47.888
It's so much bigger than that.

00:08:47.912 --> 00:08:49.063
And if you want proof,

00:08:49.087 --> 00:08:52.639
let's start where most conversations
in the US seem to start --

00:08:52.663 --> 00:08:54.067
with Kim Kardashian.

00:08:54.091 --> 00:08:55.281
(Laughter)

00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:57.424
And here's the thing:
it's not really a joke.

00:08:57.448 --> 00:08:59.321
I mean, think about when issues change.

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:02.114
It's when they go from being
political and advocacy issues

00:09:02.138 --> 00:09:03.544
to being part of pop culture,

00:09:03.568 --> 00:09:07.137
voices coming from everywhere,
celebrities using their platforms,

00:09:07.161 --> 00:09:08.762
musicians, athletes.

00:09:08.786 --> 00:09:10.042
The NBA has come forward.

00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:12.720
Conservative pundits that you never
would have imagined

00:09:12.744 --> 00:09:13.895
have come forward.

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.461
There's real cultural change --

00:09:15.485 --> 00:09:17.851
I even hear there's a TED Talk
about it this year.

00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:22.420
That's the extent to which
this cultural change is happening.

00:09:22.444 --> 00:09:26.372
And yes, Kim Kardashian has made
an unsolicited passionate appeal

00:09:26.396 --> 00:09:29.510
to her 35 million Twitter followers

00:09:29.534 --> 00:09:31.882
for expanded background checks.

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:34.821
Let's look at the political elections
that are heating up.

00:09:34.845 --> 00:09:37.702
This used to be the classic
third-rail issue for Democrats.

00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:39.440
Couldn't run from it fast enough.

00:09:39.464 --> 00:09:41.147
Now candidates are running on it.

00:09:41.171 --> 00:09:44.138
Some are being forced
to reverse very bad positions

00:09:44.162 --> 00:09:48.384
they defended very comfortably,
until very recently.

00:09:48.408 --> 00:09:50.038
For somebody like me,

00:09:50.062 --> 00:09:55.124
watching people wave around
their negative NRA ratings --

00:09:55.148 --> 00:09:58.367
it's almost surreal to watch.

00:09:58.391 --> 00:10:02.114
We're still outfunded, yes,
by the corporate gun lobby,

00:10:02.138 --> 00:10:04.507
and ultimately that needs to change.

00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:05.692
But you know what?

00:10:05.716 --> 00:10:10.075
We're smarter and we're scrappier,
and we have the truth on our side.

00:10:10.099 --> 00:10:11.819
And we're on offense.

00:10:11.843 --> 00:10:15.253
You know, they say that the Internet
democratizes information.

00:10:15.277 --> 00:10:19.015
Social media and some
of the organizing tools that plug into it

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:20.912
have democratized activism.

00:10:20.936 --> 00:10:24.303
It's allowed us to show what 90 percent
support really looks like.

00:10:24.327 --> 00:10:25.574
Sometimes I think of it --

00:10:25.598 --> 00:10:28.835
you know, we're converging
and attacking instantly by the millions,

00:10:28.859 --> 00:10:30.462
kind of like white blood cells.

00:10:30.486 --> 00:10:35.045
It's enabled us to start to really
close -- and this is the bottom line --

00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:37.275
close that disgraceful disconnect

00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:39.711
between what the American public wants

00:10:39.735 --> 00:10:41.982
and what our elected leaders
are doing about it.

00:10:42.006 --> 00:10:43.530
Until recently,

00:10:43.554 --> 00:10:46.806
the narrative in Congress
was that calls from the other side,

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.990
from that six percent,

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:51.194
outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one.

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:53.257
We're flipping that narrative on its head.

00:10:53.281 --> 00:10:55.891
After that recent terrible tragedy
in San Bernardino,

00:10:55.915 --> 00:10:57.720
we jammed Congressional switchboards.

00:10:57.744 --> 00:11:03.117
We put 15,000 calls
into Congress in 24 hours.

00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:04.292
And you know what?

00:11:04.316 --> 00:11:05.467
We got a vote on a bill

00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:08.705
that nobody thought was going to see
the light of day anytime soon.

00:11:08.729 --> 00:11:11.570
We're seeing real movement
to repeal some of the most evil,

00:11:11.594 --> 00:11:16.233
ugly gun lobby legislation
passed over the last dark decade.

00:11:16.257 --> 00:11:19.164
The stranglehold of the gun lobby
is clearly being broken.

00:11:19.188 --> 00:11:22.490
We've seen President Obama's
historic executive actions.

00:11:22.514 --> 00:11:23.904
They don't go all the way,

00:11:23.928 --> 00:11:25.515
but they are going to save lives,

00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:27.586
because they expand
Brady background checks

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.182
to thousands of gun sales
that didn't have them previously.

00:11:31.206 --> 00:11:34.214
And we're marching across the country --
we're not just waiting

00:11:34.238 --> 00:11:37.623
for Congress to act; that would almost
be the definition of insanity.

00:11:37.647 --> 00:11:39.292
We're marching across the country,

00:11:39.316 --> 00:11:41.915
state by state, marriage-equality style.

00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:43.513
And you know what? We're winning.

00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:47.204
Congress is almost always
the last to wake up and realize

00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:49.417
that it's on the wrong side of history.

00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:53.062
And when they do, it's always
because the American public shakes them.

00:11:53.086 --> 00:11:55.268
And that's exactly
what we're doing right now,

00:11:55.292 --> 00:11:56.830
as we're in this tipping point.

00:11:56.854 --> 00:12:00.803
You know, recently I was flying
cross-country to give a speech

00:12:00.827 --> 00:12:04.259
to a large group like this,
although far less intimidating,

00:12:04.283 --> 00:12:08.024
and the woman sitting next to me
happened to be binge-watching

00:12:08.048 --> 00:12:12.976
one of my all-time favorite
TV shows, "Mad Men,"

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.214
a period TV show about advertising

00:12:15.238 --> 00:12:17.056
in the 1960s.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.677
And as I was trying to think
about how to end my remarks,

00:12:20.701 --> 00:12:22.976
I'd glance up at her screen
every now and then,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.293
and it seemed that every time I did,

00:12:25.317 --> 00:12:29.642
I'd see somebody smoking
in an office or around children

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.079
or while pregnant or drinking and driving

00:12:32.103 --> 00:12:36.074
or driving without seat belts
or sexually harassing a coworker.

00:12:36.098 --> 00:12:38.472
And ultimately it dawned on me:

00:12:38.496 --> 00:12:39.858
what tremendous inspiration

00:12:39.882 --> 00:12:43.841
to those of us who have this dream
to end gun violence.

00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:46.436
I mean, think about how much
the world has changed

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.239
in a relatively short period of time,

00:12:49.263 --> 00:12:52.896
how all those behaviors that were once
considered commonplace or normal --

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.137
some even glamorous or sexy --

00:12:55.161 --> 00:12:59.268
have become stigmatized
in just a generation or two,

00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:03.316
once they became conversations
about our common ground.

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:08.613
That is the magnitude of the change
we have the potential to create

00:13:08.637 --> 00:13:10.272
around gun violence.

00:13:10.296 --> 00:13:11.860
And that's my dream,

00:13:11.884 --> 00:13:13.352
that maybe someday,

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:18.871
some period TV show will depict
the terrible nightmare of gun violence,

00:13:18.895 --> 00:13:22.269
and a future generation of children
might only be able to imagine

00:13:22.293 --> 00:13:24.142
how terrible it must have been.

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:25.317
Thank you.

00:13:25.341 --> 00:13:31.055
(Applause)

00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:32.230
Thank you.

00:13:32.254 --> 00:13:33.747
(Applause)

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:34.922
Thank you.

00:13:34.946 --> 00:13:37.849
(Applause)
