00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm an ecologist,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
mostly a coral reef ecologist.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I started out in Chesapeake Bay

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and went diving in the winter

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and became a tropical ecologist overnight.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And it was really a lot of fun

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
for about 10 years.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
I mean, somebody pays you

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
to go around and travel

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and look at some of the most

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
beautiful places on the planet.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And that was what I did.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And I ended up in Jamaica,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
in the West Indies,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
where the coral reefs were really

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
among the most extraordinary, structurally,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
that I ever saw in my life.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
And this picture here,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
it's really interesting, it shows two things:

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
First of all, it's in black and white

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
because the water was so clear

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and you could see so far,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and film was so slow

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
in the 1960s and early 70s,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
you took pictures in black and white.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
The other thing it shows you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
is that, although there's this beautiful

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
forest of coral,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
there are no fish in that picture.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Those reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
were the most studied coral reefs

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
in the world for 20 years.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
We were the best and the brightest.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
People came to study our reefs from Australia,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
which is sort of funny

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
because now we go to theirs.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And the view of scientists

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
was based on these reefs

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
without any fish.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Then, in 1980,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
I put half the lab

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
up in my house.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
The wind blew very strong.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
The waves were 25

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
to 50 feet high.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and we thought, "Well, we're real smart.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
We know that hurricanes

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
have always happened in the past."

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And we published a paper in Science,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
the first time that anybody ever

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
described the destruction

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
on a coral reef by a major hurricane.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
And we predicted what would happen,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and we got it all wrong.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And the reason was

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
because of overfishing,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and the fact that a last common grazer,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
a sea urchin, died.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And within a few months

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
after that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
And that is the same reef;

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
that's the same reef 15 years ago;

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
that's the same reef today.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
have a few percent live coral cover

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and a lot of seaweed and slime.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And that's more or less the story

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
of the coral reefs of the Caribbean,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and increasingly, tragically,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
the coral reefs worldwide.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Now, that's my little, depressing story.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
All of us in our 60s and 70s

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
have comparable depressing stories.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
There are tens of thousands

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
of those stories out there,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and it's really hard to conjure up

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
much of a sense of well-being,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
because it just keeps getting worse.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
And the reason it keeps getting worse

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
is that after a natural catastrophe,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
like a hurricane,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
it used to be that there was

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
some kind of successional sequence of recovery,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
but what's going on now is that

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
overfishing and pollution and climate change

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
are all interacting

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
in a way that prevents that.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And so I'm going to sort of go through

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and talk about those three

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
kinds of things.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
We hear a lot about

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
the collapse of cod.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
It's difficult to imagine that

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.260
two, or some historians would say three world wars

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
were fought during the colonial era

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
for the control of cod.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
It fed the slaves

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
brought to the Antilles,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
the song "Jamaica Farewell" --

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
"Ackee rice salt fish are nice" --

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
is an emblem of the importance

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
of salt cod from northeastern Canada.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
35,000 people lost their jobs.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And that was the beginning

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
of a kind of serial depletion

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
from bigger and tastier species

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
to smaller and not-so-tasty species,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
from species that were near to home

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
to species that were all around the world,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
and what have you.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
It's a little hard to understand that,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
because you can go to a Costco in the United States

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and buy cheap fish.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
You ought to read the label to find out where it came from,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
but it's still cheap,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
and everybody thinks it's okay.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
It's hard to communicate this,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and one way that I think is really interesting

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
is to talk about sport fish,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
because people like to go out and catch fish.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
It's one of those things.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
This picture here shows the trophy fish,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
the biggest fish caught

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
by people who pay a lot of money

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
to get on a boat,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
go to a place off of Key West in Florida,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
drink a lot of beer,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
come back with the biggest and the best fish,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and the champion trophy fish

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
are put on this board, where people take a picture,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and this guy is obviously

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
really excited about that fish.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Well, that's what it's like now,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
but this is what it was like in the 1950s

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
from the same boat in the same place

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
on the same board on the same dock.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
The trophy fish

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
were so big

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And the average size trophy fish

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
weighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and if you wanted to go out and kill something,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
you could pretty much count on

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
being able to catch one of those fish.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And they tasted really good.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And people paid less in 1950 dollars

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
to catch that

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
than what people pay now

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
to catch those little, tiny fish.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And that's everywhere.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
It's not just the fish, though,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
that are disappearing.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Industrial fishing uses big stuff,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
big machinery.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
We use nets that are 20 miles long.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
We use longlines

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
that have one million or two million hooks.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And we trawl,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
which means to take something

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
the size of a tractor trailer truck

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
put it on a big chain,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
and drag it across the sea floor

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
to stir up the bottom and catch the fish.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Think of it as

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
being kind of the bulldozing of a city

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
or of a forest,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
because it clears it away.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And the habitat destruction

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
is unbelievable.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
This is a photograph,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
a typical photograph,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
of what the continental shelves

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
of the world look like.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
You can see the rows in the bottom,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
the way you can see the rows

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
in a field that has just been plowed

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
to plant corn.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
which is a critical habitat

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
for the development of fish.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
What it is now is mud,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
and the area of the ocean floor

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
that has been transformed from forest

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
to level mud, to parking lot,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
is equivalent to the entire area

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
of all the forests

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
that have ever been cut down

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
on all of the earth

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
in the history of humanity.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
We've managed to do that

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
in the last 100 to 150 years.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
We tend to think of oil spills

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
and mercury

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and we hear a lot about plastic these days.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And all of that stuff is really disgusting,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
but what's really insidious

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
is the biological pollution that happens

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
because of the magnitude of the shifts

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
that it causes

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
to entire ecosystems.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
And I'm going to just talk very briefly

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
about two kinds of biological pollution:

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
one is introduced species

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and the other is what comes from nutrients.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
So this is the infamous

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
Caulerpa taxifolia,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
the so-called killer algae.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
A book was written about it.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
It's a bit of an embarrassment.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
It was accidentally released

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
from the aquarium in Monaco,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
it was bred to be cold tolerant

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
to have in peoples aquaria.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
It's very pretty,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and it has rapidly started

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
to overgrow

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
the once very rich

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
biodiversity of the

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
northwestern Mediterranean.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
I don't know how many of you remember the movie

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
"The Little Shop of Horrors,"

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
but this is the plant of "The Little Shop of Horrors."

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
But, instead of devouring the people in the shop,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
what it's doing is overgrowing

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
and smothering

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
of the entire northwestern

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
Mediterranean Sea.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
We don't know anything that eats it,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
we're trying to do all sorts of genetics

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
and figure out something that could be done,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
but, as it stands, it's the monster from hell,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
about which nobody knows what to do.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
Now another form of pollution

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
that's biological pollution

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
is what happens from excess nutrients.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
The green revolution,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
It's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
It runs down the rivers,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
and it feeds the plankton,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
the little microscopic plant cells

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
in the coastal water.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
But since we ate all the oysters

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
there's nothing to eat the plankton

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
and there's more and more of it,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
so it dies of old age,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
which is unheard of for plankton.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And when it dies, it falls to the bottom

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
and then it rots,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
which means that bacteria break it down.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
And in the process

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
they use up all the oxygen,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
and in using up all the oxygen

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
they make the environment utterly lethal

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
for anything that can't swim away.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
So, what we end up with

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
is a microbial zoo

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
dominated by bacteria

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
and jellyfish, as you see

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
on the left in front of you.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And the only fishery left --

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
and it is a commercial fishery --

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
is the jellyfish fishery

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
you see on the right, where there used to be prawns.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
Even in Newfoundland

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
where we used to catch cod,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
we now have a jellyfish fishery.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
And another version of this sort of thing

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
is what is often called red tides

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
or toxic blooms.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
That picture on the left is just staggering to me.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
I have talked about it a million times,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
but it's unbelievable.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
In the upper right of that picture on the left

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
is almost the Mississippi Delta,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and the lower left of that picture

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
is the Texas-Mexico border.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
You're looking at the entire

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
northwestern Gulf of Mexico;

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
you're looking at one toxic

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
made by that beautiful little creature

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
on the lower right.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
And in the upper right you see this

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
black sort of cloud

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
moving ashore.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
That's the same species.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And as it comes to shore and the wind blows,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and little droplets of the water get into the air,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
with people with acute respiratory distress.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And that's retirement homes

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
on the west coast of Florida.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
we called Hollywood ocean night,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
and I was trying to figure out how to

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
explain to actors what's going on.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
And I said,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
"So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu'

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
because all the beautiful people have moved

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
And the only people who are left there

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
are the people who can't afford

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
to move away from the coast,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
because the coast, instead of being paradise,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
is harmful to your health."

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
And then this is amazing.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
This is from the coast of Brittany,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
which is being enveloped

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
in this green, algal slime.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
The reason that it attracted so much attention,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
besides the fact that it's disgusting,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
is that sea birds flying over it

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
are asphyxiated by the smell and die,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
and a farmer died of it,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and you can imagine the scandal that happened.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
And so there's this war

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
between the farmers

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
and the fishermen about it all,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
and the net result is that

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
on a regular basis.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
And then, of course, there's climate change,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
and we all know about climate change.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
I guess the iconic figure of it

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
is the melting of the ice

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
in the Arctic Sea.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
trying to find the Northwest Passage.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
Well, the Northwest Passage is already there.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
I think it's sort of funny;

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
it's on the Siberian coast,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
maybe the Russians will charge tolls.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
The governments of the world

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
are taking this really seriously.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
The military of the Arctic nations

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
is taking it really seriously.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
For all the denial of climate change

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
by government leaders,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
the CIA

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
and the navies of Norway

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
and the U.S. and Canada, whatever

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
are busily thinking about

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
how they will secure their territory

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
in this inevitability

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
from their point of view.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
And, of course, Arctic communities are toast.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
The other kinds of effects of climate change --

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right?

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
All that white coral.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Except it's supposed to be brown.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
What happens is that

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
the corals are a symbiosis,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
and they have these little algal cells

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
that live inside them.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
And the algae give the corals sugar,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
and the corals give the algae

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
nutrients and protection.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
But when it gets too hot,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
the algae can't make the sugar.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
The corals say, "You cheated. You didn't pay your rent."

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
They kick them out, and then they die.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
Not all of them die; some of them survive,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
some more are surviving,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
but it's really bad news.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
To try and give you a sense of this,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
imagine you go camping in July

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
somewhere in Europe or in North America,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and you see that 80 percent of the trees,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
as far as you can see,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
And you come home, and you discover

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
that 80 percent of all the trees

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
in North America and in Europe

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
have dropped their leaves.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
And then you read in the paper a few weeks later,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
"Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
during the 1998 El Nino,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
an area vastly greater

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
than the size of North America and Europe,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
when 80 percent of all the corals bleached

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
and a quarter of them died.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
And then the really scary thing

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
about all of this --

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change --

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
the synergies among them

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
that make the whole vastly greater

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
than the sum of the parts.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
And the great scientific challenge

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
for people like me in thinking about all this,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
is do we know how

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
to put Humpty Dumpty back together again?

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
But what does that mean?

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
We really don't know.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
So what are the oceans going to be like

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
in 20 or 50 years?

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
Well, there won't be any fish

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
except for minnows,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
and the water will be pretty dirty,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
and all those kinds of things

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
and full of mercury, etc., etc.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
And dead zones will get bigger and bigger

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
and they'll start to merge,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
and we can imagine something like

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
the dead-zonification

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
of the global, coastal ocean.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
because it would be a kind of

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
gastronomic Russian roulette.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
Sometimes you have a toxic bloom;

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
sometimes you don't.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
That doesn't sell.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
The really scary things though

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
are the physical, chemical,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
oceanographic things that are happening.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
As the surface of the ocean gets warmer,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
the water is lighter when it's warmer,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
it becomes harder and harder

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
to turn the ocean over.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
We say it becomes

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
more strongly stratified.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
The consequence of that is that

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
all those nutrients

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
of the sardines of California

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
or in Peru or whatever,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
those slow down

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
and those fisheries collapse.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
And, at the same time,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
water from the surface, which is rich in oxygen,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
doesn't make it down

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
and the ocean turns into a desert.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
So the question is: How are we all

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
going to respond to this?

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
And we can do

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
all sorts of things to fix it,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
but in the final analysis,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
the thing we really need to fix

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
is ourselves.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
It's not about the fish; it's not about the pollution;

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
it's not about the climate change.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
It's about us

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
and our greed and our need for growth

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
and our inability to imagine a world

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
that is different from the selfish world

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
we live in today.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
So the question is: Will we respond to this or not?

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
I would say that the future of life

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
and the dignity of human beings

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
depends on our doing that.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
Thank you. (Applause)
