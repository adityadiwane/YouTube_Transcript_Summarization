00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:15.178
This is an image of the planet Earth.

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:18.271
It looks very much like the Apollo pictures

00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:19.882
that are very well known.

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:21.952
There is something different;

00:00:21.952 --> 00:00:23.399
you can click on it,

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:24.597
and if you click on it,

00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:27.669
you can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth.

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.668
For instance, this is a bird's-eye view

00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:32.334
of the EPFL campus.

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:34.442
In many cases, you can also see

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:38.182
how a building looks from a nearby street.

00:00:38.182 --> 00:00:39.604
This is pretty amazing.

00:00:39.604 --> 00:00:43.031
But there's something missing in this wonderful tour:

00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:45.219
It's time.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.289
i'm not really sure when this picture was taken.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.701
I'm not even sure it was taken

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:55.784
at the same moment as the bird's-eye view.

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:57.993
In my lab, we develop tools

00:00:57.993 --> 00:00:59.757
to travel not only in space

00:00:59.757 --> 00:01:02.315
but also through time.

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:04.185
The kind of question we're asking is

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:05.578
Is it possible to build something

00:01:05.578 --> 00:01:07.756
like Google Maps of the past?

00:01:07.756 --> 00:01:11.066
Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.869
and just change the year,

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.660
seeing how it was 100 years before,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.329
1,000 years before?

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.452
Is that possible?

00:01:18.452 --> 00:01:20.704
Can I reconstruct social networks of the past?

00:01:20.704 --> 00:01:23.753
Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages?

00:01:23.753 --> 00:01:27.529
So, can I build time machines?

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:30.094
Maybe we can just say, "No, it's not possible."

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:33.904
Or, maybe, we can think of it from an information point of view.

00:01:33.904 --> 00:01:37.094
This is what I call the information mushroom.

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:38.677
Vertically, you have the time.

00:01:38.677 --> 00:01:41.417
and horizontally, the amount of digital information available.

00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:44.899
Obviously, in the last 10 years, we have much information.

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.447
And obviously the more we go in the past, the less information we have.

00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:50.765
If we want to build something like Google Maps of the past,

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:52.259
or Facebook of the past,

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.833
we need to enlarge this space,

00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:55.771
we need to make that like a rectangle.

00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:57.281
How do we do that?

00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.379
One way is digitization.

00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:01.174
There's a lot of material available --

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.460
newspaper, printed books, thousands of printed books.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.228
I can digitize all these.

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:11.965
I can extract information from these.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:15.508
Of course, the more you go in the past,
the less information you will have.

00:02:15.508 --> 00:02:18.154
So, it might not be enough.

00:02:18.154 --> 00:02:20.562
So, I can do what historians do.

00:02:20.562 --> 00:02:22.086
I can extrapolate.

00:02:22.086 --> 00:02:26.556
This is what we call, in computer science, simulation.

00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:28.307
If I take a log book,

00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:30.711
I can consider, it's not just a log book

00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:33.683
of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey.

00:02:33.683 --> 00:02:35.326
I can consider it is actually a log book

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:37.908
which is representative of
many journeys of that period.

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:40.153
I'm extrapolating.

00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:42.191
If I have a painting of a facade,

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:44.942
I can consider it's not just that particular building,

00:02:44.942 --> 00:02:48.874
but probably it also shares the same grammar

00:02:48.874 --> 00:02:52.915
of buildings where we lost any information.

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:55.773
So if we want to construct a time machine,

00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:57.112
we need two things.

00:02:57.112 --> 00:02:59.346
We need very large archives,

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:02.088
and we need excellent specialists.

00:03:02.088 --> 00:03:03.962
The Venice Time Machine,

00:03:03.962 --> 00:03:05.767
the project I'm going to talk to you about,

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:08.787
is a joint project between the EPFL

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:11.765
and the University of Venice Ca'Foscari.

00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:13.930
There's something very peculiar about Venice,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.604
that its administration has been

00:03:16.604 --> 00:03:18.798
very, very bureaucratic.

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:20.991
They've been keeping track of everything,

00:03:20.991 --> 00:03:23.906
almost like Google today.

00:03:23.906 --> 00:03:25.420
At the Archivio di Stato,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.184
you have 80 kilometers of archives

00:03:27.184 --> 00:03:29.193
documenting every aspect

00:03:29.193 --> 00:03:31.439
of the life of Venice over
more than 1,000 years.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.359
You have every boat that goes out,

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.435
every boat that comes in.

00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:37.232
You have every change that was made in the city.

00:03:37.232 --> 00:03:40.523
This is all there.

00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:44.431
We are setting up a 10-year digitization program

00:03:44.431 --> 00:03:46.108
which has the objective of transforming

00:03:46.108 --> 00:03:47.492
this immense archive

00:03:47.492 --> 00:03:49.918
into a giant information system.

00:03:49.918 --> 00:03:51.775
The type of objective we want to reach

00:03:51.775 --> 00:03:56.501
is 450 books a day that can be digitized.

00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:58.748
Of course, when you digitize, that's not enough,

00:03:58.748 --> 00:04:00.035
because these documents,

00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:02.674
most of them are in Latin, in Tuscan,

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.204
in Venetian dialect,

00:04:04.204 --> 00:04:05.879
so you need to transcribe them,

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.560
to translate them in some cases,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.680
to index them,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.844
and this is obviously not easy.

00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:14.688
In particular, traditional optical
character recognition method

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.112
that can be used for printed manuscripts,

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:20.116
they do not work well on the handwritten document.

00:04:20.116 --> 00:04:22.246
So the solution is actually to take inspiration

00:04:22.246 --> 00:04:25.147
from another domain: speech recognition.

00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:27.202
This is a domain of something 
that seems impossible,

00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:29.739
which can actually be done,

00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:31.933
simply by putting additional constraints.

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:33.519
If you have a very good model

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:35.045
of a language which is used,

00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:37.131
if you have a very good model of a document,

00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:38.563
how well they are structured.

00:04:38.563 --> 00:04:39.916
And these are administrative documents.

00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:42.063
They are well structured in many cases.

00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:45.371
If you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets

00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:48.248
where a smaller subset
actually shares similar features,

00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:52.279
then there's a chance of success.

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.196
If we reach that stage, then there's something else:

00:04:57.196 --> 00:05:00.718
we can extract from this document events.

00:05:00.718 --> 00:05:03.016
Actually probably 10 billion events

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:04.947
can be extracted from this archive.

00:05:04.947 --> 00:05:06.671
And this giant information system

00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:08.487
can be searched in many ways.

00:05:08.487 --> 00:05:09.855
You can ask questions like,

00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:12.615
"Who lived in this palazzo in 1323?"

00:05:12.615 --> 00:05:14.837
"How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market

00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:16.561
in 1434?"

00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:18.021
"What was the salary

00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:20.066
of a glass maker in Murano

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:21.472
maybe over a decade?"

00:05:21.472 --> 00:05:22.894
You can ask even bigger questions

00:05:22.894 --> 00:05:25.632
because it will be semantically coded.

00:05:25.632 --> 00:05:27.772
And then what you can do is put that in space,

00:05:27.772 --> 00:05:29.945
because much of this information is spatial.

00:05:29.945 --> 00:05:31.880
And from that, you can do things like

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.993
reconstructing this extraordinary journey

00:05:33.993 --> 00:05:37.349
of that city that managed to
have a sustainable development

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.475
over a thousand years,

00:05:39.475 --> 00:05:41.095
managing to have all the time

00:05:41.095 --> 00:05:43.956
a form of equilibrium with its environment.

00:05:43.956 --> 00:05:45.204
You can reconstruct that journey,

00:05:45.204 --> 00:05:48.100
visualize it in many different ways.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.799
But of course, you cannot understand 
Venice if you just look at the city.

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:53.195
You have to put it in a larger European context.

00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:56.016
So the idea is also to document all the things

00:05:56.016 --> 00:05:58.439
that worked at the European level.

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.403
We can reconstruct also the journey

00:06:00.403 --> 00:06:02.393
of the Venetian maritime empire,

00:06:02.393 --> 00:06:05.559
how it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea,

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:09.305
how it became the most powerful medieval empire

00:06:09.305 --> 00:06:10.866
of its time,

00:06:10.866 --> 00:06:13.038
controlling most of the sea routes

00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:15.971
from the east to the south.

00:06:17.305 --> 00:06:19.621
But you can even do other things,

00:06:19.621 --> 00:06:21.898
because in these maritime routes,

00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:23.873
there are regular patterns.

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.382
You can go one step beyond

00:06:26.382 --> 00:06:28.502
and actually create a simulation system,

00:06:28.502 --> 00:06:31.317
create a Mediterranean simulator

00:06:31.317 --> 00:06:33.910
which is capable actually of reconstructing

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.112
even the information we are missing,

00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:39.100
which would enable us to have 
questions you could ask

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.088
like if you were using a route planner.

00:06:42.088 --> 00:06:45.159
"If I am in Corfu in June 1323

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:47.685
and want to go to Constantinople,

00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:49.828
where can I take a boat?"

00:06:49.828 --> 00:06:51.195
Probably we can answer this question

00:06:51.195 --> 00:06:55.668
with one or two or three days' precision.

00:06:55.668 --> 00:06:57.275
"How much will it cost?"

00:06:57.275 --> 00:07:00.867
"What are the chance of encountering pirates?"

00:07:00.867 --> 00:07:02.678
Of course, you understand,

00:07:02.678 --> 00:07:05.287
the central scientific challenge
of a project like this one

00:07:05.287 --> 00:07:09.016
is qualifying, quantifying and representing

00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:12.346
uncertainty and inconsistency
at each step of this process.

00:07:12.346 --> 00:07:15.058
There are errors everywhere,

00:07:15.058 --> 00:07:17.547
errors in the document, it's
the wrong name of the captain,

00:07:17.547 --> 00:07:20.760
some of the boats never actually took to sea.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.617
There are errors in translation, interpretative biases,

00:07:25.624 --> 00:07:29.090
and on top of that, if you add algorithmic processes,

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.039
you're going to have errors in recognition,

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:34.000
errors in extraction,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.481
so you have very, very uncertain data.

00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:42.238
So how can we detect and
correct these inconsistencies?

00:07:42.238 --> 00:07:45.898
How can we represent that form of uncertainty?

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:47.995
It's difficult. One thing you can do

00:07:47.995 --> 00:07:50.221
is document each step of the process,

00:07:50.221 --> 00:07:52.669
not only coding the historical information

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:55.348
but what we call the meta-historical information,

00:07:55.348 --> 00:07:58.011
how is historical knowledge constructed,

00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.009
documenting each step.

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:01.654
That will not guarantee that we actually converge

00:08:01.654 --> 00:08:04.104
toward a single story of Venice,

00:08:04.104 --> 00:08:06.242
but probably we can actually reconstruct

00:08:06.242 --> 00:08:09.290
a fully documented potential story of Venice.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.749
Maybe there's not a single map.

00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:12.869
Maybe there are several maps.

00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:15.085
The system should allow for that,

00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:17.944
because we have to deal with
a new form of uncertainty,

00:08:17.944 --> 00:08:22.585
which is really new for this type of giant databases.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.775
And how should we communicate

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.769
this new research to a large audience?

00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:31.432
Again, Venice is extraordinary for that.

00:08:31.432 --> 00:08:33.603
With the millions of visitors that come every year,

00:08:33.603 --> 00:08:35.366
it's actually one of the best places

00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:38.354
to try to invent the museum of the future.

00:08:38.354 --> 00:08:41.658
Imagine, horizontally you see the reconstructed map

00:08:41.658 --> 00:08:42.944
of a given year,

00:08:42.944 --> 00:08:45.902
and vertically, you see the document

00:08:45.902 --> 00:08:47.413
that served the reconstruction,

00:08:47.413 --> 00:08:50.813
paintings, for instance.

00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:53.393
Imagine an immersive system that permits

00:08:53.393 --> 00:08:56.895
to go and dive and reconstruct
the Venice of a given year,

00:08:56.895 --> 00:08:59.610
some experience you could share within a group.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.856
On the contrary, imagine actually that you start

00:09:01.856 --> 00:09:04.063
from a document, a Venetian manuscript,

00:09:04.063 --> 00:09:07.112
and you show, actually, what
you can construct out of it,

00:09:07.112 --> 00:09:08.884
how it is decoded,

00:09:08.884 --> 00:09:11.299
how the context of that document can be recreated.

00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:13.184
This is an image from an exhibit

00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:15.460
which is currently conducted in Geneva

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.814
with that type of system.

00:09:17.814 --> 00:09:19.989
So to conclude, we can say that

00:09:19.989 --> 00:09:23.068
research in the humanities is about to undergo

00:09:23.068 --> 00:09:24.870
an evolution which is maybe similar

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.452
to what happened to life sciences 30 years ago.

00:09:29.452 --> 00:09:34.128
It's really a question of scale.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.433
We see projects which are

00:09:37.433 --> 00:09:41.276
much beyond any single research team can do,

00:09:41.276 --> 00:09:43.519
and this is really new for the humanities,

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:47.388
which very often take the habit of working

00:09:47.388 --> 00:09:51.396
in small groups or only with a couple of researchers.

00:09:51.396 --> 00:09:53.514
When you visit the Archivio di Stato,

00:09:53.514 --> 00:09:56.336
you feel this is beyond what any single team can do,

00:09:56.336 --> 00:10:00.170
and that should be a joint and common effort.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.276
So what we must do for this paradigm shift

00:10:03.276 --> 00:10:05.178
is actually foster a new generation

00:10:05.178 --> 00:10:06.715
of "digital humanists"

00:10:06.715 --> 00:10:08.805
that are going to be ready for this shift.

00:10:08.805 --> 00:10:10.764
I thank you very much.

00:10:10.764 --> 00:10:14.764
