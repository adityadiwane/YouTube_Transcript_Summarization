00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.416
I have one more reason for optimism:

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.896
climate change.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.680
Maybe you don't believe it,
but here is the fact.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.800
On December 12, 2015,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.216
in Paris, under the United Nations,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.696
195 governments got together

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.880
and unanimously --

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.816
if you've worked with governments,
you know how difficult that is --

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.056
unanimously decided

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.896
to intentionally change the course
of the global economy

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.736
in order to protect the most vulnerable

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.416
and improve the life of all of us.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.856
Now, that is a remarkable achievement.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.096
(Applause)

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.256
But it is even more remarkable

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.256
if you consider where we had been
just a few years ago.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.936
2009, Copenhagen.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.600
Who remembers Copenhagen?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.736
Well, after years of working
toward a climate agreement,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.920
the same governments
convened in Copenhagen

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.040
and failed miserably.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.016
Why did it fail miserably?

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.616
For many different reasons,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.176
but primarily because
of the deeply entrenched divide

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.920
between the global
North and the global South.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.616
So now, six months after this failure,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.976
I was called in
to assume the responsibility

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.056
of the global climate change negotiations.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.456
You can imagine, the perfect moment
to start this new job.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.176
The global mood on climate change
was in the trash can.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.656
No one believed

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.640
that a global agreement
could ever be possible.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.200
In fact, neither did I.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.976
If you promise not to tell anyone
outside of this wonderful TED audience,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.096
I'm going to divulge a secret

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.480
that has been gratefully
buried by history.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.296
On my first press conference,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.696
a journalist asked, "Um, Ms. Figueres,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.096
do you think that a global agreement
is ever going to be possible?"

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.456
And without engaging brain,
I heard me utter,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.080
"Not in my lifetime."

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.776
Well, you can imagine
the faces of my press team

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.496
who were horrified
at this crazy Costa Rican woman

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.920
who was their new boss.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.336
And I was horrified, too.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.616
Now, I wasn't horrified at me,
because I'm kind of used to myself.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.816
I was actually horrified

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.536
at the consequences
of what I had just said,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.736
at the consequences for the world

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.160
in which all our children
are going to have to live.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.056
It was frankly a horrible moment for me,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.176
and I thought, well, no, hang on,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.816
hang on.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.656
Impossible is not a fact,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.120
it's an attitude.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.176
It's only an attitude.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.136
And I decided right then and there
that I was going to change my attitude

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.800
and I was going to help the world
change its attitude on climate change.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.736
So I don't know --

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.736
No, just this? Thanks.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.960
I don't know --

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.656
what you would do

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.120
if you were told
your job is to save the planet.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.760
Put that on the job description.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.696
And you have full responsibility,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.856
but you have absolutely no authority,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.720
because governments are sovereign
in every decision that they take.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.016
Well, I would really love to know

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.296
what you would do
on the first Monday morning,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.736
but here's what I did: I panicked.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.416
(Laughter)

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.936
And then I panicked again,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.000
because I realized I have no idea
how we're going to solve this problem.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.856
And then I realized I have no idea
how we're going to solve this problem,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.816
but I do know one thing:

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.816
we have got to change
the tone of this conversation.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.936
Because there is no way
you can deliver victory

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.160
without optimism.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.616
And here,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.176
I use optimism as a very simple word,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.976
but let's understand it
in its broader sense.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.896
Let's understand it as courage,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.896
hope, trust, solidarity,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.816
the fundamental belief
that we humans can come together

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.120
and can help each other
to better the fate of mankind.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.416
Well, you can imagine
that I thought that without that,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.896
there was no way we were going
to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.736
And for six years,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.616
I have stubbornly, relentlessly
injected optimism into the system,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.496
no matter what the questions
from the press --

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.696
and I have gotten better at those --

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.896
and no matter what the evidence
to the contrary.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.400
And believe you me, there has been
a lot of contrary evidence.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.640
But relentless optimism into the system.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.856
And pretty soon,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.216
we began to see changes
happening in many areas,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.496
precipitated by thousands of people,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.136
including many of you here today,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.360
and I thank you.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.136
And this TED community
will not be surprised

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.776
if I tell you the first area

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.936
in which we saw remarkable change

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.160
was ...

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.520
technology.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.216
We began to see that clean technologies,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.696
in particular renewable
energy technologies,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.336
began to drop price
and increase in capacity,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.416
to the point where today
we are already building

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.176
concentrated solar power plants

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.656
that have the capacity
to power entire cities,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.816
to say nothing of the fact
of what we are doing on mobility

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.720
and intelligent buildings.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.216
And with this shift in technologies,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.416
we were able to begin to understand

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.000
that there was a shift
in the economic equation,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.816
because we were able to recognize

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.936
that yes, there are
huge costs to climate change,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.496
and yes, there are compounded risks.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.176
But there also are economic advantages

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.896
and intrinsic benefits,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.856
because the dissemination
of the clean technologies

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.880
is going to bring us cleaner air,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.016
better health,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.576
better transportation,
more livable cities,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.136
more energy security,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.616
more energy access
to the developing world.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.680
In sum, a better world
than what we have now.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.520
And with that understanding,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.336
you should have witnessed,
in fact, part of you were,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.696
the spread of ingenuity and excitement

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.736
that went through,
first through nonnational governments,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.896
the private sector, captains of industry,
insurance companies,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.216
investors, city leaders,
faith communities,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.576
because they all began to understand,
this actually can be in their interest.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.120
This can actually
improve their bottom line.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.600
And it wasn't just the usual suspects.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.056
I have to tell you I had the CEO
of a major, major oil and gas company

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.416
come to me at the beginning of last year

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.640
and say --

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.280
privately, of course --

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.136
he did not know how
he was going to change his company,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.336
but he is going to change it,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.040
because he's interested
in long-term viability.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.016
Well, now we have a shift
in the economic equation,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.376
and with that, with broader
support from everyone,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:22.776
it did not take very long
before we saw that national governments

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.656
woke up to the fact
that this is in their national interest.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.816
And when we asked countries
to begin to identify

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.736
how they could contribute
to global efforts

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.096
but based on their national interest,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.376
189 countries out of 195,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.736
189 countries sent their
comprehensive climate change plans,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.895
based on their national interest,

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:51.816
concurrent with their priorities,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.320
consistent with their national
sustainable development plans.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.880
Well,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.976
once you protect
the core interests of nations,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.656
then you can understand
that nations were ready

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.296
to begin to converge onto a common path,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.576
onto a common direction of travel

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.736
that is going to take us
probably several decades,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.256
but over those several decades
is going to take us

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.736
into the new economy,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.336
into a decarbonized,
highly resilient economy,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.736
And the national contributions
that are currently on the table

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.056
on behalf of national governments

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.216
are insufficient to get us
to a stabilized climate,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.296
but they are only the first step,

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.336
and they will improve over time.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.776
And the measurement, reporting
and verification of all of those efforts

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.456
is legally binding.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.216
And the checkpoints that we're
going to have every five years

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.736
to assess collective progress
towards our goal are legally binding,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.656
and the path itself toward
a decarbonized and more resilient economy

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.880
is legally binding.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.496
And here's the more important part:

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.936
What did we have before?

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.016
A very small handful of countries

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.280
who had undertaken very reduced,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.376
short-term emission reduction commitments

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.576
that were completely insufficient

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.016
and furthermore,
largely perceived as a burden.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.456
Now what do we have?

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:28.056
Now we have all countries of the world
contributing with different intensities

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.376
from different approaches
in different sectors,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.880
but all of them
contributing to a common goal

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.496
and along a path

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.560
with environmental integrity.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.456
Well, once you have all of this in place

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.696
and you have shifted this understanding,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.096
then you see that governments
were able to go to Paris

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.656
and adopt the Paris agreement.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.320
(Applause)

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.560
So,

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.800
as I look back

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.560
over the past six years,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.480
first I remember

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.080
the day the Paris agreement was adopted.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.376
I cannot tell you
the euphoria in the room.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.776
5,000 people jumping out of their seats,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.456
crying, clapping, screaming, yelling,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.776
torn between euphoria and still disbelief
at what they had just seen,

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.640
because so many people

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.120
had worked for years towards this,
and this was finally their reality.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.720
And it wasn't just those
who had participated directly.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.376
A few weeks ago, I was with a colleague

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.216
who was trying to decide

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.440
on a Tahitian pearl that he wanted
to give to his wonderful wife Natasha.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.200
And once he had finally decided
what he was going to buy,

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.976
the jeweler said to him,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.816
"You know, you're very lucky
that you're buying this now,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.520
because these pearls could go extinct
very soon because of climate change."

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.776
"But," the jeweler said, "have you heard,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.576
the governments
have just come to a decision,

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.840
and Tahiti could have a chance."

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.016
Well, what a fantastic confirmation

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.056
that perhaps, perhaps here is hope,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.080
here is a possible chance.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.296
I'm the first one to recognize
that we have a lot of work still to do.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.656
We've only just started
our work on climate change.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.376
And in fact, we need to make sure
that we redouble our efforts

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.200
over the next five years
that are the urgent five years.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.496
But I do believe

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.456
that we have come over the past six years

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.680
from the impossible

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.536
to the now unstoppable.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.616
And how did we do that?
By injecting transformational optimism

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.096
that allowed us to go
from confrontation to collaboration,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.416
that allowed us to understand
that national and local interests

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.816
are not necessarily at odds
with global needs,

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.555
and that if we understand that,
we can bring them together

00:13:22.579 --> 00:13:24.816
and we can merge them harmoniously.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.576
And as I look forward
to other global issues

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.456
that will require
our attention this century --

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.960
food security, water security,
home security, forced migration --

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.496
I see that we certainly do not know

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.056
how we are going to solve
those problems yet.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.776
But we can take a page
out of what we have done on climate change

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.056
and we can understand

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:57.376
that we have got to reinterpret
the zero-sum mentality.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.376
Because we were trained to believe
that there always are winners and losers,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.040
and that your loss is my gain.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.736
Well, now that we're in a world

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.696
in which we have reached
planetary boundaries

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.376
and that we are not
just so interconnected,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.816
but increasingly
interdependent on each other,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.000
your loss is no longer my gain.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.240
We're either all losers

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.896
or we all can be winners.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.216
But we are going to have to decide

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.400
between zero and sum.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.896
We're going to have to decide
between zero benefit for all

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.896
or living life as the sum of all of us.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.256
We've done it once. We can do it again.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.496
Thanks.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.948
(Applause)
