00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:17.246
When I opened Mott Hall
Bridges Academy in 2010,

00:00:18.037 --> 00:00:19.674
my goal was simple:

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:23.563
open a school to close a prison.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.510
Now to some, this was an audacious goal,

00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:31.161
because our school is located
in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn --

00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:34.973
one of the most underserved
and violent neighborhoods

00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:37.063
in all of New York City.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.673
Like many urban schools
with high poverty rates,

00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:44.507
we face numerous challenges,

00:00:45.173 --> 00:00:47.599
like finding teachers who can empathize

00:00:47.623 --> 00:00:51.220
with the complexities
of a disadvantaged community,

00:00:52.054 --> 00:00:54.651
lack of funding for technology,

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:56.615
low parental involvement

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:03.357
and neighborhood gangs that recruit
children as early as fourth grade.

00:01:04.886 --> 00:01:06.292
So here I was,

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:13.142
the founding principal of a middle school
that was a district public school,

00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:16.855
and I only had 45 kids to start.

00:01:18.024 --> 00:01:20.540
Thirty percent of them had special needs.

00:01:21.797 --> 00:01:24.838
Eighty-six percent of them
were below grade level

00:01:24.862 --> 00:01:26.884
in English and in math.

00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:31.971
And 100 percent were living
below the poverty level.

00:01:33.258 --> 00:01:36.567
If our children are not in our classrooms,

00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:37.937
how will they learn?

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.505
And if they're not learning,

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:42.231
where would they end up?

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:48.372
It was evident when I would
ask my 13-year-old,

00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:49.657
"Young man,

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:53.018
where do you see yourself in five years?"

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:55.322
And his response:

00:01:55.691 --> 00:01:57.912
"I don't know if I'm gonna
live that long."

00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:01.847
Or to have a young woman say to me

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:08.232
that she had a lifelong goal
of working in a fast-food restaurant.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.969
To me, this was unacceptable.

00:02:11.862 --> 00:02:15.099
It was also evident that they had no idea

00:02:15.123 --> 00:02:17.268
that there was a landscape of opportunity

00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:20.040
that existed beyond their neighborhood.

00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:25.799
We call our students "scholars,"
because they're lifelong learners.

00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:28.377
And the skills that they learn today

00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:31.722
will prepare them for college
and career readiness.

00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:37.072
I chose the royal colors
of purple and black,

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:42.560
because I want them to be reminded
that they are descendants of greatness,

00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:44.409
and that through education,

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:46.480
they are future engineers,

00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:47.666
scientists,

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.053
entrepreneurs

00:02:49.077 --> 00:02:53.389
and even leaders who can and will
take over this world.

00:02:54.544 --> 00:02:55.822
To date,

00:02:55.846 --> 00:02:59.348
we have had three graduating classes,

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.345
at a 98 --

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:05.484
(Applause)

00:03:10.341 --> 00:03:13.183
At a 98-percent graduation rate.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.953
This is nearly 200 children,

00:03:16.977 --> 00:03:20.233
who are now going to some of the most
competitive high schools

00:03:20.257 --> 00:03:21.731
in New York City.

00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:27.319
(Applause)

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:32.186
It was a cold day in January

00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:36.566
when my scholar, Vidal Chastanet,
met Brandon Stanton,

00:03:37.462 --> 00:03:41.255
the founder of the popular blog
"Humans of New York."

00:03:42.102 --> 00:03:45.995
Brandon shared the story
of a young man from Brownsville

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.739
who had witnessed violence firsthand,

00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:53.502
by witnessing a man
being thrown off of a roof.

00:03:54.264 --> 00:03:57.703
Yet he can still
be influenced by a principal

00:03:57.727 --> 00:04:01.204
who had opened up a school
that believes in all children.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.095
Vidal embodies the story of so many
of our underprivileged children

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:10.230
who are struggling to survive,

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.650
which is why we must
make education a priority.

00:04:15.992 --> 00:04:19.204
Brandon's post created a global sensation

00:04:19.228 --> 00:04:21.607
that touched the lives of millions.

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:26.810
This resulted in 1.4 million
dollars being raised

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.311
for our scholars to attend field trips
to colleges and universities,

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:36.279
Summer STEAM programs,

00:04:36.303 --> 00:04:38.594
as well as college scholarships.

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:40.969
You need to understand

00:04:40.993 --> 00:04:46.462
that when 200 young people
from Brownsville visited Harvard,

00:04:47.308 --> 00:04:49.137
they now understood

00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:53.431
that a college of their choice
was a real possibility.

00:04:54.457 --> 00:04:57.895
And the impossibilities
that had been imposed upon them

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.561
by a disadvantaged community

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:04.122
were replaced by hope and purpose.

00:05:05.498 --> 00:05:10.484
The revolution in education
is happening in our schools,

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.703
with adults who provide love,

00:05:14.727 --> 00:05:15.903
structure,

00:05:15.927 --> 00:05:17.089
support

00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:18.363
and knowledge.

00:05:18.963 --> 00:05:21.782
These are the things
that inspire children.

00:05:22.806 --> 00:05:25.109
But it is not an easy task.

00:05:25.815 --> 00:05:27.854
And there are high demands

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:31.953
within an education system
that is not perfect.

00:05:32.893 --> 00:05:35.850
But I have a dynamic group of educators

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:41.026
who collaborate as a team to determine
what is the best curriculum.

00:05:41.553 --> 00:05:44.423
They take time beyond their school day,

00:05:44.447 --> 00:05:45.744
and come in on weekends

00:05:45.768 --> 00:05:50.221
and even use their own money
to often provide resources

00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:52.624
when we do not have it.

00:05:53.804 --> 00:05:55.652
And as the principal,

00:05:55.676 --> 00:05:58.562
I have to inspect what I expect.

00:05:59.308 --> 00:06:01.157
So I show up in classes

00:06:01.836 --> 00:06:04.922
and I conduct observations
to give feedback,

00:06:04.946 --> 00:06:08.361
because I want my teachers
to be just as successful

00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:10.700
as the name Mott Hall Bridges Academy.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.622
And I give them access to me
every single day,

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:18.510
which is why they all have
my personal cell number,

00:06:18.534 --> 00:06:21.592
including my scholars
and those who graduated --

00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:24.574
which is probably why I get
phone calls and text messages

00:06:24.598 --> 00:06:26.362
at three o'clock in the morning.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.571
(Laughter)

00:06:28.174 --> 00:06:30.770
But we are all connected to succeed,

00:06:30.794 --> 00:06:32.702
and good leaders do this.

00:06:34.282 --> 00:06:37.546
Tomorrow's future is sitting
in our classrooms.

00:06:38.304 --> 00:06:40.407
And they are our responsibility.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.503
That means everyone in here,

00:06:43.527 --> 00:06:45.657
and those who are watching the screen.

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:49.019
We must believe in their brilliance,

00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:52.843
and remind them by teaching them

00:06:52.867 --> 00:06:57.361
that there indeed is power in education.

00:06:58.047 --> 00:06:59.227
Thank you.

00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:09.379
(Applause)
