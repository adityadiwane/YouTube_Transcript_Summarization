00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:16.605
I didn't know when I agreed to do this

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:22.285
whether I was expected to talk or to sing.

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:27.333
But when I was told that the topic was language,

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:32.104
I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment.

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:36.453
I have a problem.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.467
It's not the worst thing in the world.

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:39.664
I'm fine.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:41.413
I'm not on fire.

00:00:41.413 --> 00:00:43.314
I know that other people in the world

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:47.482
have far worse things to deal with,

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:53.432
but for me, language and music are

00:00:53.432 --> 00:00:57.867
inextricably linked through this one thing.

00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:05.556
And the thing is that I have a stutter.

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:08.104
It might seem curious given that I spend

00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:11.902
a lot of my life on the stage.

00:01:11.902 --> 00:01:14.926
One would assume that I'm comfortable

00:01:14.926 --> 00:01:17.358
in the public sphere and comfortable here,

00:01:17.358 --> 00:01:19.798
speaking to you guys.

00:01:19.798 --> 00:01:24.568
But the truth is that I've spent
my life up until this point

00:01:24.568 --> 00:01:28.919
and including this point, living in mortal dread

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:32.229
of public speaking.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.931
Public singing, whole different thing. (Laughter)

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.432
But we'll get to that in a moment.

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:46.342
I've never really talked about it before so explicitly.

00:01:46.342 --> 00:01:48.674
I think that that's because I've always lived in hope

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:51.218
that when I was a grown-up,

00:01:51.218 --> 00:01:57.490
I wouldn't have one.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.705
I sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown,

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:03.912
I'll have learned to speak French,

00:02:03.912 --> 00:02:07.190
and when I'm grown, I'll learn
how to manage my money,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.468
and when I'm grown, I won't have a stutter,

00:02:09.468 --> 00:02:11.791
and then I'll be able to public speak
and maybe be the prime minister

00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:15.156
and anything's possible and, you know.

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:18.556
(Laughter)

00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:21.605
So I can talk about it now

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:25.427
because I've reached this point, where —

00:02:25.427 --> 00:02:29.367
I mean, I'm 28.

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:31.857
I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now.

00:02:31.857 --> 00:02:33.679
(Laughter)

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.681
And I'm an adult woman

00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:39.757
who spends her life as a performer,

00:02:39.757 --> 00:02:42.659
with a speech impediment.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.867
So, I might as well come clean about it.

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:50.849
There are some interesting
angles to having a stutter.

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.223
For me, the worst thing that can happen

00:02:54.223 --> 00:02:57.485
is meeting another stutterer.

00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:00.701
(Laughter)

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.908
This happened to me in Hamburg, when

00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:05.911
this guy, we met and he said,

00:03:05.911 --> 00:03:09.532
"Hello, m-m-m-my name is Joe,"

00:03:09.532 --> 00:03:13.793
and I said, "Oh, hello, m-m-m-my name is Meg."

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:16.450
Imagine my horror when I realized

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.355
he thought I was making fun of him.

00:03:18.355 --> 00:03:22.450
(Laughter)

00:03:24.197 --> 00:03:29.230
People think I'm drunk all the time.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.630
(Laughter)

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.306
People think that I've forgotten their name

00:03:36.306 --> 00:03:40.997
when I hesitate before saying it.

00:03:40.997 --> 00:03:43.220
And it is a very weird thing, because

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.459
proper nouns are the worst.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.249
If I'm going to use the word
"Wednesday" in a sentence,

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:54.152
and I'm coming up to the word,

00:03:54.152 --> 00:03:57.121
and I can feel that I'm going to stutter or something,

00:03:57.121 --> 00:04:00.431
I can change the word to "tomorrow,"

00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:02.490
or "the day after Tuesday,"

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.883
or something else.

00:04:04.883 --> 00:04:09.866
It's clunky, but you can get away with it,

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:12.408
because over time I've developed this

00:04:12.408 --> 00:04:16.795
loophole method of using speech

00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:19.926
where right at the last minute you

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:24.207
change the thing and you trick your brain.

00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:27.915
But with people's names, you can't change them.

00:04:27.915 --> 00:04:30.593
(Laughter)

00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:33.762
When I was singing a lot of jazz,

00:04:33.762 --> 00:04:39.285
I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve.

00:04:39.285 --> 00:04:41.899
As you can probably gather,

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:45.173
S's and T's, together or independently,

00:04:45.173 --> 00:04:48.216
are my kryptonite.

00:04:49.287 --> 00:04:51.439
But I would have to introduce the band

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:54.651
over this rolling vamp,

00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:57.500
and when I got around to Steve,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.271
I'd often find myself stuck on the "St."

00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:08.959
And it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable 
and it totally kills the vibe.

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:11.287
So after a few instances of this,

00:05:11.287 --> 00:05:16.387
Steve happily became "Seve,"

00:05:16.387 --> 00:05:20.982
and we got through it that way. (Laughter)

00:05:21.887 --> 00:05:24.238
I've had a lot of therapy,

00:05:24.238 --> 00:05:26.525
and a common form of treatment is to use

00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:31.433
this technique that's called smooth speech,

00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:36.858
which is where you almost
sing everything that you say.

00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:39.210
You kind of join everything together in this

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.475
very singsong, kindergarten teacher way,

00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:47.454
and it makes you sound very serene,
like you've had lots of Valium,

00:05:47.454 --> 00:05:51.246
and everything is calm. (Laughter)

00:05:51.246 --> 00:05:54.373
That's not actually me.

00:05:54.373 --> 00:05:57.698
And I do use that. I do.

00:05:57.698 --> 00:06:04.532
I use it when I have to be on panel shows,

00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:07.911
or when I have to do radio interviews,

00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:12.774
when the economy of airtime is paramount.

00:06:12.774 --> 00:06:15.828
(Laughter)

00:06:15.828 --> 00:06:20.216
I get through it that way for my job.

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:22.933
But as an artist who feels that their work

00:06:22.933 --> 00:06:28.903
is based solely on a platform of honesty

00:06:28.903 --> 00:06:32.937
and being real,

00:06:32.937 --> 00:06:36.671
that feels often like cheating.

00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:39.885
Which is why before I sing, I wanted to tell you

00:06:39.885 --> 00:06:43.544
what singing means to me.

00:06:43.544 --> 00:06:47.595
It's more than making nice sounds,

00:06:47.595 --> 00:06:52.997
and it's more than making nice songs.

00:06:52.997 --> 00:06:58.531
It's more than feeling known, or understood.

00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:04.696
It's more than making you feel the things that I feel.

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:07.385
It's not about mythology,

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:12.427
or mythologizing myself to you.

00:07:12.427 --> 00:07:17.805
Somehow, through some miraculous

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:22.305
synaptic function of the human brain,

00:07:22.305 --> 00:07:27.761
it's impossible to stutter when you sing.

00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:31.517
And when I was younger,
that was a method of treatment

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.970
that worked very well for me,

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:39.850
singing, so I did it a lot.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.993
And that's why I'm here today.

00:07:43.993 --> 00:07:48.358
(Applause)

00:07:48.358 --> 00:07:51.849
Thank you.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.583
Singing for me is sweet relief.

00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:07.430
It is the only time when I feel fluent.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.856
It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:13.448
is comprehensively exactly what I intended.

00:08:13.448 --> 00:08:15.731
(Laughter)

00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:18.668
So I know that this is a TED Talk,

00:08:18.668 --> 00:08:22.417
but now i'm going to TED sing.

00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:23.976
This is a song that I wrote last year.

00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:26.374
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:31.548
(Applause)
