00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
The Internet, the Web as we know it,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
the kind of Web -- the things we're all talking about --

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.160
is already less than 5,000 days old.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.160
So all of the things that we've seen come about,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
which we couldn't even imagine happening before,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
all these things rolling into our lives,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.160
just this abundance of things that are right before us,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
This kind of cornucopia of stuff

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.160
just coming and never ending is amazing, and we're not amazed.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
It's really amazing that all this stuff is here.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.160
(Laughter)

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.160
It's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
And I know that 10 years ago,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
if I had told you that this was all coming,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
you would have said that that's impossible.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.160
There's simply no economic model that that would be possible.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
And if I told you it was all coming for free,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
you would say, this is simply -- you're dreaming.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild-eyed optimist.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
And yet it's here.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.160
The other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
as I looked at what even Wired was talking about,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
we thought it was going to be TV, but better.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
was going to be coming.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
And it turns out that that's not what it was.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
First of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.160
And so one of the things that I think we're learning --

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
if you think about, like, Wikipedia,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
it's something that was simply impossible.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
It's impossible in theory, but possible in practice.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160
And if you take all these things that are impossible,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160
I think one of the things that we're learning from this era,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
from this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
because we're unprepared for it.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
So, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
But if that's happened in the last 5,000 days,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
So, I have a kind of a simple story,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
this thing that has happened in 5,000 days --

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
that's all these computers, all these handhelds,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.160
all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers --

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.160
basically what we're getting out of all these connections

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
is we're getting one machine.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160
If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
are actually just little windows into those machines,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.160
but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
And so I began to think about that.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
And it turned out that this machine happens to be

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
the most reliable machine that we've ever made.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.160
that runs the number of hours, the number of days.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
5,000 days without interruption -- that's just unbelievable.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
And of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days;

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
the Web is only 5,000 days.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.160
So, I was trying to basically make measurements.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
What are the dimensions of this machine?

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.160
And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
all around the globe on all the computers.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
And there is a 100 billion clicks per day.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.160
And there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.160
and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.160
talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
Well, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.160
but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
There's two million emails per second.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
So it's a very big number.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
It's just a huge machine,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.160
So here's the specifications,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it:

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160
170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
emails running at two megahertz itself,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
31 kilohertz text messaging,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160
246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
That's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160
And the total traffic on this

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
is running at seven terabytes per second.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
So every second, half of the Library of Congress

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160
is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
So I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
55 trillion links is almost the same

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
as the number of synapses in your brain.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
A quadrillion transistors is almost the same

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
as the number of neurons in your brain.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
So to a first approximation, we have these things --

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
twenty petahertz synapse firings.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
Of course, the memory is really huge.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.160
But to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size --

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.160
and its complexity, kind of -- to your brain.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.160
Because in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.160
However, your brain isn't doubling every two years.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.160
So if we say this machine right now that we've made

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
is about one HB, one human brain,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
if we look at the rate that this is increasing,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.160
30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
So by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
will exceed a total processing power of humanity,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
in raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.160
Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.160
So, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
I have three kind of general things

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.160
I would like to say, three consequences of this.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.160
First, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
in the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
And the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160
And thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
So let me go through those three things.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
First of all, we have all these things in our hands.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
We think they're all separate devices,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
but in fact, every screen in the world

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
is looking into the one machine.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
These are all basically portals into that one machine.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.160
The second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
and you're kind of touching the cloud with this.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.160
And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
It's wireless. It's always connected.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160
There's many things about it. It becomes very simple,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
So the machine is computing.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160
And in some ways, it's sort of back

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
to the kind of old idea of centralized computing.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.160
But everything, all the cameras, and the microphones,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.160
and the sensors in cars

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
and everything is connected to this machine.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
And everything will go through the Web.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
And we're seeing that already with, say, phones.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
Right now, phones don't go through the Web,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160
but they are beginning to, and they will.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.160
And if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
in terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah --

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
all these things are going to become Web based.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
They're going through the machine.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.160
And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
Right now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
a Word document, they aren't on the Web,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
They're going to speak the Web language.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
They're going to talk to the machine.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
The Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
that's sucking up everything into it.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.160
And so every thing will be part of the Web.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.160
So every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160
some little sliver of Web-ness and connection,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.160
and it will be part of this machine,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
so that our environment -- kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense --

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.160
our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
Now, with RFIDs and other things -- whatever technology it is,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
and so we have, basically, an Internet of things.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.160
So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
and a car as a chip with wheels,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160
because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:54.160
is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
A lot of people think about the new economy

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
as something that was going to be a disembodied,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
alternative, virtual existence,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
and that we would have the old economy of atoms.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
But in fact, what the new economy really is

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
is the marriage of those two, where we embed the information,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160
and the digital nature of things into the material world.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.160
That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going --

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:24.160
this union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
And so one of the consequences of that, I believe,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.160
is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now --

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
TV, film, video -- that basically becomes one media platform.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
And while there's many differences in some senses,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
they will share more and more in common with each other.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.160
So that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
the value's in the uncopiable things,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:50.160
the immediacy, the authentication, the personalization.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
The media wants to be liquid.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.160
not so that they are "free" as in "beer," but "free" as in "freedom."

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
And the network effects rule,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
meaning that the more you have, the more you get.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160
The first fax machine -- the person who bought the first fax machine

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.160
was an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160
But here she became an evangelist, recruiting others

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
Those are the effects that we're going to see.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
Attention is the currency.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.160
So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
And the other thing about this embodiment

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
McLuhan was saying, "Machines are the extensions of the human senses."

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
And I'm saying, "Humans are now going to be

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
the extended senses of the machine," in a certain sense.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.160
So we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
through all our digital photographs and cameras.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.160
And we see that in things like Flickr,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160
or Photosynth, this program from Microsoft

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.160
that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.160
from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:09.160
In a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160
Now, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
that what the Web is doing is restructuring.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
And I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is --

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.160
I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a "semantic Web."

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
So first of all, the first stage that we've seen

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
of the Internet was that it was going to link computers.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
And that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
And we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.160
And if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
and there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.160
you connected it from one computer to another computer.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
And what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.160
you had to share packets of information.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line:

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
you had to share packets.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.160
The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
So in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.160
I went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.160
Now we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.160
so one page links to another page.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
And if I want to go in to book a flight,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.160
I go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
and I'm linking to that page.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.160
And what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
You couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.160
you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
So that's what we were doing.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.160
We're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160
and that is where we link the data.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
So, I don't know what the name of this thing is.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
So we're going from machine to machine,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
from page to page, and now data to data.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.160
So the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.160
we're actually going to link from one idea on a page

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
to another idea, rather than to the other page.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
So every idea is basically being supported --

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
or every item, or every noun -- is being supported by the entire Web.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.160
It's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.160
So besides physically coming out again into this idea

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.160
that it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.160
So something will resolve down to the information

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.160
about a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
Every person, every item will have a something

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
that will be very specific, and will link

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160
to a specific representation of that idea or item.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160
So now, in this new one, when I link to it,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:46.160
I would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.160
And so, giving an example of this thing,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160
I live in Pacifica, rather than -- right now Pacifica

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
and that it's a specific town that I live in,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.160
but that's what we're going to be talking about.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
It's going to link directly to --

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.160
it will know, the Web will be able to read itself

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
and know that that actually is a place,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
and that whenever it sees that word, "Pacifica,"

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.160
it knows that it actually has a place,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
latitude, longitude, a certain population.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
So here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160
that you'll see a lot more of.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:24.160
All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160
So I'll give you one kind of an example.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160
There's like a billion social sites on the Web.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.160
and all your friends are.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
Why should you be doing that? You should just do that once,

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
and it should know who all your friends are.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
So that's what you want, is all your friends are identified,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
and you should just carry these relationships around.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
All this data about you should just be conveyed,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
and you should do it once and that's all that should happen.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
And you should have all the networks

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
of all the relationships between those pieces of data.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.160
That's what we're moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph --

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.160
we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.160
But what's it's doing is sharing data.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.160
So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
than just sharing your Web page, or your computer.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.160
And all these things that are going to be on this

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160
are not just pages, they are things.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.160
Everything we've described, every artifact or place,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
will be a specific representation,

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.160
will have a specific character that can be linked to directly.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
So we have this database of things.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.160
And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.160
that we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.160
but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things --

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.160
where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane --

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
that that physical thing becomes part of the Web.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
And so we are in the middle of this thing

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
that's completely linked, down to every object

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.160
in the little sliver of a connection that it has.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.160
So, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.160
that we're going to be codependent.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.160
It's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.160
If you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
And I found out by looking at it

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160
that I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
So I am open, and being transparent to that.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:25.160
And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160
That is going to be the price.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.160
If you want to have total personalization,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160
you have to be totally transparent.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
Google. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160
We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
where I don't even try to remember things --

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.160
I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160
And we kind of object at first, saying, "Oh, that's awful."

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.160
But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
called the alphabet, and writing,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
we're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.160
We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.160
And so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.160
without this other machine being there.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.160
And what is happening with this is

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160
some kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.160
as being an expert, Larry Page told me

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.160
that that's what they're trying to do,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.160
and that's what they're trying to do.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.160
But when six billion humans are Googling,

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
who's searching who? It goes both ways.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.160
So we are the Web, that's what this thing is.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.160
We are going to be the machine.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:26.160
So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160
Just like it wasn't TV and only better.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.160
The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.160
but only better -- it's going to be something different.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.160
And I think it's going to be smarter.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.160
It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.160
But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.160
Secondly, it's become much more personalized.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160
It will know us, and that's good.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.160
And again, the price of that will be transparency.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.160
And thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:01.160
in terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.160
And all these devices will be portals into that.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.160
So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:13.160
is that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better,"

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.160
but a new kind of stage in this development.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.160
It looks more global. If you take this whole thing,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
it is a very big machine, very reliable machine,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
more reliable than its parts.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.160
But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:32.160
So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.160
more as if this wasn't a large organism

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.160
that we are going to be interacting with. It's a "One."

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.160
And I don't know what else to call it, than the One.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.160
We'll have a better word for it.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.160
But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.160
And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160
I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.160
or a volvox, which is what that organism is.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:59.160
So, to do, action, take-away. So, here's what I would say:

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.160
there's only one machine, and the Web is its OS.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.160
All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.160
To share is to gain. Let the One read it.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.160
It's going to be machine-readable.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.160
You want to make something that the machine can read.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.160
And the One is us. We are in the One.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.160
I appreciate your time.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.160
(Applause)
