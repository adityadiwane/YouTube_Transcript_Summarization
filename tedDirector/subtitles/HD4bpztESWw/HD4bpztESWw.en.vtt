00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I grew up

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
in a very small village in Canada,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and I'm an undiagnosed

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
dyslexic.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I had a really hard time in school.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
In fact, my mother told me eventually

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
that I was the little kid in the village

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
who cried all the way to school.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I ran away.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
and together, over 20 years,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
we built an amazing jewelry business.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
It was a fairy tale, and then we retired.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Then she took me to see a film

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
that I really didn't want to see.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
It ruined my life --

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
(Laughter)

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
"The Inconvenient Truth" and Mr. Gore.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
I have four kids,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and even if part of what he says is true,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
they're not going to have the life that I had.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And I decided at that moment

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
that I would spend the rest of my life

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
doing whatever I could

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
to improve their possibilities.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
So here's the world,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and here we are in Bali.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
It's a tiny, little island --

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
60 miles by 90 miles.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
It has an intact Hindu culture.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Cynthia and I were there.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
We had had a wonderful life there,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and we decided to do something unusual.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
We decided to give back

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
locally.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And here it is: it's called the Green School.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
I know it doesn't look like a school,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
but it is something we decided to do,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and it is extremely,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
extremely green.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
The classrooms have no walls.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
The desks are not square.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
At Green School, the children are smiling --

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
an unusual thing for school, especially for me.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And we practice holism.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And for me it's just the idea

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
that, if this little girl

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
graduates as a whole person,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
chances are

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
she'll demand a whole world --

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
a whole world --

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
to live on.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Our children spend 181 days

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
going to school in a box.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
The people that built my school

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
also built the prison and the insane asylum

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
out of the same materials.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
So if this gentleman

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
had had a holistic education,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
would he be sitting there?

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Would he have had more possibilities in his life?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
The classrooms have natural light.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
They're beautiful. They're bamboo.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
The breeze passes through them.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And when the natural breeze isn't enough,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
the kids deploy bubbles,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
but not the kind of bubbles you know.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
These bubbles are made from natural cotton

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and rubber from the rubber tree.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
So we basically turned the box

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
into a bubble.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And these kids know

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
that painless climate control

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
may not be

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
part of their future.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
We pay the bill at the end of the month,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
but the people that are really going to pay the bill

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
are our grandchildren.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
We have to teach the kids

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
that the world is not indestructible.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
These kids did a little graffiti on their desks,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and then they signed up for two extra courses.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
The first one was called sanding

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and the second one was called re-waxing.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
But since that happened,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
they own those desks.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
They know they can control their world.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
We're on the grid. We're not proud of it.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
is taking us off the grid with solar.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And this thing

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
is the second vortex to be built in the world,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
When the turbine drops in,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
day and night.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And you know what these are.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
There's nowhere to flush.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And as long as we're taking our waste

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and mixing it with a huge amount of water --

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
you're all really smart, just do the math.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
How many people times how much water.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
There isn't enough water.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
These are compost toilets,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and nobody at the school wanted to know about them,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
especially the principal.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
And they work. People use them. People are okay.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
It's something you should think about doing.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Not many things didn't work.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
got eaten by the sun in six months.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
We had to replace them with recyclable plastic.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
into the classrooms.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
So we had some good ideas:

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
we took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and created the first alternative

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
to the whiteboard.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Green School sits in south-central Bali,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
and it's on 20 acres

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
of rolling garden.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
There's an amazing river traveling through it,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
and you can see there

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
how we manage to get across the river.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
I met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
I said, "Welcome to Green School."

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
He said, "I've been on an airplane for 24 hours."

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
I asked him, "Why?"

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
He said, "I had a dream once about a green school,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and I saw a picture of this green school,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
I got on an airplane.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
In August I'm bringing my sons."

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
This was a great thing.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
But more than that,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
people are building green houses around Green School,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
so their kids can walk to school on the paths.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
And people are bringing their green industries,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
hopefully their green restaurants,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
to the Green School.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
It's becoming a community.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
It's becoming a green model.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
We had to look at everything.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
No petrochemicals in the pavement.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
No pavement.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
These are volcanic stones laid by hand.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
There are no sidewalks.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
The sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
but they're green.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
This is the school buffalo.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
He's planning to eat that fence for dinner.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
All the fences at Green School are green.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And when the kindergarten kids

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
recently moved their gate,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
they found out the fence was made out of tapioca.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
sliced them thinly and made delicious chips.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
Landscaping.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
We manage to keep the garden that was there

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
We dropped them gently in.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
We made space for these guys

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
who are Bali's last black pigs.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
And the school cow

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
is trying to figure out

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
how to replace the lawnmower

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
on the playing field.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
These young ladies

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
are living in a rice culture,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
but they know something that few people know in a rice culture.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
They know how to plant organic rice,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
they know how to look after it,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
They're part of the rice cycle

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
and these skills will be valuable

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
for them in their future.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
This young man is picking organic vegetables.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
We feed 400 people lunch every day

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
and it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Local Balinese women

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
cook the food on sawdust burners

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
using secrets that only their grandmothers know.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
The food is incredible.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Green School is a place of pioneers,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
local and global.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
And it's a kind of microcosm

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
of the globalized world.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
The kids are from 25 countries.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
When I see them together,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
I know that they're working out

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
how to live in the future.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Green School is going into its third year

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
with 160 children.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
It's a school where you do learn reading --

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
one of my favorites --

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
writing -- I was bad at it --

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
arithmetic.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
But you also learn other things.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
You learn bamboo building.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
You practice

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
ancient Balinese arts.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
The kids love it.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
The mothers aren't quite convinced.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
(Laughter)

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
and we said, okay, local, what does "local" mean?

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Local means

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
that 20 percent of the population of the school

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
has to be Balinese,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
and this was a really big commitment.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
And we were right.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
And people are coming forward

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
from all over the world

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.260
because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
The teachers are as diverse

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
as the student body,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
and the amazing thing

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
is that volunteers are popping up.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
A man came from Java

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
with a new kind of organic agriculture.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
A woman came from Africa with music.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
And together these volunteers and the teachers

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
are deeply committed

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
to creating a new generation

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
of global, green leaders.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
The Green School effect --

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
we don't know what it is.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
We need someone to come and study it.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
But what's happening, our learning-different kids --

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
dyslexic --

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
we've renamed them prolexic --

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.260
are doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
And all the kids are thriving.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
And how did we do all this?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
On giant grass.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
It's bamboo.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
It comes out of the ground like a train.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
and three years later it can be harvested

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
to build buildings like this.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.260
It's as strong and dense as teak

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and it will hold up any roof.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
When the architects came, they brought us these things,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
and you've probably seen things like this.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
The yellow box was called the administration complex.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
(Laughter)

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
We squashed it, we rethought it,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
but mainly we renamed it

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
"the heart of school,"

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
and that changed everything forever.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
It's a double helix.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
It has administrators in it

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
and many, many other things.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
And the problem of building it --

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
when the Balinese workers

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
saw long reams of plans,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
they looked at them and said, "What's this?"

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
So we built big models.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
We had them engineered by the engineers.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
And Balinese carpenters like this

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
measured them with their bamboo rulers,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
selected the bamboo and built the buildings

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
using age-old techniques,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
mostly by hand.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
It was chaos.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
so they use metal scaffolding

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
to build the bamboo building

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and when the scaffolding came down,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
we realized that we had a cathedral,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
a cathedral to green,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
and a cathedral to green education.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
The heart of school has seven kilometers

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
of bamboo in it.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
From the time the foundations were finished,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
in three months it had roofs and floors.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
but many people believe

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
that it's the most beautiful.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Is this doable in your community?

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
We believe it is.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
Green School is a model we built for the world.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
It's a model we built for Bali.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And you just have to follow these simple, simple rules:

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
be local,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
let the environment lead

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
and think about

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.260
how your grandchildren might build.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
So, Mr. Gore, thank you.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
You ruined my life,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
but you gave me an incredible future.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
And if you're interested in being involved

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
in finishing Green School

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and building the next 50 around the world,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
please come and see us.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Thank you.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:28.260
(Applause)
