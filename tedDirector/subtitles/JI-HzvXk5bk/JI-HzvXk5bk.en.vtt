00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:16.228
How do we build a society

00:00:16.253 --> 00:00:17.760
without fossil fuels?

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:21.120
This is a very complex challenge,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.400
and I believe developing countries
could take the lead in this transition.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.680
And I'm aware that this
is a contentious statement,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.736
but the reality is that so much
is at stake in our countries

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.640
if we let fossil fuels stay
at the center of our development.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.080
We can do it differently.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.456
And it's time, it really is time,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.176
to debunk the myth

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.256
that a country has to choose
between development on the one hand

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.680
and environmental protection,
renewables, quality of life, on the other.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.080
I come from Costa Rica,
a developing country.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.880
We are nearly five million people,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.776
and we live right in the middle
of the Americas,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.120
so it's very easy
to remember where we live.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.360
Nearly 100 percent of our electricity

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.856
comes from renewable sources,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.096
five of them.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.240
(Applause)

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.656
Hydropower, geothermal,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.120
wind, solar, biomass.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.136
Did you know that last year,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.616
for 299 days,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.856
we did not use any fossil fuels

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.360
in order to generate all our electricity?

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.200
It's a fantastic achievement,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.440
and yet, it hides a paradox,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.136
which is that nearly 70 percent

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.760
of all our energy consumption is oil.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.080
Why?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.536
Because of our transportation system,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.816
which is totally dependent
on fossil fuels,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.479
like it is in most countries.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:26.016
So if we think of the energy
transition as a marathon,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.936
the question is, how do we get
to the finish line,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.080
how do we decarbonize
the rest of the economy?

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.776
And it's fair to say
that if we don't succeed,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.576
it's difficult to see who will.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.160
So that is why I want
to talk to you about Costa Rica,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.856
because I believe we are a great candidate

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.280
in pioneering a vision
for development without fossil fuels.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.456
If you know one thing about our country,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.400
it's that we don't have an army.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.360
So I'm going to take you back to 1948.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.120
That year, the country
was coming out of civil war.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.936
Thousands of Costa Ricans had died,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.240
and families were bitterly split.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.256
And yet, a surprising idea
won the hearts and minds:

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.176
we would reboot the country,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.256
and that Second Republic
would have no army.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.520
So we abolished it.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.016
And the president at the time,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.216
JosÃ© Figueres,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.560
found a powerful way
by smashing the walls of an army base.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.376
The following year, 1949,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.576
we made that decision permanent
in the new constitution,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.760
and that is why I can tell you that story
nearly 70 years later.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.536
And I'm grateful.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.520
I'm grateful they made that decision
before I was born,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.536
because it allowed me
and millions of others

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.720
to live in a very stable country.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.136
And you might be thinking
that it was good luck,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.656
but it wasn't.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.720
There was a pattern of deliberate choices.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.136
In the '40s, Costa Ricans were given
free education and free health care.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.120
We called that social guarantees.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.376
By abolishing the army,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.336
we were able to turn military spending
into social spending,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.280
and that was a driver of stability.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.375
In the '50s --

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:31.480
(Applause)

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.976
In the '50s, we started
investing in hydropower,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.656
and that kept us away from the trap

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.736
of using fossil fuels
for electricity generation,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.120
which is what the world
is struggling with today.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.696
In the '70s we invested in national parks,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.680
and that kept us away

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.296
from the deeply flawed logic
of growth, growth, growth at any cost

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.000
that you see others embracing,
especially in the developing world.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.896
In the '90s, we pioneered payments
for ecosystem services,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.856
and that helped us reverse deforestation

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.040
and boosted ecotourism,
which today is a key engine of growth.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.936
So investing in environmental protection

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.176
did not hurt our economy.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.456
Quite the opposite.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.496
And it doesn't mean we are perfect,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.856
and it doesn't mean
we don't have contradictions.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.120
That's not the point.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.216
The point is that,
by making our own choices,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.200
we were able to develop resilience
in dealing with development problems.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.656
Also, if you take a country like ours,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.576
the GDP per capita
is around 11,000 dollars,

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.320
depending on how you measure it.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.136
But according to
the Social Progress Index,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.056
we are an absolute outlier

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.200
when it comes to turning GDP
into social progress.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.536
Abolishing the army,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.376
investing in nature and people,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.200
did something very powerful, too.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.680
It shaped the narrative,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.616
the narrative of a small country
with big ideas,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.000
and it was very empowering
to grow up with that narrative.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.696
So the question is,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.800
what is the next big idea
for this generation?

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.696
And I believe what comes next

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.880
is for this generation
to let go of fossil fuels for good,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.280
just as we did with the army.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.696
Fossil fuels create climate change.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.096
We know that,

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.616
and we know how vulnerable we are
to the impacts of climate change.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.296
So as a developing country,
it is in our best interest

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.296
to build development without fossil fuels

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.960
that harm people in the first place.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.120
Because

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.840
why would we continue importing oil

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.536
for transportation

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.720
if we can use electricity instead?

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.536
Remember,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.456
this is the country

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.536
where electricity
comes from water in our rivers,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.056
heat from volcanoes,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.416
wind turbines, solar panels,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.640
biowaste.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.856
Abolishing fossil fuels means
disrupting our transportation system

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.216
so that we can power our cars,
buses and trains with electricity

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.720
instead of dirty energy.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.816
And transportation, let me tell you,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.896
has become an existential issue
for us Costa Ricans,

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.336
because the model we have
is not working for us.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.600
It's hurting people,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.216
it's hurting companies,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.216
and it's hurting our health.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.976
Because when policies
and infrastructure fail,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.240
this is what happens on a daily basis.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.376
Two hours in the morning,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.216
two hours in the evening.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.920
I don't understand why
we have to accept this as normal.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.000
It's offensive

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.960
to have to waste our time like this
every single day.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.816
And this highway is actually quite good

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.896
compared to what you see
in other countries

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.360
where traffic is exploding.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.280
You know, Costa Ricans call this "presa."

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.200
Presa means "imprisoned."

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.336
And people are turning violent

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.560
in a country that is otherwise
happy in pura vida.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.280
It's happening.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.240
So a lot is at stake.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.416
The good news

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.456
is that when we talk
about clean transportation

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.736
and different mobility,

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:47.775
we're not talking about
some distant utopia out there.

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:51.559
We're talking about electric mobility
that is happening today.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:58.496
By 2022, electric cars
and conventional cars

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.600
are expected to cost the same,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.880
and cities are already trying
electric buses.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.840
And these really cool creatures

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.960
are saving money,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.760
and they reduce pollution.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.456
So if we want to get rid
of oil-based transportation, we can,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.096
because we have options now
that we didn't have before.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.400
It's really exciting.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.960
But of course,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.960
some get very uncomfortable
with this idea,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.936
and they will come and they will tell you

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.776
that the world is stuck with oil,
and so is Costa Rica, so get real.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.056
That's what they tell you.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.416
And you know what the answer
to that argument is?

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.016
That in 1948, we didn't say
the world is stuck with armies,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.976
so let's keep our army, too.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.960
No, we made a very brave choice,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.840
and that choice made the whole difference.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.976
So it's time for this generation
to be brave again

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.776
and abolish fossil fuels for good.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.400
And I'll give you three reasons
why we have to do this.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.440
First,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.856
our model of transportation
and urbanization is broken,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.320
so this is the best moment
to redefine our urban and mobility future.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.336
We don't want cities
that are built for cars.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.696
We want cities for people

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.576
where we can walk and we can use bikes.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.736
And we want public transportation,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.256
lots of it,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.320
public transportation
that is clean and dignifying.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.120
Because if we continue
adding fleets of conventional cars,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.960
our cities will become unbearable.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.736
Second, we have to change,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.240
but incremental change
is not going to be sufficient.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.760
We need transformational change.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.456
And there are some
incremental projects in my country,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.680
and I am the first one to celebrate them.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.176
But let's not kid ourselves.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.096
We're not talking about ending up
with really beautiful electric cars here

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.736
and a few electric buses there

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.136
while we keep investing
in the same kind of infrastructure,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.656
more cars, more roads, more oil.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.976
We're talking about
breaking free from oil,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.320
and you cannot get there
through incrementalism.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.520
Third, and you know this one,

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.680
the world is hungry for inspiration.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.216
It craves stories of success

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.016
in dealing with complex issues,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.160
especially in developing countries.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.680
So I believe Costa Rica
can be an inspiration to others,

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.456
as we did last year when we disclosed

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.456
that for so many days
we were not using any fossil fuels

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.336
in order to generate all our electricity.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.720
The news went viral around the world.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.736
Also, and this makes me extremely proud,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.600
a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:13.280
played a decisive role in the negotiations
of the Paris climate agreement.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.320
So we have to protect that legacy
and be an example.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.200
So what comes next?

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.520
The people.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.840
How do we get people to own this?

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.856
How do we get people

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.296
to believe that it's possible

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.960
to build a society without fossil fuels?

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.360
A lot of work from
the ground up is needed.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.640
That is why, in 2014,
we created Costa Rica Limpia.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.416
"Limpia" means "clean,"

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.080
because we want to empower
and we want to inspire citizens.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.680
If citizens don't get engaged,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.736
clean transportation decisions
will be bogged down by endless,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.736
and I mean endless, technical discussions,

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.040
and by avalanches of lobbying
by various established interests.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.576
Wanting to be a green country
powered by renewables

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.176
is already part of our story.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.880
We should not let anybody
take that away from us.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.536
Last year, we brought people
from our seven provinces

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.800
to talk about climate change
in terms that matter to them,

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.616
and we also brought this year

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.696
another group of Costa Ricans

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.816
to talk about renewable energy.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.096
And you know what?

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.376
These people disagree on almost everything

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.056
except on renewable energy

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.176
and clean transportation and clean air.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.176
It brings people together.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.056
And the key to real participation

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.296
is to help people not to feel small.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.616
People feel powerless,

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.960
and they are tired of not being heard.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.376
So what we do is concrete things,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.896
and we translate technical issues
into citizen language

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.640
to show that citizens have a role to play
and can play it together.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.696
For the first time, we're tracking
the promises that were made

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.216
on clean transportation,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.856
and politicos know
that they have to deliver it,

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.880
but the tipping point will come
when we form coalitions --

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.816
citizens, companies,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.016
champions of public transportation --

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.816
that will make electric mobility
the new normal,

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.200
especially in a developing country.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.256
By the time the next election comes,

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.696
I believe every candidate
will have to disclose where they stand

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.616
on the abolition of fossil fuels.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.440
Because this question
has to enter our mainstream politics.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.976
And I'm telling you,
this is not a question of climate policy

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.760
or environmental agenda.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.360
It's about the country that we want

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.256
and the cities that we have

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.936
and the cities that we want

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.136
and who makes that choice.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.336
Because at the end of the day,
what we have to show

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.496
is that development with renewable energy

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.280
is good for the people,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.856
for Costa Ricans that are alive today

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.480
and especially for those
who haven't been born.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.616
This is our National Museum today.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.336
It's bright and peaceful,

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.056
and when you stand up in front of it,

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.376
it's really hard to believe
these were military barracks

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.576
at the end of the '40s.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.416
We started a new life
without an army in this place,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.296
and here is where our abolition

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.216
of fossil fuels will be announced one day.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.536
And we will make history again.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.776
Thank you.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.922
(Applause)
