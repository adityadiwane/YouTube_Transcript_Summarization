00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Salaam. Namaskar.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Good morning.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Given my TED profile, you might be expecting

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
that I'm going to speak to you about

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
the latest philanthropic trends --

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
the one that's currently got Wall Street

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
and the World Bank buzzing --

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
how to invest in women,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
how to empower them, how to save them.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Not me.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I am interested in how women

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
are saving us.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
They're saving us by redefining and re-imagining

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
a future that defies and blurs

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
accepted polarities,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
polarities we've taken for granted for a long time,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
like the ones between modernity and tradition,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
First World and Third World,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
oppression and opportunity.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
In the midst of the daunting challenges

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
we face as a global community,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
there's something about

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
this third way raga

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
that is making my heart sing.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
What intrigues me most

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
is how women are doing this,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
despite a set of paradoxes

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
that are both frustrating and fascinating.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Why is it that women are, on the one hand,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
viciously oppressed by cultural practices,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and yet at the same time,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
are the preservers of cultures in most societies?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Is the hijab or the headscarf

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
a symbol of submission

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
or resistance?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
When so many women and girls

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
are beaten, raped, maimed

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
on a daily basis

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
in the name of all kinds of causes --

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
honor, religion, nationality --

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
what allows women to replant trees,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
to rebuild societies,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
to lead radical, non-violent movements

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
for social change?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Is it different women

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing?

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Or are they one and the same?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Are we guilty, as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
at the TED conference in Oxford,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
of assuming that there is a single story

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
of women's struggles for their rights

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
while there are, in fact, many?

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And what, if anything,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
do men have to do with it?

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Much of my life has been a quest

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
to get some answers to these questions.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
It's taken me across the globe

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and introduced me to some amazing people.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
In the process, I've gathered a few fragments

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
that help me shed some light on this puzzle.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Among those who've helped open my eyes

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
to a third way

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
are: a devout Muslim in Afghanistan,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and a taboo breaker in Liberia.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
I'm indebted to them,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
as I am to my parents,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
were blessed with three daughters in this one.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And for reasons equally unclear to me,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
I was born and raised here in India,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
and I learned from an early age

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
who would bend down, pat us on the head

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and then say to my parents

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
with no problem at all,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
"Poor things. You only have three daughters.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
But you're young, you could still try again."

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
My sense of outrage

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
about women's rights

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
was brought to a boil when I was about 11.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
My aunt, an incredibly articulate

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and brilliant woman,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
was widowed early.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
A flock of relatives descended on her.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
They took off her colorful sari.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
They made her wear a white one.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
They wiped her bindi off her forehead.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
They broke her bangles.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Her daughter, Rani,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
a few years older than me,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
sat in her lap bewildered,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
not knowing what had happened

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
to the confident woman

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
she once knew as her mother.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Late that night, I heard my mother

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
begging my father,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
"Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene?"

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And my father, in a low voice, muttering,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
"I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
This is tradition."

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
That's the night I learned the rules

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
about what it means to be female in this world.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Women don't make those rules,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
but they define us, and they define

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
our opportunities and our chances.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And men are affected by those rules too.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
My father, who had fought in three wars,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
could not save his own sister

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
from this suffering.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
By 18,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
under the excellent tutelage of my mother,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
I was therefore, as you might expect,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
defiantly feminist.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
On the streets chanting,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
"[Hindi]

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
[Hindi]

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
We are the women of India.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
We are not flowers, we are sparks of change."

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
By the time I got to Beijing in 1995,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
it was clear to me, the only way

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
to achieve gender equality

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
was to overturn centuries

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
of oppressive tradition.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Soon after I returned from Beijing,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
founded by women,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
to support women's rights organizations around the globe.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
But barely six months into my new job,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
I met a woman

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
who forced me to challenge all my assumptions.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Her name is Sakena Yacoobi.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
She walked into my office

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
at a time when no one knew

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
where Afghanistan was in the United States.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
She said to me, "It is not about the burka."

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
She was the most determined advocate

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
for women's rights I had ever heard.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
She told me women were running underground schools

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
in her communities inside Afghanistan,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and that her organization, the Afghan Institute of Learning,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
had started a school in Pakistan.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
She said, "The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
is that the Koran requires

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
and strongly supports literacy.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
The prophet wanted every believer

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
to be able to read the Koran for themselves."

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Had I heard right?

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Was a women's rights advocate

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
invoking religion?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
But Sakena defies labels.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
She always wears a headscarf,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
but I've walked alongside with her on a beach

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
with her long hair flying in the breeze.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
She starts every lecture with a prayer,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
but she's a single, feisty,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
financially independent woman

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
She is also immensely pragmatic.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
"This headscarf and these clothes," she says,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
"give me the freedom to do what I need to do

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
to speak to those whose support and assistance

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
are critical for this work.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
When I had to open the school in the refugee camp,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
I went to see the imam.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
I told him, 'I'm a believer, and women and children

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
in these terrible conditions

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
need their faith to survive.'"

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
She smiles slyly.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
"He was flattered.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
He began to come twice a week to my center

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
because women could not go to the mosque.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And after he would leave,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
women and girls would stay behind.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
We began with a small literacy class

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
to read the Koran,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
then a math class, then an English class, then computer classes.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
In a few weeks, everyone in the refugee camp

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
was in our classes."

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
Sakena is a teacher

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
at a time when to educate women

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
is a dangerous business in Afghanistan.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
She is on the Taliban's hit list.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
I worry about her every time she travels across that country.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
She shrugs when I ask her about safety.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
"Kavita jaan, we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Look at those young girls who go back to school

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
when acid is thrown in their face."

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
And I smile, and I nod,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
realizing I'm watching women and girls

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
using their own religious traditions and practices,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
turning them into instruments

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
of opposition and opportunity.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
Their path is their own

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
and it looks towards an Afghanistan

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
that will be different.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
Being different is something the women

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
of Lesbor in Zagreb, Croatia

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
know all too well.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
To be a lesbian, a dyke,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
a homosexual

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
in most parts of the world, including right here

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
in our country, India,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
is to occupy a place of immense discomfort

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
and extreme prejudice.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
In post-conflict societies like Croatia,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
have created an environment unbearable

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
for anyone who might

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
be considered a social outcast.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
So enter a group of out dykes,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
young women who love the old music

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
that once spread across that region

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
from Macedonia to Bosnia,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
from Serbia to Slovenia.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
These folk singers met at college at a gender studies program.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Many are in their 20s, some are mothers.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Many have struggled to come out to their communities,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
that their daughters are not sick,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
just queer.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
As Leah, one of the founders of the group, says,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
"I like traditional music very much.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
I also like rock and roll.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
So Lesbor, we blend the two.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
in which people can really speak their voice,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
especially traditional songs

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
After the war, lots of these songs were lost,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
but they are a part of our childhood and our history,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
and we should not forget them."

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Improbably, this LGBT singing choir

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
has demonstrated how women

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
are investing in tradition to create change,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
like alchemists turning discord into harmony.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
Their repertoire includes

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
the Croatian national anthem,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
a Bosnian love song

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
and Serbian duets.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
And, Leah adds with a grin,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
"Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
because it shows we are open to religious practices

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
even though Catholic Church

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
hates us LGBT."

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
Their concerts draw from

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
their own communities, yes,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
but also from an older generation:

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
a generation that might be

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
suspicious of homosexuality,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
One father, who had initially balked at his daughter

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
coming out in such a choir,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
now writes songs for them.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
In the Middle Ages, troubadours

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
would travel across the land

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
singing their tales and sharing their verses:

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
singing, connecting people divided

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
by religion, nationality and language.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Bosnians, Croats and Serbs

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
find a rare shared space of pride in their history,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
and Lesbor reminds them that

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
the songs one group often claims as theirs alone

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
really belong to them all.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:10.260
(Singing)

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Yesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
that music can create a world

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
more accepting of difference

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
than the one we have been given.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
The world Leymah Gbowee was given

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
was a world at war.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Leymah was not an activist, she was a mother of three.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
But she was sick with worry:

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
She worried her son would be abducted

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and taken off to be a child soldier,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
she worried her daughters would be raped,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
she worried for their lives.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
One night, she had a dream.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
She dreamt she and thousands of other women

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
ended the bloodshed.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
The next morning at church, she asked others how they felt.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
They were all tired of the fighting.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
We need peace, and we need our leaders to know

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
we will not rest until there is peace.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
Among Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
She promised to raise the issue with her community.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
At the next Friday sermon,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
began to share their distress at the state of affairs.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
"What does it matter?" they said, "A bullet doesn't distinguish

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
between a Muslim and a Christian."

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
This small group of women,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
determined to bring an end to the war,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
and they chose to use their traditions to make a point:

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Liberian women usually wear

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
lots of jewelry and colorful clothing.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
But no, for the protest, they dressed

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
all in white, no makeup.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
As Leymah said, "We wore the white

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
saying we were out for peace."

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
They stood on the side of the road on which

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
They stood for weeks --

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
first just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women --

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
wearing white, singing, dancing,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
saying they were out for peace.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Eventually, opposing forces in Liberia

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
The peace talks dragged on and on and on.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
Leymah and her sisters had had enough.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
With their remaining funds, they took

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
and they surrounded the building.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
In a now famous CNN clip,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
you can see them sitting on the ground, their arms linked.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
We know this in India. It's called a [Hindi].

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
Then things get tense.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
The police are called in to physically remove the women.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
As the senior officer approaches with a baton,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Leymah stands up with deliberation,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
reaches her arms up over her head,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
and begins, very slowly,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
to untie her headdress that covers her hair.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
You can see the policeman's face.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
He looks embarrassed. He backs away.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
And the next thing you know,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
the police have disappeared.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Leymah said to me later,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
"It's a taboo, you know, in West Africa.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
If an older woman undresses in front of a man

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
because she wants to,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
the man's family is cursed."

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
(Laughter)

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
(Applause)

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
She said, "I don't know if he did it because he believed,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
but he knew we were not going to leave.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed."

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
And the peace accord was signed.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And the women of Liberia

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
a woman who broke a few taboos herself

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
becoming the first elected woman head of state

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
in Africa in years.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
When she made her presidential address,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
who allowed her to win against a football star --

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
that's soccer for you Americans --

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
no less.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Women like Sakena and Leah

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
and Leymah

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
have humbled me and changed me

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
and made me realize that I should not be so quick

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
to jump to assumptions of any kind.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
They've also saved me from my righteous anger

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
by offering insights into this third way.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
A Filipina activist once said to me,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
"How do you cook a rice cake?

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
With heat from the bottom and heat from the top."

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
The protests, the marches,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
the uncompromising position that

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
women's rights are human rights, full stop.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
That's the heat from the bottom.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
That's Malcolm X and the suffragists

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
and gay pride parades.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
But we also need the heat from the top.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
And in most parts of the world,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
that top is still

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
controlled by men.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
So to paraphrase Marx: Women make change,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
but not in circumstances of their own choosing.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
They have to negotiate.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
in order to give voice to new aspirations.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
And they need allies from their communities.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
Allies like the imam,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
allies like the father who now writes songs

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
for a lesbian group in Croatia,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
allies like my father,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
pursue their dreams.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
Maybe this is because feminism,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
unlike almost every other social movement,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor --

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
it's not the ruling class

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
or the occupiers or the colonizers --

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
that we women, far too often,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
hold ourselves.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
that the personal is in fact the political.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
So that, as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
the same is true of gender equality:

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
that it starts in small places, close to home.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
On the streets, yes,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
but also in negotiations at the kitchen table

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
and in the marital bed

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
and in relationships between lovers and parents

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
and sisters and friends.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
And then

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
you realize that by integrating

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
aspects of tradition and community

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
into their struggles,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah --

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
and Michelle Bachelet in Chile

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
and Shirin Ebadi in Iran --

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
are doing something else.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
They're challenging the very notion

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
of Western models of development.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
They are saying, we don't have to be like you

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
to make change.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260
We can wear a sari or a hijab

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
or pants or a boubou,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
and we can be party leaders and presidents

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
and human rights lawyers.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
We can use our tradition to navigate change.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
We can demilitarize societies

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
and pour resources, instead,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
into reservoirs of genuine security.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
It is in these little stories,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
these individual stories,

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
that I see a radical epic being written

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
by women around the world.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
It is in these threads

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
that are being woven into a resilient fabric

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
that will sustain communities,

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
that I find hope.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
And if my heart is singing,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.260
it's because in these little fragments,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
every now and again, you catch a glimpse

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
of a whole, of a whole new world.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.260
And she is definitely on her way.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
Thank you.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:31.260
(Applause)
