00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.895
Let me tell you a story.

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:21.999
It's my first year as a new high school science teacher,

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.319
and I'm so eager.

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.519
I'm so excited, I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.671
But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:37.703
that my students just might not be learning anything.

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:40.407
This happens one day:

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:43.621
I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:47.079
about my favorite subject in all of biology:

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.551
viruses and how they attack.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.937
And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them,

00:00:52.937 --> 00:00:56.401
and I come in and I say, "Can somebody please explain

00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.410
the main ideas and why this is so cool?"

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.041
There's silence.

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:07.314
Finally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye,

00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:10.857
and she says, "The reading sucked."

00:01:10.857 --> 00:01:14.385
And then she clarified. She said, "You know what,

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:18.314
I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it.

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:22.689
It's boring. Um, who cares, and it sucks."

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.733
These sympathetic smiles

00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.138
spread all throughout the room now,

00:01:29.138 --> 00:01:33.777
and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat,

00:01:33.777 --> 00:01:37.689
that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook,

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.092
but not one of them really understood the main ideas.

00:01:43.092 --> 00:01:45.825
Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool,

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:48.183
why it's so important.

00:01:48.183 --> 00:01:51.145
I'm totally clueless.

00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:54.409
I have no idea what to do next.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.873
So the only thing I can think of is say,

00:01:56.873 --> 00:02:01.065
"Listen. Let me tell you a story.

00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:07.273
The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses.

00:02:07.273 --> 00:02:10.441
These guys are blown up a couple million times.

00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:13.498
The real bacteria and viruses are so small

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:16.330
we can't see them without a microscope,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.034
and you guys might know bacteria and viruses

00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:20.625
because they both make us sick.

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:24.145
But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:27.025
can also make bacteria sick."

00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:29.177
Now, the story that I start telling my kids,

00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:33.801
it starts out like a horror story.

00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:37.164
Once upon a time there's this happy little bacterium.

00:02:37.164 --> 00:02:39.449
Don't get too attached to him.

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:43.585
Maybe he's floating around in your stomach

00:02:43.585 --> 00:02:45.393
or in some spoiled food somewhere,

00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:49.473
and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good.

00:02:49.473 --> 00:02:51.530
Maybe he ate something bad for lunch,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.377
and then things get really horrible,

00:02:54.377 --> 00:02:57.249
as his skin rips apart, and he sees a virus

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.385
coming out from his insides.

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:02.569
And then it gets horrible

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.593
when he bursts open and an army of viruses

00:03:05.593 --> 00:03:08.674
floods out from his insides.

00:03:08.674 --> 00:03:11.857
If -- Ouch is right! --

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:15.074
If you see this, and you're a bacterium,

00:03:15.074 --> 00:03:18.289
this is like your worst nightmare.

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:20.906
But if you're a virus and you see this,

00:03:20.906 --> 00:03:23.297
you cross those little legs of yours and you think,

00:03:23.297 --> 00:03:25.857
"We rock."

00:03:25.857 --> 00:03:30.641
Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium.

00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:32.954
Here's what had to happen.

00:03:32.954 --> 00:03:36.073
A virus grabbed onto a bacterium

00:03:36.073 --> 00:03:39.770
and it slipped its DNA into it.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.801
The next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff

00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:46.945
that chopped up the bacteria DNA.

00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:49.833
And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA,

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:54.040
the virus DNA takes control of the cell

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.033
and it tells it to start making more viruses.

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:01.745
Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint

00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:04.969
that tells living things what to make.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.201
So this is kind of like going into a car factory

00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:14.257
and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots.

00:04:14.257 --> 00:04:17.233
The workers still come the next day, they do their job,

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:20.458
but they're following different instructions.

00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:23.753
So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA

00:04:23.753 --> 00:04:29.281
turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses --

00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:33.185
that is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts.

00:04:33.185 --> 00:04:38.085
But that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria.

00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:44.251
Some are much more crafty.

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:48.097
When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium,

00:04:48.097 --> 00:04:51.097
they do a little espionage.

00:04:51.097 --> 00:04:58.369
Here, this cloaked, secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell,

00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:04.102
but here's the kicker: It doesn't do anything harmful -- not at first.

00:05:04.102 --> 00:05:09.502
Instead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA,

00:05:09.502 --> 00:05:14.134
and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell,

00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:17.159
waiting for instructions.

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:23.030
And what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.454
the babies also have the virus DNA in them.

00:05:28.454 --> 00:05:32.221
So now we have a whole extended bacteria family,

00:05:32.221 --> 00:05:36.366
filled with virus sleeper cells.

00:05:36.366 --> 00:05:41.005
They're just happily living together until a signal happens

00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:45.037
and -- BAM! -- all of the DNA pops out.

00:05:45.037 --> 00:05:49.109
It takes control of these cells, turns them into virus-making factories,

00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:51.085
and they all burst,

00:05:51.085 --> 00:05:53.461
a huge, extended bacteria family,

00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:56.844
all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts,

00:05:56.844 --> 00:06:01.834
the viruses taking over the bacterium.

00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:05.813
So now you understand how viruses can attack cells.

00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:10.181
There are two ways: On the left is what we call the lytic way,

00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:14.451
where the viruses go right in and take over the cells.

00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:17.213
On the [right] is the lysogenic way

00:06:17.213 --> 00:06:20.550
that uses secret agent viruses.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.317
So this stuff is not that hard, right?

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:25.333
And now all of you understand it.

00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:27.101
But if you've graduated from high school,

00:06:27.101 --> 00:06:30.509
I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before.

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.293
But I bet it was presented in a way

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:37.379
that it didn't exactly stick in your mind.

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:40.069
So when my students were first learning this,

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:42.989
why did they hate it so much?

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:44.976
Well, there were a couple of reasons.

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:48.321
First of all, I can guarantee you that their textbooks

00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:53.563
didn't have secret agent viruses, and they didn't have horror stories.

00:06:53.563 --> 00:06:56.400
You know, in the communication of science

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.654
there is this obsession with seriousness.

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:02.544
It kills me. I'm not kidding.

00:07:02.544 --> 00:07:04.856
I used to work for an educational publisher,

00:07:04.856 --> 00:07:08.601
and as a writer, I was always told never to use stories

00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:10.440
or fun, engaging language,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.680
because then my work might not be viewed

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.968
as "serious" and "scientific."

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:18.744
Right? I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun

00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:20.936
when they're learning science.

00:07:20.936 --> 00:07:25.639
So we have this field of science that's all about slime,

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.667
and color changes. Check this out.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.912
And then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have,

00:07:43.912 --> 00:07:47.354
explosions!

00:07:47.354 --> 00:07:51.504
But if a textbook seems too much fun,

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:55.256
it's somehow unscientific.

00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:59.112
Now another problem was that

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:04.752
the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible.

00:08:04.752 --> 00:08:07.441
If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier,

00:08:07.441 --> 00:08:08.760
we could start by saying something like,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.138
"These viruses make copies of themselves

00:08:11.138 --> 00:08:13.880
by slipping their DNA into a bacterium."

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.321
The way this showed up in the textbook, it looked like this:

00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:20.616
"Bacteriophage replication is initiated

00:08:20.616 --> 00:08:23.683
through the introduction of viral nucleic acid

00:08:23.683 --> 00:08:26.225
into a bacterium."

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:30.920
That's great, perfect for 13-year-olds.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.560
But here's the thing. There are plenty of people

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.767
in science education who would look at this and say there's no way

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:39.712
that we could ever give that to students,

00:08:39.712 --> 00:08:44.632
because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate.

00:08:44.632 --> 00:08:47.088
For example, I told you that viruses have DNA.

00:08:47.088 --> 00:08:50.217
Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't.

00:08:50.217 --> 00:08:52.632
They have something called RNA instead.

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:54.984
So a professional science writer would circle that

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:56.130
and say, "That has to go.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.280
We have to change it to something much more technical."

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.846
And after a team of professional science editors

00:09:00.846 --> 00:09:04.512
went over this really simple explanation,

00:09:04.512 --> 00:09:09.456
they'd find fault with almost every word I've used,

00:09:09.456 --> 00:09:11.824
and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough,

00:09:11.824 --> 00:09:13.592
and they'd have to change everything

00:09:13.592 --> 00:09:17.368
that wasn't 100 percent perfect.

00:09:17.368 --> 00:09:19.184
Then it would be accurate,

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:24.320
but it would be completely impossible to understand.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.512
This is horrifying.

00:09:26.512 --> 00:09:28.504
You know, I keep talking about this idea

00:09:28.504 --> 00:09:31.048
of telling a story,

00:09:31.048 --> 00:09:36.175
and it's like science communication has taken on this idea

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:39.152
of what I call the tyranny of precision,

00:09:39.152 --> 00:09:41.072
where you can't just tell a story.

00:09:41.072 --> 00:09:46.020
It's like science has become that horrible storyteller

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.440
that we all know, who gives us all the details nobody cares about,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.384
where you're like, "Oh, I met my friend for lunch the other day,

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:55.320
and she was wearing these ugly jeans.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.944
I mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings,

00:09:57.944 --> 00:10:00.464
but, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings,

00:10:00.464 --> 00:10:03.248
like, but I think — " and you're just like, "Oh my God.

00:10:03.248 --> 00:10:05.842
What is the point?"

00:10:05.842 --> 00:10:09.878
Or even worse, science education is becoming

00:10:09.878 --> 00:10:13.384
like that guy who always says, "Actually."

00:10:13.384 --> 00:10:16.464
Right? You want to be like, "Oh, dude,

00:10:16.464 --> 00:10:17.864
we had to get up in the middle of the night

00:10:17.864 --> 00:10:21.480
and drive a hundred miles in total darkness."

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.068
And that guy's like, "Actually, it was 87.3 miles."

00:10:26.068 --> 00:10:28.456
And you're like, "Actually, shut up!

00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:32.687
I'm just trying to tell a story."

00:10:32.687 --> 00:10:38.984
Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection.

00:10:38.984 --> 00:10:41.384
We have to convince our audience

00:10:41.384 --> 00:10:44.504
that what we're talking about matters.

00:10:44.504 --> 00:10:47.168
But just as important is knowing

00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:49.656
which details we should leave out

00:10:49.656 --> 00:10:53.176
so that the main point still comes across.

00:10:53.176 --> 00:10:56.408
I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said,

00:10:56.408 --> 00:10:59.392
and I paraphrase, when he said that sometimes

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:03.301
you have to lie in order to tell the truth.

00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:05.944
I think this sentiment is particularly relevant

00:11:05.944 --> 00:11:09.318
to science education.

00:11:09.318 --> 00:11:12.040
Now, finally,

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.416
I am often so disappointed

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:19.272
when people think that I'm advocating

00:11:19.272 --> 00:11:21.912
a dumbing down of science.

00:11:21.912 --> 00:11:23.688
That's not true at all.

00:11:23.688 --> 00:11:26.669
I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT,

00:11:26.669 --> 00:11:31.658
and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed,

00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:36.297
specific scientific communication between experts,

00:11:36.297 --> 00:11:40.392
but not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds.

00:11:40.392 --> 00:11:45.688
If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA,

00:11:45.688 --> 00:11:50.808
that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science.

00:11:50.808 --> 00:11:55.171
But if a young learner can't understand anything in science

00:11:55.171 --> 00:11:59.264
and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this,

00:11:59.264 --> 00:12:02.816
that will ruin their chances of success.

00:12:02.816 --> 00:12:05.853
This needs to stop,

00:12:05.853 --> 00:12:09.163
and I wish that the change could come from the institutions

00:12:09.163 --> 00:12:11.931
at the top that are perpetuating these problems,

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:15.897
and I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it.

00:12:15.897 --> 00:12:18.416
But I think that's unlikely.

00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:21.960
So we are so lucky that we have resources

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.080
like the Internet, where we can circumvent these institutions

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.234
from the bottom up.

00:12:28.234 --> 00:12:31.552
There's a growing number of online resources

00:12:31.552 --> 00:12:34.680
that are dedicated to just explaining science

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.976
in simple, understandable ways.

00:12:37.976 --> 00:12:41.032
I dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain

00:12:41.032 --> 00:12:43.784
any scientific concept you can think of

00:12:43.784 --> 00:12:48.464
in simple language any middle schooler can understand.

00:12:48.464 --> 00:12:51.736
And I myself spend most of my free time

00:12:51.736 --> 00:12:55.897
making these science videos that I put on YouTube.

00:12:55.897 --> 00:12:58.864
I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies

00:12:58.864 --> 00:13:01.352
to awkward middle school dances,

00:13:01.352 --> 00:13:03.736
and I talk about fuel cells with stories

00:13:03.736 --> 00:13:07.112
about boys and girls at a summer camp.

00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:10.872
The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled

00:13:10.872 --> 00:13:13.088
and it's often written in LOLcats,

00:13:13.088 --> 00:13:15.584
but nonetheless

00:13:15.584 --> 00:13:20.023
it's so appreciative, so thankful

00:13:20.023 --> 00:13:23.577
that I know this is the right way

00:13:23.577 --> 00:13:27.144
we should be communicating science.

00:13:27.144 --> 00:13:30.080
There's still so much work left to be done, though,

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.288
and if you're involved with science in any way

00:13:33.288 --> 00:13:36.152
I urge you to join me.

00:13:36.152 --> 00:13:41.208
Pick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever,

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:45.368
but leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon.

00:13:45.368 --> 00:13:48.984
Make me laugh. Make me care.

00:13:48.984 --> 00:13:52.136
Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about

00:13:52.136 --> 00:13:56.032
and just get to the point.

00:13:56.032 --> 00:13:58.174
How should you start?

00:13:58.174 --> 00:14:02.448
Why don't you say, "Listen, let me tell you a story"?

00:14:02.448 --> 00:14:04.498
Thank you.

00:14:04.498 --> 00:14:05.379
(Applause)
