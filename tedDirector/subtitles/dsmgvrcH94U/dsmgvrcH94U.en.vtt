00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
because until a couple of years ago,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
people knew hardly anything about us,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and I could basically come out here

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and say only good things about us.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
But in the last couple of years

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
we've become infamous for a couple of things.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
First, of course, the economic meltdown.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
It actually got so bad

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
(Laughter)

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
and no reserve.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Then there was the volcano

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
that interrupted the travel plans

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
of almost all of you and many of your friends,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
including President Obama.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
By the way, the pronunciation

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
is "Eyjafjallajokull."

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
None of your media got it right.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
(Laughter)

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
But I'm not here to share these stories

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
about these two things exactly.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
which is a financial firm founded by me

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and Kristin -- who you see in the picture --

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
in the spring of 2007,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
just over a year before the economic collapse hit.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Why would two women

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
in the corporate sector

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
leave to found a financial services firm?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Well let it suffice to say

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
that we felt a bit overwhelmed

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
with testosterone.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And I'm not here to say

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
that men are to blame for the crisis

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and what happened in my country.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
But I can surely tell you that in my country,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
men were at the helm

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
of the game of the financial sector,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and that kind of lack of diversity

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and sameness

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
leads to disastrous problems.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
(Applause)

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
So we decided, a bit fed-up with this world

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and also with the strong feeling in our stomach

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
that this wasn't sustainable,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
to found a financial services firm

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
based on our values,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and we decided to incorporate feminine values

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
into the world of finance.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
We weren't known

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
as the typical "women" women

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
in Iceland up until then.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
So it was almost like coming out of the closet

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
to actually talk about the fact that we were women

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and that we believed that we had a set of values

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and a way of doing business

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
that would be more sustainable

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
than what we had experienced until then.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And we got a great group of people to join us --

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
principled people with great skills,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and investors with a vision

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and values to match ours.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
without taking any direct losses to our equity

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
or to the funds of our clients.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And although I want to thank

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
the talented people of our company

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
foremost for that --

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and also there's a factor of luck and timing --

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
we are absolutely convinced

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
that we did this because of our values.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
So let me share with you our values.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
We believe in risk awareness.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
What does that mean?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and we will not invest

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
in things we don't understand.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Not a complicated thing.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
But in 2007,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
at the height of the sub-prime

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and all the complicated financial structures,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
it was quite opposite

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
to the reckless risk-taking behaviors

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
that we saw on the market.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
We also believe in straight-talking,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
telling it as it is,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
using simple language that people understand,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
telling people about the downsides

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
as well as the potential upsides,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
like our lack of belief in the sustainability

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
of the Icelandic financial sector

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
that already we had

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
months before the collapse hit us.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
And, although we do work in the financial sector,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
where Excel is king,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
we believe in emotional capital.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And we believe

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
that doing emotional due diligence

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
is just as important

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
as doing financial due diligence.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
It is actually people

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
that make money and lose money,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
not Excel spreadsheets.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
(Applause)

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Last, but not least,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
we believe in profit with principles.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
We care how we make our profit.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
we are willing to do it with a long-term view,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and we like to have a wider definition of profits

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
than just the economic profit in the next quarter.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
So we like to see profits,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
plus positive social

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and environmental benefits, when we invest.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
But it wasn't just about the values,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
although we are convinced that they matter.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
It was also about a business opportunity.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
that are going to create

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
some of the most interesting investment opportunities

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
in the years to come.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
The whole thing about the female trend

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
is not about women being better than men;

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
it is actually about

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
women being different from men,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
bringing different values and different ways to the table.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
So what do you get? You get better decision-making,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and you get less herd behavior,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and both of those things hit your bottom line

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
with very positive results.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
But one has to wonder,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland --

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and many would say that you in America

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
are heading for some more trouble as well.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Now that we've had all that happen,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and we have all this data out there

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
telling us that it's much better to have diversity

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
around the decision-making tables,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
will we see business and finance change?

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Will government change?

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Well I'll give you my straight talk about this.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
I have days that I believe,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
but I have days that I'm full of doubt.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Have you seen the incredible urge out there

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
to rebuild the very things that failed us?

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
(Applause)

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Einstein said

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
that this was the definition of insanity --

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
to do the same things

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
over and over again,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
hoping for a different outcome.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
So I guess the world is insane,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
because I see entirely too much

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
of doing the same things over and over again,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
I want to see more revolutionary thinking,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and I remain hopeful.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
Like TED, I believe in people.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
And I know that consumers

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
are becoming more conscious,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
and they are going to start voting with their wallets,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and they are going to change the face

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
of business and finance from the outside,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
if they don't do it from the inside.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
But I'm more of the revolutionary,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
and I should be; I'm from Iceland.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
We have a long history

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
of strong, courageous, independent women,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
ever since the Viking age.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And I want to tell you when

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
I first realized that women matter to the economy

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and to the society,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
I was seven -- it happened to be my mother's birthday --

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
October 24, 1975.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Women in Iceland took the day off.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
From work or from home, they took the day off,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and nothing worked in Iceland.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
(Laughter)

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
They marched into the center of Reykjavik,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and they put women's issues onto the agenda.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And some say this was the start of a global movement.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
For me it was the start of a long journey,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
but I decided that day to matter.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Five years later,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president --

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
first female to become head of state,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
single mom,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
a breast cancer survivor

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
who had had one of her breasts removed.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
And at one of the campaign sessions,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
she had one of her male contenders

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
allude to the fact that she couldn't become president --

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
she was a woman, and even half a woman.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
That night she won the election,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
because she came back --

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
not just because of his crappy behavior --

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
but she came back and said,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
"Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation;

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
I'm going to lead it."

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.260
(Applause)

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
So I've had incredibly many

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
women role models

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
that have influenced who I am and where I am today.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
But in spite of that,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
mostly in denial of being a woman.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
Started in corporate America,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and I was absolutely convinced

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
that it was just about the individual,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
that women and men would have just the same opportunities.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
But I've come to conclude lately

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
that it isn't like that.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
We are not the same,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
and it's great. Because of our differences,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
we create and sustain life.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
The final thought I want to leave with you

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
is that I'm fed up with this tyranny

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
of either/or choices in life --

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
either it's men or it's women.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
So let's move away

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
from thinking about business here and philanthropy there,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and let's start thinking about

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
doing good business.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Thank you.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
(Applause)
