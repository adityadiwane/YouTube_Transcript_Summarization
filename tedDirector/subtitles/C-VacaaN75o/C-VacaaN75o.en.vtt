00:00:14.057 --> 00:00:18.486
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do."

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.486
I don't have children.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.820
I borrow my friends' children, so --

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:26.058
(Laughter)

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:28.486
take all this advice with a grain of salt.

00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:31.679
I'm Gever Tulley.

00:00:31.703 --> 00:00:36.263
I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade,

00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:40.184
but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School.

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:43.833
It's a summer program
which aims to help kids

00:00:43.857 --> 00:00:46.435
learn how to build the things
that they think of.

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:48.348
So we build a lot of things,

00:00:48.372 --> 00:00:52.492
and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders.

00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:55.570
So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School,

00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:58.978
they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody.

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:00.276
(Laughter)

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:02.867
You know, we live in a world

00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:06.826
that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.917
There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy

00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:14.874
child safety regulations can get.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.486
We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.144
manufactured in the United States,

00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:23.747
or for sale with an item
in the United States.

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:26.478
We put warnings on coffee cups

00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:29.229
to tell us that the contents may be hot.

00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:36.120
And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:38.200
for children under the age of 10.

00:01:38.224 --> 00:01:41.419
So where does this trend stop?

00:01:41.443 --> 00:01:46.237
When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object,

00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:49.154
every pokey bit in the world,

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:54.249
then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp,

00:01:54.273 --> 00:01:57.562
or not made out of round plastic,

00:01:57.586 --> 00:01:59.486
they'll hurt themselves with it.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.814
So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone

00:02:05.838 --> 00:02:07.402
grow ever smaller,

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:11.371
we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities

00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:13.987
to learn how to interact
with the world around them.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.741
And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions,

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:20.463
kids are always going to figure out

00:02:20.487 --> 00:02:22.542
how to do the most dangerous
thing they can,

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:24.510
in whatever environment they can.

00:02:24.534 --> 00:02:25.926
(Laughter)

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.298
So despite the provocative title,

00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:32.075
this presentation is really about safety,

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.828
and about some simple things
that we can do

00:02:36.852 --> 00:02:41.408
to raise our kids to be creative,

00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:45.123
confident and in control
of the environment around them.

00:02:45.517 --> 00:02:47.646
And what I now present to you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.916
is an excerpt from a book in progress.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.243
The book is called "50 Dangerous Things."

00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:55.486
This is "Five Dangerous Things."

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.073
Thing number one: Play with fire.

00:02:58.668 --> 00:03:03.638
Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature

00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:07.787
is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history.

00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:09.762
Whether we remember it or not,

00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:13.238
it's the first time we really get control

00:03:13.262 --> 00:03:15.486
of one of these mysterious things.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.751
These mysteries are only revealed

00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:20.156
to those who get the opportunity
to play with it.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.135
So, playing with fire.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.485
This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.653
From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire,

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:35.486
about intake, combustion, exhaust.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.606
These are the three working
elements of fire

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.486
that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire.

00:03:40.827 --> 00:03:45.731
And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory.

00:03:45.755 --> 00:03:48.770
You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it.

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:53.217
Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me,

00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:55.043
they're going to learn things

00:03:55.067 --> 00:04:00.079
that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys.

00:04:00.103 --> 00:04:01.801
(Laughter)

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.087
Number two: Own a pocketknife.

00:04:04.881 --> 00:04:09.097
Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness,

00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:11.416
which I think is a terrible thing.

00:04:11.908 --> 00:04:15.371
(Laughter)

00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:19.267
Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:20.486
that you're given.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.486
You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.486
it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.098
And it's a powerful and empowering tool.

00:04:31.122 --> 00:04:33.926
And in a lot of cultures
they give knives --

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.481
like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives.

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:40.079
These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber.

00:04:40.103 --> 00:04:44.071
I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10,

00:04:44.095 --> 00:04:46.333
and it left a lasting impression,

00:04:46.357 --> 00:04:48.486
to see babies playing with knives.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.486
And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.640
through a tool at a very young age.

00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:57.486
You lay down a couple
of very simple rules --

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.072
always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it --

00:05:02.096 --> 00:05:05.062
and these are things kids
can understand and practice with.

00:05:05.086 --> 00:05:07.100
And yeah, they're going to cut themselves.

00:05:07.124 --> 00:05:10.235
I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself.

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.723
But you know, they're young.
They heal fast.

00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:16.056
(Laughter)

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.331
Number three: Throw a spear.

00:05:18.954 --> 00:05:22.979
It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things,

00:05:23.003 --> 00:05:28.691
and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain,

00:05:28.715 --> 00:05:30.510
they tend to atrophy over time.

00:05:31.105 --> 00:05:34.310
But when you exercise them,

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.891
any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system,

00:05:36.915 --> 00:05:38.778
and that applies to your brain, too.

00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:44.396
So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.383
the frontal and parietal lobes,

00:05:46.407 --> 00:05:51.762
which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding,

00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:55.333
and structural problem solving,

00:05:55.357 --> 00:06:00.381
so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:06.486
And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill,

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.288
so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training.

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:18.425
These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.071
attention and concentration skills,

00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:22.734
so those are great.

00:06:22.758 --> 00:06:26.818
Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances.

00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:31.486
There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.414
Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance,

00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:36.595
don't throw it out.

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:38.033
Take it apart with your kid,

00:06:38.057 --> 00:06:41.418
or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them.

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:43.714
Even if you don't know what the parts are,

00:06:43.738 --> 00:06:46.302
puzzling out what they might be for

00:06:46.326 --> 00:06:49.776
is a really good practice for the kids

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.242
to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart,

00:06:55.266 --> 00:06:57.455
and no matter how complex they are,

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.599
they can understand parts of them.

00:06:59.623 --> 00:07:02.698
And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them.

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:06.510
It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable.

00:07:06.953 --> 00:07:10.685
So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:14.486
are actually complex things
made by other people,

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.068
and you can understand them.

00:07:16.647 --> 00:07:20.596
Number five: Two-parter.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.732
Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act.

00:07:22.756 --> 00:07:25.042
(Laughter)

00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:28.852
There are laws beyond safety regulations

00:07:28.876 --> 00:07:31.591
that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things

00:07:31.615 --> 00:07:34.011
that we own -- in this case,
digital media.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.645
It's a very simple exercise:

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:41.074
Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD,

00:07:41.098 --> 00:07:44.947
then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer.

00:07:44.971 --> 00:07:46.780
You've just broken a law.

00:07:46.804 --> 00:07:50.299
Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you.

00:07:50.323 --> 00:07:52.891
It's an important lesson
for kids to understand,

00:07:52.915 --> 00:07:56.391
that some of these laws
get broken by accident,

00:07:56.415 --> 00:07:58.765
and that laws have to be interpreted.

00:07:59.185 --> 00:08:01.535
That's something we often
talk about with the kids

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:05.651
when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open,

00:08:05.675 --> 00:08:08.391
and taking them apart
and using them for other things.

00:08:08.415 --> 00:08:13.090
And also when we go out and drive a car.

00:08:14.265 --> 00:08:18.486
Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child,

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.486
so this is the alternate --

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.185
(Laughter)

00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:26.150
For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law,

00:08:26.174 --> 00:08:29.486
you can drive a car with your child.

00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:33.252
This is a great stage for a kid.

00:08:33.601 --> 00:08:35.153
This happens about the same time

00:08:35.177 --> 00:08:37.506
that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.631
these big things in the outside world,

00:08:39.655 --> 00:08:41.631
that they're trying to get a grip on.

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:46.409
A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it.

00:08:46.433 --> 00:08:50.778
And that really gives them
a handle on a world

00:08:50.802 --> 00:08:55.351
in a way that they don't often
have access to.

00:08:55.375 --> 00:08:57.005
And it's perfectly legal.

00:08:57.029 --> 00:08:59.679
Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it,

00:08:59.703 --> 00:09:03.486
and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.119
It's very safe actually.

00:09:05.143 --> 00:09:07.112
And it's fun for the whole family.

00:09:07.136 --> 00:09:10.756
(Laughter)

00:09:11.494 --> 00:09:14.510
Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.
