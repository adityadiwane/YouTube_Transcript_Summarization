00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
to do things again, not just represent things.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.260
This is a construction helmet that I received two years ago

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
at the groundbreaking of the largest project

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
I, and my firm, have ever been involved in.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I thought it represented the importance of the architect.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
I stayed thrilled until I got home,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
threw the helmet onto my bed,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
fell down onto my bed and realized inside

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
there was an inscription.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
(Laughter)

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Now, I think that this is a great metaphor

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
for the state of architecture and architects today.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
We are for decorative purposes only.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.260
(Laughter)

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Now, who do we have to blame?

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
We can only blame ourselves. Over the last 50 years

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and has gotten much more litigious.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
And we architects are cowards.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
So, as we have faced liability,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
we have stepped back and back,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and unfortunately, where there is liability, guess what there is:

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
power.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
So, eventually we have found ourselves

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
in a totally marginalized position, way over here.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Now, what did we do? We're cowards,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
but we're smart cowards.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
And we announced, "Hey, architecture, it's over here,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
in this autonomous language

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
we're going to seed control of processes."

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
We actually created an artificial schism

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.260
between creation and execution,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and as if you could actually execute

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
without knowing how to create.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Now, something else happened.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And that's when we began to sell the world

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
that architecture was created by individuals

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
creating genius sketches.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.260
And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
for years and years and years is not only something

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
to be derided,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
but we would merely write it off as

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
merely execution.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Now I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.260
that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and nine months of gestation,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and, God forbid, 24 hours of child labor

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
is merely execution.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
So, what do we architects need to do? We need to stitch back

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
creation and execution.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
And we need to start authoring processes again

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
instead of authoring objects.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Now, if we do this, I believe we can go back 50 years

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
and start reinjecting agency,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.260
social engineering, back into architecture.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Now, there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
like managing contracts, learning how to write contracts,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
understanding procurement processes,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
understanding the time value of money and cost estimation.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
But I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
into three very pedantic statements.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
The first is: Take core positions with your client.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
I know it's shocking, right, that architecture would actually say that.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
The second position is: Actually take positions.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Take joint positions with your client.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
This is the moment in which you as the architect

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and your client can begin to inject

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
vision and agency.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
But it has to be done together.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And then only after this is done

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
are you allowed to do this, begin to put forward

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
architectural manifestations

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
that manifest those positions.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And both owner and architect alike

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
are empowered to critique those manifestations

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
based on the positions that you've taken.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Now, I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.260
I'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
You do not know what the end result is.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
But I promise you, with enough brain power

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
and enough passion and enough commitment,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
you will arrive at conclusions

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
that will transcend convention,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and will simply be something

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
that you could not have initially

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
or individually conceived of.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Alright, now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
of simple dumb sketches.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
This is the modus operandi that we have today.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.260
We roll 120-foot Spartan,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.260
i.e. our vision, up to our clients' gates of Troy.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right?

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Well, how about instead of doing that,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
we roll up to the gates something they want.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
because of course we all know that inside

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
of the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
So, we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
the vessel by which

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
you get through the gate,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
get through the constraints of a project.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
At which point, you and your client

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
have the ability to start considering what

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
you're going to put inside that vessel,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
the agency, the vision.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And if you do that, you do that responsibly,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
I believe that instead of delivering Spartans,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
you can deliver maidens.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
If we are so good at our craft

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
shouldn't we be able to conceive

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
of an architectural manifestation

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
that slides seamlessly through

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
the project's and the client's constraints?

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Now, with that in mind, I'm going to show a project

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
that's very dear to many people in this room--

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
well, maybe not dear, but certainly close to many people in this room.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And that's a project that is just about to open next week,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
the new home for the Dallas Theater Center,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
Now, I'm going to present it on the same terms:

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
issue, position and architectural manifestation.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
Now, the first issue that we faced

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
was that the Dallas Theater Center

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
of some place outside of the triumvirate

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
of New York, Chicago and Seattle.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
And this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
But it also had to do with something rather unusual,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.260
and that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
Why was this horrible little building

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
so important to their renown and their innovation?

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.260
When you're on Broadway, you cannot tear the proscenium down.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
This building, when an artistic director

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
wanted to do a "Cherry Orchard" and wanted people

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
they brought a backhoe in, and they simply dug the hole.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Well, that's exciting.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And you can start to get the best artistic directors,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
scenic designers and actors from around the country

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
to come to perform here

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
because you can do things you can't do elsewhere.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
So, the first position we took was,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
"Hey, we as architects had better not show up

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and do a pristine building

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
that doesn't engender the same freedoms that this

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
old dilapidated shed provided the company."

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
The second issue is a nuance of the first.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
And that's that the company and the building was multiform.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
That meant that they were able to perform,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
as long as they had labor

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
they were able to go between proscenium, thrust, flat floor,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
arena, traverse, you name it.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
All they needed was labor.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
Well, something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
around the world.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
It started to become hard to raise operational costs,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
operational budgets.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
So, they stopped having inexpensive labor.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And eventually they had to freeze their organization

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
into something called a bastardized thruscenium.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
So, the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
the ability to move between stage configurations,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
had better be able to be done

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.260
without relying on operational costs. Alright? Affordably.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
The architectural manifestation

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
was frankly just dumb.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
and redefine them as above house and below house.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
At first blush you think, "Hey it's crazy,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
what could you possibly gain?"

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
We created what we like to call superfly.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.260
(Laughter)

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Now, superfly, the concept is

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
and you smear them across flytower and auditorium.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Suddenly the artistic director

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
can move between different stage

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
and audience configurations.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And because that flytower has the ability to pick up

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
all the pristine elements, suddenly the rest of the environment

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
can be provisional. And you can drill, cut, nail, screw

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
paint and replace,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
with a minimum of cost.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
But there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
that was unexpected.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
in a most unusual way.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
And that provided the artistic director suddenly

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
the ability to define suspension of disbelief.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
So, the building affords artistic directors the freedom

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
to conceive of almost any kind of activity

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
underneath this floating object.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
But also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
such that in the last act of Macbeth,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
if he or she wants you to associate

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.260
the parable that you're seeing with Dallas, with your real life,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
he or she can do so.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
Now, in order to do this we and the clients

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
had to do something fairly remarkable.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
In fact it really was the clients who had to do it.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
They had to make a decision, based on the positions we took

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and one-third infrastructure,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
to actually the inverse,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
That's a lot for a client to commit to

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
before you actually see the fruition of the concept.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
But based on the positions,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
they took the educated leap of faith to do so.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
And effectively we created what we like to call

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
a theater machine.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Now, that theater machine has ability

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
to move between a whole series of configurations

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
at the push of a button and a few stagehands

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
in a short amount of time.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
But it also has the potential

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.260
to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
Meaning: The artistic director

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
doesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
is they hate us architects,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
because they say the first thing they have to do,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
the first five minutes of any show,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
is they have to get our architecture

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
out of the mind of their patron.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Well now there are potentials of this building

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
to allow the artistic director

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
to actually move into the building

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
without using our architecture.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
So, in fact, there is the building, there is what we call the draw.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
You're going down into our lobby,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.260
go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits, whether you like them or not,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
But there is also the potential

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
to allow people to move directly from the outside,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.260
in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
into the interior of the auditorium.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
And here is the fruition of that in actuality.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
These are the two large pivoting doors

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
that allow people to move directly from the outside, in

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
or from the inside, out,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
performers or audience alike.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
Now, imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
But imagine the freedoms

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
if you could take this further, that in fact you could consider

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
a Wagnerian entry,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
a first act in thrust,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
an intermission in Greek, a second act in arena,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.260
and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Now that, I would say, is architecture performing.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
It is taking the hand of the architect

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
to actually remove the hand of the architect

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.260
in favor of the hand of the artistic director.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
I'll go through the three basic configurations.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
This is the flat floor configuration.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
You notice that there is no proscenium,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
the balconies have been raised up, there are no seats,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
the floor in the auditorium is flat.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
The first configuration is easy to understand.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
The balconies come down, you see that the orchestra

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
begins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
and the seats come in.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
The third configuration is a little harder to understand.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
in order to bring a thrust into the space.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
And some of the seats need to actually change their direction,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and change their rake, to allow that to happen.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
I'll do it again so you can see it.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.260
There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
And there it is in the thrust configuration.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
In order to do that,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
again, we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
And they told us one important thing:

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
"You shall not beta-test."

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
Meaning, nothing that we do

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
can we be the first ones to do it.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
But they were willing for us to apply technologies

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.260
from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And the solution in terms of the balconies

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
Now, if you were to take a scoreboard

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
and drop it on dirt and whiskey,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
that would be bad.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
that would also be bad.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.260
And so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
and allowed the theater and our client

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
to actually do this with confidence

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.260
that they would be able to change over their configurations at will.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
The second technology that we applied

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
was actually using things that you know from

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
the stage side of an opera house.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
In this case what we're doing is we're taking

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.260
the orchestra floor, lifting it up, spinning it,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
changing the rake, taking it back to flat floor,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
changing the rake again. In essence, you can begin to define

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
rakes and viewing angles

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
of people in the orchestra seating, at will.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.260
Here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
to thrust configuration.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.260
The proscenium, also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:45.260
the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
And ultimately, up in the flytower,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.260
the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.260
As I said, all that was in service of creating a flexible

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
yet affordable configuration.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
But we got this other benefit, and that was

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
Dallas on the outside.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Here you see the building in its current state

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
with blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Actually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
that are integrated into the windows themselves,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
again with failsafe mechanisms

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
if you chose, the operations of the theater

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
going on behind, rehearsals and so forth.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
But you also have the ability

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
to allow the audience to see Dallas,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
Now, if I'll take you through --

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
this is an early concept sketch --

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
Effectively you would have something like this.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.260
You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber:

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
"Aida," their elephants, you can bring the elephants in.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.260
You would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
or vice versa, Dallas to the auditorium.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
You'd be able to open portions in order to

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
change the procession,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
allow people to come in and out for an intermission,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
As I said, all the balconies can move,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
but they can also be disappeared completely.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
The proscenium can fly.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
You can bring large objects into the chamber itself.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
But most convincingly when we had to confront the idea

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
is something that is represented by this.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
And again, this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
but at least suggests the ideas.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
This building has the ability, in short order,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
to go back to a flat floor organization

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
such that they can rent it out.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
Now, if there is anyone here from American Airlines,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
please consider doing your Christmas party here.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.260
(Laughter)

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
That allows the company to raise operational budgets

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
without having to compete with other venues

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
with much larger auditoriums.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
That's an enormous benefit.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
So, the theater company has the ability

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
to do totally hermetic,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
light-controlled, sound-controlled, great acoustics,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
great intimacy Shakespeare,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
but can also do Beckett

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
with the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
Here it is in a flat floor configuration.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
The theater has been going through its kind of paces.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
Here it is in an end stage configuration.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
We stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
It was very unusual.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
Here it is in a thrust configuration.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
And last but not least,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
you see this already has the ability to create events

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
in order to generate operational budgets

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
to overcome the building in fact performing

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.260
I'm going to show you a brief time lapse.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
As I said, this can be done with only two people,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
and with a minimum amount of time.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
This is the first time that actually the changeover was done

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
and so there is literally thousands of people because

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.260
So, in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
And think of it being done with just a few people.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
Again, just a couple people are required.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.260
(Laughter)

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
I promise.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
Et voila.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:48.260
(Applause)

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
So, just in conclusion, a few shots.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
This is the AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center's

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
Dee and Charles Wyly Theater.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
There it is at night.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.260
And last but not least the entire AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.260
And to remind you that here is an example in which

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
architecture actually did something.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
But we got to that conclusion

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
without understanding where we were going,

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
what we knew were a series of issues that the company

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
and the client was confronted with.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
And we took positions with them, and it was through those positions

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
that we began to take architectural manifestations

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
and we arrived at a conclusion that none of us,

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
really none of us could ever

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.260
have conceived of initially or individually.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
Thank you.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
(Applause)
