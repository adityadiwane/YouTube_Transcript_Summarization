00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:21.583
(Music)

00:01:57.512 --> 00:02:01.264
(Applause)

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:08.288
(Music)

00:02:20.886 --> 00:02:22.037
(Music ends)

00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:28.443
(Applause)

00:02:31.124 --> 00:02:33.103
Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.322
Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much.

00:02:35.346 --> 00:02:37.672
We're so excited to be here.
It's such an honor.

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:40.259
Like he said, we're
three brothers from New Jersey --

00:02:40.283 --> 00:02:42.935
you know, the bluegrass
capital of the world.

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.746
(Laughter)

00:02:45.182 --> 00:02:47.919
We discovered bluegrass a few years ago,

00:02:47.943 --> 00:02:49.332
and we fell in love with it.

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:50.699
We hope you guys will too.

00:02:50.723 --> 00:02:54.738
This next song is an original
we wrote called "Time Lapse,"

00:02:54.762 --> 00:02:56.802
and it will probably live up to its name.

00:02:56.826 --> 00:03:03.826
(Tuning)

00:03:05.528 --> 00:03:12.528
(Music)

00:04:47.768 --> 00:04:48.918
(Music ends)

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.639
(Applause)

00:05:01.313 --> 00:05:02.908
TM: Thank you very much.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.092
RM: I'm just going to take
a second to introduce the band.

00:05:07.116 --> 00:05:09.380
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy.

00:05:09.404 --> 00:05:14.985
(Applause)

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.786
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny.

00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:21.042
(Applause)

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:22.462
He's also our brother.

00:05:23.347 --> 00:05:25.812
And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14,
and I play the fiddle.

00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:30.604
(Applause)

00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:33.847
As you can see, we decided
to make it hard on ourselves,

00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:35.396
and we chose to play three songs

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.664
in three different keys.

00:05:36.688 --> 00:05:39.037
(Tuning)

00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:41.966
Yeah. I'm also going to explain,
a lot of people want to know

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.441
where we got the name
"Sleepy Man Banjo Boys" from.

00:05:44.913 --> 00:05:47.181
So, it started when Jonny was little,

00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:50.579
and he first started the banjo,
he would play on his back

00:05:50.603 --> 00:05:51.836
with his eyes closed,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.954
and we'd say it looked
like he was sleeping.

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.484
So you can probably piece
the rest together.

00:05:56.508 --> 00:05:58.556
TM: We can't really figure out the reason.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.555
It might have been
that it weighs about a million pounds.

00:06:02.378 --> 00:06:09.378
(Music)

00:07:41.283 --> 00:07:43.804
(Applause)

00:07:43.828 --> 00:07:50.828
(Music)

00:08:24.055 --> 00:08:25.206
(Music ends)

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:30.264
(Applause)

00:08:30.288 --> 00:08:31.716
TM: Thank you very much.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.891
(Cheering)

00:08:32.915 --> 00:08:34.399
RM: Thank you.

00:08:34.423 --> 00:08:41.423
(Applause)
