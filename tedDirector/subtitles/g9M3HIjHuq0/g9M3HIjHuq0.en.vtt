00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.376
So when I decided to create
an art piece in Manshiyat Naser,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.376
the neighborhood of the Cairo
garbage collectors in Egypt,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.216
I never thought this project would be

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.920
the most amazing human experience
that I would ever live.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.336
As an artist, I had
this humanist intention

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.736
of beautifying a poor
and neglected neighborhood

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.840
by bringing art to it and hopefully
shining light on this isolated community.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.616
The first time I heard about
this Christian Coptic community

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.056
was in 2009 when the Egyptian authorities
under the regime of Hosni Mubarak

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.880
decided to slaughter 300,000 pigs
using the pretext of H1N1 virus.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.496
Originally, they are pig breeders.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.696
Their pigs and other animals
are fed with the organic waste

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.696
that they collect on a daily basis.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.480
This event killed their livelihood.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.536
The first time I entered Manshiyat Naser,
it felt like a maze.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.256
I was looking for the St. Simon Monastery
on the top of the Muqattam Mountain.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.456
So you go right, then straight,
then right again, then left

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.176
to reach all the way to the top.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.616
But to reach there, you must dodge between
the trucks overpacked with garbage

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.216
and slalom between the tuk-tuks,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.440
the fastest vehicle to move around
in the neighborhood.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.176
The smell of the garbage
unloaded from those trucks was intense,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.576
and the noise of the traffic
was loud and overbearing.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.280
Add to it the din created by the crushers
in those warehouses along the way.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.360
From outside it looks chaotic,
but everything is perfectly organized.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.056
The Zaraeeb, that’s how
they call themselves,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.616
which means the pig breeders,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.016
have been collecting the garbage of Cairo

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.816
and sorting it in their own
neighborhood for decades.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.976
They have developed
one of the most efficient

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.296
and highly profitable systems
on a global level.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.936
Still, the place is perceived
as dirty, marginalized and segregated

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.040
because of their association
with the trash.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.936
So my initial idea
was to create an anamorphic piece,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.816
a piece that you can only see
from one vantage point.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.176
I wanted to challenge myself artistically
by painting over several buildings

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.336
and having it only fully visible
from one point on the Muqattam Mountain.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.936
The Muqattam Mountain
is the pride of the community.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.416
This is where they built
the St. Simon Monastery,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.560
a 10,000-seat cave church
that they carved into the mountain itself.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.256
So, the first time
I stood on top of the mountain

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.896
and I looked at the neighborhood,

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.816
I asked myself, how on earth
will I convince all those owners

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.016
to let me paint on their buildings?

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.416
And then Magd came.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.816
Magd is a guide from the Church.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.936
He told me the only person I needed
to convince was Father Samaan,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.416
who is the leader of the community.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.656
But to convince Father Samaan,
I needed to convince Mario,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.736
who is a Polish artist
who moved to Cairo 20 years ago

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.576
and who created all the artwork
of the Cave Church.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.520
I am really grateful to Mario.
He was the key of the project.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.656
He managed to get me
a meeting with Father Samaan,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.416
and surprisingly, he loved the idea.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.696
He asked me about where I painted before

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.176
and how I will make it happen.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.400
And he was mainly concerned
by what I was going to write.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.896
In every work that I create,
I write messages

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.696
with my style of Arabic calligraphy.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.456
I make sure those messages are relevant
to the place where I am painting

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.100
but have this universal dimension,

00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:28.924
so anybody around the world
can relate to it.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.816
So for Manshiyat Naser,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.616
I decided to write in Arabic
the words of St. Athanasius of Alexandria,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.576
a Coptic bishop from the third century,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.176
who said: (Arabic),

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.456
which means in English,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.616
"Anyone who wants
to see the sunlight clearly

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.120
needs to wipe his eyes first."

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.576
It was really important for me

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.496
that the community
felt connected to the words.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.960
And for me this quote was perfectly
reflecting the spirit of the project.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.896
So Father Samaan blessed the project,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.880
and his approval brought
all the residents on board.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.936
Hundreds of liters of paint,
a dozen blue manual lifts,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.096
several trips back and forth to Cairo,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.256
a strong and solid team from France,
North Africa, Middle East and the US,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.736
and after a year of planning
and logistics, there we are,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.376
my team and some members
from the local community

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.896
creating a piece that will
spread over 50 buildings,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.816
some filling up the space
of the calligraphy

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.256
that I trace with colors.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.336
Here some blue, there some yellow,
there some orange.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.495
Some others carrying some sand bags

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:34.616
and putting them
on the top of the buildings

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.976
to hold those manual lifts,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.896
and some others assembling
and disassembling those same lifts

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.120
and moving them around
the different buildings.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.896
At the beginning of the project,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.576
I numbered all those
buildings on my sketch,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.096
and there was no real interaction
with the community.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.256
People didn’t get the point of all this.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.776
But fast enough, those building numbers
became family names.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.400
The first building
was the house of Uncle Ibrahim.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.176
Uncle Ibrahim is such
an enthusiastic person.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.256
He was always singing and making jokes,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.616
and his daughters and sons
saved me from his bull

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.096
who wanted to attack me
on the fourth floor.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.416
(Laughter)

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.736
Actually, the bull saw me from the window
and came out on the balcony.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.096
(Laughter)

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.320
Yeah.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.336
Uncle Ibrahim was always
hanging out on the balcony

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.336
and talking to me while I was painting.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.336
I remember him saying that he didn’t
go to the mountain for 10 years,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.176
and that he never takes a day off.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.976
He said that if he stopped working,
who will stop the garbage?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.416
But surprisingly,
at the end of the project,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.256
he came all the way to the mountain
to look at the piece.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.056
He was really proud
to see his house painted,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.840
and he said that this project
was a project of peace and --

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.600
sorry --

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.560
(Applause)

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.600
Thank you.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.296
He said that it was a project
of peace and unity

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.040
and that it brought people together.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.896
So his perception
towards the project changed,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.816
and my perception towards
the community changed also,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.776
and towards what they do.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.416
All the garbage that everybody
is disgusted by is not theirs.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.936
They just work out of it.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.216
Actually, they don’t live in the garbage.
They live from the garbage.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.456
So I started doubting myself and wondering

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.256
what was the real purpose
of this whole project?

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.376
It was not about beautifying
a place by bringing art to it.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.456
It was about switching perception
and opening a dialogue

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.640
on the connection that we have
with communities that we don’t know.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.776
So day after day,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.176
the calligraphy circle was taking shape,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.256
and we were always excited to go back
on the mountain to look at the piece.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.416
And standing exactly at this point
every day made my realize

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.256
the symbolism behind
this anamorphic piece.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.456
If you want to see
the real image of somebody,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.440
maybe you should change your angle.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.256
There was doubts and difficulties,

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.536
like fears and stress.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.736
It wasn't simple
to work in such environments,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.976
sometimes having pigs under you
while you paint

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.816
or climbing a stack of garbage
to reach a lift.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.176
But we all got over the fear
of the heights, the swinging lifts,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.456
the strength of the smell

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.616
and also the stress
of not finishing on time.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.880
But the kindness of all those people
made us forget everything.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.776
The building number 3 was the house
of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.056
In Egyptian, they have
this expression that says, "Ahsen Nas,"

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.616
which means "the best people."

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.896
They were the best people.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.056
We used to take our break
in front of their houses,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.456
and all the kids of the neighborhood

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.816
used to join us.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.176
I was impressed and amazed
by the kids of Manshiyat Naser.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.336
For the first few days, they were always
refusing anything we were offering them,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.416
even a snack or a drink.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.376
So I asked Aunty Fareeda, "Why is that?"

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.256
And she told me they teach
their kids to refuse anything

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.936
from somebody that they don't know

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.520
because maybe this person
needs it more than they do.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.896
So at this exact point I realized actually

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.056
the Zaraeeb community
was the ideal context

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.680
to raise the topic of perception.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.536
We need to question
our level of misconception

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.216
and judgment we can have as a society

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.680
upon communities
based on their differences.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.416
I remember how we got delayed
on Uncle Ibrahim's house

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.576
when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.176
were eating the sand bags
that hold the lifts.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.760
(Laughter)

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.576
The house of Uncle Bakheet
and Aunty Fareeda

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.256
was this kind of meeting point.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.135
Everybody used to gather there.

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:48.096
I think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.736
when he said that was
a project of peace and unity,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.559
because I really felt
that people were coming together.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.496
Everyone was greeting us
with a smile, offering us a drink

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.536
or inviting us into their
own house for lunch.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.576
Sometime, you are
at the first level of a building,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.136
and somebody opens his window
and offers you some tea.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.616
And then the same thing happens
on the second floor.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.656
And you keep going all the way to the top.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.896
(Laughter)

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.376
(Applause)

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.856
I think I never drink as much tea
as I did in Egypt.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.696
(Laughter)

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.456
And to be honest with you,
we could have finished earlier,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.656
but I think it took us three weeks
because of all those tea breaks.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.480
(Laughter)

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.056
In Egypt, they have another expression,
which is "Nawartouna,"

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.200
which means, "You brought light to us."

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.096
In Manshiyat Naser
they were always telling us this.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.256
The calligraphy, actually --

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.336
I used a white glow-in-the-dark paint
for the calligraphy

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.536
so at the end of the project,
we rented some black light projectors

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.936
and lit up the whole neighborhood,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.336
surprising everybody around.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.616
We wanted to tell them

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.840
that they are the ones
who brought light to us.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.560
(Applause)

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.056
The Zaraeeb community
are strong, honest, hard workers,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.816
and they know their value.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.976
The people of Cairo
call them "the Zabaleen,"

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.976
which means "the people of the garbage,"

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.736
but ironically,
the people of Manshiyat Naser

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.616
call the people of Cairo the Zabaleen.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.576
They say, they are the ones
who produce the garbage, not them.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.816
(Laughter)

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.216
(Applause)

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.616
The goal was to leave something
to this community,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.776
but I feel that they are the ones
who left something in our lives.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.896
You know, the art project
was just a pretext

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.576
for this amazing human experience.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.016
The art piece at some point
will disappear, vanish,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.936
and actually there is somebody
who is building a second floor

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.616
in front of Uncle Ibrahim's house,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.496
so it's covering part of the painting,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.656
so I might need to go back
and paint over it.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.296
(Laughter)

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.696
It was about the experience,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.136
about the story,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.440
about the moment.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.456
From the streets of the neighborhood,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.100
the painting appears in fragments,

00:11:00.124 --> 00:11:02.016
isolated from one another,

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.296
standing alone.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.496
But connected with the sign of calligraphy

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.376
that today reveals the powerful message
that we should all think about

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.080
before we want to judge somebody.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.776
Anyone who wants to see
the sunlight clearly

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.240
needs to wipe his eyes first.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.176
Thank you.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:24.961
(Applause)
