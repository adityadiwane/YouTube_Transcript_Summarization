00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Those of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
remember me asking a few questions

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
which still preoccupy me.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
One of them was: Why is it necessary to spend

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
six billion pounds

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
speeding up the Eurostar train

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
when, for about 10 percent of that money,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
you could have top supermodels, male and female,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
serving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
for the entire duration of the journey?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
You'd still have five billion left in change,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Now, you may remember me asking the question as well,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
a very interesting observation,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
that actually those strange little signs

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
that actually flash "35" at you,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
occasionally accompanying a little smiley face

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
or a frown,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
according to whether you're within or outside the speed limit --

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
those are actually more effective

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
at preventing road accidents than speed cameras,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
which come with the actual threat

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
of real punishment.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
So there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
I think, in many areas of human problem solving,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
particularly those which involve human psychology,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
which is: The tendency

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
of the organization or the institution

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
is to deploy as much force as possible,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
as much compulsion as possible,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
whereas actually, the tendency of the person

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
is to be almost influenced

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
in absolute reverse proportion

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
to the amount of force being applied.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
So there seems to be a complete disconnect here.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
So what I'm asking for is the creation of a new job title --

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
I'll come to this a little later --

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and perhaps the addition of a new word

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
into the English language.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Because it does seem to me that large organizations

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
including government, which is, of course, the largest organization of all,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
have actually become

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
completely disconnected

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
with what actually matters to people.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Let me give you one example of this.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
You may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger, okay,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
heralded at the time as the largest

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
single deal of all time.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
It may still be, for all I know.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Now, all of you in this room, in one form or other,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
are probably customers of one or both

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
of those organizations that merged.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Just interested, did anybody notice anything different

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
as a result of this at all?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
So unless you happened to be a shareholder

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
of one or the other organizations

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
you're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
that meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody, okay?

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
By contrast, years of marketing have taught me

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
that if you actually want people to remember you

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and to appreciate what you do,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
the most potent things are actually very, very small.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
This is from Virgin Atlantic upper-class,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
it's the cruet salt and pepper set.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Quite nice in itself, they're little, sort of, airplane things.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
What's really, really sweet is every single person looking at these things

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
has exactly the same mischievous thought,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
which is, "I reckon I can heist these."

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
However, you pick them up and underneath,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
actually engraved in the metal, are the words,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
"Stolen from Virgin Atlantic Airways upper-class."

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
(Laughter)

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Now, years after

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
you remember the strategic question

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
of whether you're flying in a 777 or an Airbus,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
you remember those words and that experience.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Similarly, this is from a hotel in Stockholm, the Lydmar.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Has anybody stayed there?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
It's the lift, it's a series of buttons in the lift.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Nothing unusual about that at all,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
It starts with garage at the bottom, I suppose, appropriately,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
but it doesn't go up garage, grand floor, mezzanine, one, two, three, four.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
It actually says garage, funk, rhythm and blues.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
You have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
My guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
in the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
is probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
It's frankly more memorable

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
than all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
at a cost of 500,000 dollars,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
in the entire course of your life.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Now, these are trivial marketing examples, I accept.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
But I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
probably one of the leading experts in,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
effectively, the eradication of poverty in the developing world,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
actually spoke.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And she came across a similar example

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
of something that fascinated me

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
as being something which, in a business context or a government context,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
would simply be so trivial a solution

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
as to seem embarrassing.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
It was simply to encourage the inoculation of children

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
by, not only making it a social event --

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
I think good use of behavioral economics in that,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
if you turn up with several other mothers

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
to have your child inoculated,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
But secondly, to incentivize that inoculation

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
It's a tiny, tiny thing.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
If you're a senior person at UNESCO

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and someone says, "So what are you doing

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
to eradicate world poverty?"

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
you're not really confident standing up there

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
saying, "I've got it cracked; it's the lentils," are you?

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Our own sense of self-aggrandizement

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
feels that big important problems

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
need to have big important, and most of all, expensive

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
solutions attached to them.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And yet, what behavioral economics shows time after time after time

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
is in human behavioral and behavioral change

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
there's a very, very strong disproportionality at work,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
that actually what changes our behavior

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and what changes our attitude to things

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
is not actually proportionate to the degree

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
of expense entailed,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
or the degree of force that's applied.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
But everything about institutions

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
makes them uncomfortable

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
with that disproportionality.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
So what happens in an institution

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
is the very person who has the power to solve the problem

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
also has a very, very large budget.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
And once you have a very, very large budget,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
you actually look for expensive things to spend it on.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
What is completely lacking is a class of people

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
who have immense amounts of power, but no money at all.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
(Laughter)

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
It's those people I'd quite like to create

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
in the world going forward.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
Now, here's another thing that happens,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
which is what I call sometimes "Terminal 5 syndrome,"

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
which is that big, expensive things

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
get big, highly-intelligent attention,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and they're great, and Terminal 5 is absolutely magnificent,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
until you get down to the small detail, the usability,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
which is the signage,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
which is catastrophic.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
You come out of "Arrive" at the airport, and you follow

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
a big yellow sign that says "Trains" and it's in front of you.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
So you walk for another hundred yards,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
expecting perhaps another sign,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
that might courteously be yellow, in front of you and saying "Trains."

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
No, no, no, the next one is actually blue, to your left,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
and says "Heathrow Express."

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
I mean, it could almost be rather like that scene from the film "Airplane."

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
A yellow sign? That's exactly what they'll be expecting.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Actually, what happens in the world increasingly --

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
now, all credit to the British Airport Authority.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
I spoke about this before,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said, "Okay, what can you do?"

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
So I did come up with five suggestions, which they are actually actioning.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
One of them also being,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
although logically it's quite a good idea

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
to have a lift with no up and down button in it,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
if it only serves two floors,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
it's actually bloody terrifying, okay?

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
Because when the door closes

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and there's nothing for you to do,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
you've actually just stepped into a Hammer film.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
(Laughter)

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
So these questions ... what is happening in the world

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
is the big stuff, actually,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
is done magnificently well.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
But the small stuff, what you might call the user interface,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
is done spectacularly badly.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
But also, there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
in terms of solving these small solutions.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
Because the people who can actually solve them

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
actually are too powerful and too preoccupied

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
with something they think of as "strategy" to actually solve them.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
I tried this exercise recently, talking about banking.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
They said, "Can we do an advertising campaign?

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
What can we do and encourage more online banking?"

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
I said, "It's really, really easy."

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
I said, "When people login to their online bank

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
there are lots and lots of things they'd probably quite like to look at.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
The last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance."

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
I've got friends who actually

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
never use their own bank cash machines

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
because there's the risk that it might display

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
their balance on the screen.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news?

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
Okay, you simply wouldn't.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
I said, "If you make, actually, 'Tell me my balance.'

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
If you make that an option rather than the default,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
you'll find twice as many people log on to online banking,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and they do it three times as often."

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Let's face it, most of us -- how many of you

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine?

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
Now, interesting that no single person does that,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
But what's interesting about that suggestion

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
was that, to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost 10 million pounds;

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
it wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure;

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
it would actually cost about 50 quid.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
And yet, it never happens.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
Because there's a fundamental disconnect, as I said,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
that actually, the people with the power

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
want to do big expensive things.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
And there's to some extent a big strategy myth

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
that's prevalent in business now.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
And if you think about it, it's very, very important

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
that the strategy myth is maintained.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
Because, if the board of directors convince everybody

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
that the success of any organization

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
it makes the disparity in salaries

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
slightly more justifiable

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
might actually lie somewhere else,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
in small pieces of tactical activity.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
But what is happening is that effectively --

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this;

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
lots of things haven't helped this --

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
It wants the world to be the kind of place where

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
the input and the change are proportionate.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
It's a kind of mechanistic world

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
that we'd all love to live in

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
where, effectively, it sits very nicely on spreadsheets,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
everything is numerically expressible,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
and the amount you spend on something is proportionate

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
to the scale of your success.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
That's the world people actually want.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
In truth, we do live in a world that science can understand.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Unfortunately, the science is probably closer to being climatology

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
in that in many cases,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
very, very small changes

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
can have disproportionately huge effects,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and equally, vast areas of activity, enormous mergers,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
But it's very, very uncomfortable for us

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
to actually acknowledge that we're living in such a world.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
But what I'm saying is we could just make things

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
a little bit better for ourselves

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
if we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
That is actually strategy, and I'm not denying that strategy has a role.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
You know, there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
and you accomplish quite a lot.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And I'd be wrong to dis that completely.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
Moving over, we come, of course, to consultancy.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
(Laughter)

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
I thought it was very indecent of Accenture

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
to ditch Tiger Woods in such

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
a sort of hurried and hasty way.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
I mean, Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
He developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
(Laughter)

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
no longer tied to a single monopoly provider,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
in many cases, sourcing things locally,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
and of course, the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
led for better load-balancing.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
So what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that, I'm not sure.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Then there are other things that don't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
That's called trivia.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
But there's a fourth thing.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
And the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
We don't know what to call it.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
And actually we don't spend nearly enough money

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
looking for those things,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
looking for those tiny things that may or may not work,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
but which, if they do work,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
can have a success absolutely out of proportion

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
to their expense, their efforts

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
and the disruption they cause.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
So the first thing I'd like

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film --

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
And the second thing, I think,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
is that the world needs to have people in charge of that.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
That's why I call for the "Chief Detail Officer."

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Every corporation should have one,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and every government should have a Ministry of Detail.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
The people who actually have no money,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
who have no extravagant budget,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
but who realize that actually

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
you might achieve greater success in uptake

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
of a government program

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
simply by redesigning the form

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
and writing it in comprehensible English.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
And if actually we created a Ministry of Detail

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
and business actually had Chief Detail Officers,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
then that fourth quadrant,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
which is so woefully neglected at the moment,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
might finally get the attention it deserves.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Thank you very much.
