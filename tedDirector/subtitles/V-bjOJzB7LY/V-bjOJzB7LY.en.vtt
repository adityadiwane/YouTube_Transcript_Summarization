00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.529
Now, I want to start with a question:

00:00:17.553 --> 00:00:20.966
When was the last time
you were called "childish"?

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.236
For kids like me,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.616
being called childish
can be a frequent occurrence.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.236
Every time we make irrational demands,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.236
exhibit irresponsible behavior,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.236
or display any other signs
of being normal American citizens,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.652
we are called childish.

00:00:37.017 --> 00:00:38.236
Which really bothers me.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.236
After all, take a look at these events:

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.236
Imperialism and colonization,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.236
world wars, George W. Bush.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.236
Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.236
Now, what have kids done?

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.236
Well, Anne Frank touched millions

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.236
with her powerful account
of the Holocaust.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.236
Ruby Bridges helped to end
segregation in the United States.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.236
And, most recently,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.953
Charlie Simpson helped to raise
120,000 pounds for Haiti,

00:01:06.977 --> 00:01:08.802
on his little bike.

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:11.236
So as you can see evidenced
by such examples,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.236
age has absolutely nothing to do with it.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.094
The traits the word "childish" addresses
are seen so often in adults,

00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:20.862
that we should abolish
this age-discriminatory word,

00:01:20.886 --> 00:01:24.632
when it comes to criticizing behavior
associated with irresponsibility

00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:26.036
and irrational thinking.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.963
(Applause)

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:33.367
Thank you.

00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:37.830
Then again, who's to say
that certain types of irrational thinking

00:01:37.854 --> 00:01:40.236
aren't exactly what the world needs?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.568
Maybe you've had grand plans before,

00:01:42.592 --> 00:01:44.553
but stopped yourself, thinking,

00:01:44.577 --> 00:01:46.877
"That's impossible,"
or "That costs too much,"

00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:48.369
or "That won't benefit me."

00:01:48.782 --> 00:01:51.315
For better or worse, we kids
aren't hampered as much

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:54.490
when it comes to thinking
about reasons why not to do things.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.758
Kids can be full of inspiring
aspirations and hopeful thinking,

00:01:58.782 --> 00:02:00.742
like my wish that no one went hungry,

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:03.401
or that everything were free,
a kind of utopia.

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.974
How many of you still dream like that,
and believe in the possibilities?

00:02:08.704 --> 00:02:13.092
Sometimes a knowledge of history
and the past failures of Utopian ideals

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:14.275
can be a burden,

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.451
because you know
that if everything were free,

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:20.379
then the food stocks would become
depleted and scarce and lead to chaos.

00:02:20.768 --> 00:02:24.236
On the other hand, we kids
still dream about perfection.

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:28.115
And that's a good thing, because
in order to make anything a reality,

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.236
you have to dream about it first.

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:33.236
In many ways, our audacity to imagine

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.133
helps push the boundaries of possibility.

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.680
For instance, the Museum
of Glass in Tacoma, Washington,

00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:41.601
my home state -- yoohoo, Washington!

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.236
(Applause)

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.458
has a program called Kids Design Glass,

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:48.609
and kids draw their own
ideas for glass art.

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:51.451
The resident artist said
they got some of their best ideas

00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:54.498
from the program, because kids
don't think about the limitations

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:57.157
of how hard it can be to blow
glass into certain shapes,

00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:58.774
they just think of good ideas.

00:02:58.798 --> 00:03:03.236
Now, when you think of glass, you
might think of colorful Chihuly designs,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.417
or maybe Italian vases,

00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.236
but kids challenge glass artists
to go beyond that,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.955
into the realm of brokenhearted snakes

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.209
and bacon boys,
who you can see has meat vision.

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:15.828
(Laughter)

00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:20.487
Now, our inherent wisdom doesn't
have to be insider's knowledge.

00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:24.081
Kids already do a lot
of learning from adults,

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:25.883
and we have a lot to share.

00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:29.189
I think that adults should
start learning from kids.

00:03:29.213 --> 00:03:30.617
Now, I do most of my speaking

00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:33.283
in front of an education crowd --
teachers and students,

00:03:33.307 --> 00:03:34.467
and I like this analogy:

00:03:34.491 --> 00:03:36.982
It shouldn't be a teacher
at the head of the class,

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:38.799
telling students, "Do this, do that."

00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:41.236
The students should teach their teachers.

00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:45.202
Learning between grown-ups
and kids should be reciprocal.

00:03:45.735 --> 00:03:48.236
The reality, unfortunately,
is a little different,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.236
and it has a lot to do
with trust, or a lack of it.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.632
Now, if you don't trust someone,
you place restrictions on them, right?

00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:58.578
If I doubt my older sister's ability
to pay back the 10 percent interest

00:03:58.602 --> 00:04:00.235
I established on her last loan,

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.236
I'm going to withhold her ability
to get more money from me,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.634
until she pays it back.

00:04:04.658 --> 00:04:05.825
(Laughter)

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.748
True story, by the way.

00:04:07.772 --> 00:04:10.236
Now, adults seem to have

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.936
a prevalently restrictive
attitude towards kids,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.236
from every "Don't do that, don't do this"
in the school handbook,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.004
to restrictions on school Internet use.

00:04:20.028 --> 00:04:23.061
As history points out,
regimes become oppressive

00:04:23.085 --> 00:04:25.308
when they're fearful
about keeping control.

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:27.666
And although adults
may not be quite at the level

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.236
of totalitarian regimes,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.236
kids have no or very little say
in making the rules,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.475
when really, the attitude
should be reciprocal,

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.196
meaning that the adult
population should learn

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.236
and take into account the wishes
of the younger population.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.236
Now, what's even worse than restriction,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.832
is that adults often
underestimate kids' abilities.

00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:49.014
We love challenges, but when
expectations are low,

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:50.649
trust me, we will sink to them.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.784
My own parents had anything
but low expectations

00:04:54.808 --> 00:04:56.101
for me and my sister.

00:04:56.744 --> 00:05:01.863
Okay, so they didn't tell us to become
doctors or lawyers or anything like that,

00:05:01.887 --> 00:05:07.485
but my dad did read to us about Aristotle
and pioneer germ-fighters,

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:09.236
when lots of other kids were hearing

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.308
"The Wheels on the Bus
Go Round and Round."

00:05:11.332 --> 00:05:15.200
Well, we heard that one too, but
"Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules.

00:05:15.224 --> 00:05:16.237
(Laughter)

00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:19.235
I loved to write from the age
of four, and when I was six,

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.236
my mom bought me my own laptop
equipped with Microsoft Word.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.670
Thank you, Bill Gates, and thank you, Ma.

00:05:25.694 --> 00:05:29.236
I wrote over 300 short stories
on that little laptop,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.236
and I wanted to get published.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.236
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy
that a kid wanted to get published,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.236
or saying wait until you're older,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.180
my parents were really supportive.

00:05:40.823 --> 00:05:43.601
Many publishers were not
quite so encouraging.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.236
One large children's
publisher ironically said

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.077
that they didn't work with children.

00:05:49.521 --> 00:05:52.750
Children's publisher not
working with children?

00:05:52.774 --> 00:05:55.933
I don't know, you're kind
of alienating a large client there.

00:05:55.957 --> 00:05:57.639
(Laughter)

00:05:57.663 --> 00:06:03.491
One publisher, Action Publishing, was
willing to take that leap and trust me,

00:06:03.515 --> 00:06:05.205
and to listen to what I had to say.

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.778
They published my first book,
"Flying Fingers," you see it here.

00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:12.236
And from there on, it's gone
to speaking at hundreds of schools,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.283
keynoting to thousands of educators,

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:16.830
and finally, today, speaking to you.

00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:18.790
I appreciate your attention today,

00:06:18.814 --> 00:06:21.640
because to show that you
truly care, you listen.

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.236
But there's a problem
with this rosy picture

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.236
of kids being so much better than adults.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.569
Kids grow up and become
adults just like you.

00:06:31.593 --> 00:06:33.236
(Laughter)

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.624
Or just like you? Really?

00:06:35.648 --> 00:06:39.116
The goal is not to turn kids
into your kind of adult,

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.236
but rather, better adults
than you have been,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.576
which may be a little challenging,
considering your guys' credentials.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.758
(Laughter)

00:06:45.782 --> 00:06:47.236
But the way progress happens,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.236
is because new generations and new eras

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.236
grow and develop and become
better than the previous ones.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.418
It's the reason we're not
in the Dark Ages anymore.

00:06:56.807 --> 00:06:59.236
No matter your position or place in life,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.236
it is imperative to create
opportunities for children,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.236
so that we can grow up to blow you away.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.146
(Laughter)

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.236
Adults and fellow TEDsters,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.236
you need to listen and learn from kids,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.923
and trust us and expect more from us.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.489
You must lend an ear today,

00:07:18.513 --> 00:07:21.211
because we are the leaders
of tomorrow, which means

00:07:21.235 --> 00:07:24.037
we're going to take care of you
when you're old and senile.

00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:25.354
No, just kidding.

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.378
(Laughter)

00:07:26.402 --> 00:07:29.097
No, really, we are going
to be the next generation,

00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:31.406
the ones who will bring
this world forward.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.581
And in case you don't think
that this really has meaning for you,

00:07:34.605 --> 00:07:36.236
remember that cloning is possible,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.546
and that involves going
through childhood again,

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.236
in which case you'll want to be
heard, just like my generation.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:48.236
Now, the world needs opportunities
for new leaders and new ideas.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.236
Kids need opportunities
to lead and succeed.

00:07:51.556 --> 00:07:53.421
Are you ready to make the match?

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.381
Because the world's problems
shouldn't be the human family's heirloom.

00:07:58.405 --> 00:08:00.236
Thank you.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.236
(Applause)

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Thank you. Thank you.
