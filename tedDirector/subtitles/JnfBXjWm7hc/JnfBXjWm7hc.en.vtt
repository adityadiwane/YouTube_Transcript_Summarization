00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.236
A few years ago,
I felt like I was stuck in a rut,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.236
so I decided to follow in the footsteps

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.796
of the great American
philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.236
and try something new for 30 days.

00:00:28.783 --> 00:00:30.536
The idea is actually pretty simple.

00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:33.936
Think about something you've always
wanted to add to your life

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.236
and try it for the next 30 days.

00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:40.551
It turns out 30 days is just
about the right amount of time

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:43.267
to add a new habit or subtract a habit --

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.536
like watching the news --

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.236
from your life.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.451
There's a few things I learned
while doing these 30-day challenges.

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.236
The first was,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.236
instead of the months
flying by, forgotten,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.236
the time was much more memorable.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.832
This was part of a challenge I did
to take a picture every day for a month.

00:01:00.856 --> 00:01:05.281
And I remember exactly where I was
and what I was doing that day.

00:01:06.392 --> 00:01:07.669
I also noticed

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:11.022
that as I started to do more
and harder 30-day challenges,

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:12.236
my self-confidence grew.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.736
I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.236
to the kind of guy who bikes to work.

00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:19.105
For fun!

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:20.479
(Laughter)

00:01:20.503 --> 00:01:23.526
Even last year, I ended up hiking
up Mt. Kilimanjaro,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.236
the highest mountain in Africa.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.283
I would never have been that adventurous
before I started my 30-day challenges.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.857
I also figured out that if you
really want something badly enough,

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.236
you can do anything for 30 days.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.230
Have you ever wanted to write a novel?

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:43.510
Every November,

00:01:43.534 --> 00:01:44.836
tens of thousands of people

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.941
try to write their own
50,000-word novel, from scratch,

00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:50.236
in 30 days.

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:55.772
It turns out, all you have to do
is write 1,667 words a day

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:56.999
for a month.

00:01:57.833 --> 00:01:59.236
So I did.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.121
By the way, the secret
is not to go to sleep

00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:04.242
until you've written
your words for the day.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.236
You might be sleep-deprived,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.958
but you'll finish your novel.

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:12.236
Now is my book the next great
American novel?

00:02:12.707 --> 00:02:14.236
No. I wrote it in a month.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.096
It's awful.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.762
(Laughter)

00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:19.971
But for the rest of my life,

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:22.236
if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.236
I don't have to say,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.236
"I'm a computer scientist."

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.599
No, no, if I want to,
I can say, "I'm a novelist."

00:02:29.623 --> 00:02:32.985
(Laughter)

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.236
So here's one last thing
I'd like to mention.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.739
I learned that when I made
small, sustainable changes,

00:02:38.763 --> 00:02:40.236
things I could keep doing,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.483
they were more likely to stick.

00:02:42.507 --> 00:02:45.236
There's nothing wrong
with big, crazy challenges.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.626
In fact, they're a ton of fun.

00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:49.690
But they're less likely to stick.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.078
When I gave up sugar for 30 days,

00:02:53.102 --> 00:02:54.917
day 31 looked like this.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.245
(Laughter)

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.710
So here's my question to you:

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:01.469
What are you waiting for?

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:03.771
I guarantee you the next 30 days

00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:07.395
are going to pass
whether you like it or not,

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:12.118
so why not think about something
you have always wanted to try

00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:13.389
and give it a shot!

00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:15.320
For the next 30 days.

00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:17.236
Thanks.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.140
(Applause)
