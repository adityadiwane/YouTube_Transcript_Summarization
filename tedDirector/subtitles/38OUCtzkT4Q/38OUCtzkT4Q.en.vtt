00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.424
So it all came to life

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.280
in a dark bar in Madrid.

00:00:16.843 --> 00:00:21.067
I encountered my colleague
from McGill, Michael Meaney.

00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.396
And we were drinking a few beers,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.473
and like scientists do,

00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:26.943
he told me about his work.

00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:35.078
And he told me that he is interested
in how mother rats lick their pups

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:36.472
after they were born.

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:39.895
And I was sitting there and saying,

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:42.919
"This is where my tax
dollars are wasted --

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:43.977
(Laughter)

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.779
on this kind of soft science."

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:50.152
And he started telling me

00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:53.576
that the rats, like humans,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.046
lick their pups in very different ways.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.805
Some mothers do a lot of that,

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.034
some mothers do very little,

00:01:01.058 --> 00:01:03.028
and most are in between.

00:01:03.687 --> 00:01:05.588
But what's interesting about it

00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:10.530
is when he follows these pups
when they become adults --

00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:14.733
like, years in human life,
long after their mother died.

00:01:14.757 --> 00:01:16.825
They are completely different animals.

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:21.222
The animals that were licked
and groomed heavily,

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:22.998
the high-licking and grooming,

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:25.243
are not stressed.

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:28.091
They have different sexual behavior.

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:31.070
They have a different way of living

00:01:31.094 --> 00:01:36.574
than those that were not treated
as intensively by their mothers.

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:40.918
So then I was thinking to myself:

00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:42.234
Is this magic?

00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:44.191
How does this work?

00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:46.424
As geneticists would like you to think,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.182
perhaps the mother had
the "bad mother" gene

00:01:51.206 --> 00:01:54.843
that caused her pups to be stressful,

00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:57.414
and then it was passed
from generation to generation;

00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:00.138
it's all determined by genetics.

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:03.656
Or is it possible that something
else is going on here?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.251
In rats, we can ask
this question and answer it.

00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:10.880
So what we did is
a cross-fostering experiment.

00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:15.659
You essentially separate the litter,
the babies of this rat, at birth,

00:02:15.683 --> 00:02:17.550
to two kinds of fostering mothers --

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:20.902
not the real mothers,
but mothers that will take care of them:

00:02:20.926 --> 00:02:23.180
high-licking mothers
and low-licking mothers.

00:02:23.204 --> 00:02:27.082
And you can do the opposite
with the low-licking pups.

00:02:27.528 --> 00:02:29.901
And the remarkable answer was,

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:33.964
it wasn't important
what gene you got from your mother.

00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:39.736
It was not the biological mother
that defined this property of these rats.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.766
It is the mother that
took care of the pups.

00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:47.416
So how can this work?

00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:50.544
I am an a epigeneticist.

00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:54.240
I am interested in how genes are marked

00:02:54.264 --> 00:02:55.980
by a chemical mark

00:02:56.004 --> 00:03:00.809
during embryogenesis, during the time
we're in the womb of our mothers,

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:03.312
and decide which gene will be expressed

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:04.518
in what tissue.

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:08.712
Different genes are expressed in the brain
than in the liver and the eye.

00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:12.377
And we thought: Is it possible

00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:19.348
that the mother is somehow
reprogramming the gene of her offspring

00:03:19.372 --> 00:03:20.921
through her behavior?

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:22.556
And we spent 10 years,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.621
and we found that there is a cascade
of biochemical events

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:30.088
by which the licking and grooming
of the mother, the care of the mother,

00:03:30.112 --> 00:03:32.595
is translated to biochemical signals

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:35.930
that go into the nucleus and into the DNA

00:03:35.954 --> 00:03:38.032
and program it differently.

00:03:38.056 --> 00:03:42.952
So now the animal can prepare
itself for life:

00:03:42.976 --> 00:03:45.597
Is life going to be harsh?

00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:47.383
Is there going to be a lot of food?

00:03:47.407 --> 00:03:49.932
Are there going to be a lot of cats
and snakes around,

00:03:49.956 --> 00:03:52.279
or will I live
in an upper-class neighborhood

00:03:52.303 --> 00:03:55.010
where all I have to do
is behave well and proper,

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:58.169
and that will gain me social acceptance?

00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:04.389
And now one can think about
how important that process can be

00:04:04.413 --> 00:04:05.588
for our lives.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.524
We inherit our DNA from our ancestors.

00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:11.160
The DNA is old.

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.252
It evolved during evolution.

00:04:13.758 --> 00:04:18.091
But it doesn't tell us
if you are going to be born in Stockholm,

00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:21.501
where the days are long in the summer
and short in the winter,

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:22.830
or in Ecuador,

00:04:22.854 --> 00:04:26.387
where there's an equal number of hours
for day and night all year round.

00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:30.206
And that has such an enormous [effect]
on our physiology.

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:35.545
So what we suggest is,
perhaps what happens early in life,

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.736
those signals that come
through the mother,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.275
tell the child what kind of social world
you're going to be living in.

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:45.699
It will be harsh, and you'd better
be anxious and be stressful,

00:04:45.723 --> 00:04:48.846
or it's going to be an easy world,
and you have to be different.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.060
Is it going to be a world
with a lot of light or little light?

00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:56.069
Is it going to be a world
with a lot of food or little food?

00:04:56.093 --> 00:04:57.617
If there's no food around,

00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:02.257
you'd better develop your brain to binge
whenever you see a meal,

00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:07.037
or store every piece of food
that you have as fat.

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.069
So this is good.

00:05:10.093 --> 00:05:11.950
Evolution has selected this

00:05:11.974 --> 00:05:16.870
to allow our fixed, old DNA
to function in a dynamic way

00:05:16.894 --> 00:05:18.743
in new environments.

00:05:19.197 --> 00:05:21.780
But sometimes things can go wrong;

00:05:22.526 --> 00:05:26.388
for example, if you're born
to a poor family

00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:29.341
and the signals are, "You better binge,

00:05:29.365 --> 00:05:32.580
you better eat every piece of food
you're going to encounter."

00:05:32.604 --> 00:05:34.856
But now we humans
and our brain have evolved,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.976
have changed evolution even faster.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.364
Now you can buy McDonald's for one dollar.

00:05:40.388 --> 00:05:46.798
And therefore, the preparation
that we had by our mothers

00:05:46.822 --> 00:05:49.414
is turning out to be maladaptive.

00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:54.384
The same preparation that was supposed
to protect us from hunger and famine

00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:56.865
is going to cause obesity,

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.859
cardiovascular problems
and metabolic disease.

00:06:00.486 --> 00:06:03.958
So this concept that genes
could be marked by our experience,

00:06:03.982 --> 00:06:06.283
and especially the early life experience,

00:06:06.307 --> 00:06:09.121
can provide us a unifying explanation

00:06:09.145 --> 00:06:11.488
of both health and disease.

00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:14.790
But is true only for rats?

00:06:14.814 --> 00:06:17.766
The problem is, we cannot
test this in humans,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.902
because ethically, we cannot administer
child adversity in a random way.

00:06:21.926 --> 00:06:25.230
So if a poor child develops
a certain property,

00:06:25.254 --> 00:06:28.993
we don't know whether
this is caused by poverty

00:06:29.017 --> 00:06:31.841
or whether poor people have bad genes.

00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:34.980
So geneticists will try to tell you
that poor people are poor

00:06:35.004 --> 00:06:37.060
because their genes make them poor.

00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:39.044
Epigeneticists will tell you

00:06:39.068 --> 00:06:43.178
poor people are in a bad environment
or an impoverished environment

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:46.166
that creates that phenotype,
that property.

00:06:47.396 --> 00:06:53.238
So we moved to look
into our cousins, the monkeys.

00:06:53.907 --> 00:06:57.601
My colleague, Stephen Suomi,
has been rearing monkeys

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:58.786
in two different ways:

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.711
randomly separated the monkey
from the mother

00:07:01.735 --> 00:07:04.327
and reared her with a nurse

00:07:04.351 --> 00:07:07.310
and surrogate motherhood conditions.

00:07:07.334 --> 00:07:10.005
So these monkeys didn't have
a mother; they had a nurse.

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:14.649
And other monkeys were reared
with their normal, natural mothers.

00:07:14.673 --> 00:07:19.369
And when they were old,
they were completely different animals.

00:07:19.393 --> 00:07:22.486
The monkeys that had a mother
did not care about alcohol,

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.189
they were not sexually aggressive.

00:07:24.213 --> 00:07:27.980
The monkeys that didn't have a mother
were aggressive, were stressed

00:07:28.004 --> 00:07:29.618
and were alcoholics.

00:07:30.302 --> 00:07:35.784
So we looked at their DNA
early after birth, to see:

00:07:35.808 --> 00:07:38.575
Is it possible that the mother is marking?

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:43.957
Is there a signature of the mother
in the DNA of the offspring?

00:07:43.981 --> 00:07:46.233
These are Day-14 monkeys,

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:50.333
and what you see here is the modern way
by which we study epigenetics.

00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:55.020
We can now map those chemical marks,
which we call methylation marks,

00:07:55.044 --> 00:07:58.302
on DNA at a single nucleotide resolution.

00:07:58.326 --> 00:08:00.203
We can map the entire genome.

00:08:00.227 --> 00:08:03.294
We can now compare the monkey
that had a mother or not.

00:08:03.318 --> 00:08:05.272
And here's a visual presentation of this.

00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:10.033
What you see is the genes
that got more methylated are red.

00:08:10.057 --> 00:08:13.071
The genes that got
less methylated are green.

00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:15.579
You can see many genes are changing,

00:08:15.603 --> 00:08:18.317
because not having a mother
is not just one thing --

00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:19.872
it affects the whole way;

00:08:19.896 --> 00:08:23.404
it sends signals about the whole way
your world is going to look

00:08:23.428 --> 00:08:25.187
when you become an adult.

00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:27.632
And you can see the two groups of monkeys

00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:30.376
extremely well-separated from each other.

00:08:31.212 --> 00:08:33.341
How early does this develop?

00:08:33.898 --> 00:08:36.111
These monkeys already
didn't see their mothers,

00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:37.834
so they had a social experience.

00:08:37.858 --> 00:08:42.123
Do we sense our social status,
even at the moment of birth?

00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:47.000
So in this experiment,
we took placentas of monkeys

00:08:47.024 --> 00:08:48.981
that had different social status.

00:08:49.518 --> 00:08:54.892
What's interesting about social rank
is that across all living beings,

00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:57.534
they will structure
themselves by hierarchy.

00:08:58.165 --> 00:09:00.353
Monkey number one is the boss;

00:09:00.377 --> 00:09:02.715
monkey number four is the peon.

00:09:02.739 --> 00:09:05.178
You put four monkeys in a cage,

00:09:05.202 --> 00:09:08.213
there will always be a boss
and always be a peon.

00:09:09.268 --> 00:09:13.116
And what's interesting
is that the monkey number one

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.572
is much healthier than monkey number four.

00:09:16.596 --> 00:09:18.400
And if you put them in a cage,

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:23.121
monkey number one will not eat as much.

00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:24.982
Monkey number four will eat [a lot].

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:30.222
And what you see here
in this methylation mapping,

00:09:30.246 --> 00:09:33.021
a dramatic separation at birth

00:09:33.045 --> 00:09:35.759
of the animals that had
a high social status

00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:38.457
versus the animals
that did not have a high status.

00:09:39.169 --> 00:09:43.400
So we are born already knowing
the social information,

00:09:43.424 --> 00:09:46.477
and that social information
is not bad or good,

00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:47.920
it just prepares us for life,

00:09:47.944 --> 00:09:52.185
because we have to program
our biology differently

00:09:52.209 --> 00:09:55.290
if we are in the high
or the low social status.

00:09:56.146 --> 00:09:58.027
But how can you study this in humans?

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.978
We can't do experiments,
we can't administer adversity to humans.

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:04.595
But God does experiments with humans,

00:10:04.619 --> 00:10:06.907
and it's called natural disasters.

00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:11.191
One of the hardest natural disasters
in Canadian history

00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:13.625
happened in my province of Quebec.

00:10:13.649 --> 00:10:16.052
It's the ice storm of 1998.

00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:19.876
We lost our entire electrical grid
because of an ice storm

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.897
when the temperatures
were, in the dead of winter in Quebec,

00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:24.870
minus 20 to minus 30.

00:10:24.894 --> 00:10:27.426
And there were pregnant
mothers during that time.

00:10:27.902 --> 00:10:33.934
And my colleague Suzanne King
followed the children of these mothers

00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.672
for 15 years.

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:40.631
And what happened was,
that as the stress increased --

00:10:40.655 --> 00:10:43.263
and here we had objective
measures of stress:

00:10:43.287 --> 00:10:47.725
How long were you without power?
Where did you spend your time?

00:10:47.749 --> 00:10:52.752
Was it in your mother-in-law's apartment
or in some posh country home?

00:10:52.776 --> 00:10:55.434
So all of these added up
to a social stress scale,

00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:56.840
and you can ask the question:

00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:59.908
How did the children look?

00:10:59.932 --> 00:11:02.566
And it appears that as stress increases,

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.648
the children develop more autism,

00:11:04.672 --> 00:11:07.211
they develop more metabolic diseases

00:11:07.235 --> 00:11:10.067
and they develop more autoimmune diseases.

00:11:10.607 --> 00:11:13.031
We would map the methylation state,

00:11:13.055 --> 00:11:18.593
and again, you see the green genes
becoming red as stress increases,

00:11:18.617 --> 00:11:22.109
the red genes becoming green
as stress increases,

00:11:22.133 --> 00:11:26.683
an entire rearrangement
of the genome in response to stress.

00:11:29.262 --> 00:11:32.471
So if we can program genes,

00:11:32.495 --> 00:11:36.468
if we are not just the slaves
of the history of our genes,

00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:39.120
that they could be programmed,
can we deprogram them?

00:11:39.913 --> 00:11:44.495
Because epigenetic causes
can cause diseases like cancer,

00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:47.282
metabolic disease

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:49.409
and mental health diseases.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.633
Let's talk about cocaine addiction.

00:11:53.395 --> 00:11:56.451
Cocaine addiction is a terrible situation

00:11:56.475 --> 00:12:00.242
that can lead to death
and to loss of human life.

00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:03.290
We asked the question:

00:12:03.314 --> 00:12:06.553
Can we reprogram the addicted brain

00:12:06.577 --> 00:12:11.501
to make that animal not addicted anymore?

00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:16.477
We used a cocaine addiction model

00:12:16.501 --> 00:12:18.590
that recapitulates what happens in humans.

00:12:18.614 --> 00:12:21.282
In humans, you're in high school,

00:12:21.306 --> 00:12:23.386
some friends suggest you use some cocaine,

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.216
you take cocaine, nothing happens.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.441
Months pass by, something reminds you
of what happened the first time,

00:12:29.465 --> 00:12:31.105
a pusher pushes cocaine,

00:12:31.129 --> 00:12:33.961
and you become addicted
and your life has changed.

00:12:33.985 --> 00:12:35.631
In rats, we do the same thing.

00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:37.230
My colleague, Gal Yadid,

00:12:37.254 --> 00:12:40.254
he trains the animals
to get used to cocaine,

00:12:40.278 --> 00:12:43.406
then for one month, no cocaine.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.106
Then he reminds them of the party
when they saw the cocaine the first time

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.946
by cue, the colors of the cage
when they saw cocaine.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.622
And they go crazy.

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:54.093
They will press the lever to get cocaine

00:12:54.117 --> 00:12:55.376
until they die.

00:12:55.867 --> 00:13:00.310
We first determined that the difference
between these animals

00:13:00.334 --> 00:13:03.035
is that during that time
when nothing happens,

00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:04.831
there's no cocaine around,

00:13:04.855 --> 00:13:06.776
their epigenome is rearranged.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.689
Their genes are re-marked
in a different way,

00:13:09.713 --> 00:13:13.455
and when the cue comes,
their genome is ready

00:13:13.479 --> 00:13:15.768
to develop this addictive phenotype.

00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:23.155
So we treated these animals with drugs
that either increase DNA methylation,

00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:25.403
which was the epigenetic
marker to look at,

00:13:25.427 --> 00:13:28.910
or decrease epigenetic markings.

00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:32.189
And we found that
if we increased methylation,

00:13:32.213 --> 00:13:34.096
these animals go even crazier.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.604
They become more craving for cocaine.

00:13:36.628 --> 00:13:40.054
But if we reduce the DNA methylation,

00:13:40.078 --> 00:13:42.182
the animals are not addicted anymore.

00:13:42.206 --> 00:13:43.825
We have reprogrammed them.

00:13:43.849 --> 00:13:47.155
And a fundamental difference
between an epigenetic drug

00:13:47.179 --> 00:13:48.485
and any other drug

00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:50.681
is that with epigenetic drugs,

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:54.837
we essentially remove
the signs of experience,

00:13:54.861 --> 00:13:56.988
and once they're gone,

00:13:57.012 --> 00:14:00.033
they will not come back
unless you have the same experience.

00:14:00.057 --> 00:14:01.711
The animal now is reprogrammed.

00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:05.956
So when we visited the animals
30 days, 60 days later,

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.899
which is in human terms
many years of life,

00:14:08.923 --> 00:14:14.229
they were still not addicted --
by a single epigenetic treatment.

00:14:16.292 --> 00:14:19.563
So what did we learn about DNA?

00:14:19.587 --> 00:14:22.712
DNA is not just a sequence of letters;

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:24.855
it's not just a script.

00:14:24.879 --> 00:14:27.250
DNA is a dynamic movie.

00:14:28.187 --> 00:14:33.098
Our experiences are being written
into this movie, which is interactive.

00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:36.675
You're, like, watching a movie
of your life, with the DNA,

00:14:36.699 --> 00:14:38.481
with your remote control.

00:14:38.505 --> 00:14:41.894
You can remove an actor and add an actor.

00:14:42.692 --> 00:14:48.587
And so you have, in spite
of the deterministic nature of genetics,

00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:52.300
you have control of the way
your genes look,

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:55.594
and this has a tremendous
optimistic message

00:14:55.618 --> 00:14:59.126
for the ability to now encounter
some of the deadly diseases

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.054
like cancer, mental health,

00:15:02.078 --> 00:15:05.006
with a new approach,

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.564
looking at them as maladaptation.

00:15:07.588 --> 00:15:10.662
And if we can epigenetically intervene,

00:15:10.686 --> 00:15:14.182
[we can] reverse the movie
by removing an actor

00:15:14.206 --> 00:15:17.063
and setting up a new narrative.

00:15:17.848 --> 00:15:20.345
So what I told you today is,

00:15:20.369 --> 00:15:25.461
our DNA is really combined
of two components,

00:15:25.485 --> 00:15:27.310
two layers of information.

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:31.601
One layer of information is old,

00:15:31.625 --> 00:15:35.130
evolved from millions
of years of evolution.

00:15:35.154 --> 00:15:38.330
It is fixed and very hard to change.

00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:43.081
The other layer of information
is the epigenetic layer,

00:15:43.105 --> 00:15:47.000
which is open and dynamic

00:15:47.024 --> 00:15:51.616
and sets up a narrative
that is interactive,

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:58.428
that allows us to control,
to a large extent, our destiny,

00:15:59.515 --> 00:16:02.971
to help the destiny of our children

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:07.150
and to hopefully conquer disease

00:16:07.174 --> 00:16:11.590
and serious health challenges

00:16:11.614 --> 00:16:15.225
that have plagued humankind
for a long time.

00:16:15.249 --> 00:16:18.642
So even though we are determined

00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:20.421
by our genes,

00:16:20.445 --> 00:16:23.512
we have a degree of freedom

00:16:23.536 --> 00:16:27.669
that can set up our life
to a life of responsibility.

00:16:27.693 --> 00:16:28.913
Thank you.

00:16:28.937 --> 00:16:33.892
(Applause)
