00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.160
And so, I have my first slide to talk about

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
the dawning of the universe and what I call

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
the cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
and then following it up and trying to understand it.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
And so one of the questions that I asked you is,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
when you look around, what do you see?

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.160
Well, you see this space that's created by designers

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
and by the work of people, but what you actually see

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
is a lot of material that was already here,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
being reshaped in a certain form.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
And so the question is: how did that material get here?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
It's a question of what's the continuity?

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
So one of the things I look at is,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
how did the universe begin and shape?

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.160
What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials?

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.160
So that's sort of the part, and let me move on then and show you

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
If you look at this picture,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
And everything but -- four of these light objects are stars,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
and you can see them there -- little pluses.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.160
This is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
So there's a couple of thousand galaxies

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
you can see easily with your eye in here.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
And when I look out at particularly this galaxy,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
which looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
an art design college conference going on,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
and intelligent beings there are thinking about, you know,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
what designs they might do, and there might be a few cosmologists

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
trying to understand where the universe itself came from,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
trying to figure out what's going on over here.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
But there's a lot of other galaxies, and some are nearby,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.160
and they're kind of the color of the Sun,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
and some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.160
But one of the questions is -- this should be, to you --

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
how come there are so many galaxies?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
This is only 1,000 galaxies.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
We think there's on the order -- visible to the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
if you had the time to scan it around --

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
about 100 billion galaxies. Right?

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
It's a very large number of galaxies.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
But when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
more galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.160
So the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
what kind of creative process and what kind of design

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
produced the world like that?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
We're going to try and follow it up.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
that it's a time machine, in a certain sense.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
just because that's where we're making observations.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
And the moon is only two seconds away, so if you take a picture of the moon

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
using ordinary light, it's the moon two seconds ago, and who cares.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
Two seconds is like the present.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal, right,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
You'd like to have a little advance warning.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
But you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away. It's a problem.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
You hear about Mars, it's a problem communicating to Mars

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
because it takes light long enough to go there.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
But if you look out to the nearest set of stars,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
to the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
So if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
But you go and look to the center of the galaxy,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.160
it's thousands of years ago.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
If you look at Andromeda, which is the nearest big galaxy,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.160
and it's two million years ago.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
there'd be no evidence of humans at all,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
because we don't think there were humans yet.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
I mean, it just gives you the scale.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
hundreds of millions of years to a billion years.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further --

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.160
there's some things even further,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
and that was what I did in a lot of my work,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
was to develop the techniques -- we could look out back to even earlier

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
And so that's the sort of sequence,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
and so I have a more artistic impression of this.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
and around that are the Hubble -- you know, nearby kind of galaxies,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
and there's a sphere that marks the different times.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
And behind that are some more modern galaxies.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
You see the whole big picture?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
The beginning of time is funny -- it's on the outside, right?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
And then there's a part of the universe we can't see

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
because it's so dense and so hot, light can't escape.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun;

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160
But you can see the edge of the Sun,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
and the universe gets that way, and you can see that.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
which is actually incredibly uniform.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
The universe is almost a perfect sphere,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
but there are these very tiny variations

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
which we show here in great exaggeration.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.160
from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
to these more advanced galaxies, and eventually the solar system, and so forth.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
So it's a big design job,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
but we'll see about how things are going on.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
So the way these measurements were done,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
there's been a set of satellites, and this is where you get to see.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
So there was the COBE satellite, which was launched in 1989,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
and we discovered these variations.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
And then in 2000, the MAP satellite was launched -- the WMAP --

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
and it made somewhat better pictures.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.160
And later this year -- this is the cool stealth version,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.160
the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
and you should look -- the Planck satellite will be launched,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
and it will make very high-resolution maps.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
And that will be the sequence of understanding

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.160
the very beginning of the universe.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.160
And what we saw was, we saw these variations, and then they told us

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
the secrets, both about the structure of space-time,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
and about the contents of the universe,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
and about how the universe started in its original motions.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.160
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.160
expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
then to the Dark Ages, and then the first stars turn on,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.160
and they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
And it's maturing up to the present time.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
And there's some spectacular things.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
And this wastebasket part, that's to represent

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
what the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.160
And so this is a pretty weird model, right?

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
What kind of evidence do we have for that?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
So let me show you some of nature's patterns

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.160
that are the result of this.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.160
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.160
and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.160
It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.160
So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
So there's a dot on here for every galaxy.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
They go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
identify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
estimate how far away they are, and plot them up.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
And just put radially they're going out that way.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
And you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
but there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
Now I'm going to show you this in 3D.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.160
What happens is, you take pictures

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
as the Earth rotates, you get a fan across the sky.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.160
or because there are no telescopes available to do it.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.160
So the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.160
Remember, every spot on here is a galaxy, and you see the galaxies,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.160
you know, sort of in our neighborhood, and you sort of see the structure.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
And you see this thing we call the Great Wall,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
and you see the complicated structure, and you see these voids.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together, right.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
So there's an interesting pattern,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
We only have a million galaxies, right?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
So we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.160
but, what's going on?

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
There's another survey which is very similar to this,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.160
called the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.160
And every time there's a galaxy -- at its location there's a galaxy --

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
and if we know anything about the galaxy, which we do,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
because there's a redshift measurement and everything,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
you put in the type of galaxy and the color,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
so this is the real representation.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.160
And when you're in the middle of the galaxies

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
it's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.160
It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
it's hard to see the pattern of this.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.160
And you'll see, first, the structure of the survey,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.160
that we see out there.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
So again, you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
But you can see the voids,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.160
you can see the complicated structure, and you say,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
well, how did this happen?

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
Suppose you're the cosmic designer.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that?

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.160
It's not just throwing them out at random.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
There's a more complicated process going on here.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
How are you going to end up doing that?

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
And so now we're in for some serious play.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
That is, we have to seriously play God,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
not just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
So if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that?

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.160
What's the kind of technique?

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
What's the kind of thing you're going to do?

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.160
So I'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.160
of what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
some of the play principles and some of the design principles that,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
you know, humans have labored so hard to pick up,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.160
And that is, you start out with very simple ingredients

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.160
and some simple rules,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160
but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.160
And then you put in some randomness,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
some fluctuations and some randomness,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
and realize a whole bunch of different representations.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
So what I'm going to do is show you

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
the distribution of matter as a function of scales.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
We're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.160
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
It's called dark matter.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160
That is matter that doesn't interact with light

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
the typical way that ordinary matter does,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.160
the way the light's shining on me or on the stage.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
It's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
we're going to make it white. OK?

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
It should be called invisible matter,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
but the dark matter we've made visible.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
And the stuff that is in the yellow color,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.160
that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
So I'll show you the next movie.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160
So this -- we're going to zoom in.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
We're going to zoom in and zoom in.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.160
And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
And when a number of filaments come together in a knot,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160
that makes a supercluster of galaxies.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
This one we're zooming in on

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160
So we live in the boonies.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
We don't live in the center of the solar system,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.160
we don't live in the center of the galaxy

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
So we're zooming in.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
This is a region which probably has more than 100,000,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
on the order of a million galaxies in that region.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160
We're going to keep zooming in. OK.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
And so I forgot to tell you the scale.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
A parsec is 3.26 light years.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
So a gigaparsec is three billion light years -- that's the scale.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
That's the distance between us and Andromeda, right?

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160
These little specks that you're seeing in here, they're galaxies.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.160
Now we're going to zoom back out,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160
and you can see this structure that,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
when we get very far out, looks very regular,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
So they're simple building blocks.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160
There's a very simple fluid to begin with.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.160
It's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.160
it's got photons and it's got neutrinos,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
which don't play much role in the later part of the universe.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.160
And it's just a simple fluid and it, over time,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.160
develops into this complicated structure.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.160
And so you know when you first saw this picture,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
it didn't mean quite so much to you.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.160
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.160
and you're seeing billions of galaxies, right, and nodes,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.160
but you realize they're not even the main structure.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.160
There's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
that's out there that's actually holding it all together.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.160
So let's fly through it, and you can see how much harder it is

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.160
when you're in the middle of something to figure this out.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160
So here's that same end result.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
You see a filament,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.160
you see the light is the invisible matter,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.160
and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
And we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
and you get a large cluster of galaxies.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.160
And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160
and you can see what it looks like.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.160
And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right?

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
It's only when you look at it at a very large scale,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
and explore it and so forth, you realize it's a very intricate,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
complicated kind of a design, right?

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.160
And it's grown up in some kind of way.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
So the question is,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.160
how hard would it be to assemble this, right?

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
How big a contractor team would you need

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
to put this universe together, right?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
That's the issue, right?

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
And so here we are.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
You see how the filament --

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
you see how several filaments are coming together,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.160
therefore making this supercluster of galaxies.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.160
And you have to understand, this is not how it would actually look

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
if you -- first, you can't travel this fast,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.160
everything would be distorted,

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:15.160
but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.160
This is how, if you took billions of years to go around,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160
it might look to you, right?

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
And if you could see invisible matter, too.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:28.160
And so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160
in a very simple way?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.160
We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.160
everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.160
plus our other instruments,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.160
was once in a region that was smaller than an atom.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.160
It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
but expanding at a tremendous rate.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
And those fluctuations

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
were stretched to astronomical sizes, and those fluctuations

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.160
eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.160
This simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
in order to make just this simple visible one.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160
So I'm going to show you one

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.160
that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
So you start out with teeny fluctuations

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160
when the universe was at this point,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160
now four times smaller, and so forth.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.160
And you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.160
And this is a simple one, because it doesn't have the ordinary matter

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
and it just has the dark matter in it.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.160
And you see how the dark matter lumps up,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
and the ordinary matter just trails along behind.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
So there it is.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
At the beginning it's very uniform.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
The fluctuations are a part in 100,000.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
There are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.160
and then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.160
This is light over density, pulls the material around in.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
That pulls in more material and pulls in more material.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.160
But the distances on the universe are so large

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.160
and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.160
And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
in terms of its expansion.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.160
And at that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160
its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.160
So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.160
and then only things that have started forming already

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.160
are going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:30.160
So we're able to do the simulation, but this is two days on a desktop.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
We need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:42.160
So we have an idea of how to play seriously, creating the universe

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.160
by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.160
and we create everything we can see in any direction, right,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.160
from almost nothing -- that is, something extremely tiny,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:02.160
extremely small -- and it is almost perfect,

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.160
except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in 100,000 level,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160
which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.160
that is, galaxies and stars and so forth.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.160
So we have a model, and we can calculate it, and we can use it

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160
to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.160
And that design is sort of way beyond

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.160
what our original imagination ever was.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.160
So this is what we started with 15 years ago,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.160
with the Cosmic Background Explorer -- made the map on the upper right,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.160
which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160
and actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.160
Since then we've had WMAP,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
which just gives us higher angular resolution.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.160
We see the same large-scale structure,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.160
but we see additional small-scale structure.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.160
And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.160
and mapped the Earth, what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.160
You can see, well, you can, kind of pick out

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.160
all the major continents, but that's about it.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.160
But what we're hoping when we get to Planck, we'll have resolution

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.160
about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.160
where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.160
And you can also tell, because of the sharp edges

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.160
and the way things fit together, there are some non-linear processes.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.160
Geology has these effects,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
which is moving the plates around and so forth.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
You can see that just from the map alone.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.160
We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.160
we can see whether there are any non-linear effects

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.160
that are starting to move, to modify, and are giving us a hint about how

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.160
space-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
So that's where we are today,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.160
and that's what I wanted to give you 
a flavor of.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.160
Give you a different view about what the design

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.160
and what everything else looks like.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.160
Thank you.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160
(Applause)
