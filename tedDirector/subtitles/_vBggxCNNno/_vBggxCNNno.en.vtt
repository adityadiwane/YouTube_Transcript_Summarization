00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:15.580
So whenever I visit a school
and talk to students,

00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:17.747
I always ask them the same thing:

00:00:18.754 --> 00:00:20.188
Why do you Google?

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:24.021
Why is Google the search engine
of choice for you?

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.407
Strangely enough, I always get
the same three answers.

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:29.470
One, "Because it works,"

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:32.400
which is a great answer;
that's why I Google, too.

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:34.457
Two, somebody will say,

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:37.121
"I really don't know of any alternatives."

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:40.836
It's not an equally great answer
and my reply to that is usually,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.781
"Try to Google the word 'search engine,'

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:45.207
you may find a couple
of interesting alternatives."

00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:47.326
And last but not least, thirdly,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.660
inevitably, one student will raise
her or his hand and say,

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:55.867
"With Google, I'm certain to always get
the best, unbiased search result."

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:03.663
Certain to always get the best,
unbiased search result.

00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:07.481
Now, as a man of the humanities,

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:09.686
albeit a digital humanities man,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.448
that just makes my skin curl,

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:16.358
even if I, too, realize that that trust,
that idea of the unbiased search result

00:01:16.382 --> 00:01:20.237
is a cornerstone in our collective love
for and appreciation of Google.

00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:24.916
I will show you why that, philosophically,
is almost an impossibility.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.194
But let me first elaborate,
just a little bit, on a basic principle

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:31.331
behind each search query
that we sometimes seem to forget.

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:33.931
So whenever you set out
to Google something,

00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:37.882
start by asking yourself this:
"Am I looking for an isolated fact?"

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:41.495
What is the capital of France?

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:43.944
What are the building blocks
of a water molecule?

00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:46.309
Great -- Google away.

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:49.453
There's not a group of scientists
who are this close to proving

00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:51.474
that it's actually London and H30.

00:01:51.498 --> 00:01:53.869
You don't see a big conspiracy
among those things.

00:01:53.893 --> 00:01:55.426
We agree, on a global scale,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.175
what the answers are
to these isolated facts.

00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:03.501
But if you complicate your question
just a little bit and ask something like,

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:06.208
"Why is there
an Israeli-Palestine conflict?"

00:02:06.978 --> 00:02:09.618
You're not exactly looking
for a singular fact anymore,

00:02:09.642 --> 00:02:11.475
you're looking for knowledge,

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.077
which is something way more
complicated and delicate.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.149
And to get to knowledge,

00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:19.204
you have to bring 10 or 20
or 100 facts to the table

00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:22.204
and acknowledge them and say,
"Yes, these are all true."

00:02:22.228 --> 00:02:23.902
But because of who I am,

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:26.196
young or old, black or white,
gay or straight,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.831
I will value them differently.

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:29.543
And I will say, "Yes, this is true,

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:31.681
but this is more important
to me than that."

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:33.695
And this is where it becomes interesting,

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.865
because this is where we become human.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.885
This is when we start
to argue, to form society.

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.266
And to really get somewhere,
we need to filter all our facts here,

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.846
through friends and neighbors
and parents and children

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.902
and coworkers and newspapers
and magazines,

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:50.006
to finally be grounded in real knowledge,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.077
which is something that a search engine
is a poor help to achieve.

00:02:55.284 --> 00:03:01.612
So, I promised you an example
just to show you why it's so hard

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:05.040
to get to the point of true, clean,
objective knowledge --

00:03:05.064 --> 00:03:06.532
as food for thought.

00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:10.449
I will conduct a couple of simple
queries, search queries.

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:14.513
We'll start with "Michelle Obama,"

00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:16.341
the First Lady of the United States.

00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:18.094
And we'll click for pictures.

00:03:19.007 --> 00:03:21.279
It works really well, as you can see.

00:03:21.303 --> 00:03:24.331
It's a perfect search
result, more or less.

00:03:24.355 --> 00:03:27.105
It's just her in the picture,
not even the President.

00:03:27.664 --> 00:03:28.977
How does this work?

00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:31.209
Quite simple.

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.448
Google uses a lot of smartness
to achieve this, but quite simply,

00:03:34.472 --> 00:03:36.532
they look at two things
more than anything.

00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:41.712
First, what does it say in the caption
under the picture on each website?

00:03:41.736 --> 00:03:43.951
Does it say "Michelle Obama"
under the picture?

00:03:43.975 --> 00:03:46.331
Pretty good indication
it's actually her on there.

00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:48.741
Second, Google looks at the picture file,

00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:51.797
the name of the file as such
uploaded to the website.

00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:54.490
Again, is it called "MichelleObama.jpeg"?

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:57.761
Pretty good indication it's not
Clint Eastwood in the picture.

00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:02.050
So, you've got those two and you get
a search result like this -- almost.

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:08.677
Now, in 2009, Michelle Obama
was the victim of a racist campaign,

00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:12.716
where people set out to insult her
through her search results.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.132
There was a picture distributed
widely over the Internet

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:18.800
where her face was distorted
to look like a monkey.

00:04:18.824 --> 00:04:21.993
And that picture was published all over.

00:04:22.017 --> 00:04:25.778
And people published it
very, very purposefully,

00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:27.773
to get it up there in the search results.

00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:30.752
They made sure to write
"Michelle Obama" in the caption

00:04:30.776 --> 00:04:34.953
and they made sure to upload the picture
as "MichelleObama.jpeg," or the like.

00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:37.344
You get why -- to manipulate
the search result.

00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:38.663
And it worked, too.

00:04:38.687 --> 00:04:41.407
So when you picture-Googled
for "Michelle Obama" in 2009,

00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:44.818
that distorted monkey picture
showed up among the first results.

00:04:44.842 --> 00:04:48.408
Now, the results are self-cleansing,

00:04:48.432 --> 00:04:50.185
and that's sort of the beauty of it,

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:53.612
because Google measures relevance
every hour, every day.

00:04:53.636 --> 00:04:56.350
However, Google didn't settle
for that this time,

00:04:56.374 --> 00:04:59.498
they just thought, "That's racist
and it's a bad search result

00:04:59.522 --> 00:05:02.657
and we're going to go back
and clean that up manually.

00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:05.613
We are going to write
some code and fix it,"

00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:06.884
which they did.

00:05:07.454 --> 00:05:11.196
And I don't think anyone in this room
thinks that was a bad idea.

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:12.953
Me neither.

00:05:14.802 --> 00:05:17.834
But then, a couple of years go by,

00:05:17.858 --> 00:05:20.842
and the world's most-Googled Anders,

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:23.145
Anders Behring Breivik,

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.875
did what he did.

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:26.900
This is July 22 in 2011,

00:05:26.924 --> 00:05:29.573
and a terrible day in Norwegian history.

00:05:29.597 --> 00:05:33.384
This man, a terrorist, blew up
a couple of government buildings

00:05:33.408 --> 00:05:36.291
walking distance from where we are
right now in Oslo, Norway

00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:38.366
and then he traveled
to the island of UtÃ¸ya

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.613
and shot and killed a group of kids.

00:05:41.113 --> 00:05:42.841
Almost 80 people died that day.

00:05:44.397 --> 00:05:48.956
And a lot of people would describe
this act of terror as two steps,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.391
that he did two things: he blew up
the buildings and he shot those kids.

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:53.580
It's not true.

00:05:54.326 --> 00:05:56.469
It was three steps.

00:05:56.493 --> 00:05:58.707
He blew up those buildings,
he shot those kids,

00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:02.375
and he sat down and waited
for the world to Google him.

00:06:03.227 --> 00:06:05.854
And he prepared
all three steps equally well.

00:06:06.544 --> 00:06:09.334
And if there was somebody
who immediately understood this,

00:06:09.358 --> 00:06:10.882
it was a Swedish web developer,

00:06:10.906 --> 00:06:14.529
a search engine optimization expert
in Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist.

00:06:14.553 --> 00:06:16.141
He's also a very political guy

00:06:16.165 --> 00:06:19.441
and he was right out there
in social media, on his blog and Facebook.

00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:20.671
And he told everybody,

00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:23.150
"If there's something that
this guy wants right now,

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.633
it's to control the image of himself.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.720
Let's see if we can distort that.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.467
Let's see if we, in the civilized world,
can protest against what he did

00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:36.808
through insulting him
in his search results."

00:06:36.832 --> 00:06:38.019
And how?

00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:40.853
He told all of his readers the following,

00:06:40.877 --> 00:06:42.741
"Go out there on the Internet,

00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:45.660
find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --

00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:48.882
find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --

00:06:48.906 --> 00:06:52.376
publish them in your feeds,
on your websites, on your blogs.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.321
Make sure to write the terrorist's
name in the caption,

00:06:55.345 --> 00:06:59.832
make sure to name
the picture file "Breivik.jpeg."

00:06:59.856 --> 00:07:03.657
Let's teach Google that that's
the face of the terrorist."

00:07:05.552 --> 00:07:06.830
And it worked.

00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:10.751
Two years after that campaign
against Michelle Obama,

00:07:10.775 --> 00:07:14.041
this manipulation campaign
against Anders Behring Breivik worked.

00:07:14.065 --> 00:07:18.527
If you picture-Googled for him weeks after
the July 22 events from Sweden,

00:07:18.551 --> 00:07:22.878
you'd see that picture of dog poop
high up in the search results,

00:07:22.902 --> 00:07:24.346
as a little protest.

00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:29.557
Strangely enough, Google
didn't intervene this time.

00:07:30.494 --> 00:07:34.766
They did not step in and manually
clean those search results up.

00:07:35.964 --> 00:07:37.680
So the million-dollar question,

00:07:37.704 --> 00:07:41.072
is there anything different
between these two happenings here?

00:07:41.096 --> 00:07:44.289
Is there anything different between
what happened to Michelle Obama

00:07:44.313 --> 00:07:46.378
and what happened
to Anders Behring Breivik?

00:07:46.402 --> 00:07:47.686
Of course not.

00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:50.332
It's the exact same thing,

00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:53.220
yet Google intervened in one case
and not in the other.

00:07:53.244 --> 00:07:54.497
Why?

00:07:55.283 --> 00:07:58.583
Because Michelle Obama
is an honorable person, that's why,

00:07:58.607 --> 00:08:01.523
and Anders Behring Breivik
is a despicable person.

00:08:02.142 --> 00:08:03.677
See what happens there?

00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:06.956
An evaluation of a person takes place

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.766
and there's only one
power-player in the world

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.270
with the authority to say who's who.

00:08:13.882 --> 00:08:15.623
"We like you, we dislike you.

00:08:15.647 --> 00:08:17.686
We believe in you,
we don't believe in you.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.257
You're right, you're wrong.
You're true, you're false.

00:08:20.281 --> 00:08:22.086
You're Obama, and you're Breivik."

00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:24.791
That's power if I ever saw it.

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:30.858
So I'm asking you to remember
that behind every algorithm

00:08:30.882 --> 00:08:32.659
is always a person,

00:08:32.683 --> 00:08:35.178
a person with a set of personal beliefs

00:08:35.202 --> 00:08:37.727
that no code can ever
completely eradicate.

00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:40.185
And my message goes
out not only to Google,

00:08:40.209 --> 00:08:43.019
but to all believers in the faith
of code around the world.

00:08:43.043 --> 00:08:46.019
You need to identify
your own personal bias.

00:08:46.043 --> 00:08:48.056
You need to understand that you are human

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.571
and take responsibility accordingly.

00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:54.829
And I say this because I believe
we've reached a point in time

00:08:54.853 --> 00:08:56.408
when it's absolutely imperative

00:08:56.432 --> 00:08:59.649
that we tie those bonds
together again, tighter:

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:02.041
the humanities and the technology.

00:09:02.483 --> 00:09:04.288
Tighter than ever.

00:09:04.312 --> 00:09:07.651
And, if nothing else, to remind us
that that wonderfully seductive idea

00:09:07.675 --> 00:09:10.343
of the unbiased, clean search result

00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:13.134
is, and is likely to remain, a myth.

00:09:13.984 --> 00:09:15.143
Thank you for your time.

00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:17.599
(Applause)
