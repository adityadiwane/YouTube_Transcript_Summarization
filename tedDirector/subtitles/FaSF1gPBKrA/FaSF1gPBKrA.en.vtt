00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Thank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
I cannot believe I'm here.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
I have not slept in weeks.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
in anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous --

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
and I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized. (Laughter)

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.160
So, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
called 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
about how we all might join in and do similar things.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.160
Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
I was trying to finish my first book,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
I was wandering around dazed every day

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
So I would walk around in a daze during the day.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:02.160
I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day, but I had flexible hours.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
there are a lot of writers --

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
it's like a very high per capita ratio

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
of writers to normal people.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.160
Meanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
My mom was a teacher, my sister became a teacher

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.160
and after college so many of my friends went into teaching.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
and how inspiring they were,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
and they were really sort of the most hard-working

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
and constantly inspiring people I knew.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
But I knew so many of the things they were up against,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
so many of the struggles they were dealing with.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
And one of them was that so many of my friends

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
that were teaching in city schools were having trouble

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
with their students keeping up at grade level,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
in their reading and writing in particular.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
Now, so many of these students had come from households

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
where English isn't spoken in the home,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
where a lot of them have different special needs,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
learning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
which sometimes and very often are under-funded.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
And so they would talk to me about this and say,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
"You know, what we really need is just more people,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
more bodies, more one-on-one attention,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
more hours, more expertise from people

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.160
that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one."

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
Now, I would say, "Well, why don't you just work with them one-on-one?"

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.160
And they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.160
This can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
How can we possibly give each student

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.160
even one hour a week of one-on-one attention?"

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160
You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
And so we started talking about this.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
And at the same time,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
I thought about this massive group of people I knew:

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.160
writers, editors, journalists, graduate students,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
assistant professors, you name it.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
and an interest in the English word --

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.160
I hope to have an interest in the English language,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
but I'm not speaking it well right now. (Laughter)

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.160
I'm trying. That clock has got me.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.160
But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
in terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
And so they had, you know, their time

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
and their interest, but at the same time

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
there wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
to bring these two communities together.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160
So when I moved back to San Francisco, we rented this building.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.160
And the idea was to put McSweeney's --

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
McSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
and a few other magazines --

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
we were going to move it into an office for the first time.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
We were going to move it into an office,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
So we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody --

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
why don't we just open up

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
the front of the building for students to come in there after school,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
get extra help on their written homework,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.160
so you have basically no border between these two communities?"

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.160
So the idea was that we would be

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
working on whatever we're working on,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
You give those hours in the afternoon

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
to the students in the neighborhood.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
So, we had this place, we rented it,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
the landlord was all for it. We did this mural,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.160
that's a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire history

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
of the printed word, in mural form -- it takes a long time

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.160
to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
So we rented this space.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
And everything was great except the landlord said,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
"Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
You've gotta sell something.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
You can't just have a tutoring center."

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
So we thought, "Ha ha! Really!"

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
but we did all the necessary research.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.160
whitewashed beams and it had the look --

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
while we were renovating this place, somebody said,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
"You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship."

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.160
And we looked around and somebody else said,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
"Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer." (Laughter)

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.160
And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
and we said, "There's a point to that.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.160
Let's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.160
You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
we made it look sort of pirate supply-like.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Here you see planks sold by the foot

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
and we have supplies to combat scurvy.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.160
We have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
Up at the top, you see the eyepatch display,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
which is the black column there for everyday use

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
for your eyepatch, and then you have the pastel

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
and other colors for stepping out at night --

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.160
special occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.160
So we opened this place. And this is a vat

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
that we fill with treasures that students dig in.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
These are some signs that we have all over the place:

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
"Practical Joking with Pirates."

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
While you're reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counter

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.160
and eight mop heads drop on your head.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.160
That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.160
It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
which is just a saltwater tank with three seats,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.160
and then right behind it we set up this space,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
which was the tutoring center.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160
So right there is the tutoring center,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
The kids would come in --

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
or we thought they would come in. I should back up.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.160
We set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and months

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
renovating this place.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
We had tables, chairs, computers, everything.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.160
I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.160
and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:33.160
Anyway, we bought 'em, we set everything up and then we waited.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
It was started with about 12 of my friends,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.160
people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160
And we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
and it just said, "Free Tutoring for Your English-Related

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
and Writing-Related Needs -- Just Come In, It's All Free."

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
And we thought, "Oh, they're going to storm the gates,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
they're gonna love it." And they didn't.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
And so we waited, we sat at the tables, we waited and waited.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
And everybody was becoming very discouraged

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160
because it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.160
And then somebody alerted us to the fact

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
that maybe there was a trust gap,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:16.160
because we were operating behind a pirate supply store. (Laughter)

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
We never put it together, you know?

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:29.160
And so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
a longtime San Francisco educator --

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
she was teaching in Mexico City,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
she had all the experience necessary,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
knew everything about education,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood --

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
She took over as executive director.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
Immediately, she made the inroads with the teachers

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.160
and the parents and the students and everything,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
and so suddenly it was actually full every day.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
And what we were trying to offer every day

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
was one-on-one attention.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
You know, it's been proven

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
a student can get one grade level higher.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
They come there, many times their parents --

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
you can't see it, but there's a church pew

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160
that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there --

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
So that was the basis of it,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
was one-on-one attention.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
And we found ourselves full every day with kids.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.160
If you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m.,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
2:30 p.m., you will get run over, often,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
by the kids and their big backpacks, or whatever, actually running to this space,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.160
which is very strange, because it's school, in a way.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.160
But there was something psychological happening there

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
that was just a little bit different.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
And the other thing was, there was no stigma.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
Kids weren't going into the "Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help,"

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
or something like that. It was 826 Valencia.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.160
First of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.160
And then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
And so our interns were actually working

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
at the same tables very often,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
and shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
And so it became a tutoring center --

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
publishing center, is what we called it --

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
and a writing center.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
They go in, and they might be working with a high school student

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
actually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids, too.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
So there's no stigma.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
They're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
These adults, they're working in their field.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
They can lean over, ask a question of one of these adults

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
and it all sort of feeds on each other.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
There's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
especially for the adults working at McSweeney's

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.160
who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
was that there was just the one bathroom. (Laughter)

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
But you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention --

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
they go home, they're finished. They don't stall.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160
They don't do their homework in front of the TV.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
They're allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.160
enjoy other hobbies, get outside, play.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
And that makes a happy family.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.160
A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
So the key to it all is homework! (Laughter) (Applause)

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.160
There you have it, you know -- one-on-one attention.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160
So we started off with about 12 volunteers,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
and then we had about 50,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
and then a couple hundred.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.160
And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
The key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
next to one student, concentrated attention,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
shining this beam of light on their work,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
on their thoughts and their self-expression,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
is going to be absolutely transformative,

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
because so many of the students have not had that ever before.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.160
So we said, "Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
it doesn't matter. That's going to be enough."

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
So that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
Then we said, "Well, what are we

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
going to do with the space during the day,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?"

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
So we started bringing in classes during the day.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
So every day, there's a field trip where they together create a book --

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
you can see it being typed up above.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.160
This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
You just point a camera at a class,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
and it always looks like this.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.160
So this is one of the books that they do.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
Notice the title of the book,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.160
"The Book That Was Never Checked Out: Titanic."

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:34.160
And the first line of that book is, "Once there was a book named Cindy

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
that was about the Titanic."

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
So, meanwhile, there's an adult in the back typing this up,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
taking it completely seriously, which blows their mind.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
So then we still had more tutors to use.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.160
This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
The teachers that we work with --

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
We went in there thinking,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.160
"We're ultimately, completely malleable. You're going to tell us.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
The neighborhood's going to tell us, the parents are going to tell us.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
The teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful."

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
So then they said, "Why don't you come into the schools?

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
necessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
or aren't close enough?" So then we started saying,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160
"Well, we've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
"I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.160
We're working on our college essays. Send them in."

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
So we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
The teacher tells them what to do,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
how to do it, what their training is, what their project is so far.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.160
They work under the teacher's guide,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
and it's all in one big room.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
And that's actually the brunt of what we do is,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
people going straight from their workplace, straight from home,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
straight into the classroom and

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
working directly with the students.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.160
So then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160
Then another school said, "Well, what if we

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?"

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
So this is the Everett Middle School Writers' Room,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
where we decorated it in buccaneer style.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
It's right off the library. And there we serve

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
all 529 kids in this middle school.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.160
This is their newspaper, the "Straight-Up News,"

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.160
that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.160
in both languages -- English and Spanish.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.160
So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
"Hey, why don't you assign a book with high school students?

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.160
I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world."

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.160
which is a school that we had worked with on some other things,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
and we gave that assignment to the students.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
And we said, "Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
She's going to publish them in a book.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
and throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it."

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
So these kids worked harder

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.160
than they've ever worked on anything in their lives,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.160
because there was that outside audience,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160
there was Isabel Allende on the other end.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.160
I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
and so this worked out incredibly well.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
We had a big party at the end.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
"I Might Get Somewhere."

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.160
And this became an ongoing thing. More and more books.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
Now we're sort of addicted to the book thing.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
The kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
if they know it's going to be permanent,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
know it's going to be on a shelf,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
know that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
that we've honored their words, honored their thoughts

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
with hundreds of hours of five drafts, six drafts --

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
all this attention that we give to their thoughts.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.160
And once they achieve that level, once they've written at that level,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
they can never go back.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
It's absolutely transformative.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
And so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
We sell all the student books.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
Where else would you put them, right?

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
So we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
with the stores. The store, actually --

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.160
even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.160
So it was paying the rent.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing --

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
I don't know, I don't want to judge.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
But people would come in --

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
and this was before the pirate movies and everything!

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.160
It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160
but it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160
There's the ocean maps you can see on the left.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.160
And it became a gateway to the community.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
People would come in and say, "What the --?

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.160
What is this?" I don't want to swear on the web. (Laughter)

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
Is that a rule? I don't know.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.160
They would say, "What is this?"

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.160
And people would come in and learn more about it.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.160
And then right beyond -- there's usually a little chain there --

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.160
right beyond, they would see the kids being tutored.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160
This is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
and they might be more likely to buy some lard,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
or millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
or hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160
So the store actually did really well.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
But it brought in so many people --

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.160
teachers, donors, volunteers, everybody --

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.160
because it was street level. It was open to the public.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.160
It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.160
of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160
that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.160
So, it became this sort of weird, happy accident.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.160
So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
"Well, why don't we have a place like that here?"

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
And a lot of them had been former educators

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
or would-be educators, so they combined

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
with a lot of local designers, local writers,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
and they just took the idea independently

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
and they did their own thing.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160
They didn't want to sell pirate supplies.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.160
They didn't think that that was going to work there.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.160
So, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.160
they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160
This is Sam Potts' great design that did this.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.160
And this was to make it look sort of like one of those

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
keysmith's shops that has to have every service

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.160
they've ever offered, you know, all over there.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.160
So they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costco

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.160
for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.160
These are all handmade.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.160
These are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.160
All the packaging is done by Sam Potts.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160
So then you have the villain containment unit,

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.160
where kids put their parents. You have the office.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.160
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there,

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.160
it goes up an electric lift

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.160
and then the guy behind the counter tells you

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.160
that you have to recite the vow of heroism,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.160
which you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.160
Personally, I think it's a problem.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:30.160
These are some of the products. These are all handmade.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.160
This is a secret identity kit.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.160
If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.160
one American female marketing executive

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
from Hoboken, New Jersey. It's a full dossier

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.160
on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.160
So, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.160
and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.160
and then we turn on three hydraulic fans

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.160
from every side and then you can see the cape in action.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.160
There's nothing worse than, you know,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.160
getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.160
So then, the secret door --

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.160
this is one of the shelves you don't see

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.160
when you walk in, but it slowly opens.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.160
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.160
It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back. (Applause)

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.160
So you can see the full effect!

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.160
But this is -- I just want to emphasize --

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.160
locally funded, locally built.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.160
All the designers, all of the builders,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.160
everybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.160
I just came and visited and said, "Yes, you guys are doing great,"

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.160
or whatever. That was it. You can see the time

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.160
in all five boroughs of New York in the back. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.160
So this is the space during tutoring hours.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.160
It's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.160
complete devotion to the students' work

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.160
and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.160
of creativity and ideas.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.160
And this switch is flicked in their heads

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.160
when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right?

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.160
So it's school, but it's not school.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.160
It's clearly not school, even though

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.160
they're working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables, pencils and papers, whatever.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.160
This is one of the students, Khaled Hamdan.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.160
You can read this quote.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.160
Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.160
Came in. Got this concentrated attention.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.160
And he couldn't escape it.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.160
So, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early --

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.160
got really addicted to finishing his homework early.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.160
It's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.160
and to have it checked, and to know he's going to achieve

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.160
the next thing and be prepared for school the next day.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.160
So he got hooked on that, and then he started doing other things.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.160
He's now been published in five books.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.160
He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.160
called "Super-Has-Beens."

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.160
He wrote a series on "Penguin Balboa,"

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.160
which is a fighting -- a boxing -- penguin.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.160
And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.160
at a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.160
He's evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.160
There's four family members that come in every day.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.160
So, I'll go through really quickly.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.160
This is L.A., The Echo Park Time Travel Mart:

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.160
"Whenever You Are, We're Already Then." (Laughter)

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.160
This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.160
So you see everything: it's exactly as a 7-Eleven would be.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.160
Leeches. Mammoth chunks. They even have their own Slurpee machine:

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.160
"Out of Order. Come Back Yesterday." (Laughter) (Applause)

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.160
Anyway. So I'm going to jump ahead.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.160
These are spaces that are only affiliated with us,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.160
doing this same thing: Word St. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts;

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.160
Ink Spot in Cincinnati; Youth Speaks, San Francisco, California,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.160
which inspired us; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis;

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.160
Austin Bat Cave in Austin;

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.160
Fighting Words in Dublin, Ireland, started by Roddy Doyle,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.160
this will be open in April.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.160
Now I'm going to the TED Wish -- is that okay?

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.160
All right, I've got a minute. So, the TED Wish:

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.160
I wish that you -- you personally and every creative individual

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.160
and organization you know -- will find a way

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.160
to directly engage with a public school in your area

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.160
and that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved,

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.160
so that within a year we have a thousand examples --

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.160
a thousand! -- of transformative partnerships.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.160
Profound leaps forward!

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.160
And these can be things that maybe you're already doing.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.160
I know that so many people in this room

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.160
are already doing really interesting things.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.160
I know that for a fact. So, tell us these stories and inspire others on the website.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.160
We created a website.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.160
I'm going to switch to "we," and not "I," hope:

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.160
We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.160
a new era of participation in our public schools.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.160
We hope that you will take the lead

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.160
in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.160
with that of innovative educators in your community.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.160
Always let the teachers lead the way.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.160
They will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.160
There are a million ways.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160
You can walk up to your local school

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.160
and consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.160
So, this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco,

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.160
they did this phenomenal job.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.160
This website is already up, it's already got a bunch of stories,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.160
a lot of ideas. It's called "Once Upon a School,"

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.160
which is a great title, I think.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.160
This site will document every story, every project that comes

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.160
out of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.160
you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.160
and then you add your own projects once you get started.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.160
Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So, visit the site.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.160
If you have any questions, you can ask this guy,

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.160
who's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.160
You email him, he'll answer any question you possibly want.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.160
And he'll get you inspired and get you going

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.160
and guide you through the process so that you can affect change.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160
And it can be fun! That's the point of this talk --

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:40.160
it needn't be sterile. It needn't be bureaucratically untenable.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.160
You can do and use the skills that you have.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.160
The schools need you. The teachers need you.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.160
Students and parents need you. They need your actual person:

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.160
your physical personhood and your open minds

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.160
and open ears and boundless compassion,

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.160
sitting next to them, listening and nodding

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.160
and asking questions for hours at a time.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.160
Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are:

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.160
how smart and how much they have to say.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.160
You can tell them. You can shine that light on them,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.160
one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.160
Thank you so much.
