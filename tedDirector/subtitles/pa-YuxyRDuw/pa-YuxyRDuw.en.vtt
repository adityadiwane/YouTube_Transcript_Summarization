00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.111
This is Charley Williams.

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:17.387
He was 94 when this photograph was taken.

00:00:17.387 --> 00:00:20.444
In the 1930s, Roosevelt put

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:22.424
thousands and thousands of Americans back to work

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:24.950
by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.365
but he also did something interesting,

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:28.677
which was to hire a few hundred writers

00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:32.638
to scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans.

00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:34.799
Charley Williams, a poor sharecropper,

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:37.461
wouldn't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview,

00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:39.889
but Charley had actually been a slave

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:42.447
until he was 22 years old.

00:00:42.447 --> 00:00:44.761
And the stories that were captured of his life

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.540
make up one of the crown jewels

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.865
of histories, of human-lived experiences

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:53.140
filled with ex-slaves.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.240
Anna Deavere Smith famously said that

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.728
there's a literature inside of each of us,

00:00:57.728 --> 00:00:59.991
and three generations later, I was part of a project

00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:01.552
called StoryCorps,

00:01:01.552 --> 00:01:03.544
which set out to capture

00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:05.569
the stories of ordinary Americans

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:08.466
by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces.

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.696
The idea is very, very simple.

00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:12.567
You go into these booths, you interview your grandmother

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:14.855
or relative, you leave with a copy of the interview

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:17.642
and an interview goes into the Library of Congress.

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:21.000
It's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.272
one conversation at a time.

00:01:23.272 --> 00:01:25.746
And the question is, who do you want to remember --

00:01:25.746 --> 00:01:28.818
if you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother?

00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:31.190
What's interesting, in conversations with the founder, Dave Isay,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.338
we always actually talked about this

00:01:32.338 --> 00:01:34.588
as a little bit of a subversive project,

00:01:34.588 --> 00:01:35.989
because when you think about it,

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:38.505
it's actually not really about the stories that are being told,

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:39.811
it's about listening,

00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:41.845
and it's about the questions that you get to ask,

00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:43.923
questions that you may not have permission to

00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:45.193
on any other day.

00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:50.131
I'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project.

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:52.109
[Jesus Melendez talking about poet Pedro Pietri's final moments]

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.675
Jesus Melendez: We took off, and as we were ascending,

00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:56.318
before we had leveled off,

00:01:56.318 --> 00:01:58.747
our level-off point was 45,000 feet,

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:00.649
so before we had leveled off,

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.934
Pedro began leaving us,

00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:05.147
and the beauty about it

00:02:05.147 --> 00:02:08.979
is that I believe that there's something after life.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.273
You can see it in Pedro.

00:02:12.273 --> 00:02:15.849
[Danny Perasa to his wife Annie Perasa married 26 years]

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.579
Danny Perasa: See, the thing of it is,

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.282
I always feel guilty when I say "I love you" to you,

00:02:20.282 --> 00:02:23.174
and I say it so often. I say it to remind you

00:02:23.174 --> 00:02:26.228
that as dumpy as I am, it's coming from me,

00:02:26.228 --> 00:02:30.500
it's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.625
and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:34.938
(Laughter)

00:02:34.938 --> 00:02:37.638
[Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz]

00:02:37.638 --> 00:02:40.696
Michael Wolmetz: So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother,

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:42.228
and we can leave it there.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:44.036
And he saved up and he purchased this,

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:45.921
and he proposed to my mother with this,

00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:47.862
and so I thought that I would give it to you

00:02:47.862 --> 00:02:51.592
so that he could be with us for this also.

00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:54.950
So I'm going to share a mic with you right now, Debora.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.767
Where's the right finger?

00:02:56.767 --> 00:02:58.540
Debora Brakarz: (Crying)

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.258
MW: Debora, will you please marry me?

00:03:02.258 --> 00:03:05.697
DB: Yes. Of course. I love you.

00:03:05.697 --> 00:03:08.358
(Kissing)

00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:12.919
MW: So kids, this is how your mother and I got married,

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.618
in a booth in Grand Central Station with my father's ring.

00:03:16.618 --> 00:03:18.752
My grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years.

00:03:18.752 --> 00:03:20.855
He used to pick people up here every day.

00:03:20.855 --> 00:03:22.982
So it seems right.

00:03:22.982 --> 00:03:24.621
Jake Barton: So I have to say

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.628
I did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:29.628
because they all make you cry.

00:03:29.628 --> 00:03:32.342
The entire project is predicated on this act of love

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:33.893
which is listening itself.

00:03:33.893 --> 00:03:36.678
And that motion of building an institution

00:03:36.678 --> 00:03:38.519
out of a moment of conversation and listening

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.371
is actually a lot of what my firm, Local Projects,

00:03:40.371 --> 00:03:43.370
is doing with our engagements in general.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.100
So we're a media design firm, and we're working

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.249
with a broad array of different institutions

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.482
building media installations for museums and public spaces.

00:03:50.482 --> 00:03:53.158
Our latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art,

00:03:53.158 --> 00:03:56.238
which we've created an engagement called Gallery One for.

00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:58.384
And Gallery One is an interesting project

00:03:58.384 --> 00:04:02.576
because it started with this massive, $350 million expansion

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.055
for the Cleveland Museum of Art,

00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:06.382
and we actually brought in this piece

00:04:06.382 --> 00:04:08.885
specifically to grow new capacity, new audiences,

00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:11.694
at the same time that the museum itself is growing.

00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:13.898
Glenn Lowry, the head of MoMA, put it best when he said,

00:04:13.898 --> 00:04:16.752
"We want visitors to actually cease being visitors.

00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:18.931
Visitors are transient. We want people who live here,

00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:20.604
people who have ownership."

00:04:20.604 --> 00:04:22.389
And so what we're doing is making a broad array

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.087
of different ways for people to actually engage

00:04:24.087 --> 00:04:26.286
with the material inside of these galleries,

00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:29.069
so you can still have a traditional gallery experience,

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.577
but if you're interested, you can actually engage

00:04:31.577 --> 00:04:34.378
with any individual artwork and see the original context

00:04:34.378 --> 00:04:37.120
from where it's from, or manipulate the work itself.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.835
So, for example, you can click on this individual lion head,

00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:43.109
and this is where it originated from, 1300 B.C.

00:04:43.109 --> 00:04:45.219
Or this individual piece here,

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:47.734
you can see the actual bedroom. It really changes the way

00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:51.074
you think about this type of a tempera painting.

00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:53.572
This is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself.

00:04:53.572 --> 00:04:55.417
This is Rodin's bust. You get the sense

00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:57.885
of this incredible factory for creativity.

00:04:57.885 --> 00:04:59.717
And it makes you think about literally the hundreds

00:04:59.717 --> 00:05:02.312
or thousands of years of human creativity and how

00:05:02.312 --> 00:05:05.367
each individual artwork stands in for part of that story.

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:06.658
This is Picasso,

00:05:06.658 --> 00:05:09.636
of course embodying so much of it from the 20th century.

00:05:09.636 --> 00:05:11.937
And so our next interface, which I'll show you,

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:15.120
actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.738
It's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse

00:05:18.738 --> 00:05:21.937
the actual museum's collection using facial recognition.

00:05:21.937 --> 00:05:23.863
So this person's making different faces,

00:05:23.863 --> 00:05:26.270
and it's actually drawing forth different objects

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.510
from the collection that connect with exactly how she's looking.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.555
And so you can imagine that, as people are performing

00:05:33.555 --> 00:05:36.085
inside of the museum itself, you get this sense

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:37.085
of this emotional connection,

00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:39.438
this way in which our face connects with the thousands

00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:41.351
and tens of thousands of years.

00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:43.546
This is an interface that actually allows you to draw

00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:47.490
and then draws forth objects using those same shapes.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.155
So more and more we're trying to find ways

00:05:49.155 --> 00:05:52.241
for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves,

00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:54.241
to be creative even as they're looking

00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:56.929
at other people's creativity and understanding them.

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:59.250
So in this wall, the collections wall,

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.749
you can actually see all 3,000 artworks all at the same time,

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:04.625
and you can actually author your own

00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:07.990
individual walking tours of the museum, so you can share them,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.792
and someone can take a tour with the museum director

00:06:10.792 --> 00:06:13.022
or a tour with their little cousin.

00:06:13.022 --> 00:06:14.112
But all the while that we've been working

00:06:14.112 --> 00:06:16.250
on this engagement for Cleveland,

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.685
we've also been working in the background

00:06:17.685 --> 00:06:19.686
on really our largest engagement to date,

00:06:19.686 --> 00:06:23.270
and that's the 9/11 Memorial and Museum.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.879
So we started in 2006

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.423
as part of a team with Thinc Design

00:06:28.423 --> 00:06:30.920
to create the original master plan for the museum,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.620
and then we've done all the media design

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.207
both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production.

00:06:35.207 --> 00:06:38.077
So the memorial opened in 2011,

00:06:38.077 --> 00:06:40.602
and the museum's going to open next year in 2014.

00:06:40.602 --> 00:06:41.886
And you can see from these images,

00:06:41.886 --> 00:06:45.494
the site is so raw and almost archaeological.

00:06:45.494 --> 00:06:47.468
And of course the event itself is so recent,

00:06:47.468 --> 00:06:50.220
somewhere between history and current events,

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.703
it was a huge challenge to imagine

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.653
how do you actually live up to a space like this,

00:06:54.653 --> 00:06:56.847
an event like this, to actually tell that story.

00:06:56.847 --> 00:06:58.860
And so what we started with

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.491
was really a new way of thinking about building an institution,

00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:03.998
through a project called Make History,

00:07:03.998 --> 00:07:05.833
which we launched in 2009.

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:08.766
So it's estimated that a third of the world

00:07:08.766 --> 00:07:10.446
watched 9/11 live,

00:07:10.446 --> 00:07:11.769
and a third of the world

00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:13.248
heard about it within 24 hours,

00:07:13.248 --> 00:07:15.616
making it really by nature of when it happened,

00:07:15.616 --> 00:07:18.816
this unprecedented moment of global awareness.

00:07:18.816 --> 00:07:21.107
And so we launched this to capture the stories

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.210
from all around the world,

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.876
through video, through photos,

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:25.053
through written history,

00:07:25.053 --> 00:07:26.777
and so people's experiences on that day,

00:07:26.777 --> 00:07:28.843
which was, in fact, this huge risk for the institution

00:07:28.843 --> 00:07:31.312
to make its first move this open platform.

00:07:31.312 --> 00:07:34.270
But that was coupled together with this oral histories booth,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.387
really the simplest we've ever made,

00:07:35.387 --> 00:07:36.515
where you locate yourself on a map.

00:07:36.515 --> 00:07:39.091
It's in six languages, and you can tell your own story

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:41.103
about what happened to you on that day.

00:07:41.103 --> 00:07:44.460
And when we started seeing the incredible images

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.908
and stories that came forth

00:07:45.908 --> 00:07:47.177
from all around the world --

00:07:47.177 --> 00:07:49.249
this is obviously part of the landing gear --

00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:51.438
we really started to understand

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:53.523
that there was this amazing symmetry

00:07:53.523 --> 00:07:55.046
between the event itself,

00:07:55.046 --> 00:07:57.345
between the way that people were telling the stories of the event,

00:07:57.345 --> 00:08:00.641
and how we ourselves needed to tell that story.

00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:02.795
This image in particular really captured

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:03.976
our attention at the time,

00:08:03.976 --> 00:08:06.464
because it so much sums up that event.

00:08:06.464 --> 00:08:09.071
This is a shot from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:12.200
There's a firefighter that's stuck, actually, in traffic,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.028
and so the firefighters themselves are running

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:16.637
a mile and a half to the site itself

00:08:16.637 --> 00:08:19.607
with upwards of 70 pounds of gear on their back.

00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:22.400
And we got this amazing email that said,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.238
"While viewing the thousands of photos on the site,

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:27.211
I unexpectedly found a photo of my son.

00:08:27.211 --> 00:08:30.171
It was a shock emotionally, yet a blessing to find this photo,"

00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:31.492
and he was writing because he said,

00:08:31.492 --> 00:08:33.832
"I'd like to personally thank the photographer

00:08:33.832 --> 00:08:34.981
for posting the photo,

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.083
as it meant more than words can describe to me

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.876
to have access to what is probably

00:08:38.876 --> 00:08:43.319
the last photo ever taken of my son."

00:08:43.319 --> 00:08:45.620
And it really made us recognize

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.221
what this institution needed to be

00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:50.591
in order to actually tell that story.

00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:54.387
We can't have just a historian or a curator narrating

00:08:54.387 --> 00:08:57.634
objectively in the third person about an event like that,

00:08:57.634 --> 00:09:00.164
when you have the witnesses to history

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:01.010
who are going to make their way

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.155
through the actual museum itself.

00:09:04.155 --> 00:09:06.028
And so we started imagining the museum,

00:09:06.028 --> 00:09:09.400
along with the creative team at the museum and the curators,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.297
thinking about how the first voice that you would hear

00:09:11.297 --> 00:09:13.906
inside the museum would actually be of other visitors.

00:09:13.906 --> 00:09:16.394
And so we created this idea of an opening gallery

00:09:16.394 --> 00:09:17.831
called We Remember.

00:09:17.831 --> 00:09:19.656
And I'll just play you part of a mockup of it,

00:09:19.656 --> 00:09:21.603
but you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:22.866
into that moment in time

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:26.119
and be transported back in history.

00:09:26.119 --> 00:09:29.930
(Video) Voice 1: I was in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Voice 2: I was in Cairo, Egypt.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.368
Voice 3: Sur les Champs-Élysées, à Paris.
Voice 4: In college, at U.C. Berkeley.

00:09:33.368 --> 00:09:36.574
Voice 5: I was in Times Square.
Voice 6: São Paolo, Brazil.

00:09:36.574 --> 00:09:41.190
(Multiple voices)

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.986
Voice 7: It was probably about 11 o'clock at night.

00:09:43.986 --> 00:09:47.734
Voice 8: I was driving to work at 5:45 local time in the morning.

00:09:47.734 --> 00:09:48.995
Voice 9: We were actually in a meeting

00:09:48.995 --> 00:09:50.722
when someone barged in and said,

00:09:50.722 --> 00:09:54.515
"Oh my God, a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center."

00:09:54.515 --> 00:09:56.690
Voice 10: Trying to frantically get to a radio.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.119
Voice 11: When I heard it over the radio --

00:09:58.119 --> 00:09:59.495
Voice 12: Heard it on the radio.

00:09:59.495 --> 00:10:01.245
(Multiple voices)

00:10:01.245 --> 00:10:04.179
Voice 13: I got a call from my father.
Voice 14: The phone rang, it woke me up.

00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:06.120
My business partner told me to turn on the television.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.489
Voice 15: So I switched on the television.

00:10:08.489 --> 00:10:10.877
Voice 16: All channels in Italy were displaying the same thing.

00:10:10.877 --> 00:10:13.719
Voice 17: The Twin Towers.
Voice 18: The Twin Towers.

00:10:13.719 --> 00:10:14.816
JB: And you move from there

00:10:14.816 --> 00:10:16.900
into that open, cavernous space.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.785
This is the so-called slurry wall.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.959
It's the original, excavated wall at the base of the World Trade Center

00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:24.961
that withstood the actual pressure from the Hudson River

00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:26.998
for a full year after the event itself.

00:10:26.998 --> 00:10:30.199
And so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity,

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:32.574
of presence of that moment

00:10:32.574 --> 00:10:34.099
into the actual exhibition itself.

00:10:34.099 --> 00:10:36.849
And we tell the stories of being inside the towers

00:10:36.849 --> 00:10:38.383
through that same audio collage,

00:10:38.383 --> 00:10:40.350
so you're hearing people literally talking about

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.274
seeing the planes as they make their way into the building,

00:10:43.274 --> 00:10:45.377
or making their way down the stairwells.

00:10:45.377 --> 00:10:47.624
And as you make your way into the exhibition

00:10:47.624 --> 00:10:49.470
where it talks about the recovery,

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.958
we actually project directly onto these moments

00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.155
of twisted steel all of the experiences from people

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:58.490
who literally excavated on top of the pile itself.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.494
And so you can hear oral histories --

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:02.965
so people who were actually working the so-called bucket brigades

00:11:02.965 --> 00:11:06.150
as you're seeing literally the thousands of experiences

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.985
from that moment.

00:11:07.985 --> 00:11:09.839
And as you leave that storytelling moment

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:11.702
understanding about 9/11,

00:11:11.702 --> 00:11:14.750
we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.522
and actually talk to the individual visitors

00:11:17.522 --> 00:11:20.153
and ask them their own experiences about 9/11.

00:11:20.153 --> 00:11:21.370
And we ask them questions that are actually

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.408
not really answerable, the types of questions

00:11:23.408 --> 00:11:26.904
that 9/11 itself draws forth for all of us.

00:11:26.904 --> 00:11:28.326
And so these are questions like,

00:11:28.326 --> 00:11:31.483
"How can a democracy balance freedom and security?"

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:35.057
"How could 9/11 have happened?"

00:11:35.057 --> 00:11:37.192
"And how did the world change after 9/11?"

00:11:37.192 --> 00:11:38.723
And so these oral histories,

00:11:38.723 --> 00:11:41.606
which we've actually been capturing already for years,

00:11:41.606 --> 00:11:43.745
are then mixed together with interviews

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.971
that we're doing with people like Donald Rumsfeld,

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:47.843
Bill Clinton, Rudy Giuliani,

00:11:47.843 --> 00:11:49.963
and you mix together these different players

00:11:49.963 --> 00:11:50.994
and these different experiences,

00:11:50.994 --> 00:11:53.360
these different reflection points about 9/11.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.055
And suddenly the institution, once again,

00:11:55.055 --> 00:11:57.396
turns into a listening experience.

00:11:57.396 --> 00:11:59.217
So I'll play you just a short excerpt

00:11:59.217 --> 00:12:01.171
of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices,

00:12:01.171 --> 00:12:02.968
but you really get a sense

00:12:02.968 --> 00:12:06.915
of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event.

00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:10.258
(Video) Voice 1: 9/11 was not just a New York experience.

00:12:10.258 --> 00:12:14.268
Voice 2: It's something that we shared, and it's something that united us.

00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:15.822
Voice 3: And I knew when I saw that,

00:12:15.822 --> 00:12:17.877
people who were there that day who immediately

00:12:17.877 --> 00:12:20.937
went to help people known and unknown to them

00:12:20.937 --> 00:12:22.955
was something that would pull us through.

00:12:22.955 --> 00:12:25.774
Voice 4: All the outpouring of affection and emotion

00:12:25.774 --> 00:12:27.742
that came from our country was something really

00:12:27.742 --> 00:12:30.560
that will forever, ever stay with me.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.306
Voice 5: Still today I pray and think about those

00:12:32.306 --> 00:12:33.995
who lost their lives,

00:12:33.995 --> 00:12:36.672
and those who gave their lives to help others,

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:40.091
but I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country,

00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:42.411
the love, the compassIon, the strength,

00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:44.840
and I watched a nation come together

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.399
in the middle of a terrible tragedy.

00:12:50.013 --> 00:12:52.720
JB: And so as people make their way out of the museum,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.808
reflecting on the experience, reflecting on their own thoughts of it,

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:58.984
they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself,

00:12:58.984 --> 00:13:01.062
because they've gone back up to grade,

00:13:01.062 --> 00:13:03.129
and we actually got involved in the memorial

00:13:03.129 --> 00:13:05.368
after we'd done the museum for a few years.

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:08.177
The original designer of the memorial, Michael Arad,

00:13:08.177 --> 00:13:10.707
had this image in his mind of all the names appearing

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:13.103
undifferentiated, almost random,

00:13:13.103 --> 00:13:16.935
really a poetic reflection on top of the nature

00:13:16.935 --> 00:13:18.452
of a terrorism event itself,

00:13:18.452 --> 00:13:21.560
but it was a huge challenge for the families, for the foundation,

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.436
certainly for the first responders,

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:25.566
and there was a negotiation that went forth

00:13:25.566 --> 00:13:27.079
and a solution was found

00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:30.442
to actually create not an order in terms of chronology,

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:31.806
or in terms of alphabetical,

00:13:31.806 --> 00:13:33.952
but through what's called meaningful adjacency.

00:13:33.952 --> 00:13:36.703
So these are groupings of the names themselves

00:13:36.703 --> 00:13:39.371
which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order,

00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:42.607
and we, along with Jer Thorp, created an algorithm

00:13:42.607 --> 00:13:44.602
to take massive amounts of data

00:13:44.602 --> 00:13:47.927
to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves.

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:50.959
So this is an image of the actual algorithm itself

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:53.315
with the names scrambled for privacy,

00:13:53.315 --> 00:13:55.695
but you can see that these blocks of color

00:13:55.695 --> 00:13:57.645
are actually the four different flights,

00:13:57.645 --> 00:14:00.422
the two different towers, the first responders,

00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:02.994
and you can actually see within that different floors,

00:14:02.994 --> 00:14:05.769
and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections

00:14:05.785 --> 00:14:08.959
that were requested by the families themselves.

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:11.340
And so when you go to the memorial,

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.990
you can actually see the overarching organization

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.874
inside of the individual pools themselves.

00:14:16.874 --> 00:14:19.244
You can see the way that the geography of the event

00:14:19.244 --> 00:14:22.127
is reflected inside of the memorial,

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:23.955
and you can search for an individual name,

00:14:23.955 --> 00:14:26.530
or in this case an employer, Cantor Fitzgerald,

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.926
and see the way in which all of those names,

00:14:28.926 --> 00:14:31.036
those hundreds of names, are actually organized

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:32.728
onto the memorial itself,

00:14:32.728 --> 00:14:35.346
and use that to navigate the memorial.

00:14:35.346 --> 00:14:37.282
And more importantly, when you're actually at the site

00:14:37.282 --> 00:14:38.761
of the memorial, you can see those connections.

00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:42.381
You can see the relationships between the different names themselves.

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:45.650
So suddenly what is this undifferentiated, anonymous

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.328
group of names springs into reality as an individual life.

00:14:50.328 --> 00:14:52.496
In this case, Harry Ramos,

00:14:52.496 --> 00:14:54.835
who was the head trader at an investment bank,

00:14:54.835 --> 00:14:59.873
who stopped to aid Victor Wald on the 55th floor of the South Tower.

00:14:59.873 --> 00:15:02.558
And Ramos told Wald, according to witnesses,

00:15:02.558 --> 00:15:05.028
"I'm not going to leave you."

00:15:05.028 --> 00:15:10.604
And Wald's widow requested that they be listed next to each other.

00:15:10.604 --> 00:15:13.806
Three generations ago, we had to actually get people

00:15:13.806 --> 00:15:17.203
to go out and capture the stories for common people.

00:15:17.203 --> 00:15:20.671
Today, of course, there's an unprecedented amount of stories

00:15:20.671 --> 00:15:24.569
for all of us that are being captured for future generations.

00:15:24.569 --> 00:15:28.082
And this is our hope, that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories.

00:15:28.097 --> 00:15:29.021
Thank you very much.

00:15:29.021 --> 00:15:33.878
(Applause)
