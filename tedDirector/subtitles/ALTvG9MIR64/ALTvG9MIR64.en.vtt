00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:14.369
Fresh out of college,

00:00:14.393 --> 00:00:16.944
I went to work for a consulting firm.

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:20.672
During orientation,
the leaders dished out advice.

00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:24.690
Amongst them was one pithy counsel
I will never forget.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.491
He told us, "Be easy to manage."

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:32.304
Considering how naïve
I really was at the time,

00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:34.095
I took his advice to heart.

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:35.614
I told myself,

00:00:35.638 --> 00:00:38.494
"Yes, I will be the ultimate team player.

00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:40.461
I will do everything I'm told.

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:42.371
I will be easy to manage."

00:00:43.478 --> 00:00:45.836
It wasn't until I arrived
in graduate school

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.776
and witnessed firsthand the criminal
actions of scientists and engineers

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.529
in the water crisis in Flint, Michigan

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:58.111
that I realized how dangerous
and yet surprisingly common

00:00:58.135 --> 00:01:00.153
this line of thinking really is.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.685
Make no mistake:

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:06.351
the Flint water crisis is one of the most
egregious environmental injustices

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:07.526
of our time.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.106
For over 18 months,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.212
100,000 residents,
including thousands of young children,

00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:17.119
were exposed to contaminated
drinking water with high levels of lead.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.736
Lead is a potent neurotoxin

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.500
which causes cognitive
and developmental disabilities

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:27.736
and is especially harmful
to growing fetuses and young children.

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:31.678
We've known about its dangers
since the Roman Empire.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.086
Amongst a whole host of health issues,

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.827
12 people died by contracting
Legionnaires' disease.

00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:41.163
Flint's water infrastructure --

00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:44.268
the complex network
of underground pipes --

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:46.360
has been severely damaged.

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:50.096
And while the water quality
is slowly improving

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.171
and the pipes are being replaced now,

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.895
more than two years later,

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:56.269
the water is still not safe to drink.

00:01:58.096 --> 00:02:00.981
So, people are still in shock.

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:02.313
They ask themselves,

00:02:02.337 --> 00:02:04.018
"How could this have happened?"

00:02:04.903 --> 00:02:09.690
The short answer is: the crisis began
when an emergency manager,

00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:12.139
appointed by Michigan's governor,

00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:16.621
decided to switch their water source
to a local river to save money.

00:02:17.147 --> 00:02:19.042
But it continued for so long

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.703
because scientists and engineers
at government agencies

00:02:22.727 --> 00:02:25.782
in the state of Michigan
and in the federal government

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:29.315
did not follow federal regulations
for treating the water right.

00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:31.939
What was more,

00:02:31.963 --> 00:02:35.465
they actively cheated on the law
and orchestrated cover-ups.

00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:38.796
They ridiculed residents asking for help,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.280
while publicly insisting that the brown,
smelly water coming out of the tap

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:44.577
was safe to drink.

00:02:45.568 --> 00:02:51.233
The system at the local, state
and federal levels completely failed

00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:53.249
to protect our most vulnerable,

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:56.930
and an entire population
was left to fend for itself.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.780
Now, amidst this injustice,
Flint residents were rallying together.

00:03:02.804 --> 00:03:05.935
Amongst them were some
amazing women of Flint --

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.960
mothers concerned about their kids --

00:03:07.984 --> 00:03:11.877
who came together forming
many grassroots coalitions,

00:03:11.901 --> 00:03:15.726
and these groups started protesting
and demanding change.

00:03:16.308 --> 00:03:20.046
The group also reached out
to outside scientists for help,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.606
and a few responded.

00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:25.779
Amongst them was a guy
named Miguel Del Toral,

00:03:25.803 --> 00:03:30.481
a water expert at the US EPA --
the Environmental Protection Agency --

00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:33.068
who actually wrote this scientific memo

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:36.232
and sent it to the state of Michigan
and the federal government

00:03:36.256 --> 00:03:38.620
to bring their attention to this problem.

00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.667
He was characterized a "rogue employee,"

00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:43.155
and silenced.

00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:47.334
In collaboration with Flint residents,

00:03:47.358 --> 00:03:49.692
our research team here at Tech,

00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:52.978
of students and scientists
led by professor Marc Edwards,

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:55.140
conducted citywide testing

00:03:55.164 --> 00:03:58.172
to prove that Flint's water
was indeed contaminated,

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.474
even toxic in some homes.

00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:04.494
We substantiated what Flint
had been screaming for months,

00:04:04.518 --> 00:04:07.666
and put it on the Internet
for the world to see.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.668
Now, when I was getting involved,

00:04:10.692 --> 00:04:12.086
when I said yes to this,

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.585
I had no idea what I was getting into.

00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:18.976
But every second of this journey
has been totally worth it.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.765
This was science
in service to the public.

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.318
This is what I came
to graduate school for,

00:04:24.342 --> 00:04:27.115
and this is how I would rather
spend my life.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.714
And so this coalition --

00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:34.631
this unlikely coalition of citizens,
pastors, journalists and scientists --

00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:39.055
came together to uncover the truth
using science, advocacy and activism.

00:04:39.505 --> 00:04:41.638
A local pediatrician figured out

00:04:41.662 --> 00:04:46.001
that the instances of childhood
lead poisoning had indeed doubled

00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:47.836
in Flint during the crisis.

00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:52.631
And the state of Michigan was forced
to acknowledge the problem

00:04:52.655 --> 00:04:55.175
and take steps to correct it.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.735
This group and many others
got Flint's kids protected.

00:04:59.826 --> 00:05:00.996
A few months later,

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.489
President Obama came in
and declared a federal emergency,

00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:08.021
and now Flint is getting
more than 600 million dollars

00:05:08.045 --> 00:05:11.444
in healthcare, nutrition, education

00:05:11.468 --> 00:05:13.786
and overhauling
their water infrastructure.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.707
However, the arrogance and the callous
disregard for public health

00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:25.159
shown by scientists and engineers
at these government agencies

00:05:25.183 --> 00:05:26.586
is beyond belief.

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.081
These unhealthy cultures
that are festering in these groups,

00:05:31.105 --> 00:05:35.050
where the focus is on meeting
regulations and checking boxes

00:05:35.074 --> 00:05:37.224
as opposed to protecting public health,

00:05:37.248 --> 00:05:38.721
is just appalling.

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:43.717
Just consider this email
that an EPA employee wrote,

00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:45.963
where she goes,

00:05:45.987 --> 00:05:50.135
"I'm not so sure Flint is a community
we want to go out on a limb for."

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.156
The dehumanization of an entire population
could not be more obvious.

00:05:56.671 --> 00:06:01.580
Now, contrast that to the first
canon of engineering,

00:06:01.604 --> 00:06:04.865
which, in my opinion, should be
the first law of humanity:

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.966
"To hold paramount the health,
safety and welfare of the public,"

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.660
above all else.

00:06:10.684 --> 00:06:14.128
This is the Hippocratic Oath
we've rarely acknowledged,

00:06:14.152 --> 00:06:15.510
let alone embraced.

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:20.595
And so when scientists and engineers,
very much like medical doctors,

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:21.868
screw up,

00:06:21.892 --> 00:06:23.733
people can get hurt --

00:06:23.757 --> 00:06:25.128
even die.

00:06:25.152 --> 00:06:29.697
If our professionals and even
students fail to get that,

00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:31.775
society pays a huge price.

00:06:33.472 --> 00:06:37.673
Buried deep in history lies
a character I deeply admire --

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:40.838
an engineer named Peter Palchinsky.

00:06:40.862 --> 00:06:43.759
He lived in the time of the Soviet Union.

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:49.179
And Palchinsky repeatedly got in trouble
for his radical honesty

00:06:49.203 --> 00:06:54.758
and willingness to point out major flaws
in the Soviets' mindless pursuit

00:06:54.782 --> 00:06:56.715
of rapid industrialization.

00:06:57.549 --> 00:07:01.567
Everyone was expected to follow orders
coming from the top.

00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:05.490
Anyone asking questions
or offering feedback was unwelcome.

00:07:06.174 --> 00:07:11.452
The Soviets had created the largest army
of engineers the world had ever seen,

00:07:11.476 --> 00:07:16.517
and yet most of them were mere cogs
in a gigantic machine heading for doom.

00:07:17.284 --> 00:07:20.326
Palchinsky, on the other hand,
implored engineers

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.686
to look at the economic, political
and social consequences of their actions;

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.699
in other words, be more public-focused.

00:07:28.723 --> 00:07:32.522
His fearless voice of reason
was seen as a threat

00:07:32.546 --> 00:07:34.363
to the political establishment,

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:38.157
and Joseph Stalin
had him executed in 1929.

00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:43.673
Palchinsky's view on technocrats
is very different

00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:49.047
from one that is still very popular,
still very common --

00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:54.780
that of a dispassionate researcher
working in his ivory tower lab,

00:07:54.804 --> 00:07:57.771
or a nerdy engineer
working in his cubicle.

00:07:58.338 --> 00:08:00.630
Brilliant, no doubt,

00:08:00.654 --> 00:08:02.584
yet somehow cut off from the world,

00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:04.820
shows little emotion --

00:08:04.844 --> 00:08:08.177
kind of like Spock
from "Star Trek," you know?

00:08:08.767 --> 00:08:10.003
This guy.

00:08:10.027 --> 00:08:11.624
(Laughter)

00:08:11.648 --> 00:08:13.419
Let's try and do the Spock salute.

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:15.682
I don't think I'll succeed ...

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:18.460
See, I can't be Spock.

00:08:18.484 --> 00:08:20.622
Thank goodness I can't be Spock.

00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:21.796
(Laughter)

00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:27.909
I was reminded of this distinction
because a recent article came out

00:08:27.933 --> 00:08:31.159
in a very reputed scientific journal,

00:08:31.183 --> 00:08:36.506
which kind of characterized our Flint work
as driven by "youthful idealism,"

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.209
and "Hollywood's dramatic sensibilities."

00:08:39.233 --> 00:08:44.724
It asks scientists to protect
their research funding and institutions

00:08:44.748 --> 00:08:48.099
at all costs, no matter
how just the cause.

00:08:48.123 --> 00:08:51.445
And if you think you have to get
involved in something,

00:08:51.469 --> 00:08:53.504
even if it's an emergency,

00:08:53.528 --> 00:08:57.681
try finding an activist group or an NGO,

00:08:57.705 --> 00:09:00.701
and obtain the full support
of the academic community --

00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:02.063
whatever that means --

00:09:02.087 --> 00:09:03.799
before you get involved.

00:09:04.447 --> 00:09:08.592
Not one mention of our moral
and professional obligation

00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:10.679
of preventing harm to the public,

00:09:10.703 --> 00:09:14.072
or the fact that we have
all this expertise,

00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:17.121
resources and, for some, even tenure

00:09:17.145 --> 00:09:19.791
to, you know, accomplish this task.

00:09:20.597 --> 00:09:23.325
I'm not saying every scientist
should be an activist.

00:09:23.349 --> 00:09:28.168
There are real and sometimes very painful
consequences of speaking up.

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:33.023
But to denounce this idea,
this possibility so completely

00:09:33.047 --> 00:09:35.443
so that you can protect research funding,

00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:38.092
simply screams of self-serving cowardice,

00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:43.317
and these are not the ideals
we would want to pass to our students.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.752
And so you may think,
"OK, all this sounds great,

00:09:47.776 --> 00:09:51.399
but you'll never completely change
organizational cultures,

00:09:51.423 --> 00:09:55.470
or imbibe mindsets in students
and professionals

00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:58.131
to look at their work as a public good --

00:09:58.155 --> 00:10:00.215
science in service to the public."

00:10:00.887 --> 00:10:02.350
Maybe so.

00:10:02.374 --> 00:10:04.616
But could a big reason for that be

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.300
that we are not training
our students right?

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:10.143
Because if you look closely,

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:15.079
our education system today
is focused more on creating

00:10:15.103 --> 00:10:20.158
what ex-Yale professor Bill Deresiewicz
calls "excellent sheep" --

00:10:20.182 --> 00:10:23.037
young people who are smart and ambitious,

00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:27.965
and yet somehow risk-averse,
timid, directionless

00:10:27.989 --> 00:10:30.791
and, sometimes, full of themselves.

00:10:30.815 --> 00:10:32.734
Now, kids ... you know,

00:10:32.758 --> 00:10:35.374
we fell in love with science
when we were kids,

00:10:35.398 --> 00:10:39.700
and yet we somehow spend most of our time
during high school and college

00:10:39.724 --> 00:10:41.221
just jumping through hoops

00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:44.712
and doing things
so that we can polish our résumé

00:10:44.736 --> 00:10:46.406
instead of sitting down

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.949
and reflecting on what we want to do
and who we want to be.

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.218
And so,

00:10:55.444 --> 00:10:59.079
the markers of empathy
in our college graduates

00:10:59.103 --> 00:11:02.246
have been dropping dramatically
in the past two decades,

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.996
while those of narcissism are on the rise.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.691
There is also a growing culture
of disengagement

00:11:07.715 --> 00:11:10.648
between engineering students
and the public.

00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:16.705
We are trained to build bridges
and solve complex problems

00:11:16.729 --> 00:11:21.743
but not how to think or live
or be a citizen of this world.

00:11:21.767 --> 00:11:26.160
My undergraduate years
were explicit job preparation,

00:11:26.184 --> 00:11:30.390
and I cannot tell you how suffocating
and painful it was at times.

00:11:31.748 --> 00:11:33.360
And so,

00:11:33.384 --> 00:11:36.961
some people think the solution
to great engineers, to great scientists,

00:11:36.985 --> 00:11:38.789
is more technical training.

00:11:38.813 --> 00:11:40.046
Maybe so.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.564
But where are the discussions
on ethical decision-making,

00:11:43.588 --> 00:11:45.413
or building character,

00:11:45.437 --> 00:11:48.277
or discerning right from wrong?

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:53.808
Consider this project
that I deeply love and admire.

00:11:53.832 --> 00:11:56.610
It's called, "Heroic Imagination Project."

00:11:56.634 --> 00:11:59.257
A brainchild of Dr. Phil Zimbardo,

00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:02.059
famous for the Stanford Prison Experiment,

00:12:02.083 --> 00:12:07.328
this program seeks to train
school-going children around the world

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:10.792
to look at themselves
as heroes-in-waiting,

00:12:10.816 --> 00:12:12.732
or heroes-in-training.

00:12:12.756 --> 00:12:18.107
So, these young minds work over time
to develop skills and virtues

00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:20.291
so that when the opportunity comes,

00:12:20.315 --> 00:12:22.885
no matter what that opportunity be,

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:25.517
to stand up and do the right thing.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.467
In other words,

00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:29.408
anyone can be a hero.

00:12:30.227 --> 00:12:32.344
Think about that idea for a second.

00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:36.059
Why don't we teach science
and engineering like that --

00:12:36.083 --> 00:12:40.461
where heroism and public service
are seen as key values,

00:12:40.485 --> 00:12:43.103
because indeed, it's often heroism

00:12:43.127 --> 00:12:46.875
that is not only the antidote
to public indifference,

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:50.856
but also to systemic evil
like we saw in Flint.

00:12:51.957 --> 00:12:53.391
And so, dream with me

00:12:53.415 --> 00:12:57.572
what a 21st-century scientist
slash engineer could look like:

00:12:57.596 --> 00:13:01.149
individuals who are driven
to master the sciences

00:13:01.173 --> 00:13:03.147
so that they can serve society,

00:13:03.171 --> 00:13:04.365
and are also aware

00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:07.865
of the tremendous power
their knowledge and decisions have;

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.103
folks who are developing
their moral courage at all times,

00:13:12.127 --> 00:13:15.913
and who realize that conflict
and controversy

00:13:15.937 --> 00:13:18.041
are not necessarily bad things

00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:21.720
if our ultimate loyalty
is to the public and the planet.

00:13:22.641 --> 00:13:27.683
These are the people who will
stand up like we did in Flint --

00:13:27.707 --> 00:13:31.442
not to be saviors or heroes in the media,

00:13:31.466 --> 00:13:38.417
but altruistic and fundamentally good
actors that you and I can trust.

00:13:39.537 --> 00:13:44.330
Imagine fostering
such a public-focused mindset

00:13:44.354 --> 00:13:47.809
in classes, on service trips
and during activities

00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:50.175
during college or even high school,

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:54.013
so that these young minds
will hold onto those ideals

00:13:54.037 --> 00:13:56.509
when they actually enter the real world,

00:13:56.533 --> 00:14:00.656
whether that be consulting,
academia, policy making --

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.472
or even becoming
the president of a country.

00:14:05.362 --> 00:14:08.910
Some of mankind's greatest
challenges lie ahead of us;

00:14:08.934 --> 00:14:11.941
contaminated drinking water
is just one example.

00:14:12.411 --> 00:14:14.481
We could definitely use more --

00:14:14.505 --> 00:14:19.492
nay, we desperately need more --
compassionate upstanders

00:14:19.516 --> 00:14:22.650
and public-focused
scientists and engineers

00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:24.683
who will strive to the do right thing,

00:14:24.707 --> 00:14:26.719
and not be easy to manage.

00:14:26.743 --> 00:14:27.914
Thank you.

00:14:27.938 --> 00:14:32.462
(Applause)
