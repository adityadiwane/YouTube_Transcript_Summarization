00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:14.880
It's very nice to be here tonight.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.596
So I've been working on the history of income

00:00:18.596 --> 00:00:21.915
and wealth distribution for the past 15 years,

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:25.016
and one of the interesting lessons

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:27.517
coming from this historical evidence

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:29.530
is indeed that, in the long run,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.250
there is a tendency for 
the rate of return of capital

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.920
to exceed the economy's growth rate,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.665
and this tends to lead to 
high concentration of wealth.

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:40.498
Not infinite concentration of wealth,

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.289
but the higher the gap between r and g,

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.224
the higher the level of inequality of wealth

00:00:46.224 --> 00:00:49.431
towards which society tends to converge.

00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:52.985
So this is a key force that
I'm going to talk about today,

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:54.954
but let me say right away

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.284
that this is not the only important force

00:00:57.284 --> 00:00:59.757
in the dynamics of income 
and wealth distribution,

00:00:59.757 --> 00:01:01.782
and there are many other forces that play

00:01:01.782 --> 00:01:04.763
an important role in the long-run dynamics

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.338
of income and wealth distribution.

00:01:06.338 --> 00:01:08.307
Also there is a lot of data

00:01:08.307 --> 00:01:09.863
that still needs to be collected.

00:01:09.863 --> 00:01:12.795
We know a little bit more today

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:15.316
than we used to know, 
but we still know too little,

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:17.992
and certainly there are 
many different processes —

00:01:17.992 --> 00:01:20.290
economic, social, political —

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.717
that need to be studied more.

00:01:21.717 --> 00:01:24.697
And so I'm going to focus today on this simple force,

00:01:24.697 --> 00:01:26.958
but that doesn't mean that other important forces

00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.162
do not exist.

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:30.434
So most of the data I'm going to present

00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:32.639
comes from this database

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:33.899
that's available online:

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.384
the World Top Incomes Database.

00:01:35.384 --> 00:01:37.487
So this is the largest existing

00:01:37.487 --> 00:01:39.940
historical database on inequality,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.290
and this comes from the effort

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.182
of over 30 scholars from several dozen countries.

00:01:45.182 --> 00:01:47.960
So let me show you a couple of facts

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.105
coming from this database,

00:01:49.105 --> 00:01:51.179
and then we'll return to r bigger than g.

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.689
So fact number one is that there has been

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.740
a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.645
between the United States and Europe

00:01:58.645 --> 00:02:00.400
over the past century.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.905
So back in 1900, 1910, income inequality was actually

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:06.170
much higher in Europe than in the United States,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.280
whereas today, it is a lot higher in the United States.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.946
So let me be very clear:

00:02:10.946 --> 00:02:13.770
The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.267
It has more to do with changing supply and demand

00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:20.720
for skill, the race between education and technology,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.300
globalization, probably more unequal access

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.906
to skills in the U.S.,

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:28.493
where you have very good, very top universities

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:30.735
but where the bottom part of the educational system

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:31.500
is not as good,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.861
so very unequal access to skills,

00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:35.780
and also an unprecedented rise

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.800
of top managerial compensation of the United States,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.650
which is difficult to account for
just on the basis of education.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.604
So there is more going on here,

00:02:43.604 --> 00:02:46.213
but I'm not going to talk too much about this today,

00:02:46.213 --> 00:02:48.879
because I want to focus on wealth inequality.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.860
So let me just show you a very simple indicator

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.210
about the income inequality part.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.664
So this is the share of total income

00:02:56.664 --> 00:02:58.452
going to the top 10 percent.

00:02:58.452 --> 00:03:00.624
So you can see that one century ago,

00:03:00.624 --> 00:03:04.201
it was between 45 and 50 percent in Europe

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:06.939
and a little bit above 40 percent in the U.S.,

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.210
so there was more inequality in Europe.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.234
Then there was a sharp decline

00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:13.765
during the first half of the 20th century,

00:03:13.765 --> 00:03:16.128
and in the recent decade, you can see that

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:19.630
the U.S. has become more unequal than Europe,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.300
and this is the first fact I just talked about.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.211
Now, the second fact is more about wealth inequality,

00:03:26.211 --> 00:03:29.301
and here the central fact is that wealth inequality

00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:31.907
is always a lot higher than income inequality,

00:03:31.907 --> 00:03:34.292
and also that wealth inequality,

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:36.945
although it has also increased in recent decades,

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:38.801
is still less extreme today

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.680
than what it was a century ago,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.199
although the total quantity of wealth

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.224
relative to income has now recovered

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:46.855
from the very large shocks

00:03:46.855 --> 00:03:48.880
caused by World War I, the Great Depression,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.099
World War II.

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.143
So let me show you two graphs

00:03:52.143 --> 00:03:55.000
illustrating fact number two and fact number three.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.390
So first, if you look at the level of wealth inequality,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.548
this is the share of total wealth

00:04:02.548 --> 00:04:05.070
going to the top 10 percent of wealth holders,

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.779
so you can see the same kind of reversal

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.344
between the U.S. and Europe that we had before

00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:12.020
for income inequality.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.570
So wealth concentration was higher

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.813
in Europe than in the U.S. a century ago,

00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:19.647
and now it is the opposite.

00:04:19.647 --> 00:04:21.638
But you can also show two things:

00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:25.339
First, the general level of wealth inequality

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:27.994
is always higher than income inequality.

00:04:27.994 --> 00:04:30.334
So remember, for income inequality,

00:04:30.334 --> 00:04:32.662
the share going to the top 10 percent

00:04:32.662 --> 00:04:36.960
was between 30 and 50 percent of total income,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.772
whereas for wealth, the share is always

00:04:39.772 --> 00:04:41.831
between 60 and 90 percent.

00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:43.347
Okay, so that's fact number one,

00:04:43.347 --> 00:04:45.273
and that's very important for what follows.

00:04:45.273 --> 00:04:46.994
Wealth concentration is always

00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:48.873
a lot higher than income concentration.

00:04:48.873 --> 00:04:52.259
Fact number two is that the rise

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.206
in wealth inequality in recent decades

00:04:55.206 --> 00:04:59.492
is still not enough to get us back to 1910.

00:04:59.492 --> 00:05:01.269
So the big difference today,

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:03.182
wealth inequality is still very large,

00:05:03.182 --> 00:05:06.444
with 60, 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10,

00:05:06.444 --> 00:05:08.289
but the good news is that it's actually

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.070
better than one century ago,

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.441
where you had 90 percent in
Europe going to the top 10.

00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:15.432
So today what you have

00:05:15.432 --> 00:05:17.434
is what I call the middle 40 percent,

00:05:17.434 --> 00:05:19.347
the people who are not in the top 10

00:05:19.347 --> 00:05:21.120
and who are not in the bottom 50,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.386
and what you can view as the wealth middle class

00:05:23.386 --> 00:05:26.529
that owns 20 to 30 percent

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.391
of total wealth, national wealth,

00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:31.722
whereas they used to be poor, a century ago,

00:05:31.722 --> 00:05:34.340
when there was basically no wealth middle class.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.917
So this is an important change,

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:40.532
and it's interesting to see that wealth inequality

00:05:40.532 --> 00:05:43.838
has not fully recovered to pre-World War I levels,

00:05:43.838 --> 00:05:47.347
although the total quantity of wealth has recovered.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.294
Okay? So this is the total value

00:05:49.294 --> 00:05:51.510
of wealth relative to income,

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.623
and you can see that in particular in Europe,

00:05:53.623 --> 00:05:57.483
we are almost back to the pre-World War I level.

00:05:57.483 --> 00:05:59.328
So there are really two

00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:01.859
different parts of the story here.

00:06:01.859 --> 00:06:02.978
One has to do with

00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:05.420
the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.098
and there is nothing bad per se, of course,

00:06:07.098 --> 00:06:08.845
in accumulating a lot of wealth,

00:06:08.845 --> 00:06:11.713
and in particular if it is more diffuse

00:06:11.713 --> 00:06:13.107
and less concentrated.

00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:15.852
So what we really want to focus on

00:06:15.852 --> 00:06:18.233
is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality,

00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:20.533
and what's going to happen in the future.

00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:22.558
How can we account for the fact that

00:06:22.558 --> 00:06:26.220
until World War I, wealth inequality was so high

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.410
and, if anything, was rising to even higher levels,

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.737
and how can we think about the future?

00:06:32.737 --> 00:06:36.623
So let me come to some of the explanations

00:06:36.623 --> 00:06:38.759
and speculations about the future.

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.354
Let me first say that

00:06:40.354 --> 00:06:42.341
probably the best model to explain

00:06:42.341 --> 00:06:44.438
why wealth is so much

00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:46.624
more concentrated than income

00:06:46.624 --> 00:06:49.736
is a dynamic, dynastic model

00:06:49.736 --> 00:06:52.200
where individuals have a long horizon

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.956
and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.566
If people were accumulating wealth

00:06:57.566 --> 00:06:59.569
only for life cycle reasons,

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:01.582
you know, to be able to consume

00:07:01.582 --> 00:07:03.169
when they are old,

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:05.542
then the level of wealth inequality

00:07:05.542 --> 00:07:07.859
should be more or less in line

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:09.828
with the level of income inequality.

00:07:09.828 --> 00:07:11.756
But it will be very difficult to explain

00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:13.950
why you have so much more wealth inequality

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.434
than income inequality

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:16.710
with a pure life cycle model,

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.741
so you need a story

00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:20.429
where people also care

00:07:20.429 --> 00:07:22.960
about wealth accumulation for other reasons.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.884
So typically, they want to transmit

00:07:24.884 --> 00:07:28.210
wealth to the next generation, to their children,

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.978
or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth

00:07:29.978 --> 00:07:32.746
because of the prestige, the
power that goes with wealth.

00:07:32.746 --> 00:07:34.130
So there must be other reasons

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.120
for accumulating wealth than just life cycle

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.888
to explain what we see in the data.

00:07:38.888 --> 00:07:42.234
Now, in a large class of dynamic models

00:07:42.234 --> 00:07:44.210
of wealth accumulation

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.768
with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth,

00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:50.614
you will have all sorts of random,

00:07:50.614 --> 00:07:51.537
multiplicative shocks.

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:53.786
So for instance, some families

00:07:53.786 --> 00:07:55.473
have a very large number of children,

00:07:55.473 --> 00:07:57.239
so the wealth will be divided.

00:07:57.239 --> 00:07:59.129
Some families have fewer children.

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:01.357
You also have shocks to rates of return.

00:08:01.357 --> 00:08:03.454
Some families make huge capital gains.

00:08:03.454 --> 00:08:05.249
Some made bad investments.

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:07.490
So you will always have some mobility

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.928
in the wealth process.

00:08:08.928 --> 00:08:11.303
Some people will move up,
some people will move down.

00:08:11.303 --> 00:08:12.955
The important point is that,

00:08:12.955 --> 00:08:13.965
in any such model,

00:08:13.965 --> 00:08:16.521
for a given variance of such shocks,

00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:18.557
the equilibrium level of wealth inequality

00:08:18.557 --> 00:08:23.394
will be a steeply rising function of r minus g.

00:08:23.394 --> 00:08:26.263
And intuitively, the reason why the difference

00:08:26.263 --> 00:08:28.107
between the rate of return to wealth

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:29.862
and the growth rate is important

00:08:29.862 --> 00:08:32.174
is that initial wealth inequalities

00:08:32.174 --> 00:08:34.565
will be amplified at a faster pace

00:08:34.565 --> 00:08:36.634
with a bigger r minus g.

00:08:36.634 --> 00:08:38.108
So take a simple example,

00:08:38.108 --> 00:08:41.874
with r equals five percent and g equals one percent,

00:08:41.874 --> 00:08:43.982
wealth holders only need to reinvest

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.621
one fifth of their capital income to ensure

00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:49.354
that their wealth rises as fast

00:08:49.354 --> 00:08:51.267
as the size of the economy.

00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:52.650
So this makes it easier

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.416
to build and perpetuate large fortunes

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:56.371
because you can consume four fifths,

00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:58.110
assuming zero tax,

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.771
and you can just reinvest one fifth.

00:08:59.771 --> 00:09:02.359
So of course some families
will consume more than that,

00:09:02.359 --> 00:09:04.102
some will consume less, so there will be

00:09:04.102 --> 00:09:05.857
some mobility in the distribution,

00:09:05.857 --> 00:09:08.703
but on average, they only need to reinvest one fifth,

00:09:08.703 --> 00:09:12.472
so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained.

00:09:12.472 --> 00:09:14.969
Now, you should not be surprised

00:09:14.969 --> 00:09:18.505
by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever,

00:09:18.505 --> 00:09:20.121
because, in fact, this is what happened

00:09:20.121 --> 00:09:22.192
during most of the history of mankind.

00:09:22.192 --> 00:09:25.543
And this was in a way very obvious to everybody

00:09:25.543 --> 00:09:27.321
for a simple reason, which is that growth

00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:29.509
was close to zero percent

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:31.130
during most of the history of mankind.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.662
Growth was maybe 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 percent,

00:09:34.662 --> 00:09:36.658
but very slow growth of population

00:09:36.658 --> 00:09:38.655
and output per capita,

00:09:38.655 --> 00:09:40.539
whereas the rate of return on capital

00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:42.395
of course was not zero percent.

00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:44.431
It was, for land assets, which was

00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:46.240
the traditional form

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.641
of assets in preindustrial societies,

00:09:48.641 --> 00:09:50.404
it was typically five percent.

00:09:50.404 --> 00:09:54.190
Any reader of Jane Austen would know that.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.098
If you want an annual income of 1,000 pounds,

00:09:57.098 --> 00:09:58.740
you should have a capital value

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.596
of 20,000 pounds so that

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:03.146
five percent of 20,000 is 1,000.

00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:05.163
And in a way, this was

00:10:05.163 --> 00:10:06.941
the very foundation of society,

00:10:06.941 --> 00:10:09.976
because r bigger than g

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:14.100
was what allowed holders of wealth and assets

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.790
to live off their capital income

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.490
and to do something else in life

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.685
than just to care about their own survival.

00:10:22.685 --> 00:10:24.845
Now, one important conclusion

00:10:24.845 --> 00:10:26.836
of my historical research is that

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:29.547
modern industrial growth did not change

00:10:29.547 --> 00:10:32.371
this basic fact as much as one might have expected.

00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:34.050
Of course, the growth rate

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.858
following the Industrial Revolution

00:10:35.858 --> 00:10:40.180
rose, typically from zero to one to two percent,

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.110
but at the same time, the rate of return

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.755
to capital also rose

00:10:43.755 --> 00:10:46.180
so that the gap between the two

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.636
did not really change.

00:10:47.636 --> 00:10:49.886
So during the 20th century,

00:10:49.886 --> 00:10:52.530
you had a very unique combination of events.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.547
First, a very low rate of return

00:10:54.547 --> 00:10:57.563
due to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks,

00:10:57.563 --> 00:10:59.868
destruction of wealth, inflation,

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.848
bankruptcy during the Great Depression,

00:11:01.848 --> 00:11:03.513
and all of this reduced

00:11:03.513 --> 00:11:05.263
the private rate of return to wealth

00:11:05.263 --> 00:11:07.158
to unusually low levels

00:11:07.158 --> 00:11:09.497
between 1914 and 1945.

00:11:09.497 --> 00:11:11.333
And then, in the postwar period,

00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:14.570
you had unusually high growth rate,

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.944
partly due to the reconstruction.

00:11:16.944 --> 00:11:18.869
You know, in Germany, in France, in Japan,

00:11:18.869 --> 00:11:20.420
you had five percent growth rate

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.570
between 1950 and 1980

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.213
largely due to reconstruction,

00:11:25.213 --> 00:11:27.564
and also due to very large demographic growth,

00:11:27.564 --> 00:11:29.705
the Baby Boom Cohort effect.

00:11:29.705 --> 00:11:32.143
Now, apparently that's not going to last for very long,

00:11:32.143 --> 00:11:33.818
or at least the population growth

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.586
is supposed to decline in the future,

00:11:36.586 --> 00:11:40.242
and the best projections we have is that

00:11:40.242 --> 00:11:42.070
the long-run growth is going to be closer

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.493
to one to two percent

00:11:43.493 --> 00:11:45.439
rather than four to five percent.

00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:48.116
So if you look at this,

00:11:48.116 --> 00:11:50.257
these are the best estimates we have

00:11:50.257 --> 00:11:51.913
of world GDP growth

00:11:51.913 --> 00:11:54.272
and rate of return on capital,

00:11:54.272 --> 00:11:56.360
average rates of return on capital,

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.428
so you can see that during most

00:11:57.428 --> 00:11:58.945
of the history of mankind,

00:11:58.945 --> 00:12:00.558
the growth rate was very small,

00:12:00.558 --> 00:12:02.392
much lower than the rate of return,

00:12:02.392 --> 00:12:04.754
and then during the 20th century,

00:12:04.754 --> 00:12:06.925
it is really the population growth,

00:12:06.925 --> 00:12:09.197
very high in the postwar period,

00:12:09.197 --> 00:12:10.797
and the reconstruction process

00:12:10.797 --> 00:12:12.370
that brought growth

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.441
to a smaller gap with the rate of return.

00:12:15.441 --> 00:12:18.964
Here I use the United Nations population projections,

00:12:18.964 --> 00:12:21.440
so of course they are uncertain.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.831
It could be that we all start

00:12:22.831 --> 00:12:24.937
having a lot of children in the future,

00:12:24.937 --> 00:12:27.702
and the growth rates are going to be higher,

00:12:27.702 --> 00:12:28.951
but from now on,

00:12:28.951 --> 00:12:31.753
these are the best projections we have,

00:12:31.753 --> 00:12:33.687
and this will make global growth

00:12:33.687 --> 00:12:36.443
decline and the gap between

00:12:36.443 --> 00:12:38.446
the rate of return go up.

00:12:38.446 --> 00:12:41.308
Now, the other unusual event

00:12:41.308 --> 00:12:42.979
during the 20th century

00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:44.308
was, as I said,

00:12:44.308 --> 00:12:46.624
destruction, taxation of capital,

00:12:46.624 --> 00:12:49.359
so this is the pre-tax rate of return.

00:12:49.359 --> 00:12:52.338
This is the after-tax rate of return,

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:53.904
and after destruction,

00:12:53.904 --> 00:12:55.681
and this is what brought

00:12:55.681 --> 00:12:57.369
the average rate of return

00:12:57.369 --> 00:12:59.158
after tax, after destruction,

00:12:59.158 --> 00:13:01.578
below the growth rate during a long time period.

00:13:01.578 --> 00:13:03.252
But without the destruction,

00:13:03.252 --> 00:13:05.727
without the taxation, this 
would not have happened.

00:13:05.727 --> 00:13:08.970
So let me say that the balance between

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.326
returns on capital and growth

00:13:11.326 --> 00:13:13.188
depends on many different factors

00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:15.273
that are very difficult to predict:

00:13:15.273 --> 00:13:17.388
technology and the development

00:13:17.388 --> 00:13:19.972
of capital-intensive techniques.

00:13:19.972 --> 00:13:22.991
So right now, the most capital-intensive sectors

00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:26.367
in the economy are the real estate sector, housing,

00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:29.229
the energy sector, but it could be in the future

00:13:29.229 --> 00:13:32.941
that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors

00:13:32.941 --> 00:13:34.830
and that this would be a bigger share

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.740
of the total capital stock that it is today.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.734
Well, we are very far from this,

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:40.500
and from now, what's going on

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.289
in the real estate sector, the energy sector,

00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:44.415
is much more important for the total capital stock

00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:45.549
and capital share.

00:13:45.549 --> 00:13:47.582
The other important issue

00:13:47.582 --> 00:13:49.732
is that there are scale effects
in portfolio management,

00:13:49.732 --> 00:13:52.151
together with financial complexity,

00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:53.601
financial deregulation,

00:13:53.601 --> 00:13:56.310
that make it easier to get higher rates of return

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.937
for a large portfolio,

00:13:57.937 --> 00:14:00.600
and this seems to be particularly strong

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.582
for billionaires, large capital endowments.

00:14:02.582 --> 00:14:04.872
Just to give you one example,

00:14:04.872 --> 00:14:08.205
this comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings

00:14:08.205 --> 00:14:11.535
over the 1987-2013 period,

00:14:11.535 --> 00:14:14.323
and you can see the very top wealth holders

00:14:14.323 --> 00:14:17.440
have been going up at six, seven percent per year

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.831
in real terms above inflation,

00:14:19.831 --> 00:14:22.203
whereas average income in the world,

00:14:22.203 --> 00:14:23.566
average wealth in the world,

00:14:23.566 --> 00:14:26.949
have increased at only two percent per year.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:28.678
And you find the same

00:14:28.678 --> 00:14:29.954
for large university endowments —

00:14:29.954 --> 00:14:32.222
the bigger the initial endowments,

00:14:32.222 --> 00:14:34.290
the bigger the rate of return.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.968
Now, what could be done?

00:14:35.968 --> 00:14:38.364
The first thing is that I think we need

00:14:38.364 --> 00:14:40.479
more financial transparency.

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:44.320
We know too little about global wealth dynamics,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.220
so we need international transmission

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.482
of bank information.

00:14:47.482 --> 00:14:50.168
We need a global registry of financial assets,

00:14:50.168 --> 00:14:52.659
more coordination on wealth taxation,

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:55.771
and even wealth tax with a small tax rate

00:14:55.771 --> 00:14:57.987
will be a way to produce information

00:14:57.987 --> 00:15:00.669
so that then we can adapt our policies

00:15:00.669 --> 00:15:02.505
to whatever we observe.

00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:04.343
And to some extent, the fight

00:15:04.343 --> 00:15:05.824
against tax havens

00:15:05.824 --> 00:15:07.639
and automatic transmission of information

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:09.490
is pushing us in this direction.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.814
Now, there are other ways to redistribute wealth,

00:15:11.814 --> 00:15:14.771
which it can be tempting to use.

00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:16.127
Inflation:

00:15:16.127 --> 00:15:17.826
it's much easier to print money

00:15:17.826 --> 00:15:19.981
than to write a tax code, so that's very tempting,

00:15:19.981 --> 00:15:22.101
but sometimes you don't know
what you do with the money.

00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:23.748
This is a problem.

00:15:23.748 --> 00:15:25.611
Expropriation is very tempting.

00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:27.872
Just when you feel some people get too wealthy,

00:15:27.872 --> 00:15:29.166
you just expropriate them.

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:30.878
But this is not a very efficient way

00:15:30.878 --> 00:15:33.711
to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics.

00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:36.190
So war is an even less efficient way,

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.526
so I tend to prefer progressive taxation,

00:15:38.526 --> 00:15:41.100
but of course, history — (Laughter) —

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.835
history will invent its own best ways,

00:15:42.835 --> 00:15:44.533
and it will probably involve

00:15:44.533 --> 00:15:46.267
a combination of all of these.

00:15:46.267 --> 00:15:48.133
Thank you.

00:15:48.133 --> 00:15:50.270
(Applause)

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:55.829
Bruno Giussani: Thomas Piketty. Thank you.

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:57.708
Thomas, I want to ask you two or three questions,

00:15:57.708 --> 00:16:01.567
because it's impressive how you're
in command of your data, of course,

00:16:01.567 --> 00:16:05.361
but basically what you suggest is

00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:06.934
growing wealth concentration is kind of

00:16:06.934 --> 00:16:08.858
a natural tendency of capitalism,

00:16:08.858 --> 00:16:12.396
and if we leave it to its own devices,

00:16:12.396 --> 00:16:14.636
it may threaten the system itself,

00:16:14.636 --> 00:16:16.362
so you're suggesting that we need to act

00:16:16.362 --> 00:16:19.400
to implement policies that redistribute wealth,

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.121
including the ones we just saw:

00:16:21.121 --> 00:16:22.592
progressive taxation, etc.

00:16:22.592 --> 00:16:24.731
In the current political context,

00:16:24.731 --> 00:16:26.722
how realistic are those?

00:16:26.722 --> 00:16:28.533
How likely do you think that it is

00:16:28.533 --> 00:16:30.277
that they will be implemented?

00:16:30.277 --> 00:16:31.488
Thomas Piketty: Well, you know, I think

00:16:31.488 --> 00:16:33.269
if you look back through time,

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:35.920
the history of income, wealth and taxation

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.522
is full of surprise.

00:16:37.522 --> 00:16:40.127
So I am not terribly impressed

00:16:40.127 --> 00:16:41.695
by those who know in advance

00:16:41.695 --> 00:16:43.326
what will or will not happen.

00:16:43.326 --> 00:16:45.030
I think one century ago,

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.599
many people would have said

00:16:46.599 --> 00:16:48.737
that progressive income taxation would never happen

00:16:48.737 --> 00:16:50.257
and then it happened.

00:16:50.257 --> 00:16:52.246
And even five years ago,

00:16:52.246 --> 00:16:54.598
many people would have said that bank secrecy

00:16:54.598 --> 00:16:56.623
will be with us forever in Switzerland,

00:16:56.623 --> 00:16:58.411
that Switzerland was too powerful

00:16:58.411 --> 00:16:59.900
for the rest of the world,

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.861
and then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions

00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:05.483
against Swiss banks for a big change to happen,

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.186
and now we are moving toward

00:17:07.186 --> 00:17:08.862
more financial transparency.

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:13.143
So I think it's not that difficult

00:17:13.143 --> 00:17:15.612
to better coordinate politically.

00:17:15.612 --> 00:17:17.670
We are going to have a treaty

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.719
with half of the world GDP around the table

00:17:20.719 --> 00:17:22.721
with the U.S. and the European Union,

00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:24.847
so if half of the world GDP is not enough

00:17:24.847 --> 00:17:27.513
to make progress on financial transparency

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:31.597
and minimal tax for multinational corporate profits,

00:17:31.597 --> 00:17:33.261
what does it take?

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:36.884
So I think these are not technical difficulties.

00:17:36.884 --> 00:17:38.808
I think we can make progress

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.395
if we have a more pragmatic
approach to these questions

00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:43.296
and we have the proper sanctions

00:17:43.296 --> 00:17:46.287
on those who benefit from financial opacity.

00:17:46.287 --> 00:17:47.940
BG: One of the arguments

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.373
against your point of view

00:17:49.373 --> 00:17:50.815
is that economic inequality

00:17:50.815 --> 00:17:54.452
is not only a feature of capitalism
but is actually one of its engines.

00:17:54.452 --> 00:17:57.253
So we take measures to lower inequality,

00:17:57.253 --> 00:17:59.660
and at the same time we lower growth, potentially.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.220
What do you answer to that?

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.949
TP: Yeah, I think inequality

00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:04.838
is not a problem per se.

00:18:04.838 --> 00:18:06.878
I think inequality up to a point

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:09.530
can actually be useful for innovation and growth.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.723
The problem is, it's a question of degree.

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:14.267
When inequality gets too extreme,

00:18:14.267 --> 00:18:17.156
then it becomes useless for growth

00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:18.618
and it can even become bad

00:18:18.618 --> 00:18:21.675
because it tends to lead to high perpetuation

00:18:21.675 --> 00:18:23.311
of inequality over time

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.177
and low mobility.

00:18:25.177 --> 00:18:28.463
And for instance, the kind of wealth concentrations

00:18:28.463 --> 00:18:31.340
that we had in the 19th century

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.265
and pretty much until World War I

00:18:33.265 --> 00:18:35.030
in every European country

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.124
was, I think, not useful for growth.

00:18:37.124 --> 00:18:39.226
This was destroyed by a combination

00:18:39.226 --> 00:18:41.567
of tragic events and policy changes,

00:18:41.567 --> 00:18:43.839
and this did not prevent growth from happening.

00:18:43.839 --> 00:18:47.282
And also, extreme inequality can be bad

00:18:47.282 --> 00:18:49.480
for our democratic institutions

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.863
if it creates very unequal access to political voice,

00:18:51.863 --> 00:18:53.728
and the influence of private money

00:18:53.728 --> 00:18:55.730
in U.S. politics, I think,

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.270
is a matter of concern right now.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.346
So we don't want to return to that kind of extreme,

00:19:01.346 --> 00:19:03.436
pre-World War I inequality.

00:19:03.436 --> 00:19:07.110
Having a decent share of the national wealth

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.500
for the middle class is not bad for growth.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.781
It is actually useful

00:19:11.781 --> 00:19:14.865
both for equity and efficiency reasons.

00:19:14.865 --> 00:19:16.530
BG: I said at the beginning

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.639
that your book has been criticized.

00:19:18.639 --> 00:19:19.880
Some of your data has been criticized.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.346
Some of your choice of data sets has been criticized.

00:19:22.346 --> 00:19:24.222
You have been accused of cherry-picking data

00:19:24.222 --> 00:19:26.959
to make your case. What do you answer to that?

00:19:26.959 --> 00:19:28.886
TP: Well, I answer that I am very happy

00:19:28.886 --> 00:19:31.353
that this book is stimulating debate.

00:19:31.353 --> 00:19:33.834
This is part of what it is intended for.

00:19:33.834 --> 00:19:37.128
Look, the reason why I put all the data online

00:19:37.128 --> 00:19:38.974
with all of the detailed computation

00:19:38.974 --> 00:19:41.308
is so that we can have 
an open and transparent

00:19:41.308 --> 00:19:42.977
debate about this.

00:19:42.977 --> 00:19:44.743
So I have responded point by point

00:19:44.743 --> 00:19:46.535
to every concern.

00:19:46.535 --> 00:19:49.648
Let me say that if I was to rewrite the book today,

00:19:49.648 --> 00:19:51.189
I would actually conclude

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:53.383
that the rise in wealth inequality,

00:19:53.383 --> 00:19:55.310
particularly in the United States,

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.683
has been actually higher
than what I report in my book.

00:19:57.683 --> 00:20:00.928
There is a recent study by Saez and Zucman

00:20:00.928 --> 00:20:02.520
showing, with new data

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.297
which I didn't have at the time of the book,

00:20:04.297 --> 00:20:06.824
that wealth concentration in the U.S. has risen

00:20:06.824 --> 00:20:08.760
even more than what I report.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.791
And there will be other data in the future.

00:20:10.791 --> 00:20:12.942
Some of it will go in different directions.

00:20:12.942 --> 00:20:17.041
Look, we put online almost every week

00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:19.975
new, updated series on the
World Top Income Database

00:20:19.975 --> 00:20:21.875
and we will keep doing so in the future,

00:20:21.875 --> 00:20:24.181
in particular in emerging countries,

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:27.110
and I welcome all of those who want to contribute

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.456
to this data collection process.

00:20:29.456 --> 00:20:32.264
In fact, I certainly agree

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:33.878
that there is not enough

00:20:33.878 --> 00:20:35.756
transparency about wealth dynamics,

00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:37.671
and a good way to have better data

00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:39.536
would be to have a wealth tax

00:20:39.536 --> 00:20:41.107
with a small tax rate to begin with

00:20:41.107 --> 00:20:43.446
so that we can all agree

00:20:43.446 --> 00:20:45.010
about this important evolution

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.337
and adapt our policies to whatever we observe.

00:20:48.337 --> 00:20:50.399
So taxation is a source of knowledge,

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:53.335
and that's what we need the most right now.

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:55.150
BG: Thomas Piketty, merci beaucoup.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:59.150
Thank you.
TP: Thank you. (Applause)
