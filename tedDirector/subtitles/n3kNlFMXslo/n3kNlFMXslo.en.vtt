00:00:12.902 --> 00:00:15.500
When people find out
I write about time management,

00:00:16.588 --> 00:00:18.263
they assume two things.

00:00:19.564 --> 00:00:22.548
One is that I'm always on time,

00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:24.984
and I'm not.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.870
I have four small children,

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.710
and I would like to blame them
for my occasional tardiness,

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:31.842
but sometimes it's just not their fault.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:35.112
I was once late to my own speech
on time management.

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:36.176
(Laughter)

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.773
We all had to just take a moment
together and savor that irony.

00:00:40.972 --> 00:00:44.191
The second thing they assume
is that I have lots of tips and tricks

00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:46.108
for saving bits of time here and there.

00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:49.846
Sometimes I'll hear from magazines
that are doing a story along these lines,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.197
generally on how to help their readers
find an extra hour in the day.

00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:56.507
And the idea is that we'll shave
bits of time off everyday activities,

00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:57.708
add it up,

00:00:57.732 --> 00:00:59.906
and we'll have time for the good stuff.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.964
I question the entire premise
of this piece, but I'm always interested

00:01:03.988 --> 00:01:06.671
in hearing what they've come
up with before they call me.

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:07.847
Some of my favorites:

00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:10.777
doing errands where you only
have to make right-hand turns --

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:11.829
(Laughter)

00:01:11.853 --> 00:01:13.999
Being extremely judicious
in microwave usage:

00:01:14.023 --> 00:01:16.746
it says three to three-and-a-half
minutes on the package,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.206
we're totally getting in on
the bottom side of that.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.969
And my personal favorite,
which makes sense on some level,

00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:25.745
is to DVR your favorite shows so you can
fast-forward through the commercials.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:28.061
That way, you save
eight minutes every half hour,

00:01:28.085 --> 00:01:30.182
so in the course of two hours
of watching TV,

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:31.749
you find 32 minutes to exercise.

00:01:31.773 --> 00:01:32.789
(Laughter)

00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:34.098
Which is true.

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:37.208
You know another way to find
32 minutes to exercise?

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:39.961
Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right?

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:41.001
(Laughter)

00:01:41.025 --> 00:01:44.499
Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits
of time here and there, add it up,

00:01:44.523 --> 00:01:46.807
we will finally get
to everything we want to do.

00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:49.743
But after studying how successful
people spend their time

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:52.404
and looking at their
schedules hour by hour,

00:01:52.428 --> 00:01:55.724
I think this idea
has it completely backward.

00:01:56.305 --> 00:01:59.947
We don't build the lives
we want by saving time.

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.126
We build the lives we want,

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:05.603
and then time saves itself.

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:08.345
Here's what I mean.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.063
I recently did a time diary project

00:02:10.087 --> 00:02:14.291
looking at 1,001 days in the lives
of extremely busy women.

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:16.959
They had demanding jobs,
sometimes their own businesses,

00:02:16.983 --> 00:02:19.118
kids to care for,
maybe parents to care for,

00:02:19.142 --> 00:02:20.472
community commitments --

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:22.309
busy, busy people.

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.006
I had them keep track
of their time for a week

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.343
so I could add up how much
they worked and slept,

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:30.176
and I interviewed them
about their strategies, for my book.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.189
One of the women whose time log I studied

00:02:32.213 --> 00:02:34.276
goes out on a Wednesday night
for something.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.929
She comes home to find
that her water heater has broken,

00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:39.589
and there is now water
all over her basement.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.834
If you've ever had anything
like this happen to you,

00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:45.738
you know it is a hugely damaging,
frightening, sopping mess.

00:02:45.762 --> 00:02:48.472
So she's dealing with the immediate
aftermath that night,

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:50.373
next day she's got plumbers coming in,

00:02:50.397 --> 00:02:53.897
day after that, professional cleaning
crew dealing with the ruined carpet.

00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:55.987
All this is being recorded
on her time log.

00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.311
Winds up taking seven hours of her week.

00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:00.473
Seven hours.

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:03.981
That's like finding
an extra hour in the day.

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:07.628
But I'm sure if you had asked her
at the start of the week,

00:03:07.652 --> 00:03:10.870
"Could you find seven hours
to train for a triathlon?"

00:03:11.893 --> 00:03:15.698
"Could you find seven hours
to mentor seven worthy people?"

00:03:15.722 --> 00:03:18.413
I'm sure she would've said
what most of us would've said,

00:03:18.437 --> 00:03:22.881
which is, "No -- can't you see
how busy I am?"

00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:25.318
Yet when she had to find seven hours

00:03:25.342 --> 00:03:28.141
because there is water
all over her basement,

00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:30.675
she found seven hours.

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:35.206
And what this shows us
is that time is highly elastic.

00:03:35.594 --> 00:03:37.637
We cannot make more time,

00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:41.840
but time will stretch to accommodate
what we choose to put into it.

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:44.933
And so the key to time management

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:47.776
is treating our priorities

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.847
as the equivalent
of that broken water heater.

00:03:52.162 --> 00:03:53.312
To get at this,

00:03:53.336 --> 00:03:56.781
I like to use language from one
of the busiest people I ever interviewed.

00:03:56.805 --> 00:03:59.093
By busy, I mean she was running
a small business

00:03:59.117 --> 00:04:00.586
with 12 people on the payroll,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.633
she had six children in her spare time.

00:04:02.657 --> 00:04:05.275
I was getting in touch with her
to set up an interview

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.795
on how she "had it all" -- that phrase.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.628
I remember it was a Thursday morning,

00:04:09.652 --> 00:04:11.659
and she was not available
to speak with me.

00:04:11.683 --> 00:04:12.839
Of course, right?

00:04:12.863 --> 00:04:15.282
But the reason she was
unavailable to speak with me

00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:17.246
is that she was out for a hike,

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.308
because it was a beautiful spring morning,

00:04:19.332 --> 00:04:20.895
and she wanted to go for a hike.

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.256
So of course this makes me
even more intrigued,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.456
and when I finally do catch up with her,
she explains it like this.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.747
She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do,

00:04:29.592 --> 00:04:33.205
every minute I spend, is my choice."

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.981
And rather than say,

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:37.434
"I don't have time to do x, y or z,"

00:04:37.893 --> 00:04:43.007
she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z
because it's not a priority."

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:48.077
"I don't have time," often means
"It's not a priority."

00:04:49.075 --> 00:04:51.963
If you think about it,
that's really more accurate language.

00:04:51.987 --> 00:04:54.551
I could tell you I don't have time
to dust my blinds,

00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:55.744
but that's not true.

00:04:55.768 --> 00:04:58.208
If you offered to pay me $100,000
to dust my blinds,

00:04:58.232 --> 00:04:59.832
I would get to it pretty quickly.

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:00.872
(Laughter)

00:05:00.896 --> 00:05:02.531
Since that is not going to happen,

00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:05.159
I can acknowledge this is not
a matter of lacking time;

00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:06.784
it's that I don't want to do it.

00:05:06.808 --> 00:05:10.194
Using this language reminds us
that time is a choice.

00:05:10.218 --> 00:05:11.391
And granted,

00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:14.447
there may be horrible consequences
for making different choices,

00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:15.677
I will give you that.

00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:17.323
But we are smart people,

00:05:17.347 --> 00:05:19.205
and certainly over the long run,

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.229
we have the power to fill our lives

00:05:21.253 --> 00:05:23.929
with the things that deserve to be there.

00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:26.492
So how do we do that?

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:28.559
How do we treat our priorities

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:30.914
as the equivalent
of that broken water heater?

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:33.850
Well, first we need
to figure out what they are.

00:05:33.874 --> 00:05:36.628
I want to give you two strategies
for thinking about this.

00:05:36.652 --> 00:05:38.410
The first, on the professional side:

00:05:38.434 --> 00:05:40.945
I'm sure many people
coming up to the end of the year

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.292
are giving or getting
annual performance reviews.

00:05:43.316 --> 00:05:45.581
You look back over
your successes over the year,

00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:47.650
your "opportunities for growth."

00:05:47.674 --> 00:05:49.697
And this serves its purpose,

00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:53.151
but I find it's more effective
to do this looking forward.

00:05:53.175 --> 00:05:55.769
So I want you to pretend
it's the end of next year.

00:05:56.326 --> 00:05:58.687
You're giving yourself
a performance review,

00:05:58.711 --> 00:06:03.227
and it has been an absolutely
amazing year for you professionally.

00:06:04.034 --> 00:06:09.821
What three to five things did you do
that made it so amazing?

00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:14.534
So you can write next
year's performance review now.

00:06:14.558 --> 00:06:16.805
And you can do this
for your personal life, too.

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:19.458
I'm sure many of you,
like me, come December,

00:06:19.482 --> 00:06:23.028
get cards that contain these folded up
sheets of colored paper,

00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:28.321
on which is written what is known
as the family holiday letter.

00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:29.983
(Laughter)

00:06:30.007 --> 00:06:32.638
Bit of a wretched genre
of literature, really,

00:06:32.662 --> 00:06:35.946
going on about how amazing
everyone in the household is,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.257
or even more scintillating,

00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:39.456
how busy everyone in the household is.

00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:41.464
But these letters serve a purpose,

00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:43.695
which is that they tell
your friends and family

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:47.044
what you did in your personal life
that mattered to you over the year.

00:06:47.068 --> 00:06:48.452
So this year's kind of done,

00:06:48.476 --> 00:06:50.926
but I want you to pretend
it's the end of next year,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.704
and it has been an absolutely amazing year

00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:56.825
for you and the people you care about.

00:06:57.391 --> 00:07:02.094
What three to five things did you do
that made it so amazing?

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:06.980
So you can write next
year's family holiday letter now.

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:08.982
Don't send it.

00:07:09.006 --> 00:07:10.022
(Laughter)

00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:12.684
Please, don't send it.

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:14.439
But you can write it.

00:07:14.463 --> 00:07:18.177
And now, between the performance
review and the family holiday letter,

00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:21.438
we have a list of six to ten goals
we can work on in the next year.

00:07:21.462 --> 00:07:24.261
And now we need to break
these down into doable steps.

00:07:24.285 --> 00:07:26.493
So maybe you want
to write a family history.

00:07:26.517 --> 00:07:28.770
First, you can read
some other family histories,

00:07:28.794 --> 00:07:30.056
get a sense for the style.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.287
Then maybe think about the questions
you want to ask your relatives,

00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:35.160
set up appointments to interview them.

00:07:35.184 --> 00:07:36.645
Or maybe you want to run a 5K.

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:39.830
So you need to find a race and sign up,
figure out a training plan,

00:07:39.854 --> 00:07:42.227
and dig those shoes
out of the back of the closet.

00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:44.193
And then -- this is key --

00:07:44.217 --> 00:07:48.312
we treat our priorities as the equivalent
of that broken water heater,

00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:51.335
by putting them into our schedules first.

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:56.639
We do this by thinking through our weeks
before we are in them.

00:07:56.663 --> 00:08:00.347
I find a really good time to do this
is Friday afternoons.

00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:03.433
Friday afternoon is what
an economist might call

00:08:03.457 --> 00:08:05.994
a "low opportunity cost" time.

00:08:06.764 --> 00:08:09.664
Most of us are not sitting there
on Friday afternoons saying,

00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:11.567
"I am excited to make progress

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.887
toward my personal
and professional priorities

00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:15.065
right now."

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:16.105
(Laughter)

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:18.746
But we are willing to think
about what those should be.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.975
So take a little bit
of time Friday afternoon,

00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:27.189
make yourself a three-category priority
list: career, relationships, self.

00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:31.580
Making a three-category list reminds us

00:08:31.604 --> 00:08:35.094
that there should be something
in all three categories.

00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:36.374
Career, we think about;

00:08:36.398 --> 00:08:37.905
relationships, self --

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:39.248
not so much.

00:08:39.272 --> 00:08:41.170
But anyway, just a short list,

00:08:41.194 --> 00:08:42.623
two to three items in each.

00:08:43.013 --> 00:08:45.394
Then look out over the whole
of the next week,

00:08:45.418 --> 00:08:47.133
and see where you can plan them in.

00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:50.181
Where you plan them in is up to you.

00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:53.667
I know this is going to be more
complicated for some people than others.

00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:57.213
I mean, some people's lives
are just harder than others.

00:08:57.674 --> 00:09:00.943
It is not going to be easy
to find time to take that poetry class

00:09:00.967 --> 00:09:03.697
if you are caring for multiple
children on your own.

00:09:04.058 --> 00:09:05.229
I get that.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:07.460
And I don't want to minimize
anyone's struggle.

00:09:07.484 --> 00:09:12.010
But I do think that the numbers
I am about to tell you are empowering.

00:09:12.906 --> 00:09:16.913
There are 168 hours in a week.

00:09:17.962 --> 00:09:22.663
Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours.

00:09:23.295 --> 00:09:26.028
That is a lot of time.

00:09:26.627 --> 00:09:29.818
If you are working a full-time
job, so 40 hours a week,

00:09:29.842 --> 00:09:32.934
sleeping eight hours a night,
so 56 hours a week --

00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.538
that leaves 72 hours for other things.

00:09:36.622 --> 00:09:38.529
That is a lot of time.

00:09:38.956 --> 00:09:40.841
You say you're working 50 hours a week,

00:09:40.865 --> 00:09:42.811
maybe a main job and a side hustle.

00:09:42.835 --> 00:09:45.305
Well, that leaves 62 hours
for other things.

00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:47.229
You say you're working 60 hours.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.681
Well, that leaves 52 hours
for other things.

00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:51.747
You say you're working more than 60 hours.

00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:53.328
Well, are you sure?

00:09:53.352 --> 00:09:55.086
(Laughter)

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.016
There was once a study comparing
people's estimated work weeks

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.435
with time diaries.

00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:02.135
They found that people claiming
75-plus-hour work weeks

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:04.263
were off by about 25 hours.

00:10:04.287 --> 00:10:05.981
(Laughter)

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:08.326
You can guess in which direction, right?

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.780
Anyway, in 168 hours a week,

00:10:11.804 --> 00:10:14.768
I think we can find time
for what matters to you.

00:10:14.792 --> 00:10:16.990
If you want to spend
more time with your kids,

00:10:17.014 --> 00:10:19.319
you want to study more
for a test you're taking,

00:10:19.343 --> 00:10:22.688
you want to exercise for three hours
and volunteer for two,

00:10:22.712 --> 00:10:23.866
you can.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.531
And that's even if you're working
way more than full-time hours.

00:10:27.885 --> 00:10:29.937
So we have plenty of time, which is great,

00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:31.187
because guess what?

00:10:31.211 --> 00:10:34.049
We don't even need that much
time to do amazing things.

00:10:34.486 --> 00:10:37.233
But when most of us have
bits of time, what do we do?

00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:39.359
Pull out the phone, right?

00:10:39.826 --> 00:10:41.995
Start deleting emails.

00:10:42.381 --> 00:10:44.468
Otherwise, we're puttering
around the house

00:10:44.492 --> 00:10:45.752
or watching TV.

00:10:46.114 --> 00:10:48.967
But small moments can have great power.

00:10:49.657 --> 00:10:51.610
You can use your bits of time

00:10:52.094 --> 00:10:54.290
for bits of joy.

00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:58.064
Maybe it's choosing to read
something wonderful on the bus

00:10:58.088 --> 00:10:59.452
on the way to work.

00:10:59.476 --> 00:11:01.875
I know when I had a job
that required two bus rides

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:03.444
and a subway ride every morning,

00:11:03.468 --> 00:11:06.371
I used to go to the library
on weekends to get stuff to read.

00:11:06.395 --> 00:11:10.886
It made the whole experience
almost, almost, enjoyable.

00:11:11.857 --> 00:11:15.044
Breaks at work can be used
for meditating or praying.

00:11:15.434 --> 00:11:18.628
If family dinner is out
because of your crazy work schedule,

00:11:18.652 --> 00:11:21.401
maybe family breakfast
could be a good substitute.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.020
It's about looking at
the whole of one's time

00:11:25.044 --> 00:11:27.177
and seeing where the good stuff can go.

00:11:28.504 --> 00:11:30.217
I truly believe this.

00:11:31.054 --> 00:11:33.755
There is time.

00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:36.633
Even if we are busy,

00:11:37.223 --> 00:11:38.962
we have time for what matters.

00:11:39.752 --> 00:11:41.754
And when we focus on what matters,

00:11:42.312 --> 00:11:43.983
we can build the lives we want

00:11:44.765 --> 00:11:46.043
in the time we've got.

00:11:46.638 --> 00:11:47.793
Thank you.

00:11:47.817 --> 00:11:52.941
(Applause)
