00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.800
"Mom, who are these people?"

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.096
It was an innocent question
from my young daughter Alia

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.256
around the time when she was three.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.376
We were walking along with my husband

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.176
in one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.496
Alia was peering at a huge poster
standing tall in the middle of the mall.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.880
It featured the three rulers
of the United Arab Emirates.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.216
As she tucked in my side,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.456
I bent down and explained
that these were the rulers of the UAE

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.736
who had worked hard
to develop their nation

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.000
and preserve its unity.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.896
She asked, "Mom, why is it
that here where we live,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.576
and back in Lebanon,
where grandma and grandpa live,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.736
we never see the pictures
of powerful women on the walls?

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.640
Is it because women are not important?"

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.856
This is probably the hardest question
I've had to answer in my years as a parent

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.320
and in my 16-plus years
of professional life, for that matter.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.096
I had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.576
the younger of two daughters
to a very hard-working pilot

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.216
and director of operations
for the Lebanese Airlines

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.040
and a super-supportive
stay-at-home mom and grandma.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.056
My father had encouraged
my sister and I to pursue our education

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.376
even though our culture
emphasized at the time

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.400
that it was sons and not daughters
who should be professionally motivated.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.016
I was one of very few girls
of my generation

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.440
who left home at 18 to study abroad.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.296
My father didn't have a son,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.320
and so I, in a sense, became his.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.576
Fast-forward a couple of decades,
and I hope I didn't do too badly

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.200
in making my father proud
of his would-be son.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.816
As I got my Bachelor's and PhD
in electrical engineering,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.680
did R&amp;D in the UK,
then consulting in the Middle East,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.960
I have always been
in male-dominated environments.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.200
Truth be told, I have never found
a role model I could truly identify with.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.002
My mother's generation
wasn't into professional leadership.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.056
There were some
encouraging men along the way,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.240
but none knew the demands
and pressures I was facing,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.639
pressures that got particularly acute
when I had my own two beautiful children.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:26.320
And although Western women love to give us
poor, oppressed Arab women advice,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.920
they live different lives
with different constraints.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.216
So Arab women of my generation
have had to become our own role models.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.496
We have had to juggle more than Arab men,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.880
and we have had to face
more cultural rigidity than Western women.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.816
As a result, I would like to think
that we poor, oppressed women

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.320
actually have some useful,
certainly hard-earned lessons to share,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.016
lessons that might turn out useful

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.600
for anyone wishing to thrive
in the modern world.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.736
Here are three of mine.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.616
["Convert their sh*t into your fuel."]

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.856
(Laughter)

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.680
(Applause)

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.656
There is this word that everybody
is touting as the key to success:

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.920
resilience.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.560
Well, what exactly is resilience,
and how do you develop it?

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.800
I believe resilience is simply
the ability to transform shit into fuel.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.456
In my previous job,
well before my current firm,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.600
I was working with a man
we will call John.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.816
I had teamed up with John
and was working hard,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.816
hoping he would notice how great I was

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.160
and that he would come to support
my case to make partner at the firm.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.216
I was, in addition to delivering
on my consulting projects,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.400
writing passionately on the topic
of women economic empowerment.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.920
One day, I got to present my research
to a roomful of MBA students.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.136
John was part of the audience

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.800
listening for the first time
to the details of my study.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.296
As I proceeded with my presentation,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.520
I could see John in the corner of my eye.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.536
He had turned a dark shade of pink

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.360
and had slid under his chair
in apparent shame.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.296
I finished my presentation
to an applauding audience

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.400
and we rushed out and jumped into the car.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.360
There he exploded.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.216
"What you did up there was unacceptable!

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.440
You are a consultant, not an activist!"

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.056
I said, "John, I don't understand.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.736
I presented a couple of
gender parity indices,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.815
and some conclusions about the Arab world.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:32.815
Yes, we do happen to be today
at the bottom of the index,

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:36.040
but what is it that I said or presented
that was not factual?"

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.096
To which he replied,
"The whole premise of your study is wrong.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.960
What you are doing is dangerous and will
break the social fabric of our society."

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.096
He paused, then added,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.520
"When women have children,
their place is in the home."

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.616
Time stood still for a long while,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.336
and all I could think and repeat
in the chaos of my brain was:

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.536
"You can forget about
that partnership, Leila.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.132
It's just never going to happen."

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.576
It took me a couple of days to fully
absorb this incident and its implications,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.240
but once I did,
I reached three conclusions.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.696
One, that these were his issues,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.216
his complexes.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.296
There may be many like him in our society,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.520
but I would never let
their issues become mine.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.336
Two, that I needed
another sponsor, and fast.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.576
(Laughter)

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.816
I got one, by the way,
and boy, was he great.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.256
And three, that I would get to show John
what women with children can do.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.696
I apply this lesson equally well
to my personal life.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.496
As I have progressed in my career,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.976
I have received many words
of encouragement,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.296
but I have also often been met
by women, men and couples

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.056
who have clearly had an issue
with my husband and I

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.600
having chosen the path
of a dual-career couple.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.696
So you get this well-meaning couple

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.976
who tells you straight out
at a family gathering

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.256
or at a friends gathering,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.709
that, come on, you must know
you're not a great mom,

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:01.293
given how much you're investing
in your career, right?

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.416
I would lie if I said
these words didn't hurt.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.896
My children are the most
precious thing to me,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.600
and the thought that I could be
failing them in any way is intolerable.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.016
But just like I did with John,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.656
I quickly reminded myself
that these were their issues,

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.880
their complexes.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.816
So instead of replying,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.136
I gave back one of my largest smiles

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.016
as I saw, in flashing light,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.176
the following sign in my mind's eye.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.256
[Be happy, it drives people crazy.]

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.520
(Applause)

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.096
You see, as a young woman
in these situations, you have two options.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.976
You can either decide
to internalize these negative messages

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.616
that are being thrown at you,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.616
to let them make you feel like a failure,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.216
like success is way too hard
to ever achieve,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.656
or you can choose to see that others'
negativity is their own issue,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.720
and instead transform it
into your own personal fuel.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.056
I have learned
to always go for option two,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.200
and I have found that it has taken me
from strength to strength.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.256
And it's true what they say:

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.440
success is the best revenge.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.376
Some women in the Middle East

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.816
are lucky enough to be married
to someone supportive of their career.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.296
Correction: I should say "smart enough,"

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.696
because who you marry is your own choice,

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.320
and you'd better marry someone supportive
if you plan to have a long career.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.536
Still today, the Arab man
is not an equal contributor in the home.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.776
It's simply not expected by our society,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.240
and even frowned upon as not very manly.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.056
As for the Arab woman,
our society still assumes

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.816
that her primary source of happiness
should be the happiness and prosperity

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.776
of her children and husband.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.240
She mostly exists for her family.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.736
Things are changing,
but it will take time.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.256
For now, it means
that the professional Arab woman

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.616
has to somehow maintain the perfect home,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.736
make sure that her children's every need
is being taken care of

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.760
and manage her demanding career.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.096
To achieve this, I have found the hard way

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.896
that you need to apply your hard-earned
professional skills to your personal life.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.360
You need to work your life.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.240
Here is how I do this in my personal life.

00:08:12.998 --> 00:08:14.856
One thing to know about the Middle East

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.320
is that nearly every family
has access to affordable domestic help.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.320
The challenge therefore becomes
how to recruit effectively.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.456
Just like I would in my business life,
I have based the selection

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.536
of who would support me
with my children while I'm at work

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.760
on a strong referral.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.216
Cristina had worked
for four years with my sister

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.560
and the quality of her work
was well-established.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.136
She is now an integral
member of our family,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.760
having been with us
since Alia was six months old.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.895
She makes sure that the house
is running smoothly while I'm at work,

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:49.135
and I make sure to empower her

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:52.336
in the most optimal conditions
for her and my children,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.559
just like I would my best talent at work.

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:59.136
This lesson applies
whatever your childcare situation,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.576
whether an au pair, nursery,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.936
part-time nanny
that you share with someone else.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.800
Choose very carefully, and empower.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.376
If you look at my calendar,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.376
you will see every working day

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.096
one and a half hours
from 7pm to 8:30pm UAE time

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.080
blocked and called "family time."

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.336
This is sacred time.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.760
I have done this
ever since Alia was a baby.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.456
I do everything in my power
to protect this time

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.896
so that I can be home by then
to spend quality time with my children,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.320
asking them about their day,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.256
checking up on homework,
reading them a bedtime story

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.856
and giving them
lots of kisses and cuddles.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.376
If I'm traveling,
in whatever the time zone,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.880
I use Skype to connect with my children
even if I am miles away.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.256
Our son Burhan is five years old,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.840
and he's learning to read
and do basic maths.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.496
Here's another confession:

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.256
I have found that our daughter
is actually more successful

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.176
at teaching him these skills than I am.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.920
(Laughter)

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.856
It started as a game, but Alia loves
playing teacher to her little brother,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.056
and I have found that these sessions
actually improve Burhan's literacy,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.456
increase Alia's sense of responsibility,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.456
and strengthen the bonding between them,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.760
a win-win all around.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.736
The successful Arab women I know

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.896
have each found their unique approach
to working their life

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.296
as they continue to shoulder

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.016
the lion's share
of responsibility in the home.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.656
But this is not just
about surviving in your dual role

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.376
as a career woman and mother.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.920
This is also about being in the present.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.856
When I am with my children,

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.296
I try to leave work out of our lives.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.336
Instead of worrying about how many minutes
I can spend with them every day,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.136
I focus on turning these minutes
into memorable moments,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.376
moments where I'm seeing my kids,

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.216
hearing them, connecting with them.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.016
["Join forces, don't compete."]

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.816
Arab women of my generation
have not been very visible

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.936
in the public eye as they grew up.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.856
This explains, I think, to some extent,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.560
why you find so few women
in politics in the Arab world.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.816
The upside of this, however,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.936
is that we have spent a lot of time

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.400
developing a social skill
behind the scenes,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.816
in coffee shops, in living rooms,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.056
on the phone,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.856
a social skill that is
very important to success:

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.536
networking.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.216
I would say the average Arab woman

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.776
has a large network
of friends and acquaintances.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.800
The majority of those are also women.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.376
In the West, it seems like ambitious women
often compare themselves to other women

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.560
hoping to be noticed as the most
successful woman in the room.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.136
This leads to the much-spoken-about
competitive behavior

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.480
between professional women.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.736
If there's only room
for one woman at the top,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.600
then you can't make room for others,
much less lift them up.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.256
Arab women, generally speaking,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.520
have not fallen
for this psychological trap.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.216
Faced with a patriarchal society,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.576
they have found
that by helping each other out,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.840
all benefit.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.296
In my previous job, I was the most
senior woman in the Middle East,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.176
so one could think that investing
in my network of female colleagues

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.776
couldn't bring many benefits

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.056
and that I should instead invest my time

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.800
developing my relationships
with male seniors and peers.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.320
Yet two of my biggest breaks
came through the support of other women.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.656
It was the head of marketing
who initially suggested

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.976
I be considered as a young global leader
to the World Economic Forum.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.976
She was familiar with my media engagements
and my publications,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.096
and when she was asked
to voice her opinion,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.360
she highlighted my name.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.936
It was a young consultant,
a Saudi lady and friend,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.696
who helped me sell
my first project in Saudi Arabia,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.920
a market I was finding hard
to gain traction in as a woman.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.336
She introduced me to a client,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.496
and that introduction led to the first
of very many projects for me in Saudi.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.976
Today, I have two senior women on my team,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.240
and I see making them successful
as key to my own success.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.296
Women continue to advance in the world,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.696
not fast enough, but we're moving.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.816
The Arab world, too, is making progress,
despite many recent setbacks.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.456
Just this year, the UAE appointed
five new female ministers to its cabinet,

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.800
for a total of eight female ministers.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.056
That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.896
and more than many
developed countries can claim.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.280
This is today my daughter
Alia's favorite picture.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.856
This is the result,
no doubt, of great leadership,

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.496
but it is also the result
of strong Arab women

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.496
not giving up and continuously
pushing the boundaries.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.656
It is the result of Arab women
deciding every day like me

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.456
to convert shit into fuel,

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.016
to work their life
to keep work out of their life,

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.080
and to join forces and not compete.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.376
As I look to the future,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.936
my hopes for my daughter
when she stands on this stage

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.776
some 20, 30 years from now

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.896
are that she be as proud
to call herself her mother's daughter

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.160
as her father's daughter.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.496
My hopes for my son

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.136
are that by then, the expression
"her mother's son" or "mama's boy"

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.560
would have taken on
a completely different meaning.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.336
Thank you.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:01.068
(Applause)
