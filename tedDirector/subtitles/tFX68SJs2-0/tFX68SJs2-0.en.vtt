00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I know what you're thinking.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
You think I've lost my way,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and guide me gently back to my seat.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.260
(Applause)

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
I get that all the time in Dubai.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
"Here on holiday are you, dear?"

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
(Laughter)

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
"Come to visit the children?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
How long are you staying?"

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
for over 30 years.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.260
(Applause)

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Now that statistic

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
is quite shocking.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And I want to talk to you today

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
about language loss

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and the globalization of English.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
I want to tell you about my friend

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And one fine day,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
she decided to take them into the garden

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
to teach them some nature vocabulary.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
But it was she who ended up learning

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
all the Arabic words for the local plants,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
as well as their uses --

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
medicinal uses, cosmetics,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
cooking, herbal.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
How did those students get all that knowledge?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Of course, from their grandparents

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and even their great-grandparents.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
It's not necessary to tell you how important it is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
to be able to communicate

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
across generations.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
But sadly, today,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
languages are dying

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
at an unprecedented rate.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
A language dies every 14 days.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Now, at the same time,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
English is the undisputed global language.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Could there be a connection?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Well I don't know.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
When I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
in the days when it was still a hardship post.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Actually, not that long ago.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
That is a little bit too early.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
But nevertheless,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
I was recruited by the British Council,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
along with about 25 other teachers.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And we were the first non-Muslims

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
We were brought to teach English

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.260
because the government wanted to modernize the country

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and to empower the citizens through education.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And of course, the U.K. benefited

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
from some of that lovely oil wealth.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Okay.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Now this is the major change that I've seen --

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
how teaching English

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
has morphed

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.260
from being a mutually beneficial practice

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
to becoming a massive international business that it is today.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.260
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and no longer the sole domain

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
of mother England,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
it has become a bandwagon

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
for every English-speaking nation on earth.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
And why not?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
After all, the best education --

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
according to the latest World University Rankings --

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
is to be found in the universities

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
of the U.K. and the U.S.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.260
So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
But if you're not a native speaker,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
you have to pass a test.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Now can it be right

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
to reject a student

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
on linguistic ability alone?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Perhaps you have a computer scientist

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
who's a genius.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Well, I don't think so.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
We English teachers reject them all the time.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
We put a stop sign,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and we stop them in their tracks.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
They can't pursue their dream any longer,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
'til they get English.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Now let me put it this way:

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.260
if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
who had the cure for cancer,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
would I stop him from entering my British University?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
I don't think so.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
But indeed, that is exactly what we do.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
We English teachers are the gatekeepers.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And you have to satisfy us first

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
that your English is good enough.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Now it can be dangerous

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
to give too much power

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
to a narrow segment of society.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Maybe the barrier would be too universal.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Okay.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
"But," I hear you say,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
"what about the research?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
It's all in English."

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
So the books are in English,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
the journals are done in English,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
It feeds the English requirement.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And so it goes on.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
I ask you, what happened to translation?

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.260
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
there was lots of translation then.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
They translated from Latin and Greek

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
into Arabic, into Persian,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and then it was translated on

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
into the Germanic languages of Europe

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and the Romance languages.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Now don't get me wrong;

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
I am not against teaching English,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
all you English teachers out there.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
I love it that we have a global language.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
We need one today more than ever.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
But I am against using it

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
as a barrier.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and the main one being English, or Chinese?

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
We need more than that. Where do we draw the line?

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
This system

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
equates intelligence

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
with a knowledge of English,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
which is quite arbitrary.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:07.260
(Applause)

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And I want to remind you

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
that the giants upon whose shoulders

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
today's intelligentsia stand

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
did not have to have English,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
they didn't have to pass an English test.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Case in point, Einstein.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
He, by the way, was considered remedial at school

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
because he was, in fact, dyslexic.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
But fortunately for the world,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
he did not have to pass an English test.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
Because they didn't start until 1964

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
with TOEFL,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
the American test of English.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
Now it's exploded.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
There are lots and lots of tests of English.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And millions and millions of students

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
take these tests every year.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Now you might think, you and me,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
"Those fees aren't bad, they're okay,"

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
but they are prohibitive

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
to so many millions of poor people.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
So immediately, we're rejecting them.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
(Applause)

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
It brings to mind a headline I saw recently:

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
"Education: The Great Divide."

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Now I get it,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
I understand why people would want to focus on English.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
They want to give their children the best chance in life.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
And to do that, they need a Western education.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
Because, of course, the best jobs

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
go to people out of the Western Universities,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
that I put on earlier.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
It's a circular thing.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Okay.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
Let me tell you a story about two scientists,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
two English scientists.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
They were doing an experiment

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
to do with genetics

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
But they couldn't get the results they wanted.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
They really didn't know what to do,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
until along came a German scientist

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
who realized that they were using two words

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
for forelimb and hind limb,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.260
whereas genetics does not differentiate

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
and neither does German.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
So bingo,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
problem solved.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
If you can't think a thought,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
you are stuck.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
But if another language can think that thought,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
then, by cooperating,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
we can achieve and learn so much more.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
My daughter

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
came to England from Kuwait.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
It's an Arabic-medium school.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
And she was the best in the class

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
at those subjects.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Which tells us

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
that when students come to us from abroad,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
we may not be giving them enough credit

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
for what they know,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
and they know it in their own language.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
When a language dies,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
we don't know what we lose with that language.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.260
This is -- I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently --

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
they gave the Heroes Award

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
to a young Kenyan shepherd boy

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
who couldn't study at night in his village,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
like all the village children,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
because the kerosene lamp,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
it had smoke and it damaged his eyes.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
And anyway, there was never enough kerosene,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
because what does a dollar a day buy for you?

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
So he invented

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
a cost-free solar lamp.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
And now the children in his village

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
get the same grades at school

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.260
as the children who have electricity at home.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:33.260
(Applause)

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
When he received his award,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
he said these lovely words:

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
"The children can lead Africa from what it is today,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
a dark continent,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
to a light continent."

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
A simple idea,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
but it could have such far-reaching consequences.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
People who have no light,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
whether it's physical or metaphorical,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
cannot pass our exams,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
and we can never know what they know.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Let us not keep them and ourselves

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
in the dark.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Let us celebrate diversity.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Mind your language.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.260
Use it to spread great ideas.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:23.260
(Applause)

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
Thank you very much.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
(Applause)
