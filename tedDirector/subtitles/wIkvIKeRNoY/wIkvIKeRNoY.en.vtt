00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.261
So, I have an overlooked
but potentially lucrative

00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:19.264
investment opportunity for you.

00:00:20.447 --> 00:00:22.861
Over the past 10 years in the UK,

00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:26.320
the return on burial plots
has outperformed the UK property market

00:00:26.344 --> 00:00:28.647
by a ratio of around three to one.

00:00:29.924 --> 00:00:33.746
There are private cemeteries being set up
with plots for sale to investors,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.914
and they start at around 3,900 pounds.

00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:40.460
And they're projected to achieve
about 40 percent growth.

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:45.552
The biggest advantage is that this
is a market with continuous demand.

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:50.061
Now, this is a real proposition,

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:54.531
and there are companies out there
that really are offering this investment,

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.317
but my interest in it is quite different.

00:00:57.713 --> 00:00:59.755
I'm an architect and urban designer,

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:01.370
and for the past year and a half,

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.394
I've been looking at approaches
to death and dying

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:07.729
and at how they've shaped our cities
and the buildings within them.

00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:11.675
So in the summer,
I did my first exhibition

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:14.215
on death and architecture in Venice,

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:16.119
and it was called "Death in Venice."

00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:18.564
And because death is a subject

00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:21.645
that many of us find quite
uncomfortable to talk about,

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:23.994
the exhibition was designed
to be quite playful,

00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:26.517
so that people would
literally engage with it.

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:30.427
So one of our exhibits
was an interactive map of London

00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:33.469
which showed just how much
of the real estate in the city

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.443
is given over to death.

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:37.649
As you wave your hand across the map,

00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:41.178
the name of the piece of real estate --
the building or the cemetery --

00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:42.352
is revealed.

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.473
And those white shapes that you can see,

00:01:45.497 --> 00:01:48.406
they're all of the hospitals and hospices

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.161
and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city.

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:53.247
In fact, the majority are cemeteries.

00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:58.354
We wanted to show that, even though
death and burial are things

00:01:58.378 --> 00:01:59.869
that we might not think about,

00:01:59.893 --> 00:02:03.423
they're all around us, and they're
important parts of our cities.

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:08.495
So about half a million people
die in the UK each year,

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.548
and of those, around a quarter
will want to be buried.

00:02:11.572 --> 00:02:15.512
But the UK, like many
Western European countries,

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:17.211
is running out of burial space,

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:19.115
especially in the major cities.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.186
And the Greater London Authority
has been aware of this for a while,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.678
and the main causes are population growth,

00:02:26.702 --> 00:02:29.543
the fact that existing
cemeteries are almost full.

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:33.874
There's a custom in the UK that graves
are considered to be occupied forever,

00:02:33.898 --> 00:02:37.625
and there's also development pressure --
people want to use that same land

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:41.208
to build houses or offices or shops.

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:43.697
So they came up with a few solutions.

00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:47.764
They were like, well, maybe we can
reuse those graves after 50 years.

00:02:47.788 --> 00:02:50.101
Or maybe we can bury people,
like, four deep,

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:53.113
so that four people can be buried
in the same plot,

00:02:53.137 --> 00:02:55.780
and we can make more efficient use
of the land that way,

00:02:55.804 --> 00:02:59.144
and in that way, hopefully London
will still have space to bury people

00:02:59.168 --> 00:03:00.319
in the near future.

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:03.768
But, traditionally, cemeteries
haven't been taken care of

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:05.532
by the local authority.

00:03:05.556 --> 00:03:08.922
In fact, the surprising thing is that
there's no legal obligation

00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:11.975
on anyone in the UK
to provide burial space.

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:17.282
Traditionally, it's been done
by private and religious organizations,

00:03:17.306 --> 00:03:20.117
like churches and mosques and synagogues.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.435
But there's also occasionally
been a for-profit group

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.476
who has wanted to get in on the act.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.005
And, you know, they look at
the small size of a burial plot

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:31.697
and that high cost,

00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:34.213
and it looks like there's
serious money to be made.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.294
So, actually, if you want to go out
and start your own cemetery,

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.741
you kind of can.

00:03:39.765 --> 00:03:41.901
There was this couple in South Wales,

00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:45.161
and they had a farmhouse
and a load of fields next to it,

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:47.316
and they wanted to develop the land.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.741
They had a load of ideas.

00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:51.879
They first thought about making
a caravan park,

00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:53.617
but the council said no.

00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:55.609
And then they wanted to make a fish farm

00:03:55.633 --> 00:03:57.354
and again the council said no.

00:03:57.751 --> 00:04:00.422
Then they hit on the idea
of making a cemetery

00:04:00.446 --> 00:04:02.502
and they calculated that by doing this,

00:04:02.526 --> 00:04:05.043
they could increase
the value of their land

00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:09.796
from about 95,000 pounds
to over one million pounds.

00:04:10.802 --> 00:04:15.561
But just to come back to this idea
of making profit from cemeteries,

00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:17.655
like, it's kind of ludicrous, right?

00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:21.780
The thing is that the high cost
of those burial plots

00:04:21.804 --> 00:04:23.920
is actually very misleading.

00:04:23.944 --> 00:04:25.731
They look like they're expensive,

00:04:25.755 --> 00:04:29.957
but that cost reflects the fact that
you need to maintain the burial plot --

00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:33.289
like, someone has to cut the grass
for the next 50 years.

00:04:33.313 --> 00:04:36.210
That means it's very difficult
to make money from cemeteries.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:39.059
And it's the reason that normally
they're run by the council

00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:41.079
or by a not-for-profit group.

00:04:41.103 --> 00:04:43.754
But anyway, the council granted
these people permission,

00:04:43.778 --> 00:04:46.229
and they're now trying
to build their cemetery.

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:49.573
So just to explain to you
kind of how this works:

00:04:49.597 --> 00:04:51.654
If I want to build something in the UK,

00:04:51.678 --> 00:04:53.870
like a cemetery for example,

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:56.868
then I have to apply
for planning permission first.

00:04:56.892 --> 00:05:01.102
So if I want to build a new
office building for a client

00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:03.380
or if I want to extend my home

00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:07.173
or, you know, if I have a shop
and I want to convert it into an office,

00:05:07.197 --> 00:05:08.728
I have to do a load of drawings,

00:05:08.752 --> 00:05:11.188
and I submit them
to the council for permission.

00:05:11.212 --> 00:05:15.169
And they'll look at things like
how it fits in the surroundings.

00:05:15.193 --> 00:05:17.225
So they'll look at what it looks like.

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.845
But they'll also think about things
like what impact is it going to have

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:22.344
on the local environment?

00:05:22.368 --> 00:05:24.408
And they'll be thinking about things like,

00:05:24.432 --> 00:05:26.273
is this thing going to cause pollution

00:05:26.297 --> 00:05:28.225
or is there going to be a lot of traffic

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.582
that wants to go to this thing
that I've built?

00:05:30.606 --> 00:05:31.986
But also good things.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.327
Is it going to add local services
like shops to the neighborhood

00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:37.413
that local people would like to use?

00:05:38.183 --> 00:05:40.877
And they'll weigh up the advantages
and the disadvantages

00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:42.337
and they'll make a decision.

00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:46.880
So that's how it works if I want
to build a large cemetery.

00:05:47.356 --> 00:05:49.350
But what if I've got a piece of land

00:05:49.374 --> 00:05:52.692
and I just want to bury
a few people, like five or six?

00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:57.152
Well, then -- actually, I don't need
permission from anyone!

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.216
There's actually almost no regulation
in the UK around burial,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.883
and the little bit that there is,
is about not polluting water courses,

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.517
like not polluting rivers or groundwater.

00:06:08.962 --> 00:06:11.986
So actually, if you want to go
and make your own mini-cemetery,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.305
then you can.

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.757
But I mean, like -- really,
who does this? Right?

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:21.629
Well, if you're an aristocratic family
and you have a large estate,

00:06:21.653 --> 00:06:24.336
then there's a chance that you'll
have a mausoleum on it,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.169
and you'll bury your family there.

00:06:26.708 --> 00:06:28.867
But the really weird thing

00:06:28.891 --> 00:06:32.260
is that you don't need to have
a piece of land of a certain size

00:06:32.284 --> 00:06:34.886
before you're allowed
to start burying people on it.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.855
And so that means that, technically,

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:40.568
this applies to, like, the back garden
of your house in the suburbs.

00:06:40.592 --> 00:06:41.921
(Laughter)

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.394
So what if you wanted
to try this yourself at home?

00:06:46.418 --> 00:06:50.466
Well, there's a few councils
that have guidance on their website

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.877
which can help you.

00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:53.995
So, the first thing that they tell you

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:57.755
is that you need to have a certificate
of burial before you can go ahead --

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:01.127
you're not allowed to just murder people
and put them under the patio.

00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:03.151
(Laughter)

00:07:04.253 --> 00:07:08.056
They also tell you that you need to keep
a record of where the grave is.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.713
But that's pretty much it
for formal requirements.

00:07:10.737 --> 00:07:13.739
Now, they do warn you that
your neighbors might not like this,

00:07:13.763 --> 00:07:17.666
but, legally speaking, there's almost
nothing that they can do about it.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.856
And just in case any of you
still had that profit idea in your mind

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.141
about how much those burial plots cost

00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:27.513
and how much money
you might be able to make,

00:07:27.537 --> 00:07:30.283
they also warn that it might cause
the value of your house

00:07:30.307 --> 00:07:32.037
to drop by 20 percent.

00:07:32.515 --> 00:07:34.262
Although, actually, it's more likely

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:37.254
that no one will want to buy
your house at all after that.

00:07:38.341 --> 00:07:40.900
So what I find fascinating about this

00:07:40.924 --> 00:07:45.589
is the fact that it kind of sums up
many of our attitudes towards death.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.696
In the UK, and I think that the figures
across Europe are probably similar,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.831
only about 30 percent of people
have ever talked to anyone

00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:55.547
about their wishes around death,

00:07:55.571 --> 00:07:57.481
and even for people over 75,

00:07:57.505 --> 00:08:01.091
only 45 percent of people
have ever talked about this.

00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:04.139
And the reasons that
people give ... you know,

00:08:04.163 --> 00:08:05.984
they think that their death is far off

00:08:06.008 --> 00:08:08.885
or they think that they're going
to make people uncomfortable

00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:10.295
by talking about it.

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:12.074
And you know, to a certain extent,

00:08:12.098 --> 00:08:15.736
there are other people out there
who are taking care of things for us.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.441
The government has all this regulation
and bureaucracy around things

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:21.698
like burying a death, for example,

00:08:21.722 --> 00:08:23.691
and there's people like funeral directors

00:08:23.715 --> 00:08:26.311
who devote their entire
working lives to this issue.

00:08:26.335 --> 00:08:27.841
But when it comes to our cities

00:08:27.865 --> 00:08:30.907
and thinking about how
death fits in our cities,

00:08:30.931 --> 00:08:34.980
there's much less regulation
and design and thought

00:08:35.004 --> 00:08:36.320
than we might imagine.

00:08:36.344 --> 00:08:38.558
So we're not thinking about this,

00:08:38.582 --> 00:08:41.482
but all of the people we imagine
are thinking about it --

00:08:41.506 --> 00:08:43.551
they're not taking care of it either.

00:08:43.575 --> 00:08:44.733
Thank you.

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:47.715
(Applause)
