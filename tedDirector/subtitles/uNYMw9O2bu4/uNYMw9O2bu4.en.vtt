00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
I'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity, actually,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
so I thought I'd make my life more complex, as a serious play.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
So, I'm going to, like, go through some slides 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
from way back when,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
So, basically it all began with 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
this whole idea of a computer.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
Who has a computer? Yeah.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
O.K., so, everyone has a computer.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
Even a mobile phone, it's a computer. 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
And -- anyone remember this workbook, 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
"Instant Activities for Your Apple" -- 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
free poster in each book?

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
This was how computing began. 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.160
Don't forget: a computer came out; it had no software. 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
You'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in, 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
and it would do absolutely nothing at all. 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
So, you had to program it, 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
and there were great programming, like, tutorials, like this. 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
I mean, this was great. 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
It's, like, you know, Herbie the Apple II.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
It's such a great way to -- 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
I mean, they should make Java books like this, 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
and we've have no problem learning a program. 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
But this was a great, grand time of the computer, 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.160
when it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era. 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
And, you see,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
this era coincided with my own childhood.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle. 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Who of you grew up in a family business, 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
suffered the torture? Yes, yes.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture? 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
It was just life-changing, you know. And so, in my life, you know, I was in the tofu; 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
it was a family business. 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
And my mother was a kind of a designer, also. 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
She'd make this kind of, like, wall of tofu cooking, 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
and it would confuse the customers, 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
because they all thought it was a restaurant.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
A bad sort of branding thing, or whatever. 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
But, anyway, that's where I grew up, 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
in this little tofu factory in Seattle, 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
and it was kind of like this: 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
That's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really: 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
he would invent, like, ways to make things heavy.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
Like back here, there's like, concrete block technology here, 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu, 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing, 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
and so you have to have heavy stuff 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
to push out the liquid and make it hard. 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
Tofu comes out in these big batches, 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
and my father would sort of cut them by hand. 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
I can't tell you -- family business story: you'd understand this -- 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
my father was the most sincere man possible. 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
He walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
slipped, broke his arm, rushed out:

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
he didn't want to inconvenience Safeway. 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
So, instead, you know, my father's, like, arm's broken 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
for two weeks in the store, and that week -- 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
now, those two weeks were when my older brother and I 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
had to do everything.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
And that was torture, real torture. 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
Because, you see, we'd seen my father 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
taking the big block of tofu and cutting it,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
like, knife in, zap, zap, zap. We thought, wow. 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
So, the first time I did that, I went, like, whoa! Like this. 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Bad blocks. But anyways, 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
the tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
And because working in a store was so hard, 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
I liked going to school; it was like heaven. 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
And I was really good at school. 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
So, when I got to MIT, you know, 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
as most of you who are creatives,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
your parents all told you not to be creative, right? 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
So, same way, you know, 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
I was good at art and good at math, and my father says, he's --

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
John's good at math. 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
I went to MIT, did my math, 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
but I had this wonderful opportunity,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
because computers had just become visual. 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
The Apple -- Macintosh just came out; 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT. 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
And it was a time when a guy who, kind of, 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
could cross the two sides --

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
it was a good time. 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
And so, I remember that my first major piece of software 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
was on a direct copy of then-Aldus PageMaker. 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
I made a desktop publishing system way back when, 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
and that was, kind of, my first step into figuring out how to -- 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
oh, these two sides are kind of fun to mix. 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
And the problem when you're younger --

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
for all you students out there --

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
is, your head gets kind of big really easy. 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
And when I was making icons, I was, like, 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
the icon master,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
and I was, like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know. 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
And then luckily, you know, 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
I had the fortune of going to something called a library, 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
and in the library I came upon this very book. 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
I found this book. It's called, 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.160
"Thoughts on Design," by a man named Paul Rand.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
It's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this. 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy, Paul Rand, 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
who was one of the greatest graphic designers, 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
and also a great writer as well. 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
And when I saw this man's work, 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
I realized how bad I was at design,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
or whatever I called it back then, 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
and I suddenly had a kind of career goal, 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
kind of in hot pursuit.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
So I kind of switched. I went to MIT, finished. 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
I got my masters,
and then went to art school after that.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
And just began to design stuff,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
like chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus -- whatever I could get a handle on:

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
sort of wheel-and-deal, move up in the design world, whatever. 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
And isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
Remember that moment -- publishing your designs? 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
Remember that moment? It felt so good, didn't it? 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.160
So, I was published, you know, 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
so, wow, my design's in a book, you know? 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160
After that, things kind of got strange, 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
and I got thinking about the computer, 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
because the computer to me always, kind of, bothered me. 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
I didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
was a kind of crusty designer, 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
you know, a crusty designer, like a good -- kind of like a good French bread? 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
You know, he wrote in one of his books: 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
"A Yale student once said,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
'I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.' 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
Design schools take heed." 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
This is in the '80s,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
in the great clash of computer/non-computer people.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
A very difficult time, actually. 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
And this to me was an important message from Rand. 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time. 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
This is the first sort of play thing I did, my own serious play. 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.160
I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator-ish thing. 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
It looks like Illustrator; it can, like, draw. 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
It was very hard to make this, actually. 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
It took a month to make this part. 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
And then I thought, what if I added this feature, 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
where I can say, this point, 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
you can fly like a bird. You're free, kind of thing.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.160
So I could, sort of, change the kind of stability 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
with a little control there on the dial, 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
and I can sort of watch it flip around. 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
And this is in 1993. 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.160
And when my professors saw this, they were very upset at me. 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
They were saying, Why's it moving? 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
They were saying, Make it stop now.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
Now, I was saying, Well, that's the whole point: it's moving.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
And he says, Well, when's it going to stop?

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.160
And I said, Never.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
And he said, Even worse. Stop it now.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
I started studying this whole idea, 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
of like, what is this computer? It's a strange medium.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
It's not like print. It's not like video. 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium. 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
So, I went off with this, 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160
and began to look for things even more.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
And so in Japan, I began to experiment with people. 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
This is actually bad: human experiments. 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
I would do these things where I'd have students become pens: 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
there's blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen. 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
And someone sits down and draws a picture. 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
They're laughing because he said, 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
draw from the middle-right to the middle, and he kind of messed up.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
See, humans don't know how to take orders; 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
the computer's so good at it. 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once: 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
you know, you, pen, do this, and you, pen, do this.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
And so began to have multiple pens on the page --

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
again, hard to do with our hands. 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
And then someone discovered this "a-ha moment" 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.160
where you could use coordinate systems. 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160
We thought, ah, this is when it's going to happen. 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
In the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing. 

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
It became computerish; we began to think computerish -- 

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
the X, Y system -- and so that was kind of a revelation. 

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people, 

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
called a human-powered computer. 

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
So, this happened in 1993.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160
Sound down, please. 

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.160
It's a computer where the people are the parts. 

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.160
I have behind this wall a disk drive, a CPU, 

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
a graphics card, a memory system. 

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard. 

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
It's put inside the computer. 

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
And that little program's on that cardboard disk. 

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
So, she wears the disk, 

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.160
and reads the data off the sectors of the disk,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.160
and the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really. 

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
I had a moment of -- what is it called? -- 

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.160
the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast. 

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.160
This computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard, 

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
and people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160
And this computer's programmed to do only one thing, which is,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
if you move your mouse, the mouse changes on the screen. 

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
On the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around. 

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
On this computer, if you move the mouse, it takes half an hour 

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
for the mouse cursor to change. 

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
To give you a sense of the speed, the scale: 

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
the computer is just so amazingly fast, O.K.?

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
And so, after this I began to do experiments for different companies.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
This is something I did for Sony in 1996. 

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
It was three Sony "H" devices 

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
that responded to sound.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
So, if you talk into the mike,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160
you'll hear some music in your headphones; 

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
if you talk in the phone, then video would happen. 

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
So, I began to experiment with industry in different ways 

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
with this kind of mixture of skills. 

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.160
I did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol, but I do drink sometimes. 

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
And Chanel. So, getting to do different projects. 

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
And also, one thing I realized is that 

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
I like to make things.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
We like to make things. It's fun to make things. 

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.160
And so I never developed the ability to have a staff. 

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
I have no staff; it's all kind of made by hand -- 

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
these sort of broken hands.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
And these hands were influenced 

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
by this man, Mr. Inami Naomi.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
This guy was my kind of like mentor. 

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo. 

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
He's the guy that kind of discovered me, 

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
and kind of got me going in digital media. 

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
He was such an inspirational guy. 

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
I remember, like, we'd be in his studio, like, at 2 a.m., 

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
and then he'd show up from some client meeting. 

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
He'd come in and say, you know, 

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
If I am here, everything is okay.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
And you'd feel so much better, you know. 

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.160
And I'll never forget how, like, but -- I'll never forget how, like,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
he had a sudden situation with his -- he had an aneurysm. 

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
He went into a coma.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
And so, for three years he was out, and he could only blink, 

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
and so I realized at this moment, I thought, wow --

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
how fragile is this thing we're wearing, 

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
this body and mind we're wearing, 

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
and so I thought, How do you go for it more? 

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
How do you take that time you have left and go after it? 

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
So, Naomi was pivotal in that. 

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
And so, I began to think more carefully about the computer. 

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
This was a moment where I was thinking about, 

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
so, you have a computer program, 

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.160
it responds to motion -- X and Y -- 

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160
and I realized that each computer program 

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.160
has all these images inside the program.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
So, if you can see here, you know, 

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
that program you're seeing in the corner,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160
if you spread it out, it's all these things all at once. 

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160
It's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with. 

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
We're so used to working in one vector. 

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
This is all at the same time.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
The computer lives in so many dimensions. 

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160
And also, at the same time I was frustrated, 

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere, 

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
and there were these, like, "the computer lab," you know, 

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
and this is, like, in the late 1990s, 

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
and this is in Basel,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
a great graphic design school.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
And here's this, like, dirty, kind of, shoddy, 

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160
kind of, dark computer room. 

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
And I began to wonder, Is this the goal? 

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
Is this what we want, you know? 

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
And also, I began to be fascinated by machines -- 

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
you know, like copy machines -- and so this is actually in Basel.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive -- 

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
this is, like, a touch screen -- 

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
and I noticed how you can only touch five places, 

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
and so, "why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere?" 

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
became a question. And also, the sound: 

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.160
I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone. 

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
You get it? No? O.K.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
And also, I discovered in Logan airport, 

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
this was, like, calling out to me. 

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
Do you hear that? It's like cows. This is at 4 a.m. at Logan. 

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
So, I was wondering, like, 

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.160
what is this thing in front of me, this computer thing? 

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
It didn't make any sense. 

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
So, I began to make things again. This is another series of objects

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
made of old computers from my basement. 

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
I made -- I took my old Macintoshes 

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
and made different objects out of them from Tokyo. 

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves, 

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160
so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots. 

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
I made this series of works. 

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle 

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
as a kind of display that's sort of thinking, 

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.160
I'm abstract art. What am I? I'm abstract.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.160
And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction. 

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
I began to be fascinated by plastic, 

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160
so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks 

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
perfectly optically transparent, 

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.160
as a kind of release of stress.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
Because of that, I became interested in blue tape, 

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
so in San Francisco, at C.C., I had a whole exhibition on blue tape.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
I made a whole installation out of blue tape -- blue painters' tape.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.160
And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me, 

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.160
so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think, 

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
Well, what else is there in life? 

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
And so computers, as you know, 

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
these big computers, there are now tiny computers. 

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
They're littler computers, so the one-chip computers, 

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
I began to program one-chip computers 

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160
and make objects out of P.C. boards, LEDs.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
I began to make LED sculptures 

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.160
that would live inside little boxes out of MDF. 

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy. 

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.160
Very simple boxes: you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs. 

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp: 

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
it's sort of a plastic rice lamp;

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
it's very friendly. 

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.160
I did a show in London last year made out of iPods -- 

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
I used iPods as a material. 

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
So I took 16 iPod Nanos 

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160
and made a kind of a Nano fish, basically.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
Recently, this is for Reebok. 

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
I've done shoes for Reebok as well,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
as a kind of a hobby for apparel. 

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.160
So anyways, there are all these things you can do, 

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
but the thing I love the most is to 

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160
experience, taste the world.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
The world is just so tasty. 

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
We think we'll go to a museum; that's where all the tastes are. 

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
No, they're all out there. 

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
So, this is, like, in front of the Eiffel Tower, really,

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160
actually, around the Louvre area. 

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
This I found, where nature had made a picture for me. 

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160
This is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature. 

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
In this strange moment where, like, these things kind of appeared.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
We all are creative people. 

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
We have this gene defect in our mind.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
We can't help but stop, right? This feeling's a wonderful thing. 

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
It's the forever-always-on museum. 

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
This is from the Cape last year. 

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design, 

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
which we know as circle-triangle-square. 

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
It's everywhere on the beach, I discovered. 

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.160
I began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square. 

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
I put these all back, by the way. 

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
And I also discovered how .

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.160
some rocks are twins separated at birth.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
This is also out there, you know. 

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
I'm, like, how did this happen, kind of thing? 

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
I brought you guys together again. 

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
So, three years ago I discovered, the letters M-I-T 

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
occurring in simplicity and complexity. 

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
My alma mater, MIT, and I had this moment -- 

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.160
a kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment -- 

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
where I thought, Whoa! I have to do this.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.160
And I went after it with passion. 

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.160
However, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose --

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
going to RISD -- and I couldn't reconcile this real easy, 

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.160
because the letters had told me, MIT forever. 

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
But I discovered in the French word raison d'être. 

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160
I was, like, aha, wait a second. 

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.160
And there RISD appeared. 

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.160
And so I realized it was O.K. to go.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.160
So, I'm going to RISD, actually. 

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
Who's a RISD alum out there? 

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160
RISD alums? Yeah, RISD. There we go, RISD. Woo, RISD.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Art Center -- Art Center is good, too.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.160
RISD is kind of my new kind of passion, 

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
and I'll tell you a little bit about that. 

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
So, RISD is -- 

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160
I was outside RISD,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
and some student wrote this on some block, and I thought,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
Wow, RISD wants to know what itself is. 

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160
And I have no idea what RISD should be, actually, 

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
or what it wants to be, but one thing I have to tell you is that

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.160
although I'm a technologist, I don't like technology very much. 

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.160
It's a, kind of, the qi thing, or whatever. 

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.160
People say, 

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160
Are you going to bring RISD into the future?

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
And I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD. 

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
There's my perspective. Because in reality, 

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160
the problem isn't how to make the world more technological. 

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160
It's about how to make it more humane again. 

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.160
And if anything, I think RISD has a strange DNA. 

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.160
It's a strange exuberance

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
about materials, about the world:

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.160
a fascination that I think the world needs 

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.160
quite very much right now.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.160
So, thank you everyone.
