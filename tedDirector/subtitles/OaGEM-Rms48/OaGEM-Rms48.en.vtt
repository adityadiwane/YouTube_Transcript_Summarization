00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.096
Periods.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.496
Blood.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.720
Menstruation.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.016
Gross.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.656
Secret.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.880
Hidden.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.600
Why?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.656
A natural biological process

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.496
that every girl and woman
goes through every month

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.696
for about half of her life.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.416
A phenomenon that is so significant

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.640
that the survival and propagation
of our species depends on it.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.320
Yet we consider it a taboo.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.040
We feel awkward
and shameful talking about it.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.656
When I got my first periods,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040
I was told to keep it
a secret from others --

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.640
even from my father and brother.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.256
Later when this chapter
appeared in our textbooks,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.616
our biology teacher skipped the subject.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.320
(Laughter)

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.680
You know what I learned from it?

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.520
I learned that it is really
shameful to talk about it.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.736
I learned to be ashamed of my body.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.816
I learned to stay unaware of periods

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.800
in order to stay decent.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.256
Research in various parts of India

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.016
shows that three out of every 10 girls
are not aware of menstruation

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.800
at the time of their first periods.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.016
And in some parts of Rajasthan

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.880
this number is as high as nine
out of 10 girls being unaware of it.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.456
You'd be surprised to know

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.696
that most of the girls
that I have spoken to,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.536
who did not know about periods
at the time of their first menstruation

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.936
thought that they have got blood cancer

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.560
and they're going to die soon.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.696
Menstrual hygiene
is a very important risk factor

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.280
for reproductive tract infections.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.216
But in India, only 12 percent
of girls and women

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.000
have access to hygienic ways
of managing their periods.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.336
If you do the math,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.456
88 percent of girls and women use
unhygienic ways to manage their periods.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.680
I was one of them.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.816
I grew up in a small town
called Garhwa, in Jharkhand,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.960
where even buying a sanitary napkin
is considered shameful.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.895
So when I started getting my periods,

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.680
I began with using rags.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.216
After every use
I would wash and reuse them.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.496
But to store them,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.136
I would hide and keep it
in a dark, damp place

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.760
so that nobody finds out
that I'm menstruating.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.136
Due to repeated washing
the rags would become coarse,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
and I would often get rashes
and infections using them.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.160
I wore these already for five years
until I moved out of that town.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.976
Another issue
that periods brought in my life

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.296
those of the social restrictions

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.656
that are imposed upon our girls
and women when they're on their periods.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.976
I think you all must be aware of it,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.960
but I'll still list it
for the few who don't.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.200
I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.696
I was not allowed to sit on the sofa
or some other family member's bed.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.176
I had to wash my bed sheet
after every period,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.136
even if it was not stained.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.976
I was considered impure

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.800
and forbidden from worshipping or touching
any object of religious importance.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.096
You'll find signposts outside temples

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.560
denying the entry
of menstruating girls and women.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.456
Ironically,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.296
most of the time it is the older woman

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.760
who imposes such restrictions
on younger girls in a family.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.536
After all, they have grown up
accepting such restrictions as norms.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.576
And in the absence of any intervention,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.616
it is the myth and misconception

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.240
that propagate
from generation to generation.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.096
During my years of work in this field,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.616
I have even come across stories

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.256
where girls have to eat
and wash their dishes separately.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.616
They're not allowed
to take baths during periods,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.720
and in some households they are even
secluded from other family members.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.256
About 85 percent of girls
and women in India

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.600
would follow one or more restrictive
customs on their periods every month.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.856
Can you imagine what this does

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.840
to the self-esteem
and self-confidence of a young girl?

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.456
The psychological trauma
that this inflicts,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.056
affecting her personality,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.816
her academic performance

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.480
and every single aspect of growing up
during her early formative years?

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.800
I religiously followed all these
restrictive customs for 13 years,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.776
until a discussion with my partner, Tuhin,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.360
changed my perception
about menstruation forever.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.736
In 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing
our postgraduation in design.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.416
We fell in love with each other

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.880
and I was at ease
discussing periods with him.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.560
Tuhin knew little about periods.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.800
(Laughter)

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.416
He was astonished to know
that girls get painful cramps

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.856
and we bleed every month.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.976
(Laughter)

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.496
Yeah.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.296
He was completely shocked to know

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.496
about the restrictions that are imposed
upon menstruating girls and women

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.096
by their own families and their society.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.176
In order to help me with my cramps,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.000
he would go on the Internet
and learn more about menstruation.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.336
When he shared his findings with me,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.360
I realized how little I knew
about menstruation myself.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.080
And many of my beliefs
actually turned out to be myths.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.896
That's when we wondered:

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.256
if we, being so well educated,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.376
were so ill-informed about menstruation,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.400
there would be millions of girls out there
who would be ill-informed, too.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.976
To study --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.776
to understand the problem better,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.416
I undertook a year-long research to study
the lack of awareness about menstruation

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.040
and the root cause behind it.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.696
While it is generally believed

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.696
that menstrual unawareness
and misconception is a rural phenomenon,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.936
during my research,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.936
I found that it is as much
an urban phenomenon as well.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.320
And it exists with the educated
urban class, also.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.776
While talking to many
parents and teachers,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.096
I found that many of them actually
wanted to educate girls about periods

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.760
before they have started
getting their menstrual cycle.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.056
And --

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.616
but they lacked
the proper means themselves.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.896
And since it is a taboo,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.960
they feel inhibition
and shameful in talking about it.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.456
Girls nowadays get their periods
in classes six and seven,

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.096
but our educational curriculum

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.920
teaches girls about periods
only in standard eight and nine.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.360
And since it is a taboo,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.440
teachers still
skip the subject altogether.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.096
So school does not
teach girls about periods,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.256
parents don't talk about it.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.680
Where do the girls go?

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.520
Two decades ago and now --

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.400
nothing has changed.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.940
I shared these finding with Tuhin
and we wondered:

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.576
What if we could create something

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.176
that would help girls understand
about menstruation on their own --

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.416
something that would help
parents and teachers

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.360
talk about periods
comfortably to young girls?

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.456
During my research,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.456
I was collecting a lot of stories.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.160
These were stories of experiences
of girls during their periods.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.056
These stories would make girls
curious and interested

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.016
in talking about menstruation
in their close circle.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.496
That's what we wanted.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.856
We wanted something
that would make the girls curious

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.056
and drive them to learn about it.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.240
We wanted to use these stories
to teach girls about periods.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.456
So we decided to create a comic book,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.736
where the cartoon characters
would enact these stories

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.640
and educate girls about menstruation
in a fun and engaging way.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.376
To represent girls
in their different phases of puberty,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.040
we have three characters.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.736
Pinki, who has not gotten her period yet,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.256
Jiya who gets her period
during the narrative of the book

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.536
and Mira who has already
been getting her period.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.976
There is a fourth character, Priya Didi.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.536
Through her, girls come to know
about the various aspects of growing up

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.360
and menstrual hygiene management.

00:08:32.455 --> 00:08:34.398
While making the book, we took great care

00:08:34.423 --> 00:08:38.376
that none of the illustrations
were objectionable in any way

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.360
and that it is culturally sensitive.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.056
During our prototype testing,
we found that the girls loved the book.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.456
They were keen on reading it

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.240
and knowing more and more
about periods on their own.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:53.056
Parents and teachers were
comfortable in talking about periods

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.775
to young girls using the book,

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:57.776
and sometimes even boys
were interested in reading it.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.936
(Laughter)

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.720
(Applause)

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.656
The comic book helped
in creating an environment

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.120
where menstruation ceased to be a taboo.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.776
Many of the volunteers took this prototype
themselves to educate girls

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.736
and take menstrual awareness workshops
in five different states in India.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.136
And one of the volunteers
took this prototype to educate young monks

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.376
and took it to this monastery in Ladakh.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.736
We made the final version of the book,
called "Menstrupedia Comic"

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.520
and launched in September last year.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.496
And so far,

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.856
more than 4,000 girls have been
educated by using the book in India and --

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.536
(Applause)

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.776
Thank you.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.120
(Applause)

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.040
And 10 different countries.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.176
We are constantly translating the book
into different languages

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.936
and collaborating with local organizations

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.616
to make this book available
in different countries.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.576
15 schools in different parts of India

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.016
have made this book
a part of their school curriculum

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.816
to teach girls about menstruation.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.240
(Applause)

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.776
I am amazed to see how volunteers,

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.936
individuals, parents,
teachers, school principals,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.456
have come together

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.736
and taken this menstrual awareness
drive to their own communities,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.456
have made sure that the girls
learn about periods at the right age

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.640
and helped in breaking this taboo.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.336
I dream of a future
where menstruation is not a curse,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.896
not a disease,

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.360
but a welcoming change in a girl's life.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.336
And I would --

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.480
(Applause)

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.336
And I would like to end this

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.256
with a small request
to all the parents here.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.480
Dear parents,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.456
if you would be ashamed of periods,

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.696
your daughters would be, too.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.176
So please be period positive.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.416
(Laughter)

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.656
Thank you.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.403
(Applause)
