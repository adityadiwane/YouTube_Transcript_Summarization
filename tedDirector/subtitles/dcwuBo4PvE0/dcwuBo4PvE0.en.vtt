00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.536
I am British.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.696
(Laughter)

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.856
(Applause)

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.656
Never before has the phrase
"I am British" elicited so much pity.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.776
(Laughter)

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.536
I come from an island
where many of us like to believe

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.680
there's been a lot of continuity
over the last thousand years.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.136
We tend to have historically
imposed change on others

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.480
but done much less of it ourselves.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.816
So it came as an immense shock to me

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.616
when I woke up on the morning of June 24

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.496
to discover that my country
had voted to leave the European Union,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.376
my Prime Minister had resigned,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.976
and Scotland was considering a referendum

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.840
that could bring to an end
the very existence of the United Kingdom.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.856
So that was an immense shock for me,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.160
and it was an immense
shock for many people,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.536
but it was also something
that, over the following several days,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.296
created a complete political meltdown

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.776
in my country.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.016
There were calls for a second referendum,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.576
almost as if, following a sports match,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.120
we could ask the opposition for a replay.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.336
Everybody was blaming everybody else.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.936
People blamed the Prime Minister

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.136
for calling the referendum
in the first place.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.616
They blamed the leader of the opposition
for not fighting it hard enough.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.896
The young accused the old.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.800
The educated blamed
the less well-educated.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.536
That complete meltdown was made even worse

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.656
by the most tragic element of it:

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.536
levels of xenophobia and racist abuse
in the streets of Britain

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.816
at a level that I have never seen before

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.080
in my lifetime.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.176
People are now talking about whether
my country is becoming a Little England,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.296
or, as one of my colleagues put it,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.496
whether we're about to become
a 1950s nostalgia theme park

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.536
floating in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.640
(Laughter)

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.376
But my question is really,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.680
should we have the degree of shock
that we've experienced since?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.816
Was it something
that took place overnight?

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.336
Or are there deeper structural factors
that have led us to where we are today?

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.936
So I want to take a step back
and ask two very basic questions.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.856
First, what does Brexit represent,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.416
not just for my country,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.176
but for all of us around the world?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.376
And second, what can we do about it?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.736
How should we all respond?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.280
So first, what does Brexit represent?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.200
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.896
Brexit teaches us many things
about our society

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.280
and about societies around the world.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.616
It highlights in ways
that we seem embarrassingly unaware of

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.360
how divided our societies are.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.176
The vote split along lines of age,
education, class and geography.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.096
Young people didn't turn out
to vote in great numbers,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.336
but those that did wanted to remain.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.096
Older people really wanted
to leave the European Union.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.616
Geographically, it was London and Scotland
that most strongly committed

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.656
to being part of the European Union,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.800
while in other parts of the country
there was very strong ambivalence.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.376
Those divisions are things we really
need to recognize and take seriously.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.256
But more profoundly,
the vote teaches us something

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.616
about the nature of politics today.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.896
Contemporary politics
is no longer just about right and left.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.656
It's no longer just about tax and spend.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.616
It's about globalization.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.456
The fault line of contemporary politics is
between those that embrace globalization

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.480
and those that fear globalization.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.600
(Applause)

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.336
If we look at why
those who wanted to leave --

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.896
we call them "Leavers,"
as opposed to "Remainers" --

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.136
we see two factors in the opinion polls

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.536
that really mattered.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.896
The first was immigration,
and the second sovereignty,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.376
and these represent a desire for people
to take back control of their own lives

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.280
and the feeling that they
are unrepresented by politicians.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.936
But those ideas are ones
that signify fear and alienation.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.976
They represent a retreat
back towards nationalism and borders

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.079
in ways that many of us would reject.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.816
What I want to suggest is the picture
is more complicated than that,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.376
that liberal internationalists,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.616
like myself, and I firmly
include myself in that picture,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.176
need to write ourselves
back into the picture

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.280
in order to understand
how we've got to where we are today.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.296
When we look at the voting patterns
across the United Kingdom,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.520
we can visibly see the divisions.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.576
The blue areas show Remain

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.696
and the red areas Leave.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.976
When I looked at this,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.856
what personally struck me
was the very little time in my life

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.096
I've actually spent
in many of the red areas.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.256
I suddenly realized that,
looking at the top 50 areas in the UK

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.136
that have the strongest Leave vote,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.560
I've spent a combined total
of four days of my life in those areas.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.056
In some of those places,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.656
I didn't even know the names
of the voting districts.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.536
It was a real shock to me,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.616
and it suggested that people like me

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.736
who think of ourselves
as inclusive, open and tolerant,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.456
perhaps don't know
our own countries and societies

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.096
nearly as well as we like to believe.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.000
(Applause)

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.976
And the challenge that comes from that
is we need to find a new way

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.096
to narrate globalization to those people,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.496
to recognize that for those people who
have not necessarily been to university,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.936
who haven't necessarily
grown up with the Internet,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.976
that don't get opportunities to travel,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.856
they may be unpersuaded
by the narrative that we find persuasive

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.080
in our often liberal bubbles.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.040
(Applause)

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.496
It means that we need to reach out
more broadly and understand.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.536
In the Leave vote, a minority have peddled
the politics of fear and hatred,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.056
creating lies and mistrust

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.016
around, for instance,
the idea that the vote on Europe

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.176
could reduce the number of refugees
and asylum-seekers coming to Europe,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.456
when the vote on leaving
had nothing to do with immigration

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.440
from outside the European Union.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.656
But for a significant majority
of the Leave voters

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.336
the concern was disillusionment
with the political establishment.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.536
This was a protest vote for many,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.016
a sense that nobody represented them,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.456
that they couldn't find
a political party that spoke for them,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.720
and so they rejected
that political establishment.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.496
This replicates around Europe
and much of the liberal democratic world.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.416
We see it with the rise in popularity
of Donald Trump in the United States,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.496
with the growing nationalism
of Viktor OrbÃ¡n in Hungary,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.216
with the increase in popularity
of Marine Le Pen in France.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.120
The specter of Brexit
is in all of our societies.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.096
So the question I think we need to ask
is my second question,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.640
which is how should we
collectively respond?

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.256
For all of us who care about creating
liberal, open, tolerant societies,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.936
we urgently need a new vision,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.656
a vision of a more tolerant,
inclusive globalization,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.480
one that brings people with us
rather than leaving them behind.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.576
That vision of globalization

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.416
is one that has to start by a recognition
of the positive benefits of globalization.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.016
The consensus amongst economists

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.816
is that free trade,
the movement of capital,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.776
the movement of people across borders

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.536
benefit everyone on aggregate.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.256
The consensus amongst
international relations scholars

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.896
is that globalization
brings interdependence,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.856
which brings cooperation and peace.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.336
But globalization
also has redistributive effects.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.096
It creates winners and losers.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.256
To take the example of migration,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.936
we know that immigration is a net positive
for the economy as a whole

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.480
under almost all circumstances.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.136
But we also have to be very aware

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.216
that there are
redistributive consequences,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.696
that importantly, low-skilled immigration

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.135
can lead to a reduction in wages
for the most impoverished in our societies

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.296
and also put pressure on house prices.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.856
That doesn't detract
from the fact that it's positive,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.775
but it means more people
have to share in those benefits

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:53.080
and recognize them.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.096
In 2002, the former Secretary-General
of the United Nations, Kofi Annan,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.016
gave a speech at Yale University,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.016
and that speech was on the topic
of inclusive globalization.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.096
That was the speech
in which he coined that term.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.896
And he said, and I paraphrase,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.256
"The glass house of globalization
has to be open to all

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.840
if it is to remain secure.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.536
Bigotry and ignorance

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:31.136
are the ugly face of exclusionary
and antagonistic globalization."

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.336
That idea of inclusive globalization
was briefly revived in 2008

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.936
in a conference on progressive governance

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.400
involving many of the leaders
of European countries.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.136
But amid austerity
and the financial crisis of 2008,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.256
the concept disappeared
almost without a trace.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.736
Globalization has been taken
to support a neoliberal agenda.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.696
It's perceived to be
part of an elite agenda

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.296
rather than something that benefits all.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.936
And it needs to be reclaimed
on a far more inclusive basis

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.160
than it is today.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.456
So the question is,
how can we achieve that goal?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.216
How can we balance on the one hand
addressing fear and alienation

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.656
while on the other hand
refusing vehemently

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.456
to give in to xenophobia and nationalism?

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.616
That is the question for all of us.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.456
And I think, as a social scientist,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.280
that social science
offers some places to start.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.216
Our transformation has to be about
both ideas and about material change,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.856
and I want to give you four ideas
as a starting point.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.416
The first relates to the idea
of civic education.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.216
What stands out from Brexit

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.296
is the gap between public perception
and empirical reality.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.016
It's been suggested that we've moved
to a postfactual society,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.696
where evidence and truth no longer matter,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.816
and lies have equal status
to the clarity of evidence.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.096
So how can we --

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.816
(Applause)

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.016
How can we rebuild respect for truth
and evidence into our liberal democracies?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.976
It has to begin with education,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.320
but it has to start with the recognition
that there are huge gaps.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.616
In 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.936
published a survey
on attitudes to immigration,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.976
and it showed that as numbers
of immigrants increase,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.216
so public concern
with immigration also increases,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.656
although it obviously
didn't unpack causality,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.816
because this could equally be to do
not so much with numbers

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.240
but the political
and media narrative around it.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.576
But the same survey also revealed

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.736
huge public misinformation

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.496
and misunderstanding
about the nature of immigration.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.736
For example, in these attitudes
in the United Kingdom,

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.496
the public believed that levels of asylum

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.936
were a greater proportion
of immigration than they were,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.416
but they also believed
the levels of educational migration

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.536
were far lower as a proportion
of overall migration

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.056
than they actually are.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.736
So we have to address this misinformation,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.256
the gap between perception and reality
on key aspects of globalization.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.096
And that can't just be something
that's left to our schools,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.536
although that's important
to begin at an early age.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.616
It has to be about lifelong
civic participation

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.800
and public engagement
that we all encourage as societies.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.776
The second thing
that I think is an opportunity

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.416
is the idea to encourage more interaction
across diverse communities.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.040
(Applause)

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.736
One of the things that stands out
for me very strikingly,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.616
looking at immigration attitudes
in the United Kingdom,

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.416
is that ironically,
the regions of my country

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.345
that are the most tolerant of immigrants

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:51.136
have the highest numbers of immigrants.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.496
So for instance, London and the Southeast
have the highest numbers of immigrants,

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.656
and they are also by far
the most tolerant areas.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.296
It's those areas of the country
that have the lowest levels of immigration

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.840
that actually are the most exclusionary
and intolerant towards migrants.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.736
So we need to encourage exchange programs.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.216
We need to ensure that older generations
who maybe can't travel

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.376
get access to the Internet.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.096
We need to encourage,
even on a local and national level,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.976
more movement, more participation,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.696
more interaction
with people who we don't know

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.640
and whose views we might
not necessarily agree with.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.216
The third thing that I think
is crucial, though,

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.016
and this is really fundamental,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.336
is we have to ensure that everybody shares

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.600
in the benefits of globalization.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.256
This illustration from the Financial Times
post-Brexit is really striking.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.016
It shows tragically that those people
who voted to leave the European Union

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.856
were those who actually
benefited the most materially

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.400
from trade with the European Union.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.616
But the problem is
that those people in those areas

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.296
didn't perceive themselves
to be beneficiaries.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.096
They didn't believe that they
were actually getting access

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.840
to material benefits of increased trade
and increased mobility around the world.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.576
I work on questions
predominantly to do with refugees,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.256
and one of the ideas
I spent a lot of my time preaching,

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.056
mainly to developing countries
around the world,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.656
is that in order to encourage
the integration of refugees,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.016
we can't just benefit
the refugee populations,

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.080
we also have to address the concerns
of the host communities in local areas.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.816
But in looking at that,

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.856
one of the policy prescriptions
is that we have to provide

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.496
disproportionately better
education facilities, health facilities,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.296
access to social services

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.576
in those regions of high immigration

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.416
to address the concerns
of those local populations.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.096
But while we encourage that
around the developing world,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.696
we don't take those lessons home

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.560
and incorporate them in our own societies.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.536
Furthermore, if we're going
to really take seriously

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.896
the need to ensure people share
in the economic benefits,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.576
our businesses and corporations
need a model of globalization

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.200
that recognizes that they, too,
have to take people with them.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.496
The fourth and final idea
I want to put forward

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.400
is an idea that we need
more responsible politics.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.216
There's very little
social science evidence

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.056
that compares attitudes on globalization.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.616
But from the surveys that do exist,

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.376
what we can see is there's huge variation
across different countries

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.696
and time periods in those countries

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.096
for attitudes and tolerance

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.816
of questions like migration
and mobility on the one hand

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.896
and free trade on the other.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:40.176
But one hypothesis that I think emerges
from a cursory look at that data

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:46.296
is the idea that polarized societies
are far less tolerant of globalization.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.136
It's the societies
like Sweden in the past,

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.576
like Canada today,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.416
where there is a centrist politics,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.496
where right and left work together,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.536
that we encourage supportive attitudes
towards globalization.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.376
And what we see around the world today
is a tragic polarization,

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.416
a failure to have dialogue
between the extremes in politics,

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.216
and a gap in terms
of that liberal center ground

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.056
that can encourage communication
and a shared understanding.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.696
We might not achieve that today,

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.536
but at the very least we have to call
upon our politicians and our media

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.336
to drop a language of fear
and be far more tolerant of one another.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.240
(Applause)

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.576
These ideas are very tentative,

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.000
and that's in part because this needs
to be an inclusive and shared project.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.400
I am still British.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.080
I am still European.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.640
I am still a global citizen.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.216
For those of us who believe

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.336
that our identities
are not mutually exclusive,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.376
we have to all work together

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.096
to ensure that globalization
takes everyone with us

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.336
and doesn't leave people behind.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.936
Only then will we truly reconcile
democracy and globalization.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.176
Thank you.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:21.480
(Applause)
