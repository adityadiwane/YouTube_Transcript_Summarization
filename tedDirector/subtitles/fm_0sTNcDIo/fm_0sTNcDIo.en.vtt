00:00:12.877 --> 00:00:16.120
As a scientist, and also as a human being,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.124
I've been trying to make myself

00:00:18.124 --> 00:00:21.499
susceptible to wonder.

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.368
I think Jason Webley last night called it

00:00:24.368 --> 00:00:28.395
"conspiring to be part of the magic."

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.216
So it's fortunate that my career as a biologist

00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:33.860
lets me dive deeply into the lives

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.378
of some truly wondrous creatures

00:00:36.378 --> 00:00:38.757
that share our planet:

00:00:38.757 --> 00:00:40.452
fireflies.

00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:42.735
Now, for many of you, I know that fireflies

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:45.478
might conjure up some really great memories:

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.532
childhood, summertime,

00:00:48.532 --> 00:00:50.302
even other TED Talks.

00:00:50.302 --> 00:00:54.442
Maybe something like this.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.815
My seduction into the world of fireflies

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:03.664
began when I was back in graduate school.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:06.488
One evening, I was sitting out in my backyard

00:01:06.488 --> 00:01:08.426
in North Carolina,

00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:13.725
and suddenly, these silent sparks

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:15.579
rose up all around me,

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.961
and I began to wonder:

00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:19.651
How do these creatures make light,

00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:21.341
and what's with all this flashing?

00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:23.180
Are they talking to one another?

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.371
And what happens after the lights go out?

00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:27.662
I've been lucky enough to answer

00:01:27.662 --> 00:01:29.030
some of these questions

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.121
as I've explored this nocturnal world.

00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.460
Now if you've ever seen

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.561
or even heard about fireflies,

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:40.207
then you'll know how magically they can transform

00:01:40.207 --> 00:01:42.598
our everyday landscape into something

00:01:42.598 --> 00:01:44.501
ethereal and otherworldly,

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:46.442
and this happens around the globe,

00:01:46.442 --> 00:01:48.532
like this hillside in the Smoky Mountains

00:01:48.532 --> 00:01:52.618
that I saw transformed into a living cascade of light

00:01:52.618 --> 00:01:56.978
by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies,

00:01:56.978 --> 00:01:59.998
or a roadside river that I visited in Japan

00:01:59.998 --> 00:02:04.104
as it was giving birth to the slow, floating flashes

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:06.735
of these Genji fireflies,

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:09.297
or in Malaysia, the mangrove trees

00:02:09.297 --> 00:02:11.625
that I watched blossom nightly

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.055
not with flowers

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:15.923
but with the lights of a thousand — 
(Bleep! Bleep!) — fireflies,

00:02:15.923 --> 00:02:17.253
all blinking together

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:20.411
in stunning synchrony.

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:22.507
These luminous landscapes

00:02:22.507 --> 00:02:24.899
still fill me with wonder,

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.419
and they keep me connected to the magic

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.827
of the natural world.

00:02:29.827 --> 00:02:31.443
And I find it amazing that they're created

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:34.731
by these tiny insects.

00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:37.622
In person, fireflies are charming.

00:02:37.622 --> 00:02:39.435
They're charismatic.

00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:41.119
They've been celebrated in art

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.594
and in poetry for centuries.

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:44.992
As I've traveled around the world,

00:02:44.992 --> 00:02:47.010
I've met many thoughtful people

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.839
who have told me that God put fireflies on Earth

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:51.990
for humans to enjoy.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.386
Other creatures can enjoy them too.

00:02:54.386 --> 00:02:58.715
I think these graceful insects are truly miraculous

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:02.720
because they so beautifully illuminate

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.951
the creative improvisation of evolution.

00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:08.761
They've been shaped by two powerful

00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:10.292
evolutionary forces:

00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:13.952
natural selection, the struggle for survival,

00:03:13.952 --> 00:03:16.101
and sexual selection,

00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:20.162
the struggle for reproductive opportunity.

00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:22.513
As a firefly junkie, the past 20 years

00:03:22.513 --> 00:03:24.999
have been quite an exciting ride.

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.496
Together with my students at Tufts University

00:03:27.496 --> 00:03:28.512
and other colleagues,

00:03:28.512 --> 00:03:32.119
we've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies:

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:34.128
their courtship and sex lives,

00:03:34.128 --> 00:03:37.022
their treachery and murder.

00:03:37.022 --> 00:03:38.839
So today I'd like to share with you

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.310
just a couple of tales that we've brought back

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.788
from our collective adventures

00:03:43.788 --> 00:03:47.498
into this hidden world.

00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:50.660
Fireflies belong to a very beautiful

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.898
and diverse group of insects, the beetles.

00:03:54.898 --> 00:03:59.511
Worldwide, there are more than 2,000 firefly species,

00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:01.671
and these have evolved remarkably diverse

00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:03.026
courtship signals,

00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:06.660
that is, different ways to find and attract mates.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.916
Around 150 million years ago,

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:12.045
the very first fireflies probably looked like this.

00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:13.402
They flew during the daytime

00:04:13.402 --> 00:04:15.665
and they didn't light up.

00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:18.838
Instead, males used their fantastic antennae

00:04:18.838 --> 00:04:22.949
to sniff out perfumes given off by their females.

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.555
In other fireflies, it's only the females who light up.

00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:30.897
They are attractively plump and wingless,

00:04:30.897 --> 00:04:32.821
so every night, they climb up onto perches

00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:34.789
and they glow brightly for hours

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.980
to attract their flying but unlit males.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.830
In still other fireflies, both sexes

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.217
use quick, bright flashes to find their mates.

00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:46.688
Here in North America,

00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:49.829
we have more than 100 different kinds of firefly

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:53.406
that have the remarkable ability to shine energy

00:04:53.406 --> 00:04:55.644
out from their bodies

00:04:55.644 --> 00:04:57.970
in the form of light.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.420
How do they do that?

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.453
It seems totally magical,

00:05:02.453 --> 00:05:03.736
but these bioluminescent signals

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:07.040
arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.934
that happen inside the firefly lantern.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:13.241
The main star is an enzyme called luciferase,

00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:14.996
which in the course of evolution

00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:18.190
has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.780
around an even smaller molecule called luciferin,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.457
in the process getting it so excited

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:27.831
that it actually gives off light.

00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:29.506
Incredible.

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:31.334
But how could these bright lights

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:35.479
have benefited some proto-firefly?

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.589
To answer this question, we need to flip back

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:41.953
in the family album to some baby pictures.

00:05:41.953 --> 00:05:45.665
Fireflies completely reinvent
their bodies as they grow.

00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:47.966
They spend the vast majority of their lifetime,

00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:49.709
up to two years,

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:52.570
in this larval form.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.823
Their main goal here, like my teenagers,

00:05:54.823 --> 00:05:57.978
is to eat and grow.

00:05:57.978 --> 00:06:00.430
And firefly light first originated

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.477
in these juveniles.

00:06:02.477 --> 00:06:04.907
Every single firefly larva can light up,

00:06:04.907 --> 00:06:07.786
even when their adults can't.

00:06:07.786 --> 00:06:08.878
But what's the point

00:06:08.878 --> 00:06:12.515
to being so conspicuous?

00:06:12.515 --> 00:06:14.133
Well, we know that these juveniles

00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:16.113
make nasty-tasting chemicals

00:06:16.113 --> 00:06:19.731
that help them survive their extended childhood,

00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:23.561
so we think these lights first evolved as a warning,

00:06:23.561 --> 00:06:28.120
a neon sign that says, "Toxic! Stay away!"

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.014
to any would-be predators.

00:06:31.014 --> 00:06:33.964
It took many millions of years

00:06:33.964 --> 00:06:35.363
before these bright lights

00:06:35.363 --> 00:06:37.901
evolved into a smart communication tool

00:06:37.901 --> 00:06:40.916
that could be used not just to
ward off potential predators

00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:43.886
but to bring in potential mates.

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:46.687
Driven now by sexual selection,

00:06:46.687 --> 00:06:48.577
some adult fireflies

00:06:48.577 --> 00:06:50.973
like this proud male

00:06:50.973 --> 00:06:54.765
evolved a shiny new glow-in-the-dark lantern

00:06:54.765 --> 00:06:56.609
that would let them take courtship

00:06:56.609 --> 00:07:00.389
to a whole new level.

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.841
These adults only live a few weeks,

00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:07.757
and now they're single-mindedly focused on sex,

00:07:07.757 --> 00:07:09.727
that is, on propelling their genes

00:07:09.727 --> 00:07:12.503
into the next firefly generation.

00:07:12.503 --> 00:07:15.767
So we can follow this male out into the field

00:07:15.767 --> 00:07:18.791
as he joins hundreds of other males

00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:23.169
who are all showing off their new courtship signals.

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:26.161
It's amazing to think that the luminous displays

00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:27.845
we admire

00:07:27.845 --> 00:07:30.280
here and in fact everywhere around the world

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.476
are actually the silent love songs

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:37.453
of male fireflies.

00:07:37.453 --> 00:07:41.540
They're flying and flashing their hearts out.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.080
I still find it very romantic.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.497
But meanwhile, where are all the females?

00:07:48.497 --> 00:07:50.092
Well, they're lounging down below

00:07:50.092 --> 00:07:51.830
surveying their options.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.758
They have plenty of males to choose from,

00:07:53.758 --> 00:07:57.850
and these females turn out to be very picky.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.215
When a female sees a flash

00:08:00.215 --> 00:08:02.862
from an especially attractive male,

00:08:02.862 --> 00:08:05.843
she'll aim her lantern in his direction,

00:08:05.843 --> 00:08:08.370
and give him a flash back.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.771
It's her "come hither" sign.

00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:15.366
So he flies closer and he flashes again.

00:08:15.366 --> 00:08:16.492
If she still likes him,

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:19.703
they'll strike up a conversation.

00:08:19.703 --> 00:08:22.395
These creatures speak their love

00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:25.298
in the language of light.

00:08:25.298 --> 00:08:30.195
So what exactly do these females consider sexy?

00:08:30.195 --> 00:08:32.940
We decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.702
to find out.

00:08:34.702 --> 00:08:37.910
When we tested females using blinking LED lights,

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.225
we discovered they prefer males

00:08:40.225 --> 00:08:44.280
who give longer-lasting flashes.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.891
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:47.891 --> 00:08:49.070
I know you're wondering,

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.273
what gives these males their sex appeal?

00:08:52.273 --> 00:08:53.648
Now we get to see what happens

00:08:53.648 --> 00:08:56.209
when the lights go out.

00:08:56.209 --> 00:08:57.678
The first thing we discovered

00:08:57.678 --> 00:09:00.447
is that once a male and female hook up like this,

00:09:00.447 --> 00:09:03.192
they stay together all night long,

00:09:03.192 --> 00:09:04.419
and when we looked inside

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.853
to see what might be happening,

00:09:05.853 --> 00:09:08.141
we discovered a surprising new twist

00:09:08.141 --> 00:09:10.105
to firefly sex.

00:09:10.105 --> 00:09:11.275
While they're mating,

00:09:11.275 --> 00:09:13.079
the male is busy giving the female

00:09:13.079 --> 00:09:15.050
not just his sperm

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.156
but also a nutrient-filled package

00:09:19.156 --> 00:09:23.777
called a nuptial gift.

00:09:23.777 --> 00:09:25.711
We can zoom in to look more closely

00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:27.274
inside this mating pair.

00:09:27.274 --> 00:09:28.967
We can actually see the gift —

00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:30.379
it's shown here in red —

00:09:30.379 --> 00:09:34.329
as it's being passed from the male to the female.

00:09:34.329 --> 00:09:37.464
What makes this gift so valuable

00:09:37.464 --> 00:09:39.320
is that it's packed with protein

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.781
that the female will use to provision her eggs.

00:09:43.781 --> 00:09:47.651
So females are keeping their eyes on this prize

00:09:47.651 --> 00:09:49.923
as they size up potential mates.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:52.792
We discovered that females use male flash signals

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.839
to try to predict which males

00:09:54.839 --> 00:09:56.909
have the biggest gifts to offer,

00:09:56.909 --> 00:10:01.746
because this bling helps the female lay more eggs

00:10:01.746 --> 00:10:04.997
and ultimately launch more of her own offspring

00:10:04.997 --> 00:10:07.747
into the next generation.

00:10:09.687 --> 00:10:11.695
So it's not all sweetness and light.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.466
Firefly romance is risky.

00:10:14.466 --> 00:10:16.943
For the most part, these adult fireflies

00:10:16.943 --> 00:10:19.627
don't get eaten because like their juveniles

00:10:19.627 --> 00:10:22.563
they can manufacture toxins that are repellent

00:10:22.563 --> 00:10:25.620
to birds and other insectivores,

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.120
but somewhere along the line,

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.440
one particular group of fireflies

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.567
somehow lost the metabolic machinery

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:37.370
needed to make their own protective toxins.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.650
This evolutionary flaw,

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.356
which was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner,

00:10:42.356 --> 00:10:44.299
has driven these fireflies

00:10:44.299 --> 00:10:47.697
to take their bright lights out into the night

00:10:47.697 --> 00:10:51.380
with treacherous intent.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.010
Dubbed "femme fatales"

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.495
by Jim Lloyd, another colleague,

00:10:55.495 --> 00:10:58.413
these females have figured out how to target

00:10:58.413 --> 00:11:02.224
the males of other firefly species.

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:04.124
So the hunt begins with the predator —

00:11:04.124 --> 00:11:06.171
she's shown here in the lower left —

00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:08.218
where she's sitting quietly

00:11:08.218 --> 00:11:11.350
and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.790
of her intended prey,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.803
and here's how it might go.

00:11:14.803 --> 00:11:18.673
First the prey male flashes, "Do you love me?"

00:11:18.673 --> 00:11:22.779
His own female responds, "Maybe."

00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:25.605
So then he flashes again.

00:11:25.605 --> 00:11:29.158
But this time, the predator sneaks in a reply

00:11:29.158 --> 00:11:34.834
that cleverly mimics exactly
what the other female just said.

00:11:34.834 --> 00:11:39.300
She's not looking for love: she's looking for toxins.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.181
If she's good, she can lure this male close enough

00:11:43.181 --> 00:11:46.172
to reach out and grab him,

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.613
and he's not just a light snack.

00:11:48.613 --> 00:11:51.448
Over the next hour, she slowly

00:11:51.448 --> 00:11:54.307
exsanguinates this male

00:11:54.307 --> 00:11:58.000
leaving behind just some gory remains.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.751
Unable to make their own toxins,

00:12:00.751 --> 00:12:03.088
these females resort to drinking the blood

00:12:03.088 --> 00:12:07.783
of other fireflies to get these protective chemicals.

00:12:07.783 --> 00:12:13.628
So a firefly vampire,

00:12:13.628 --> 00:12:17.980
brought to you by natural selection.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.161
We still have a lot to learn about fireflies,

00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:24.544
but it looks like many stories will remain untold,

00:12:24.544 --> 00:12:26.973
because around the world, firefly populations

00:12:26.973 --> 00:12:29.628
are blinking out.

00:12:29.628 --> 00:12:32.216
The main culprit: habitat loss.

00:12:32.216 --> 00:12:34.702
Pretty much everywhere, the fields and forests,

00:12:34.702 --> 00:12:37.649
the mangroves and meadows
that fireflies need to survive,

00:12:37.649 --> 00:12:41.281
are giving way to development and to sprawl.

00:12:41.281 --> 00:12:45.470
Here's another problem: we've conquered darkness,

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.964
but in the process, we spill so
much extra light out into the night

00:12:48.964 --> 00:12:52.090
that it disrupts the lives of other creatures,

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.534
and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution

00:12:55.534 --> 00:12:58.155
because it obscures the signals

00:12:58.155 --> 00:13:02.614
that they use to find their mates.

00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:04.592
Do we really need fireflies?

00:13:04.592 --> 00:13:06.631
After all, they're just one tiny bit

00:13:06.631 --> 00:13:08.900
of Earth's biodiversity.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.208
Yet every time a species is lost,

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.897
it's like extinguishing a room full of candles

00:13:14.897 --> 00:13:17.825
one by one.

00:13:17.825 --> 00:13:18.771
You might not notice

00:13:18.771 --> 00:13:22.061
when the first few flames flicker out,

00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:26.435
but in the end, you're left sitting in darkness.

00:13:31.591 --> 00:13:36.411
As we work together to craft a planetary future,

00:13:36.411 --> 00:13:38.875
I hope we can find a way

00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:42.328
to keep these bright lights shining.

00:13:42.328 --> 00:13:44.364
Thank you.

00:13:44.364 --> 00:13:46.672
(Applause)
