00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:18.638
Organic chemists make molecules,

00:00:18.638 --> 00:00:20.454
very complicated molecules,

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:24.138
by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules

00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:25.999
and reverse engineering.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.038
And as a chemist,

00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:30.505
one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is,

00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:34.656
could we make a really cool universal chemistry set?

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:39.689
In essence, could we "app" chemistry?

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:42.872
Now what would this mean, and how would we do it?

00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:44.843
Well to start to do this,

00:00:44.843 --> 00:00:46.575
we took a 3D printer

00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:50.877
and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:54.942
and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side

00:00:54.942 --> 00:00:58.096
and combine them together in what we call reactionware.

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:02.530
And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.697
we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry.

00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:09.245
Now what could this mean?

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:14.513
Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine,

00:01:14.513 --> 00:01:17.662
so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure

00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:19.381
or bacteria that you want to kill,

00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:21.712
if you have this embedded in your device

00:01:21.712 --> 00:01:24.161
at the same time, and you do the chemistry,

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:27.762
you may be able to make drugs in a new way.

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:30.162
So how are we doing this in the lab?

00:01:30.162 --> 00:01:33.261
Well it requires software, it requires hardware

00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:35.627
and it requires chemical inks.

00:01:35.627 --> 00:01:37.080
And so the really cool bit is,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.127
the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks

00:01:40.127 --> 00:01:42.396
that we put out with the printer,

00:01:42.396 --> 00:01:46.678
and you download the blueprint, the organic chemistry for that molecule

00:01:46.678 --> 00:01:49.678
and you make it in the device.

00:01:49.678 --> 00:01:55.245
And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software.

00:01:55.245 --> 00:01:57.444
So what could this mean?

00:01:57.444 --> 00:02:02.391
Well, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine.

00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:04.360
And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.262
But to take baby steps to get there,

00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:09.095
first of all we want to look at drug design and production,

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:11.745
or drug discovery and manufacturing.

00:02:11.745 --> 00:02:14.744
Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it,

00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:16.878
we could deploy it anywhere.

00:02:16.878 --> 00:02:18.994
You don't need to go to the chemist anymore.

00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:21.362
We can print drugs at point of need.

00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:24.017
We can download new diagnostics.

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:26.028
Say a new super bug has emerged.

00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:27.645
You put it in your search engine,

00:02:27.645 --> 00:02:30.778
and you create the drug to treat the threat.

00:02:30.778 --> 00:02:34.466
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly.

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:37.461
But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future

00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:40.811
is this idea of taking your own stem cells,

00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:42.578
with your genes and your environment,

00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:46.027
and you print your own personal medicine.

00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:48.279
And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough,

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.327
where do you think we're going to go?

00:02:50.327 --> 00:02:54.911
Well, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator.

00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:56.811
Beam me up, Scotty.

00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:00.160
(Applause)
