00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:16.644
Let's talk dirty.

00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:19.380
A few years ago, oddly enough,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.114
I needed the bathroom,

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:25.464
and I found one, a public bathroom,

00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:27.828
and I went into the stall,

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:31.125
and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life:

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:35.667
use the toilet, flush the toilet, forget about the toilet.

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:37.748
And for some reason that day, instead,

00:00:37.748 --> 00:00:39.932
I asked myself a question,

00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:43.808
and it was, where does this stuff go?

00:00:43.808 --> 00:00:47.700
And with that question, I found myself plunged

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.724
into the world of sanitation --

00:00:51.724 --> 00:00:53.289
there's more coming -- (Laughter) —

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.858
sanitation, toilets and poop,

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:00.931
and I have yet to emerge.

00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:03.236
And that's because it's such an enraging,

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:06.452
yet engaging place to be.

00:01:06.452 --> 00:01:09.708
To go back to that toilet,

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:12.502
it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet,

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:13.937
it wasn't as nice as this one

00:01:13.937 --> 00:01:16.868
from the World Toilet Organization.

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:21.135
That's the other WTO. (Laughter)

00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:24.749
But it had a lockable door, it had privacy, it had water,

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:27.013
it had soap so I could wash my hands,

00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:30.077
and I did because I'm a woman, and we do that.

00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:35.685
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:38.096
But that day, when I asked that question,

00:01:38.096 --> 00:01:40.829
I learned something, and that was that I'd grown up thinking

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.044
that a toilet like that was my right,

00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:46.222
when in fact it's a privilege.

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:51.481
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet.

00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:55.421
They don't have a bucket or a box.

00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:59.629
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet.

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:02.126
And they have to do what this little boy is doing

00:02:02.126 --> 00:02:05.061
by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway,

00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:07.709
which is called open defecation,

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.064
or poo-pooing in the open.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:13.298
And he does that every day,

00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:15.797
and every day, probably, that guy in the picture

00:02:15.797 --> 00:02:17.651
walks on by,

00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:21.109
because he sees that little boy, but he doesn't see him.

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.229
But he should, because the problem

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.589
with all that poop lying around

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.597
is that poop carries passengers.

00:02:28.597 --> 00:02:32.896
Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit.

00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:35.317
All those things, the eggs, the cysts,

00:02:35.317 --> 00:02:38.093
the bacteria, the viruses, all those can travel

00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:41.501
in one gram of human feces.

00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:45.213
How? Well, that little boy will not have washed his hands.

00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:47.709
He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house,

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.364
and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food

00:02:51.364 --> 00:02:52.768
and his environment

00:02:52.768 --> 00:02:55.165
with whatever diseases he may be carrying

00:02:55.165 --> 00:03:00.914
by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:03.186
In what I call the flushed-and-plumbed world

00:03:03.186 --> 00:03:05.813
that most of us in this room are lucky to live in,

00:03:05.813 --> 00:03:08.862
the most common symptoms associated with those diseases,

00:03:08.862 --> 00:03:11.688
diarrhea, is now a bit of a joke.

00:03:11.688 --> 00:03:15.379
It's the runs, the Hershey squirts, the squits.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.229
Where I come from, we call it Delhi belly,

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.837
as a legacy of empire.

00:03:19.837 --> 00:03:23.577
But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea

00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:26.368
in a leading photo image agency,

00:03:26.368 --> 00:03:28.388
this is the picture that you come up with.

00:03:28.388 --> 00:03:30.253
(Laughter)

00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:35.432
Still not sure about the bikini.

00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:37.928
And here's another image of diarrhea.

00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:41.040
This is Marie Saylee, nine months old.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.839
You can't see her, because she's buried

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:46.122
under that green grass in a little village in Liberia,

00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:49.684
because she died in three days from diarrhea --

00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:53.313
the Hershey squirts, the runs, a joke.

00:03:53.313 --> 00:03:55.792
And that's her dad.

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:57.354
But she wasn't alone that day,

00:03:57.354 --> 00:04:01.154
because 4,000 other children died of diarrhea,

00:04:01.154 --> 00:04:03.824
and they do every day.

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:08.823
Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide,

00:04:08.823 --> 00:04:11.495
and you've probably been asked to care about things

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:14.656
like HIV/AIDS or T.B. or measles,

00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:16.000
but diarrhea kills more children

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.712
than all those three things put together.

00:04:19.712 --> 00:04:24.054
It's a very potent weapon of mass destruction.

00:04:24.054 --> 00:04:27.202
And the cost to the world is immense:

00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:29.691
260 billion dollars lost every year

00:04:29.691 --> 00:04:32.684
on the losses to poor sanitation.

00:04:32.684 --> 00:04:34.365
These are cholera beds in Haiti.

00:04:34.365 --> 00:04:37.864
You'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.

00:04:37.864 --> 00:04:40.048
It gets a fraction of the attention and funding

00:04:40.048 --> 00:04:43.764
given to any of those other diseases.

00:04:43.764 --> 00:04:46.176
But we know how to fix this.

00:04:46.176 --> 00:04:49.696
We know, because in the mid-19th century,

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:52.085
wonderful Victorian engineers

00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:54.888
installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment

00:04:54.888 --> 00:04:59.599
and the flush toilet, and disease dropped dramatically.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.508
Child mortality dropped by the most

00:05:01.508 --> 00:05:03.698
it had ever dropped in history.

00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:06.644
The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance

00:05:06.644 --> 00:05:09.824
of the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal,

00:05:09.824 --> 00:05:12.667
and they were choosing over the Pill, anesthesia,

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.075
and surgery.

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:16.796
It's a wonderful waste disposal device.

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:20.414
But I think that it's so good — it doesn't smell,

00:05:20.414 --> 00:05:23.193
we can put it in our house, we can lock it behind a door —

00:05:23.193 --> 00:05:26.197
and I think we've locked it out of conversation too.

00:05:26.197 --> 00:05:27.852
We don't have a neutral word for it.

00:05:27.852 --> 00:05:29.795
Poop's not particularly adequate.

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:33.920
Shit offends people. Feces is too medical.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.112
Because I can't explain otherwise,

00:05:36.112 --> 00:05:39.680
when I look at the figures, what's going on.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.254
We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation,

00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:44.584
but if you look at the budgets of countries,

00:05:44.584 --> 00:05:46.905
developing and developed,

00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:49.456
you'll think there's something wrong with the math,

00:05:49.456 --> 00:05:52.282
because you'll expect absurdities like

00:05:52.282 --> 00:05:55.164
Pakistan spending 47 times more on its military

00:05:55.164 --> 00:05:57.445
than it does on water and sanitation,

00:05:57.445 --> 00:06:00.253
even though 150,000 children die of diarrhea

00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:02.352
in Pakistan every year.

00:06:02.352 --> 00:06:04.312
But then you look at that already minuscule

00:06:04.312 --> 00:06:06.206
water and sanitation budget,

00:06:06.206 --> 00:06:09.690
and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply,

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.643
which is great; we all need water.

00:06:11.643 --> 00:06:13.950
No one's going to refuse clean water.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.901
But the humble latrine, or flush toilet,

00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:19.010
reduces disease by twice as much

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.434
as just putting in clean water.

00:06:21.434 --> 00:06:22.745
Think about it. That little boy

00:06:22.745 --> 00:06:24.600
who's running back into his house,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.710
he may have a nice, clean fresh water supply,

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.170
but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.674
And I think that the real waste of human waste

00:06:34.674 --> 00:06:37.442
is that we are wasting it as a resource

00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:41.202
and as an incredible trigger for development,

00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:43.352
because these are a few things that toilets

00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:46.282
and poop itself can do for us.

00:06:46.282 --> 00:06:49.458
So a toilet can put a girl back in school.

00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:52.290
Twenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.808
because they have no adequate sanitation.

00:06:55.808 --> 00:06:57.573
They've been used to sitting through lessons

00:06:57.573 --> 00:07:00.490
for years and years holding it in.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.250
We've all done that, but they do it every day,

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.806
and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating,

00:07:05.806 --> 00:07:08.149
it just gets too much.

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:11.690
And I understand that. Who can blame them?

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.616
So if you met an educationalist and said,

00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:16.490
"I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.688
with just one simple thing,"

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:21.501
you'd make a lot of friends in education.

00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:24.036
That's not the only thing it can do for you.

00:07:24.036 --> 00:07:27.096
Poop can cook your dinner.

00:07:27.096 --> 00:07:28.790
It's got nutrients in it.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.251
We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well.

00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:33.103
We don't keep them all.

00:07:33.103 --> 00:07:35.730
In Rwanda, they are now getting

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.574
75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system

00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:41.936
from the contents of prisoners' bowels.

00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:45.722
So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare.

00:07:45.722 --> 00:07:47.874
They're genocidal inmates, most of them,

00:07:47.874 --> 00:07:51.522
and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines,

00:07:51.522 --> 00:07:54.833
because if you put poop in a sealed environment, in a tank,

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:56.589
pretty much like a stomach,

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:59.402
then, pretty much like a stomach, it gives off gas,

00:07:59.402 --> 00:08:01.427
and you can cook with it.

00:08:01.427 --> 00:08:03.570
And you might think it's just good karma

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.042
to see these guys stirring shit,

00:08:06.042 --> 00:08:08.342
but it's also good economic sense,

00:08:08.342 --> 00:08:10.408
because they're saving a million dollars a year.

00:08:10.408 --> 00:08:12.414
They're cutting down on deforestation,

00:08:12.414 --> 00:08:15.317
and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible,

00:08:15.317 --> 00:08:20.059
infinite and free at the point of production.

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:23.407
It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives.

00:08:23.407 --> 00:08:25.559
Here's a woman who's about to get a dose

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:27.312
of the brown stuff in those syringes,

00:08:27.312 --> 00:08:29.248
which is what you think it is,

00:08:29.248 --> 00:08:32.292
except not quite, because it's actually donated.

00:08:32.292 --> 00:08:35.174
There is now a new career path called stool donor.

00:08:35.174 --> 00:08:36.994
It's like the new sperm donor.

00:08:36.994 --> 00:08:39.987
Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff,

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:43.431
and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases.

00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:44.943
She's been suffering for years.

00:08:44.943 --> 00:08:48.035
She gets a dose of healthy human feces,

00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:52.516
and the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent.

00:08:52.516 --> 00:08:56.914
It's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it.

00:08:56.914 --> 00:08:58.936
Maybe it's the ick factor.

00:08:58.936 --> 00:09:01.806
That's okay, because there's a team of research scientists

00:09:01.806 --> 00:09:04.783
in Canada who have now created a stool sample,

00:09:04.783 --> 00:09:07.567
a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate.

00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:09.855
So you'd be thinking by now, okay, the solution's simple,

00:09:09.855 --> 00:09:11.740
we give everyone a toilet.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.893
And this is where it gets really interesting,

00:09:13.893 --> 00:09:16.818
because it's not that simple, because we are not simple.

00:09:16.818 --> 00:09:20.911
So the really interesting, exciting work --

00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:23.847
this is the engaging bit -- in sanitation is that

00:09:23.847 --> 00:09:26.175
we need to understand human psychology.

00:09:26.175 --> 00:09:28.551
We need to understand software

00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:30.903
as well as just giving someone hardware.

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.685
They've found in many developing countries that

00:09:32.685 --> 00:09:35.407
governments have gone in and given out free latrines

00:09:35.407 --> 00:09:37.563
and gone back a few years later and found that they've

00:09:37.563 --> 00:09:41.686
got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms

00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:44.053
with their owners happily walking past them

00:09:44.053 --> 00:09:47.863
and going over to the open defecating ground.

00:09:47.863 --> 00:09:50.887
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion.

00:09:50.887 --> 00:09:53.388
It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it

00:09:53.388 --> 00:09:55.327
in the early 20th century.

00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:58.086
They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.

00:09:58.086 --> 00:10:02.253
They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it.

00:10:02.253 --> 00:10:03.608
In India now there's a campaign

00:10:03.608 --> 00:10:06.154
which persuades young brides

00:10:06.154 --> 00:10:09.252
not to marry into families that don't have a toilet.

00:10:09.252 --> 00:10:11.920
It's called "No Loo, No I Do."

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.267
(Laughter)

00:10:14.267 --> 00:10:16.242
And in case you think that poster's just propaganda,

00:10:16.242 --> 00:10:18.342
here's Priyanka, 23 years old.

00:10:18.342 --> 00:10:20.463
I met her last October in India,

00:10:20.463 --> 00:10:23.520
and she grew up in a conservative environment.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.616
She grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India,

00:10:26.616 --> 00:10:30.782
and she was engaged at 14, and then at 21 or so,

00:10:30.782 --> 00:10:32.553
she moved into her in-law's house.

00:10:32.553 --> 00:10:34.588
And she was horrified to get there and find

00:10:34.588 --> 00:10:35.880
that they didn't have a toilet.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.247
She'd grown up with a latrine.

00:10:37.247 --> 00:10:39.201
It was no big deal, but it was a latrine.

00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:41.224
And the first night she was there, she was told

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:42.431
that at 4 o'clock in the morning --

00:10:42.431 --> 00:10:45.270
her mother-in-law got her up, told her to go outside

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.090
and go and do it in the dark in the open.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.160
And she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.034
She was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape.

00:10:53.034 --> 00:10:55.516
After three days, she did an unthinkable thing.

00:10:55.516 --> 00:10:57.256
She left.

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:58.841
And if you know anything about rural India,

00:10:58.841 --> 00:11:02.319
you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do.

00:11:02.319 --> 00:11:03.376
But not just that.

00:11:03.376 --> 00:11:05.788
She got her toilet, and now she goes around

00:11:05.788 --> 00:11:07.386
all the other villages in India

00:11:07.386 --> 00:11:09.139
persuading other women to do the same thing.

00:11:09.139 --> 00:11:12.600
It's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.775
and really exciting.

00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:16.864
Another version of this, another village in India

00:11:16.864 --> 00:11:18.861
near where Priyanka lives

00:11:18.861 --> 00:11:22.736
is this village, called Lakara, and about a year ago,

00:11:22.736 --> 00:11:24.187
it had no toilets whatsoever.

00:11:24.187 --> 00:11:26.481
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera.

00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:30.823
Some visitors came, using various behavioral change tricks

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:33.617
like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit

00:11:33.617 --> 00:11:35.834
and watching the flies go one to the other.

00:11:35.834 --> 00:11:38.401
Somehow, people who'd been thinking

00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:39.930
that what they were doing was not disgusting at all

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.802
suddenly thought, "Oops."

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:44.129
Not only that, but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit.

00:11:44.129 --> 00:11:47.257
That's what really made them change their behavior.

00:11:47.257 --> 00:11:49.793
So this woman, this boy's mother

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:52.278
installed this latrine in a few hours.

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:54.661
Her entire life, she'd been using the banana field behind,

00:11:54.661 --> 00:11:56.229
but she installed the latrine in a few hours.

00:11:56.229 --> 00:11:59.902
It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life.

00:11:59.902 --> 00:12:03.093
So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation,

00:12:03.093 --> 00:12:05.289
even though these are pretty exciting times

00:12:05.289 --> 00:12:07.867
because we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

00:12:07.867 --> 00:12:09.929
reinventing the toilet, which is great,

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:12.483
we've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike,

00:12:12.483 --> 00:12:16.218
which is great for humanity, very bad for his colon.

00:12:16.218 --> 00:12:17.932
But there are things to worry about.

00:12:17.932 --> 00:12:20.690
It's the most off-track Millennium Development Goal.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.036
It's about 50 or so years off track.

00:12:23.036 --> 00:12:24.372
We're not going to meet targets,

00:12:24.372 --> 00:12:27.657
providing people with sanitation at this rate.

00:12:27.657 --> 00:12:31.138
So when I get sad about sanitation,

00:12:31.138 --> 00:12:34.457
I think of Japan, because Japan 70 years ago

00:12:34.457 --> 00:12:37.046
was a nation of people who used pit latrines

00:12:37.046 --> 00:12:39.178
and wiped with sticks,

00:12:39.178 --> 00:12:42.505
and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos,

00:12:42.505 --> 00:12:43.985
washlet toilets.

00:12:43.985 --> 00:12:46.329
They have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely,

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:49.074
hands-free cleaning experience,

00:12:49.074 --> 00:12:51.246
and they have various other features

00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:54.221
like a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device

00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:56.562
which is known as the "marriage-saver."

00:12:56.562 --> 00:12:58.018
(Laughter)

00:12:58.018 --> 00:13:00.423
But most importantly, what they have done in Japan,

00:13:00.423 --> 00:13:01.923
which I find so inspirational,

00:13:01.923 --> 00:13:04.487
is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door.

00:13:04.487 --> 00:13:05.988
They've made it conversational.

00:13:05.988 --> 00:13:09.390
People go out and upgrade their toilet.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.798
They talk about it. They've sanitized it.

00:13:13.798 --> 00:13:18.278
I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do.

00:13:18.278 --> 00:13:20.548
All we really need to do

00:13:20.548 --> 00:13:22.390
is look at this issue

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:26.702
as the urgent, shameful issue that it is.

00:13:26.702 --> 00:13:29.475
And don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.639
Our sewers are crumbling.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:33.806
Things are going wrong here too.

00:13:33.806 --> 00:13:36.705
The solution to all of this is pretty easy.

00:13:36.705 --> 00:13:38.426
I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon

00:13:38.426 --> 00:13:40.779
and just ask you to do one thing,

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:43.855
and that's to go out, protest,

00:13:43.855 --> 00:13:46.093
speak about the unspeakable,

00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:47.632
and talk shit.

00:13:47.632 --> 00:13:49.586
Thank you.

00:13:49.586 --> 00:13:54.910
(Applause)
