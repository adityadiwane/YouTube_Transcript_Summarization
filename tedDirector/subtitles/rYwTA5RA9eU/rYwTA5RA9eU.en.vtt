00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:15.558
I'd like to reimagine education.

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:17.148
The last year

00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:20.054
has seen the invention of a new four-letter word.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:21.967
It starts with an M.

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:26.424
MOOC: massive open online courses.

00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:27.901
Many organizations

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.659
are offering these online courses

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.689
to students all over the world, in the millions, for free.

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:36.249
Anybody who has an Internet connection

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:38.777
and the will to learn can access these great courses

00:00:38.777 --> 00:00:40.871
from excellent universities

00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:44.128
and get a credential at the end of it.

00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:46.752
Now, in this discussion today,

00:00:46.752 --> 00:00:47.987
I'm going to focus

00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:51.255
on a different aspect of MOOCs.

00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:53.606
We are taking what we are learning

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:56.171
and the technologies we are developing in the large

00:00:56.171 --> 00:00:58.271
and applying them in the small

00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:01.250
to create a blended model of education

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.043
to really reinvent and reimagine

00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:05.470
what we do in the classroom.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.980
Now, our classrooms could use change.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.401
So, here's a classroom

00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:12.426
at this little three-letter institute

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:15.210
in the Northeast of America, MIT.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.529
And this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago,

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:20.996
and this is a classroom today.

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:24.116
What's changed?

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.663
The seats are in color.

00:01:26.663 --> 00:01:29.791
Whoop-de-do.

00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.502
Education really hasn't changed

00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:34.197
in the past 500 years.

00:01:34.197 --> 00:01:36.528
The last big innovation in education

00:01:36.528 --> 00:01:40.010
was the printing press and the textbooks.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.420
Everything else has changed around us.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.243
You know, from healthcare to transportation,

00:01:43.243 --> 00:01:47.736
everything is different,
but education hasn't changed.

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:50.409
It's also been a real issue in terms of access.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.036
So what you see here

00:01:52.036 --> 00:01:54.538
is not a rock concert.

00:01:54.538 --> 00:01:57.084
And the person you see at the end of the stage

00:01:57.084 --> 00:01:59.144
is not Madonna.

00:01:59.144 --> 00:02:00.773
This is a classroom

00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:05.191
at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:09.127
Now, we've all heard of distance education,

00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:10.495
but the students way in the back,

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:12.607
200 feet away from the instructor,

00:02:12.607 --> 00:02:17.502
I think they are undergoing long-distance education.

00:02:17.502 --> 00:02:19.177
Now, I really believe

00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:21.392
that we can transform education,

00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:24.238
both in quality and scale and access,

00:02:24.238 --> 00:02:26.546
through technology.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:30.241
For example, at edX,

00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:32.494
we are trying to transform education

00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:35.654
through online technologies.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:38.913
Given education has been calcified for 500 years,

00:02:38.913 --> 00:02:41.104
we really cannot think about reengineering it,

00:02:41.104 --> 00:02:42.249
micromanaging it.

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.557
We really have to completely reimagine it.

00:02:44.557 --> 00:02:48.598
It's like going from ox carts to the airplane.

00:02:48.598 --> 00:02:50.121
Even the infrastructure has to change.

00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:51.734
Everything has to change.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.099
We need to go from lectures on the blackboard

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.707
to online exercises, online videos.

00:02:57.707 --> 00:03:00.188
We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories

00:03:00.188 --> 00:03:01.837
and gamification.

00:03:01.837 --> 00:03:03.748
We have to go to completely online grading

00:03:03.748 --> 00:03:06.501
and peer interaction and discussion boards.

00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:08.782
Everything really has to change.

00:03:08.782 --> 00:03:11.288
So at edX and a number of other organizations,

00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:13.447
we are applying these technologies to education

00:03:13.447 --> 00:03:16.633
through MOOCs to really
increase access to education.

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:18.350
And you heard of this example,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.966
where, when we launched our very first course --

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:22.732
and this was an MIT-hard

00:03:22.732 --> 00:03:24.320
circuits and electronics course --

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.014
about a year and a half ago,

00:03:27.014 --> 00:03:32.317
155,000 students from 162 countries

00:03:32.317 --> 00:03:34.020
enrolled in this course.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.706
And we had no marketing budget.

00:03:36.706 --> 00:03:40.194
Now, 155,000 is a big number.

00:03:40.194 --> 00:03:41.933
This number is bigger

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:44.564
than the total number of alumni of MIT

00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:48.389
in its 150-year history.

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.547
7,200 students passed the course,

00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:53.010
and this was a hard course.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.464
7,200 is also a big number.

00:03:56.464 --> 00:04:00.006
If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year,

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.883
I would have to teach for 40 years

00:04:02.883 --> 00:04:05.485
before I could teach this many students.

00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:07.023
Now these large numbers

00:04:07.023 --> 00:04:09.181
are just one part of the story.

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:11.843
So today, I want to discuss a different aspect,

00:04:11.843 --> 00:04:13.068
the other side of MOOCs,

00:04:13.068 --> 00:04:15.247
take a different perspective.

00:04:15.247 --> 00:04:18.182
We are taking what we develop
and learn in the large

00:04:18.182 --> 00:04:19.727
and applying it in the small

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:23.723
to the classroom, to create
a blended model of learning.

00:04:23.723 --> 00:04:28.326
But before I go into that, let me tell you a story.

00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:32.410
When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.777
she stopped speaking English,

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:38.838
and she began speaking this new language.

00:04:38.838 --> 00:04:41.644
I call it teen-lish.

00:04:41.644 --> 00:04:43.856
It's a digital language.

00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:50.570
It's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.886
"Honey, come over for dinner."

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:55.481
"Hmm."

00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:57.615
"Did you hear me?"

00:04:57.615 --> 00:04:59.878
Silence. (Laughter)

00:04:59.878 --> 00:05:01.250
"Can you listen to me?"

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.622
&amp;quot;Hmm.&amp;quot;

00:05:02.622 --> 00:05:04.578
So we had a real issue with communicating,

00:05:04.578 --> 00:05:06.846
and we were just not communicating,

00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:09.860
until one day I had this epiphany.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.523
I texted her. (Laughter)

00:05:12.523 --> 00:05:14.841
I got an instant response.

00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:16.526
I said, no, that must have been by accident.

00:05:16.526 --> 00:05:17.613
She must have thought, you know,

00:05:17.613 --> 00:05:19.900
some friend of hers was calling her.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.997
So I texted her again. Boom, another response.

00:05:22.997 --> 00:05:24.806
I said, this is great.

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:26.862
And so since then, our life has changed.

00:05:26.862 --> 00:05:28.420
I text her, she responds.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.922
It's just been absolutely great.

00:05:30.922 --> 00:05:36.777
(Applause)

00:05:36.777 --> 00:05:38.747
So our millennial generation

00:05:38.747 --> 00:05:40.381
is built differently.

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:42.882
Now, I'm older, and my
youthful looks might belie that,

00:05:42.882 --> 00:05:46.738
but I'm not in the millennial generation.

00:05:46.738 --> 00:05:48.370
But our kids are really different.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.229
The millennial generation is completely comfortable

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.469
with online technology.

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.498
So why are we fighting it in the classroom?

00:05:53.498 --> 00:05:55.131
Let's not fight it. Let's embrace it.

00:05:55.131 --> 00:05:56.820
In fact, I believe -- and I have two fat thumbs,

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.469
I can't text very well --

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.636
but I'm willing to bet that with evolution,

00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:02.881
our kids and their grandchildren

00:06:02.881 --> 00:06:04.711
will develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs

00:06:04.711 --> 00:06:06.094
to text much better,

00:06:06.094 --> 00:06:08.954
that evolution will fix all of that stuff.

00:06:08.954 --> 00:06:10.725
But what if we embraced technology,

00:06:10.725 --> 00:06:13.329
embraced the millennial generation's

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:14.594
natural predilections,

00:06:14.594 --> 00:06:17.639
and really think about creating
these online technologies,

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.073
blend them into their lives.

00:06:19.073 --> 00:06:20.896
So here's what we can do.

00:06:20.896 --> 00:06:23.388
So rather than driving our kids into a classroom,

00:06:23.388 --> 00:06:25.960
herding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning --

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.718
I hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning,

00:06:28.718 --> 00:06:30.800
so why are we forcing our kids to do that?

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.974
So instead what you do

00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:33.994
is you have them watch videos

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:35.805
and do interactive exercises

00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:38.494
in the comfort of their dorm rooms, in their bedroom,

00:06:38.494 --> 00:06:40.355
in the dining room, in the bathroom,

00:06:40.355 --> 00:06:42.932
wherever they're most creative.

00:06:42.932 --> 00:06:44.927
Then they come into the classroom

00:06:44.927 --> 00:06:48.351
for some in-person interaction.

00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:50.188
They can have discussions amongst themselves.

00:06:50.188 --> 00:06:51.764
They can solve problems together.

00:06:51.764 --> 00:06:52.910
They can work with the professor

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.904
and have the professor answer their questions.

00:06:55.904 --> 00:06:59.767
In fact, with edX, when we
were teaching our first course

00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:02.193
on circuits and electronics around the world,

00:07:02.193 --> 00:07:04.572
this was happening unbeknownst to us.

00:07:04.572 --> 00:07:06.111
Two high school teachers

00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:09.793
at the Sant High School in Mongolia

00:07:09.793 --> 00:07:11.940
had flipped their classroom,

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.219
and they were using our video lectures

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:16.092
and interactive exercises,

00:07:16.092 --> 00:07:17.703
where the learners in the high school,

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:19.288
15-year-olds, mind you,

00:07:19.288 --> 00:07:21.122
would go and do these things in their own homes

00:07:21.122 --> 00:07:22.469
and they would come into class,

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:24.405
and as you see from this image here,

00:07:24.405 --> 00:07:25.491
they would interact with each other

00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:27.828
and do some physical laboratory work.

00:07:27.828 --> 00:07:29.149
And the only way we discovered this

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:30.572
was they wrote a blog

00:07:30.572 --> 00:07:34.595
and we happened to stumble upon that blog.

00:07:34.595 --> 00:07:36.702
We were also doing other pilots.

00:07:36.702 --> 00:07:39.184
So we did a pilot experimental blended courses,

00:07:39.184 --> 00:07:42.156
working with San Jose State University in California,

00:07:42.156 --> 00:07:44.003
again, with the circuits and electronics course.

00:07:44.003 --> 00:07:46.471
You'll hear that a lot. That course has become

00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:49.947
sort of like our petri dish of learning.

00:07:49.947 --> 00:07:52.215
So there, the students would, again,

00:07:52.215 --> 00:07:54.942
the instructors flipped the classroom,

00:07:54.942 --> 00:07:56.663
blended online and in person,

00:07:56.663 --> 00:07:58.971
and the results were staggering.

00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:01.613
Now don't take these results to the bank just yet.

00:08:01.613 --> 00:08:04.101
Just wait a little bit longer as we
experiment with this some more,

00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:06.262
but the early results are incredible.

00:08:06.262 --> 00:08:08.659
So traditionally, semester upon semester,

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:11.000
for the past several years, this course,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.689
again, a hard course,

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:15.805
had a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent

00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:17.305
every semester.

00:08:17.305 --> 00:08:20.003
With this blended class late last year,

00:08:20.003 --> 00:08:23.984
the failure rate fell to nine percent.

00:08:23.984 --> 00:08:27.747
So the results can be extremely, extremely good.

00:08:27.747 --> 00:08:30.974
Now before we go too far into this,

00:08:30.974 --> 00:08:33.626
I'd like to spend some time discussing

00:08:33.626 --> 00:08:34.775
some key ideas.

00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:35.986
What are some key ideas

00:08:35.986 --> 00:08:38.843
that makes all of this work?

00:08:38.843 --> 00:08:41.070
One idea is active learning.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.510
The idea here is, rather than have students

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.696
walk into class and watch lectures,

00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:48.738
we replace this with what we call lessons.

00:08:48.738 --> 00:08:50.982
Lessons are interleaved sequences

00:08:50.982 --> 00:08:53.663
of videos and interactive exercises.

00:08:53.663 --> 00:08:56.842
So a student might watch a five-, seven-minute video

00:08:56.842 --> 00:08:59.882
and follow that with an interactive exercise.

00:08:59.882 --> 00:09:03.027
Think of this as the ultimate
Socratization of education.

00:09:03.027 --> 00:09:05.007
You teach by asking questions.

00:09:05.007 --> 00:09:06.511
And this is a form of learning

00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:07.788
called active learning,

00:09:07.788 --> 00:09:11.067
and really promoted by a very early paper, in 1972,

00:09:11.067 --> 00:09:12.585
by Craik and Lockhart,

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:14.106
where they said and discovered

00:09:14.106 --> 00:09:16.486
that learning and retention really relates strongly

00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:18.235
to the depth of mental processing.

00:09:18.235 --> 00:09:19.727
Students learn much better

00:09:19.727 --> 00:09:22.915
when they are interacting with the material.

00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:25.693
The second idea is self-pacing.

00:09:25.693 --> 00:09:27.329
Now, when I went to a lecture hall,

00:09:27.329 --> 00:09:28.619
and if you were like me,

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:30.585
by the fifth minute I would lose the professor.

00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:34.165
I wasn't all that smart, and I would
be scrambling, taking notes,

00:09:34.165 --> 00:09:37.356
and then I would lose the lecture
for the rest of the hour.

00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:39.826
Instead, wouldn't it be nice with online technologies,

00:09:39.826 --> 00:09:43.694
we offer videos and interactive
engagements to students?

00:09:43.694 --> 00:09:45.425
They can hit the pause button.

00:09:45.425 --> 00:09:47.916
They can rewind the professor.

00:09:47.916 --> 00:09:51.015
Heck, they can even mute the professor.

00:09:51.015 --> 00:09:53.069
So this form of self-pacing

00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:55.694
can be very helpful to learning.

00:09:55.694 --> 00:09:59.048
The third idea that we have is instant feedback.

00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:00.525
With instant feedback,

00:10:00.525 --> 00:10:02.380
the computer grades exercises.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.675
I mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students?

00:10:04.675 --> 00:10:06.969
Your computer is grading all the exercises.

00:10:06.969 --> 00:10:08.503
And we've all submitted homeworks,

00:10:08.503 --> 00:10:10.544
and your grades come back two weeks later,

00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:12.168
you've forgotten all about it.

00:10:12.168 --> 00:10:14.245
I don't think I've still received
some of my homeworks

00:10:14.245 --> 00:10:15.730
from my undergraduate days.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.077
Some are never graded.

00:10:17.077 --> 00:10:18.571
So with instant feedback,

00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:20.061
students can try to apply answers.

00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:22.470
If they get it wrong, they can get instant feedback.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.118
They can try it again and try it again,

00:10:24.118 --> 00:10:26.051
and this really becomes much more engaging.

00:10:26.051 --> 00:10:27.634
They get the instant feedback,

00:10:27.634 --> 00:10:30.553
and this little green check mark that you see here

00:10:30.553 --> 00:10:34.143
is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX.

00:10:34.143 --> 00:10:37.031
Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night

00:10:37.047 --> 00:10:40.491
dreaming of the green check mark.

00:10:40.491 --> 00:10:42.293
In fact, one of our learners

00:10:42.293 --> 00:10:45.074
who took the circuits course early last year,

00:10:45.074 --> 00:10:47.006
he then went on to take a software course

00:10:47.006 --> 00:10:49.307
from Berkeley at the end of the year,

00:10:49.307 --> 00:10:51.453
and this is what the learner had to say

00:10:51.453 --> 00:10:52.725
on our discussion board

00:10:52.725 --> 00:10:54.251
when he just started that course

00:10:54.251 --> 00:10:56.772
about the green check mark:

00:10:56.772 --> 00:10:58.829
&amp;quot;Oh god; have I missed you.&amp;quot;

00:10:58.829 --> 00:11:01.527
When's the last time you've seen students

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:05.988
posting comments like this about homework?

00:11:05.988 --> 00:11:08.384
My colleague Ed Bertschinger,

00:11:08.384 --> 00:11:10.554
who heads up the physics department at MIT,

00:11:10.554 --> 00:11:13.398
has this to say about instant feedback:

00:11:13.398 --> 00:11:16.399
He indicated that instant feedback

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:22.174
turns teaching moments into learning outcomes.

00:11:22.174 --> 00:11:24.466
The next big idea is gamification.

00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:26.367
You know, all learners engage really well

00:11:26.367 --> 00:11:27.876
with interactive videos and so on.

00:11:27.876 --> 00:11:29.141
You know, they would sit down and shoot

00:11:29.141 --> 00:11:31.485
alien spaceships all day long until they get it.

00:11:31.485 --> 00:11:34.272
So we applied these gamification
techniques to learning,

00:11:34.272 --> 00:11:36.495
and we can build these online laboratories.

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:38.742
How do you teach creativity?
How do you teach design?

00:11:38.752 --> 00:11:40.421
We can do this through online labs

00:11:40.421 --> 00:11:41.698
and use computing power

00:11:41.698 --> 00:11:43.287
to build these online labs.

00:11:43.287 --> 00:11:45.675
So as this little video shows here,

00:11:45.675 --> 00:11:47.140
you can engage students

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.747
much like they design with Legos.

00:11:48.747 --> 00:11:50.665
So here, the learners are building a circuit

00:11:50.665 --> 00:11:52.556
with Lego-like ease.

00:11:52.556 --> 00:11:56.647
And this can also be graded by the computer.

00:11:56.647 --> 00:11:59.581
Fifth is peer learning.

00:11:59.581 --> 00:12:02.416
So here, we use discussion forums and discussions

00:12:02.416 --> 00:12:04.516
and Facebook-like interaction

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:06.380
not as a distraction,

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.227
but to really help students learn.

00:12:09.227 --> 00:12:10.944
Let me tell you a story.

00:12:10.944 --> 00:12:14.170
When we did our circuits course

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.036
for the 155,000 students,

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:17.701
I didn't sleep for three nights

00:12:17.701 --> 00:12:19.588
leading up to the launch of the course.

00:12:19.588 --> 00:12:22.147
I told my TAs, okay, 24/7,

00:12:22.147 --> 00:12:23.413
we're going to be up

00:12:23.413 --> 00:12:25.287
monitoring the forum, answering questions.

00:12:25.287 --> 00:12:27.260
They had answered questions for 100 students.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.121
How do you do that for 150,000?

00:12:30.121 --> 00:12:32.457
So one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night,

00:12:32.457 --> 00:12:33.678
and I think there's this question

00:12:33.678 --> 00:12:35.649
from a student from Pakistan,

00:12:35.649 --> 00:12:36.977
and he asked a question, and I said,

00:12:36.977 --> 00:12:38.433
okay, let me go and type up an answer,

00:12:38.433 --> 00:12:40.041
I don't type all that fast,

00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:41.605
and I begin typing up the answer,

00:12:41.605 --> 00:12:43.299
and before I can finish,

00:12:43.299 --> 00:12:45.973
another student from Egypt
popped in with an answer,

00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:47.891
not quite right, so I'm fixing the answer,

00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:49.859
and before I can finish, a student from the U.S.

00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:51.468
had popped in with a different answer.

00:12:51.468 --> 00:12:54.268
And then I sat back, fascinated.

00:12:54.268 --> 00:12:56.215
Boom, boom, boom, boom, the students were

00:12:56.215 --> 00:12:58.166
discussing and interacting with each other,

00:12:58.166 --> 00:13:00.684
and by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated,

00:13:00.684 --> 00:13:02.152
having this epiphany,

00:13:02.152 --> 00:13:03.408
and by 4 a.m. in the morning,

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.161
they had discovered the right answer.

00:13:05.161 --> 00:13:06.888
And all I had to do was go and bless it,

00:13:06.888 --> 00:13:08.854
"Good answer."

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:11.206
So this is absolutely amazing,

00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:13.016
where students are learning from each other,

00:13:13.016 --> 00:13:15.833
and they're telling us that they are learning

00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:18.130
by teaching.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.110
Now this is all not just in the future.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.862
This is happening today.

00:13:21.862 --> 00:13:24.179
So we are applying these blended learning pilots

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.920
in a number of universities and 
high schools around the world,

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.706
from Tsinghua in China

00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:31.138
to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia

00:13:31.138 --> 00:13:32.749
to Berkeley in California --

00:13:32.749 --> 00:13:34.108
all over the world.

00:13:34.108 --> 00:13:36.132
And these kinds of technologies really help,

00:13:36.132 --> 00:13:37.681
the blended model can really help

00:13:37.681 --> 00:13:39.779
revolutionize education.

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:43.190
It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs,

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.870
the business aspect.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.186
We can also license these MOOC courses

00:13:47.186 --> 00:13:48.925
to other universities,

00:13:48.925 --> 00:13:51.489
and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs,

00:13:51.489 --> 00:13:53.878
where the university that
licenses it with the professor

00:13:53.878 --> 00:13:55.715
can use these online courses

00:13:55.715 --> 00:13:57.916
like the next-generation textbook.

00:13:57.916 --> 00:14:00.371
They can use as much or as little as they like,

00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:05.857
and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal.

00:14:05.857 --> 00:14:07.907
Finally, I would like to have you

00:14:07.907 --> 00:14:10.748
dream with me for a little bit.

00:14:10.748 --> 00:14:14.917
I would like us to really reimagine education.

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:19.042
We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces.

00:14:19.042 --> 00:14:21.717
We have to move from books to tablets

00:14:21.717 --> 00:14:23.543
like the Aakash in India

00:14:23.543 --> 00:14:25.891
or the Raspberry Pi, 20 dollars.

00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:27.898
The Aakash is 40 dollars.

00:14:27.898 --> 00:14:30.812
We have to move from
bricks-and-mortar school buildings

00:14:30.812 --> 00:14:33.433
to digital dormitories.

00:14:33.433 --> 00:14:34.881
But I think at the end of the day,

00:14:34.881 --> 00:14:37.123
I think we will still need one lecture hall

00:14:37.123 --> 00:14:39.685
in our universities.

00:14:39.685 --> 00:14:42.509
Otherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren

00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:45.904
that your grandparents sat in that room

00:14:45.904 --> 00:14:49.128
in neat little rows like cornstalks

00:14:49.128 --> 00:14:51.681
and watched this professor at the end

00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:54.328
talk about content and, you know,

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:56.975
you didn't even have a rewind button?

00:14:56.975 --> 00:14:59.203
Thank you.

00:14:59.203 --> 00:15:01.194
(Applause)

00:15:01.194 --> 00:15:07.945
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
