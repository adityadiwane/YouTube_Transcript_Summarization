00:00:15.887 --> 00:00:17.499
I was born in Den Bosch,

00:00:17.523 --> 00:00:20.860
where the painter Hieronymus Bosch
named himself after.

00:00:20.884 --> 00:00:23.307
And I've always been very fond
of this painter

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:25.816
who lived and worked in the 15th century.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.536
And what is interesting about him
in relation to morality

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.615
is that he lived at a time
where religion's influence was waning,

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:33.456
and he was sort of wondering, I think,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.070
what would happen with society
if there was no religion

00:00:36.094 --> 00:00:37.554
or if there was less religion.

00:00:37.578 --> 00:00:41.032
And so he painted this famous painting,
"The Garden of Earthly Delights,"

00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:44.915
which some have interpreted
as being humanity before the Fall,

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:48.177
or being humanity without any Fall at all.

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:49.489
And so it makes you wonder,

00:00:49.513 --> 00:00:53.012
what would happen if we hadn't tasted
the fruit of knowledge, so to speak,

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:55.236
and what kind of morality would we have.

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:59.559
Much later, as a student,
I went to a very different garden,

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:04.251
a zoological garden in Arnhem
where we keep chimpanzees.

00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:07.401
This is me at an early age
with a baby chimpanzee.

00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:10.110
(Laughter)

00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:11.853
And I discovered there

00:01:11.877 --> 00:01:15.133
that the chimpanzees are very power-hungry
and wrote a book about it.

00:01:15.157 --> 00:01:17.684
And at that time the focus
in a lot of animal research

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:20.135
was on aggression and competition.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.416
I painted a whole picture
of the animal kingdom

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.638
and humanity included, was that deep down
we are competitors, we are aggressive,

00:01:27.662 --> 00:01:30.715
we are all out
for our own profit, basically.

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:32.611
This is the launch of my book.

00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:35.019
I'm not sure how well
the chimpanzees read it,

00:01:35.043 --> 00:01:37.714
but they surely seemed
interested in the book.

00:01:37.738 --> 00:01:39.943
(Laughter)

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:42.878
Now in the process of doing all this work

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:45.802
on power and dominance
and aggression and so on,

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:49.009
I discovered that chimpanzees
reconcile after fights.

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:51.819
And so what you see here
is two males who have had a fight.

00:01:51.843 --> 00:01:55.187
They ended up in a tree, and one of them
holds out a hand to the other.

00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:57.281
And about a second
after I took the picture,

00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:59.366
they came together in the fork of the tree

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.106
and kissed and embraced each other.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.474
And this is very interesting

00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:05.795
because at the time, everything
was about competition and aggression,

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.313
so it wouldn't make any sense.

00:02:07.337 --> 00:02:09.973
The only thing that matters
is that you win or you lose.

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:12.934
But why reconcile after a fight?
That doesn't make any sense.

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.956
This is the way bonobos do it.
Bonobos do everything with sex.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.794
And so they also reconcile with sex.

00:02:17.818 --> 00:02:19.744
But the principle is exactly the same.

00:02:19.768 --> 00:02:23.743
The principle is that you have
a valuable relationship

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:27.857
that is damaged by conflict,
so you need to do something about it.

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:32.248
So my whole picture of the animal kingdom,
and including humans also,

00:02:32.272 --> 00:02:33.851
started to change at that time.

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:38.214
So we have this image in political
science, economics, the humanities,

00:02:38.238 --> 00:02:42.096
the philosophy for that matter,
that man is a wolf to man.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.804
And so deep down,
our nature is actually nasty.

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:48.151
I think it's a very unfair
image for the wolf.

00:02:48.175 --> 00:02:51.621
The wolf is, after all,
a very cooperative animal.

00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:53.899
And that's why many of you
have a dog at home,

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:56.142
which has all these characteristics also.

00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:57.961
And it's really unfair to humanity,

00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:01.236
because humanity is actually
much more cooperative and empathic

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.447
than given credit for.

00:03:03.471 --> 00:03:05.731
So I started getting
interested in those issues

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:07.540
and studying that in other animals.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.944
So these are the pillars of morality.

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:13.520
If you ask anyone,
"What is morality based on?"

00:03:13.544 --> 00:03:15.739
these are the two factors
that always come out.

00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:17.470
One is reciprocity,

00:03:17.494 --> 00:03:21.049
and associated with it is a sense
of justice and a sense of fairness.

00:03:21.073 --> 00:03:23.266
And the other one is empathy
and compassion.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.541
And human morality is more than this,
but if you would remove these two pillars,

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:29.694
there would be not much
remaining, I think.

00:03:29.718 --> 00:03:31.373
So they're absolutely essential.

00:03:31.397 --> 00:03:33.265
So let me give you a few examples here.

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.989
This is a very old video
from the Yerkes Primate Center,

00:03:36.013 --> 00:03:38.336
where they trained
chimpanzees to cooperate.

00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:41.451
So this is already
about a hundred years ago

00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:44.567
that we were doing
experiments on cooperation.

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:48.123
What you have here is two
young chimpanzees who have a box,

00:03:48.147 --> 00:03:51.152
and the box is too heavy
for one chimp to pull in.

00:03:51.176 --> 00:03:53.035
And of course, there's food on the box.

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.060
Otherwise they wouldn't
be pulling so hard.

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:57.197
And so they're bringing in the box.

00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.490
And you can see that they're synchronized.

00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:02.614
You can see that they work together,
they pull at the same moment.

00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:05.151
It's already a big advance
over many other animals

00:04:05.175 --> 00:04:06.813
who wouldn't be able to do that.

00:04:06.837 --> 00:04:09.223
Now you're going to get
a more interesting picture,

00:04:09.247 --> 00:04:11.873
because now one
of the two chimps has been fed.

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:15.323
So one of the two is not really interested
in the task anymore.

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:20.168
(Laughter)

00:04:24.023 --> 00:04:28.833
(Laughter)

00:04:35.054 --> 00:04:37.990
(Laughter)

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.342
[- and sometimes appears to convey
its wishes and meanings by gestures.]

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.430
Now look at what happens
at the very end of this.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.184
(Laughter)

00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:09.656
He takes basically everything.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.656
(Laughter)

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.696
There are two interesting
parts about this.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.362
One is that the chimp on the right

00:05:16.386 --> 00:05:18.678
has a full understanding
he needs the partner --

00:05:18.702 --> 00:05:21.137
so a full understanding
of the need for cooperation.

00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:23.650
The second one is that the partner
is willing to work

00:05:23.674 --> 00:05:25.796
even though he's not
interested in the food.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.023
Why would that be?

00:05:27.047 --> 00:05:29.238
Well, that probably
has to do with reciprocity.

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:32.266
There's actually a lot of evidence
in primates and other animals

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.812
that they return favors.

00:05:33.836 --> 00:05:36.524
He will get a return favor
at some point in the future.

00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:38.423
And so that's how this all operates.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.195
We do the same task with elephants.

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.373
Now, it's very dangerous
to work with elephants.

00:05:44.397 --> 00:05:47.554
Another problem with elephants
is that you cannot make an apparatus

00:05:47.578 --> 00:05:49.495
that is too heavy for a single elephant.

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:51.236
Now you can probably make it,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.021
but it's going to be a pretty
clumsy apparatus, I think.

00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:55.687
And so what we did in that case --

00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:58.373
we do these studies in Thailand
for Josh Plotnik --

00:05:58.397 --> 00:06:02.330
is we have an apparatus around which
there is a rope, a single rope.

00:06:02.354 --> 00:06:06.117
And if you pull on this side of the rope,
the rope disappears on the other side.

00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:09.528
So two elephants need to pick it up
at exactly the same time, and pull.

00:06:09.552 --> 00:06:12.599
Otherwise nothing is going to happen
and the rope disappears.

00:06:12.623 --> 00:06:14.831
The first tape you're going to see

00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:18.844
is two elephants who are released together
arrive at the apparatus.

00:06:18.868 --> 00:06:21.668
The apparatus is on the left,
with food on it.

00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:25.118
And so they come together,
they arrive together,

00:06:25.142 --> 00:06:27.435
they pick it up together,
and they pull together.

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:29.775
So it's actually fairly simple for them.

00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:32.695
There they are.

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:42.024
So that's how they bring it in.

00:06:42.048 --> 00:06:44.205
But now we're going to make it
more difficult.

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:46.049
Because the purpose of this experiment

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:48.265
is to see how well
they understand cooperation.

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:51.127
Do they understand that as well
as the chimps, for example?

00:06:51.151 --> 00:06:54.629
What we do in the next step is we release
one elephant before the other

00:06:54.653 --> 00:06:56.664
and that elephant needs to be smart enough

00:06:56.688 --> 00:06:59.160
to stay there and wait
and not pull at the rope --

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:02.665
because if he pulls at the rope,
it disappears and the whole test is over.

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:05.959
Now this elephant does something illegal
that we did not teach it.

00:07:05.983 --> 00:07:08.149
But it shows the understanding he has,

00:07:08.173 --> 00:07:10.697
because he puts his big foot on the rope,

00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:13.039
stands on the rope
and waits there for the other,

00:07:13.063 --> 00:07:15.646
and then the other is going
to do all the work for him.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.236
So it's what we call freeloading.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.275
(Laughter)

00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:24.115
But it shows the intelligence
that the elephants have.

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:26.712
They developed several
of these alternative techniques

00:07:26.736 --> 00:07:28.694
that we did not approve of, necessarily.

00:07:28.718 --> 00:07:29.941
(Laughter)

00:07:29.965 --> 00:07:31.948
So the other elephant is now coming ...

00:07:35.006 --> 00:07:36.465
and is going to pull it in.

00:07:54.598 --> 00:07:57.716
Now look at the other;
it doesn't forget to eat, of course.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.002
(Laughter)

00:08:00.937 --> 00:08:03.154
This was the cooperation
and reciprocity part.

00:08:03.178 --> 00:08:04.397
Now something on empathy.

00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:06.925
Empathy is my main topic
at the moment, of research.

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:08.397
And empathy has two qualities:

00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.440
One is the understanding part of it.

00:08:10.464 --> 00:08:12.095
This is just a regular definition:

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:14.931
the ability to understand and share
the feelings of another.

00:08:14.955 --> 00:08:16.164
And the emotional part.

00:08:16.188 --> 00:08:19.599
Empathy has basically two channels:
One is the body channel,

00:08:19.623 --> 00:08:21.481
If you talk with a sad person,

00:08:21.505 --> 00:08:24.758
you're going to adopt
a sad expression and a sad posture,

00:08:24.782 --> 00:08:26.544
and before you know it, you feel sad.

00:08:26.568 --> 00:08:30.786
And that's sort of the body channel
of emotional empathy,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.089
which many animals have.

00:08:32.113 --> 00:08:33.668
Your average dog has that also.

00:08:33.692 --> 00:08:35.692
That's why people keep mammals in the home

00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:38.023
and not turtles or snakes
or something like that,

00:08:38.047 --> 00:08:39.836
who don't have that kind of empathy.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.632
And then there's a cognitive channel,

00:08:41.656 --> 00:08:44.720
which is more that you can take
the perspective of somebody else.

00:08:44.744 --> 00:08:45.902
And that's more limited.

00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:50.172
Very few animals, I think elephants
and apes, can do that kind of thing.

00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:53.133
So synchronization,

00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:55.300
which is part of that whole
empathy mechanism,

00:08:55.324 --> 00:08:57.579
is a very old one in the animal kingdom.

00:08:57.603 --> 00:09:00.844
In humans, of course,
we can study that with yawn contagion.

00:09:00.868 --> 00:09:02.686
Humans yawn when others yawn.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.493
And it's related to empathy.

00:09:04.517 --> 00:09:06.652
It activates the same areas in the brain.

00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:09.397
Also, we know that people
who have a lot of yawn contagion

00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:10.574
are highly empathic.

00:09:10.598 --> 00:09:13.773
People who have problems with empathy,
such as autistic children,

00:09:13.797 --> 00:09:15.289
they don't have yawn contagion.

00:09:15.313 --> 00:09:16.468
So it is connected.

00:09:16.492 --> 00:09:20.215
And we study that in our chimpanzees
by presenting them with an animated head.

00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:24.230
So that's what you see on the upper-left,
an animated head that yawns.

00:09:24.254 --> 00:09:25.874
And there's a chimpanzee watching,

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.340
an actual real chimpanzee
watching a computer screen

00:09:28.364 --> 00:09:30.312
on which we play these animations.

00:09:36.591 --> 00:09:38.272
(Laughter)

00:09:38.296 --> 00:09:41.235
So yawn contagion
that you're probably all familiar with --

00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:44.375
and maybe you're going
to start yawning soon now --

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:47.615
is something that we share
with other animals.

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:50.640
And that's related to that whole
body channel of synchronization

00:09:50.664 --> 00:09:52.384
that underlies empathy,

00:09:52.408 --> 00:09:55.511
and that is universal
in the mammals, basically.

00:09:55.535 --> 00:09:58.646
We also study more complex expressions --
This is consolation.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.770
This is a male chimpanzee
who has lost a fight and he's screaming,

00:10:01.794 --> 00:10:04.505
and a juvenile comes over
and puts an arm around him

00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:05.694
and calms him down.

00:10:05.718 --> 00:10:06.892
That's consolation.

00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:08.780
It's very similar to human consolation.

00:10:08.804 --> 00:10:10.963
And consolation behavior --

00:10:10.987 --> 00:10:12.137
(Laughter)

00:10:12.161 --> 00:10:13.846
it's empathy driven.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.687
Actually, the way to study
empathy in human children

00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:19.285
is to instruct a family member
to act distressed,

00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:21.272
and then to see what young children do.

00:10:21.296 --> 00:10:23.310
And so it is related to empathy,

00:10:23.334 --> 00:10:25.567
and that's the kind
of expressions we look at.

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:28.689
We also recently published an experiment
you may have heard about.

00:10:28.713 --> 00:10:30.696
It's on altruism and chimpanzees,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.136
where the question is: Do chimpanzees care
about the welfare of somebody else?

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.611
And for decades it had been assumed
that only humans can do that,

00:10:39.635 --> 00:10:42.894
that only humans worry
about the welfare of somebody else.

00:10:42.918 --> 00:10:45.355
Now we did a very simple experiment.

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:48.006
We do that on chimpanzees
that live in Lawrenceville,

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.772
in the field station of Yerkes.

00:10:49.796 --> 00:10:51.133
And so that's how they live.

00:10:51.157 --> 00:10:54.367
And we call them into a room
and do experiments with them.

00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:56.728
In this case, we put
two chimpanzees side-by-side,

00:10:56.752 --> 00:11:00.329
and one has a bucket full of tokens,
and the tokens have different meanings.

00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:02.926
One kind of token feeds
only the partner who chooses,

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.775
the other one feeds both of them.

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:07.144
So this is a study we did
with Vicki Horner.

00:11:08.816 --> 00:11:11.085
And here, you have the two color tokens.

00:11:11.109 --> 00:11:13.068
So they have a whole bucket full of them.

00:11:13.092 --> 00:11:15.865
And they have to pick
one of the two colors.

00:11:16.413 --> 00:11:17.873
You will see how that goes.

00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:21.529
So if this chimp makes the selfish choice,

00:11:22.433 --> 00:11:25.094
which is the red token in this case,

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:26.748
he needs to give it to us,

00:11:26.772 --> 00:11:30.109
we pick it up, we put it on a table
where there's two food rewards,

00:11:30.133 --> 00:11:32.668
but in this case, only the one
on the right gets food.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.473
The one on the left walks away
because she knows already

00:11:35.497 --> 00:11:37.567
that this is not a good test for her.

00:11:37.591 --> 00:11:40.276
Then the next one is the pro-social token.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.644
So the one who makes the choices --
that's the interesting part here --

00:11:43.668 --> 00:11:46.488
for the one who makes the choices,
it doesn't really matter.

00:11:46.512 --> 00:11:49.485
So she gives us now a pro-social
token and both chimps get fed.

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.236
So the one who makes the choices
always gets a reward.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.838
So it doesn't matter whatsoever.

00:11:53.862 --> 00:11:56.356
And she should actually
be choosing blindly.

00:11:57.182 --> 00:12:00.541
But what we find is that they prefer
the pro-social token.

00:12:00.565 --> 00:12:03.559
So this is the 50 percent line,
that's the random expectation.

00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:07.532
And especially if the partner draws
attention to itself, they choose more.

00:12:07.556 --> 00:12:09.564
And if the partner
puts pressure on them --

00:12:09.588 --> 00:12:12.727
so if the partner starts spitting water
and intimidating them --

00:12:12.751 --> 00:12:14.279
then the choices go down.

00:12:14.303 --> 00:12:15.342
(Laughter)

00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:17.236
It's as if they're saying,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.247
"If you're not behaving,
I'm not going to be pro-social today."

00:12:20.271 --> 00:12:22.275
And this is what happens
without a partner,

00:12:22.299 --> 00:12:24.113
when there's no partner sitting there.

00:12:24.137 --> 00:12:27.956
So we found that the chimpanzees do care
about the well-being of somebody else --

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.803
especially, these are other members
of their own group.

00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:34.204
So the final experiment
that I want to mention to you

00:12:34.228 --> 00:12:35.875
is our fairness study.

00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:38.789
And so this became a very famous study.

00:12:38.813 --> 00:12:40.236
And there are now many more,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.403
because after we did this
about 10 years ago,

00:12:42.427 --> 00:12:44.236
it became very well-known.

00:12:44.784 --> 00:12:47.077
And we did that originally
with Capuchin monkeys.

00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:49.891
And I'm going to show you
the first experiment that we did.

00:12:49.915 --> 00:12:52.727
It has now been done
with dogs and with birds

00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:54.236
and with chimpanzees.

00:12:54.805 --> 00:12:58.236
But with Sarah Brosnan,
we started out with Capuchin monkeys.

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:02.783
So what we did is we put
two Capuchin monkeys side-by-side.

00:13:02.807 --> 00:13:05.636
Again, these animals, live in a group,
they know each other.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.414
We take them out of the group,
put them in a test chamber.

00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:11.601
And there's a very simple task
that they need to do.

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:15.005
And if you give both of them
cucumber for the task,

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:16.459
the two monkeys side-by-side,

00:13:16.483 --> 00:13:19.313
they're perfectly willing
to do this 25 times in a row.

00:13:19.337 --> 00:13:22.784
So cucumber, even though
it's only really water in my opinion,

00:13:22.808 --> 00:13:26.046
but cucumber is perfectly fine for them.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.353
Now if you give the partner grapes --

00:13:28.377 --> 00:13:30.524
the food preferences
of my Capuchin monkeys

00:13:30.548 --> 00:13:33.588
correspond exactly with the prices
in the supermarket --

00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:37.017
and so if you give them grapes --
it's a far better food --

00:13:37.041 --> 00:13:39.244
then you create inequity between them.

00:13:39.962 --> 00:13:41.808
So that's the experiment we did.

00:13:41.832 --> 00:13:43.913
Recently, we videotaped it
with new monkeys

00:13:43.937 --> 00:13:45.274
who'd never done the task,

00:13:45.298 --> 00:13:47.930
thinking that maybe they would have
a stronger reaction,

00:13:47.954 --> 00:13:49.493
and that turned out to be right.

00:13:49.517 --> 00:13:52.013
The one on the left is the monkey
who gets cucumber.

00:13:52.037 --> 00:13:54.296
The one on the right
is the one who gets grapes.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.667
The one who gets cucumber --

00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:58.401
note that the first piece
of cucumber is perfectly fine.

00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:00.236
The first piece she eats.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.865
Then she sees the other one getting grape,
and you will see what happens.

00:14:04.554 --> 00:14:07.133
So she gives a rock to us.
That's the task.

00:14:07.157 --> 00:14:10.215
And we give her a piece
of cucumber and she eats it.

00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:12.236
The other one needs to give a rock to us.

00:14:13.448 --> 00:14:15.236
And that's what she does.

00:14:15.847 --> 00:14:17.459
And she gets a grape ...

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:20.002
and eats it.

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.221
The other one sees that.

00:14:21.245 --> 00:14:22.561
She gives a rock to us now,

00:14:22.585 --> 00:14:24.157
gets, again, cucumber.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:34.620
(Laughter)

00:14:41.001 --> 00:14:43.002
(Laughter ends)

00:14:43.026 --> 00:14:46.001
She tests a rock now against the wall.

00:14:46.025 --> 00:14:47.381
She needs to give it to us.

00:14:48.244 --> 00:14:50.260
And she gets cucumber again.

00:14:52.603 --> 00:14:59.059
(Laughter)

00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:02.840
So this is basically
the Wall Street protest that you see here.

00:15:02.864 --> 00:15:05.236
(Laughter)

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.513
(Applause)

00:15:09.537 --> 00:15:11.323
I still have two minutes left --

00:15:11.347 --> 00:15:13.310
let me tell you a funny story about this.

00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:17.131
This study became very famous
and we got a lot of comments,

00:15:17.155 --> 00:15:20.761
especially anthropologists,
economists, philosophers.

00:15:20.785 --> 00:15:22.193
They didn't like this at all.

00:15:22.217 --> 00:15:24.779
Because they had decided
in their minds, I believe,

00:15:24.803 --> 00:15:28.869
that fairness is a very complex issue,
and that animals cannot have it.

00:15:29.472 --> 00:15:31.935
And so one philosopher even wrote us

00:15:31.959 --> 00:15:34.733
that it was impossible that monkeys
had a sense of fairness

00:15:34.757 --> 00:15:37.538
because fairness was invented
during the French Revolution.

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:39.979
(Laughter)

00:15:40.003 --> 00:15:42.685
And another one wrote a whole chapter

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:46.236
saying that he would believe
it had something to do with fairness,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.657
if the one who got grapes
would refuse the grapes.

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:52.553
Now the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan,
who's been doing this with chimpanzees,

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.723
had a couple of combinations
of chimpanzees

00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:57.103
where, indeed, the one
who would get the grape

00:15:57.127 --> 00:16:00.033
would refuse the grape
until the other guy also got a grape.

00:16:00.057 --> 00:16:02.824
So we're getting very close
to the human sense of fairness.

00:16:02.848 --> 00:16:06.284
And I think philosophers need
to rethink their philosophy for a while.

00:16:06.918 --> 00:16:08.236
So let me summarize.

00:16:08.852 --> 00:16:10.664
I believe there's an evolved morality.

00:16:10.688 --> 00:16:13.907
I think morality is much more
than what I've been talking about,

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:16.382
but it would be impossible
without these ingredients

00:16:16.406 --> 00:16:17.904
that we find in other primates,

00:16:17.928 --> 00:16:19.765
which are empathy and consolation,

00:16:19.789 --> 00:16:23.495
pro-social tendencies and reciprocity
and a sense of fairness.

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:25.576
And so we work on these particular issues

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.945
to see if we can create a morality
from the bottom up, so to speak,

00:16:28.969 --> 00:16:31.402
without necessarily
god and religion involved,

00:16:31.426 --> 00:16:33.892
and to see how we can get
to an evolved morality.

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:36.066
And I thank you for your attention.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:43.090
(Applause)
