00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
My name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
about my project, Tidying Up Art.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.330
First of all -- any questions so far?

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.330
I'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.330
I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
because I'm speaking in a foreign language,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.330
and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.330
Because I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
I'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
if we Swiss try to speak American.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
But don't worry -- I don't have trouble with English, as such.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.330
I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
(Laughter)

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.330
I am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
and you have to go on talking like this all the time.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.330
(Laughter)

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
It's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
it's more or less a picture book.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.330
So the reading would be over very quickly.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.330
But since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.330
in the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.330
I'd like to show them around so we can just, you know --

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
(Laughter)

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.330
So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
You won't be familiar with it.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.330
I mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.330
and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.330
and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
this guy was looking at all day long.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
And it seemed to me even he felt really bad

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.330
facing these unorganized red squares day after day.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
So I decided to give him a little support,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.330
and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
(Laughter)

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.330
Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.330
And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.330
at modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
is particularly topsy-turvy.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
And I can show here a very good example.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
It's a picture by Paul Klee.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
And we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
(Laughter)

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.330
Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture --

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.330
the whole thing is unstructured.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.330
We don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean --

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
(Laughter)

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
-- maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
We can see here he started out with orange,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
and then he already ran out of orange,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.330
and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.330
(Laughter)

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330
We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.330
17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.330
Yeah, that's great.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.330
So I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.330
(Laughter)

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.330
What can you say? What a mess.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.330
I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
If my room back home had looked like this,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
my mother would have grounded me for three days.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.330
So I'd like to -- I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.330
And that's really advanced tidying up.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
(Applause)

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
Yeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
but that's actually more in Switzerland.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.330
(Laughter)

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.330
We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
We are only happy when things are in order.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.330
But to go on, here is a very good example to see.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
This is a picture by Joan Miro.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.330
And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.330
and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
(Laughter)

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.330
And this is my --

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
(Laughter)

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.330
-- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
It's more economical and also more efficient.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.330
With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.330
But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.330
So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.330
I brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
because I've had my working methods patented

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.330
at the Eidgenössische Amt für Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
(Laughter)

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
I'll just quote from the specification.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.330
"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht --"

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
It's not finished yet.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.330
"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht Götz von Ohlenhusen

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich geschützt welche die Kunst

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
durch spezifisch aufgeräumte Regelmässigkeiten

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
des allgemeinen Formenschatzes

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
neue Wirkungen zu erzielen möglich wird."

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.330
Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.330
I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.330
I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
that's why these patents are sometimes necessary.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
I would like to do a short test with you.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.330
So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
The right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.330
And now, I'll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
Now, I'll count to three, and on the count of three

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK?

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
One, two, three.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:06.330
(Laughter)

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.330
You can see now, that's a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic way

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
can sometimes lead to complete chaos.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.330
So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.330
This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.330
And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.330
what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.330
But in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
(Laughter)

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:48.330
Yeah, it's a -- this one here, that's much better.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
That's a picture by Keith Haring.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.330
(Laughter)

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
I think it doesn't matter.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.330
So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:07.330
It's called "Untitled" and I think that's appropriate.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.330
So, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
(Laughter)

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
This is Keith Haring looked at statistically.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
One can see here quite clearly,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.330
you can see we have 25 pale green elements,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
of which one is in the form of a circle.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:31.330
Or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.330
I mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
to cover all Mr. Haring's various works,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.330
in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.330
And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.330
by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.330
(Laughter)

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
One can obviously also make combinations.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.330
For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.330
In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.330
Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:15.330
put it in your office and you can make a living doing it.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
(Laughter)

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
Yeah, from my own experience. So I'm --

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.330
(Laughter)

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:27.330
Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.330
This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
(Laughter)

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.330
But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.330
And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:48.330
(Laughter)

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
And here, that's one of my favorites.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.330
You know, there is a --

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.330
(Laughter)

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.330
I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.330
So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
And you know, there you had this little sign --

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:16.330
I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
"Please tidy room." I don't know if you have them over here.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:25.330
So actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
So after a while I decided to have a little fun,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.330
and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.330
Like books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.330
By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:49.330
But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
(Laughter)

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:57.330
And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
And when I returned it looked like this.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:07.330
(Laughter)

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
(Laughter)

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
OK, I mean, I can see there are always people

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.330
that like reacting that one or another picture

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.330
hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
This is a picture by Rene Magritte,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.330
and I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is --

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:35.330
to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
(Laughter)

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:42.330
Yeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.330
Some people would make apple pie out of it.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
But it's a very good example to see that the whole work

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:53.330
was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:59.330
of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
And it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer,

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.330
otherwise it would look like this.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:11.330
(Laughter)

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:17.330
So now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.330
Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:25.330
It's -- oh, no, it's -- that's a really hard one.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:30.330
But after a while, I just decided here to go all the way

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
and put the paint back into the cans.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:43.330
(Applause)

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:48.330
Or you could go into three-dimensional art.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:53.330
Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
Here I just brought it back to its original state.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:04.330
(Laughter)

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:09.330
But yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know --

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:15.330
Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
where everything is broken down into dots and pixels.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.330
And then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
(Laughter)

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.330
So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
and I collected together all his dots.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
And now they're all in here.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:41.330
(Laughter)

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.330
You can count them afterwards, if you like.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:47.330
You see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea:

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.330
There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.330
I mean, it's "the future we will create."

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
(Laughter)

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:05.330
But to round things up I would like to show you just one more.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.330
This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.330
That's how it looks like when you send everyone home.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:22.330
(Laughter)

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.330
where old Bruegel's people went?

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.330
Of course, they're not gone. They're all here.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.330
(Laughter)

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.330
I just piled them up.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:39.330
(Laughter)

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.330
So I'm -- yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:48.330
And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
(Laughter)

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.330
But before leaving I would like to show you,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.330
I'm working right now on another -- in a related field

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
with my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:14.330
And I started to bring some order into some flags.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:21.330
Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:26.330
(Laughter)

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:31.330
And then maybe before I leave you ...

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:35.330
yeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.330
(Laughter)

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:44.330
Yeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly,

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.330
so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
(Laughter)

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.330
Thank you very much.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.330
(Applause)
