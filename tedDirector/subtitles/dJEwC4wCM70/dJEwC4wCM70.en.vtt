00:00:12.715 --> 00:00:14.464
For over a decade as a doctor,

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:17.130
I've cared for homeless veterans,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.185
for working-class families.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:23.406
I've cared for people who 
live and work in conditions

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:25.855
that can be hard, if not harsh,

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:27.608
and that work has led me to believe

00:00:27.608 --> 00:00:29.553
that we need a fundamentally different way

00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:31.787
of looking at healthcare.

00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:33.193
We simply need a healthcare system

00:00:33.193 --> 00:00:35.294
that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms

00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:36.973
that bring people into clinics,

00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:39.850
but instead actually is able to look

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.445
and improve health where it begins.

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:43.932
And where health begins

00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:46.692
is not in the four walls of a doctor's office,

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:48.102
but where we live

00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:50.321
and where we work,

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:53.473
where we eat, sleep, learn and play,

00:00:53.473 --> 00:00:56.900
where we spend the majority of our lives.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.568
So what does this different 
approach to healthcare look like,

00:00:59.568 --> 00:01:02.794
an approach that can improve health where it begins?

00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:06.601
To illustrate this, I'll tell you about Veronica.

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.320
Veronica was the 17th patient

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.227
out of my 26-patient day

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:13.174
at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles.

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:15.693
She came into our clinic with a chronic headache.

00:01:15.693 --> 00:01:16.856
This headache had been going on

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:18.809
for a number of years, and this particular episode

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:21.260
was very, very troubling.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.974
In fact, three weeks before she came to visit us

00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:27.130
for the first time, she went to an 
emergency room in Los Angeles.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.597
The emergency room doctors said,

00:01:29.597 --> 00:01:31.555
"We've run some tests, Veronica.

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:34.267
The results are normal, so
here's some pain medication,

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:36.786
and follow up with a primary care doctor,

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:38.529
but if the pain persists or if it worsens,

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:40.258
then come on back."

00:01:40.258 --> 00:01:43.350
Veronica followed those standard instructions

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.100
and she went back.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.333
She went back not just once, but twice more.

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.791
In the three weeks before Veronica met us,

00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:52.940
she went to the emergency room three times.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.807
She went back and forth,

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:56.506
in and out of hospitals and clinics,

00:01:56.506 --> 00:01:58.272
just like she had done in years past,

00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:01.712
trying to seek relief but still coming up short.

00:02:01.712 --> 00:02:03.840
Veronica came to our clinic,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.472
and despite all these encounters
with healthcare professionals,

00:02:06.472 --> 00:02:09.304
Veronica was still sick.

00:02:09.304 --> 00:02:12.925
When she came to our clinic, though, 
we tried a different approach.

00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:15.562
Our approach started with our medical assistant,

00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:17.609
someone who had a GED-level training

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:18.959
but knew the community.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.080
Our medical assistant asked some routine questions.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.532
She asked, "What's your chief complaint?"

00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:25.821
"Headache."

00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:27.115
"Let's get your vital signs" â€”

00:02:27.115 --> 00:02:29.624
measure your blood pressure and your heart rate,

00:02:29.624 --> 00:02:31.637
but let's also ask something equally as vital

00:02:31.637 --> 00:02:33.707
to Veronica and a lot of patients like her

00:02:33.707 --> 00:02:35.514
in South Los Angeles.

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:38.155
"Veronica, can you tell me about where you live?

00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:39.908
Specifically, about your housing conditions?

00:02:39.908 --> 00:02:42.361
Do you have mold? Do you have water leaks?

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:44.518
Do you have roaches in your home?"

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:46.925
Turns out, Veronica said yes
to three of those things:

00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:49.232
roaches, water leaks, mold.

00:02:49.232 --> 00:02:52.347
I received that chart in hand, reviewed it,

00:02:52.347 --> 00:02:53.674
and I turned the handle on the door

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:55.666
and I entered the room.

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:57.116
You should understand that Veronica,

00:02:57.116 --> 00:02:59.569
like a lot of patients that I have
the privilege of caring for,

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.292
is a dignified person, a formidable presence,

00:03:02.292 --> 00:03:04.125
a personality that's larger than life,

00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:05.925
but here she was

00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:08.760
doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.944
Her head, clearly throbbing, was resting in her hands.

00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:14.293
She lifted her head up,

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:17.400
and I saw her face, said hello,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.659
and then I immediately noticed something

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.331
across the bridge of her nose,

00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:22.416
a crease in her skin.

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:25.735
In medicine, we call that crease the allergic salute.

00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:28.547
It's usually seen among children
who have chronic allergies.

00:03:28.547 --> 00:03:31.303
It comes from chronically rubbing
one's nose up and down,

00:03:31.303 --> 00:03:33.609
trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms,

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.646
and yet, here was Veronica, a grown woman,

00:03:35.646 --> 00:03:38.435
with the same telltale sign of allergies.

00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:41.380
A few minutes later, in asking
Veronica some questions,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.329
and examining her and listening to her,

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.134
I said, "Veronica, I think I know what you have.

00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:48.188
I think you have chronic allergies,

00:03:48.188 --> 00:03:50.451
and I think you have migraine
headaches and some sinus congestion,

00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:53.989
and I think all of those are 
related to where you live."

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.733
She looked a little bit relieved,

00:03:55.733 --> 00:03:57.708
because for the first time, she had a diagnosis,

00:03:57.708 --> 00:03:59.945
but I said, "Veronica, now let's
talk about your treatment.

00:03:59.945 --> 00:04:03.387
We're going to order some
medications for your symptoms,

00:04:03.387 --> 00:04:06.920
but I also want to refer you to
a specialist, if that's okay."

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.226
Now, specialists are a little hard to find

00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:11.028
in South Central Los Angeles,

00:04:11.028 --> 00:04:13.714
so she gave me this look, like, "Really?"

00:04:13.714 --> 00:04:16.391
And I said, "Veronica, actually,
the specialist I'm talking about

00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:18.677
is someone I call a community health worker,

00:04:18.677 --> 00:04:20.318
someone who, if it's okay with you,

00:04:20.318 --> 00:04:21.100
can come to your home

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.830
and try to understand what's going on

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.188
with those water leaks and that mold,

00:04:24.188 --> 00:04:28.226
trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms,

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.318
and if required, that specialist might refer you

00:04:30.318 --> 00:04:32.810
to another specialist that we
call a public interest lawyer,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.503
because it might be that your landlord

00:04:34.503 --> 00:04:37.776
isn't making the fixes he's required to make."

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:39.903
Veronica came back in a few months later.

00:04:39.903 --> 00:04:42.715
She agreed to all of those treatment plans.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:45.761
She told us that her symptoms
had improved by 90 percent.

00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:47.627
She was spending more time at work

00:04:47.627 --> 00:04:49.513
and with her family and less time

00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:54.123
shuttling back and forth between
the emergency rooms of Los Angeles.

00:04:54.123 --> 00:04:56.335
Veronica had improved remarkably.

00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:58.329
Her sons, one of whom had asthma,

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:00.104
were no longer as sick as they used to be.

00:05:00.104 --> 00:05:02.491
She had gotten better, and not coincidentally,

00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:06.166
Veronica's home was better too.

00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:08.010
What was it about this different approach we tried

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.604
that led to better care,

00:05:11.604 --> 00:05:15.163
fewer visits to the E.R., better health?

00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:17.260
Well, quite simply, it started with that question:

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.251
"Veronica, where do you live?"

00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:22.627
But more importantly, it was that we put in place

00:05:22.627 --> 00:05:25.197
a system that allowed us to routinely ask questions

00:05:25.197 --> 00:05:27.498
to Veronica and hundreds more like her

00:05:27.498 --> 00:05:29.357
about the conditions that mattered

00:05:29.357 --> 00:05:31.195
in her community, about where health,

00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:34.147
and unfortunately sometimes illness, do begin

00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:35.900
in places like South L.A.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.129
In that community, substandard housing

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.670
and food insecurity are the major conditions

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.492
that we as a clinic had to be aware of,

00:05:41.492 --> 00:05:43.220
but in other communities it could be

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.300
transportation barriers, obesity,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.685
access to parks, gun violence.

00:05:48.685 --> 00:05:50.919
The important thing is, we put in place a system

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.283
that worked,

00:05:52.283 --> 00:05:54.554
and it's an approach that I call an upstream approach.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.227
It's a term many of you are familiar with.

00:05:56.227 --> 00:05:58.344
It comes from a parable that's very common

00:05:58.344 --> 00:06:00.663
in the public health community.

00:06:00.663 --> 00:06:03.273
This is a parable of three friends.

00:06:03.273 --> 00:06:05.440
Imagine that you're one of these three friends

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.020
who come to a river.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.380
It's a beautiful scene, but it's
shattered by the cries of a child,

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.357
and actually several children,
in need of rescue in the water.

00:06:13.357 --> 00:06:15.250
So you do hopefully what everybody would do.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.041
You jump right in along with your friends.

00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:18.830
The first friend says, I'm going to rescue those

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.163
who are about to drown,

00:06:20.163 --> 00:06:22.199
those at most risk of falling over the waterfall.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.134
The second friends says,
I'm going to build a raft.

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.934
I'm going to make sure that fewer people

00:06:25.934 --> 00:06:27.419
need to end up at the waterfall's edge.

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:28.721
Let's usher more people to safety

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:29.883
by building this raft,

00:06:29.883 --> 00:06:31.739
coordinating those branches together.

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:34.110
Over time, they're successful, but not really,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.012
as much as they want to be.

00:06:35.012 --> 00:06:37.273
More people slip through, and they finally look up

00:06:37.273 --> 00:06:38.543
and they see that their third friend

00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:39.960
is nowhere to be seen.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.391
They finally spot her.

00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:43.427
She's in the water. She's swimming away from them

00:06:43.427 --> 00:06:45.800
upstream, rescuing children as she goes,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.105
and they shout to her, "Where are you going?

00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:48.646
There are children here to save."

00:06:48.646 --> 00:06:50.143
And she says back,

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:51.372
"I'm going to find out

00:06:51.372 --> 00:06:55.430
who or what is throwing these children in the water."

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.329
In healthcare, we have that first friend â€”

00:06:58.329 --> 00:06:59.404
we have the specialist,

00:06:59.404 --> 00:07:01.950
we have the trauma surgeon, the ICU nurse,

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.974
the E.R. doctors.

00:07:02.974 --> 00:07:05.515
We have those people that are vital rescuers,

00:07:05.515 --> 00:07:08.920
people you want to be there
when you're in dire straits.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.179
We also know that we have the second friend â€”

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:12.874
we have that raft-builder.

00:07:12.874 --> 00:07:14.585
That's the primary care clinician,

00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:16.743
people on the care team who are there

00:07:16.743 --> 00:07:18.333
to manage your chronic conditions,

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:19.874
your diabetes, your hypertension,

00:07:19.874 --> 00:07:21.280
there to give you your annual checkups,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.485
there to make sure your vaccines are up to date,

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:25.150
but also there to make sure that you have

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.626
a raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety.

00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:30.393
But while that's also vital and very necessary,

00:07:30.393 --> 00:07:32.237
what we're missing is that third friend.

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:34.352
We don't have enough of that upstreamist.

00:07:34.352 --> 00:07:36.013
The upstreamists are the health care professionals

00:07:36.013 --> 00:07:38.300
who know that health does begin

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.291
where we live and work and play,

00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:42.823
but beyond that awareness, is able to mobilize

00:07:42.823 --> 00:07:45.110
the resources to create the system

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.918
in their clinics and in their hospitals

00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:50.304
that really does start to approach that,

00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:52.306
to connect people to the resources they need

00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:54.980
outside the four walls of the clinic.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.648
Now you might ask, and it's 
a very obvious question

00:07:56.648 --> 00:07:59.303
that a lot of colleagues in medicine ask:

00:07:59.303 --> 00:08:02.449
"Doctors and nurses thinking
about transportation and housing?

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.759
Shouldn't we just provide pills and procedures

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:06.491
and just make sure we focus on the task at hand?"

00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:09.337
Certainly, rescuing people at the water's edge

00:08:09.337 --> 00:08:12.454
is important enough work.

00:08:12.454 --> 00:08:13.725
Who has the time?

00:08:13.725 --> 00:08:16.616
I would argue, though, that if we
were to use science as our guide,

00:08:16.616 --> 00:08:19.349
that we would find an upstream
approach is absolutely necessary.

00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:21.104
Scientists now know that

00:08:21.104 --> 00:08:23.354
the living and working conditions that we all

00:08:23.354 --> 00:08:24.990
are part of

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.380
have more than twice the impact on our health

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.507
than does our genetic code,

00:08:29.507 --> 00:08:30.840
and living and working conditions,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.226
the structures of our environments,

00:08:32.226 --> 00:08:35.695
the ways in which our social fabric is woven together,

00:08:35.695 --> 00:08:37.877
and the impact those have on our behaviors,

00:08:37.877 --> 00:08:40.190
all together, those have more than five times

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.155
the impact on our health

00:08:41.155 --> 00:08:43.164
than do all the pills and procedures

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:45.213
administered by doctors and hospitals combined.

00:08:45.213 --> 00:08:48.384
All together, living and working conditions

00:08:48.384 --> 00:08:52.480
account for 60 percent of preventable death.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.060
Let me give you an example of what this feels like.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.663
Let's say there was a company, a tech startup

00:08:56.663 --> 00:08:58.564
that came to you and said, "We have a great product.

00:08:58.564 --> 00:09:01.388
It's going to lower your risk
of death from heart disease."

00:09:01.388 --> 00:09:03.289
Now, you might be likely to invest

00:09:03.289 --> 00:09:06.473
if that product was a drug or a device,

00:09:06.473 --> 00:09:09.211
but what if that product was a park?

00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:10.767
A study in the U.K.,

00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:12.851
a landmark study that reviewed the records

00:09:12.851 --> 00:09:16.192
of over 40 million residents in the U.K.,

00:09:16.192 --> 00:09:18.020
looked at several variables,

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.587
controlled for a lot of factors, and found that

00:09:20.587 --> 00:09:24.670
when trying to adjust the risk of heart disease,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.701
one's exposure to green
space was a powerful influence.

00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:29.580
The closer you were to green space,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.922
to parks and trees,

00:09:30.922 --> 00:09:32.417
the lower your chance of heart disease,

00:09:32.417 --> 00:09:35.224
and that stayed true for rich and for poor.

00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:37.544
That study illustrates what my friends in public health

00:09:37.544 --> 00:09:39.042
often say these days:

00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:41.110
that one's zip code matters more

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.786
than your genetic code.

00:09:42.786 --> 00:09:44.235
We're also learning that zip code

00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:46.670
is actually shaping our genetic code.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.887
The science of epigenetics looks
at those molecular mechanisms,

00:09:49.887 --> 00:09:52.920
those intricate ways in which
our DNA is literally shaped,

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.488
genes turned on and off

00:09:54.488 --> 00:09:56.682
based on the exposures to the environment,

00:09:56.682 --> 00:09:59.426
to where we live and to where we work.

00:09:59.426 --> 00:10:01.283
So it's clear that these factors,

00:10:01.283 --> 00:10:03.366
these upstream issues, do matter.

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:05.069
They matter to our health,

00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:07.562
and therefore our healthcare professionals
should do something about it.

00:10:07.562 --> 00:10:09.330
And yet, Veronica asked me

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.289
perhaps the most compelling question

00:10:10.289 --> 00:10:11.697
I've been asked in a long time.

00:10:11.697 --> 00:10:13.835
In that follow-up visit, she said,

00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:15.987
"Why did none of my doctors

00:10:15.987 --> 00:10:18.865
ask about my home before?

00:10:18.865 --> 00:10:21.069
In those visits to the emergency room,

00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:22.870
I had two CAT scans,

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.827
I had a needle placed in the lower part of my back

00:10:24.827 --> 00:10:26.357
to collect spinal fluid,

00:10:26.357 --> 00:10:27.831
I had nearly a dozen blood tests.

00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:30.485
I went back and forth, I saw
all sorts of people in healthcare,

00:10:30.485 --> 00:10:34.770
and no one asked about my home."

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.508
The honest answer is that in healthcare,

00:10:36.508 --> 00:10:38.203
we often treat symptoms without addressing

00:10:38.203 --> 00:10:41.323
the conditions that make you sick in the first place.

00:10:41.323 --> 00:10:43.167
And there are many reasons for that, but the big three

00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:47.767
are first, we don't pay for that.

00:10:47.767 --> 00:10:51.152
In healthcare, we often pay 
for volume and not value.

00:10:51.152 --> 00:10:52.940
We pay doctors and hospitals usually

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.920
for the number of services they provide,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.219
but not necessarily on how healthy they make you.

00:10:58.219 --> 00:11:00.530
That leads to a second phenomenon that I call

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.910
the "don't ask, don't tell" approach

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.484
to upstream issues in healthcare.

00:11:04.484 --> 00:11:06.228
We don't ask about where you
live and where you work,

00:11:06.228 --> 00:11:07.453
because if there's a problem there,

00:11:07.453 --> 00:11:10.349
we don't know what to tell you.

00:11:10.349 --> 00:11:13.169
It's not that doctors don't know
these are important issues.

00:11:13.169 --> 00:11:15.040
In a recent survey done in the U.S. among physicians,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.931
over 1,000 physicians,

00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:18.743
80 percent of them actually said that

00:11:18.743 --> 00:11:20.441
they know that their patients' upstream problems

00:11:20.441 --> 00:11:22.328
are as important as their health issues,

00:11:22.328 --> 00:11:24.020
as their medical problems,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.381
and yet despite that widespread awareness

00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:28.315
of the importance of upstream issues,

00:11:28.315 --> 00:11:30.588
only one in five doctors said they had

00:11:30.588 --> 00:11:33.453
any sense of confidence to address those issues,

00:11:33.453 --> 00:11:35.301
to improve health where it begins.

00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:36.843
There's this gap between knowing

00:11:36.843 --> 00:11:39.272
that patients' lives, the context
of where they live and work,

00:11:39.272 --> 00:11:42.080
matters, and the ability to do something about it

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.857
in the systems in which we work.

00:11:43.857 --> 00:11:46.191
This is a huge problem right now,

00:11:46.191 --> 00:11:48.339
because it leads them to this next question, which is,

00:11:48.339 --> 00:11:49.926
whose responsibility is it?

00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:51.635
And that brings me to that third point,

00:11:51.635 --> 00:11:54.909
that third answer to Veronica's compelling question.

00:11:54.909 --> 00:11:56.495
Part of the reason that we have this conundrum

00:11:56.495 --> 00:12:00.250
is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.295
in the healthcare system.

00:12:02.295 --> 00:12:04.195
There are not nearly enough of that third friend,

00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:05.959
that person who is going to find out

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.816
who or what is throwing those kids in the water.

00:12:08.816 --> 00:12:10.521
Now, there are many upstreamists,

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:12.962
and I've had the privilege of meeting many of them,

00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:15.589
in Los Angeles and in other parts of the country

00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:17.357
and around the world,

00:12:17.357 --> 00:12:19.785
and it's important to note that upstreamists

00:12:19.785 --> 00:12:22.322
sometimes are doctors, but they need not be.

00:12:22.322 --> 00:12:24.515
They can be nurses, other clinicians,

00:12:24.515 --> 00:12:26.523
care managers, social workers.

00:12:26.523 --> 00:12:28.475
It's not so important what specific degree

00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:30.274
upstreamists have at the end of their name.

00:12:30.274 --> 00:12:32.030
What's more important is that they all seem

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:36.455
to share the same ability to implement a process

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:38.244
that transforms their assistance,

00:12:38.244 --> 00:12:40.590
transforms the way they practice medicine.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.176
That process is a quite simple process.

00:12:42.176 --> 00:12:44.549
It's one, two and three.

00:12:44.549 --> 00:12:46.200
First, they sit down and they say,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.224
let's identify the clinical problem

00:12:48.224 --> 00:12:49.567
among a certain set of patients.

00:12:49.567 --> 00:12:51.310
Let's say, for instance,

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.244
let's try to help children

00:12:53.244 --> 00:12:55.048
who are bouncing in and out of the hospital

00:12:55.048 --> 00:12:57.130
with asthma.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.641
After identifying the problem, they 
then move on to that second step,

00:12:59.641 --> 00:13:02.380
and they say, let's identify the root cause.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.171
Now, a root cause analysis, in healthcare,

00:13:06.171 --> 00:13:07.886
usually says, well, let's look at your genes,

00:13:07.886 --> 00:13:10.344
let's look at how you're behaving.

00:13:10.344 --> 00:13:12.424
Maybe you're not eating healthy enough.

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:13.440
Eat healthier.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.835
It's a pretty simplistic

00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:16.241
approach to root cause analyses.

00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:17.906
It turns out, it doesn't really work

00:13:17.906 --> 00:13:20.370
when we just limit ourselves that worldview.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.471
The root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings

00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:24.408
to the table is to say, let's look at the living

00:13:24.408 --> 00:13:27.760
and the working conditions in your life.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.842
Perhaps, for children with asthma,

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:31.450
it's what's happening in their home,

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.386
or perhaps they live close to a
freeway with major air pollution

00:13:34.386 --> 00:13:36.210
that triggers their asthma.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.830
And perhaps that's what we should
mobilize our resources to address,

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.203
because that third element,
that third part of the process,

00:13:41.203 --> 00:13:43.734
is that next critical part of what upstreamists do.

00:13:43.734 --> 00:13:45.973
They mobilize the resources to create a solution,

00:13:45.973 --> 00:13:47.694
both within the clinical system,

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:50.030
and then by bringing in people from public health,

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.372
from other sectors, lawyers,

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:53.319
whoever is willing to play ball,

00:13:53.319 --> 00:13:55.402
let's bring in to create a solution that makes sense,

00:13:55.402 --> 00:13:58.212
to take those patients who
actually have clinical problems

00:13:58.212 --> 00:14:00.395
and address their root causes together

00:14:00.395 --> 00:14:02.937
by linking them to the resources you need.

00:14:02.937 --> 00:14:04.714
It's clear to me that there are so many stories

00:14:04.714 --> 00:14:07.200
of upstreamists who are doing remarkable things.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.860
The problem is that there's just not
nearly enough of them out there.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.443
By some estimates, we need one upstreamist

00:14:12.443 --> 00:14:15.389
for every 20 to 30 clinicians
in the healthcare system.

00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:16.644
In the U.S., for instance, that would mean

00:14:16.644 --> 00:14:18.740
that we need 25,000 upstreamists

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.207
by the year 2020.

00:14:22.207 --> 00:14:26.317
But we only have a few thousand upstreamists
out there right now, by all accounts,

00:14:26.317 --> 00:14:28.870
and that's why, a few years ago, my colleagues and I

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.787
said, you know what, we need to train

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.760
and make more upstreamists.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.466
So we decided to start an organization

00:14:34.466 --> 00:14:36.684
called Health Begins,

00:14:36.684 --> 00:14:38.430
and Health Begins simply does that:

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.390
We train upstreamists.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.328
And there are a lot of measures
that we use for our success,

00:14:41.328 --> 00:14:42.689
but the main thing that we're interested in

00:14:42.689 --> 00:14:44.601
is making sure that we're changing

00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:46.140
the sense of confidence,

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.045
that "don't ask, don't tell" metric among clinicians.

00:14:48.045 --> 00:14:50.344
We're trying to make sure that clinicians,

00:14:50.344 --> 00:14:52.284
and therefore their systems that they work in

00:14:52.284 --> 00:14:54.579
have the ability, the confidence

00:14:54.579 --> 00:14:57.254
to address the problems in the living

00:14:57.254 --> 00:15:00.261
and working conditions in our lives.

00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:02.240
We're seeing nearly a tripling

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.821
of that confidence in our work.

00:15:03.821 --> 00:15:05.124
It's remarkable,

00:15:05.124 --> 00:15:07.038
but I'll tell you the most compelling part

00:15:07.038 --> 00:15:08.607
of what it means to be working

00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:13.090
with upstreamists to gather them together.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.413
What is most compelling is that every day,

00:15:15.413 --> 00:15:19.184
every week, I hear stories just like Veronica's.

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:21.662
There are stories out there of Veronica

00:15:21.662 --> 00:15:23.581
and many more like her,

00:15:23.581 --> 00:15:25.462
people who are coming to the healthcare system

00:15:25.462 --> 00:15:26.840
and getting a glimpse of what it feels like

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.400
to be part of something that works,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.873
a health care system that stops
bouncing you back and forth

00:15:31.873 --> 00:15:33.694
but actually improves your health,

00:15:33.694 --> 00:15:34.821
listens to you who you are,

00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:37.124
addresses the context of your life,

00:15:37.124 --> 00:15:41.489
whether you're rich or poor or middle class.

00:15:41.489 --> 00:15:43.144
These stories are compelling because

00:15:43.144 --> 00:15:45.124
not only do they tell us that we're this close

00:15:45.124 --> 00:15:47.710
to getting the healthcare system that we want,

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.459
but that there's something
that we can all do to get there.

00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:52.321
Doctors and nurses can get better at asking

00:15:52.321 --> 00:15:54.165
about the context of patients' lives,

00:15:54.165 --> 00:15:56.676
not simply because it's better bedside manner,

00:15:56.676 --> 00:15:59.758
but frankly, because it's a better standard of care.

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:02.100
Healthcare systems and payers

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.890
can start to bring in public health agencies

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.305
and departments and say,

00:16:06.305 --> 00:16:07.843
let's look at our data together.

00:16:07.843 --> 00:16:11.369
Let's see if we can discover some patterns
in our data about our patients' lives

00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:13.840
and see if we can identify an upstream cause,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.401
and then, as importantly, can we align the resources

00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:18.737
to be able to address them?

00:16:18.737 --> 00:16:20.131
Medical schools, nursing schools,

00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:22.427
all sorts of health professional education programs

00:16:22.427 --> 00:16:26.183
can help by training the
next generation of upstreamists.

00:16:26.183 --> 00:16:27.938
We can also make sure that these schools

00:16:27.938 --> 00:16:31.166
certify a backbone of the upstream approach,

00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:33.361
and that's the community health worker.

00:16:33.361 --> 00:16:34.880
We need many more of them
in the healthcare system

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.233
if we're truly going to have it be effective,

00:16:37.233 --> 00:16:38.740
to move from a sickcare system

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.238
to a healthcare system.

00:16:40.238 --> 00:16:42.286
But finally, and perhaps most importantly,

00:16:42.286 --> 00:16:44.845
what do we do? What do we do as patients?

00:16:44.845 --> 00:16:47.110
We can start by simply going to our doctors

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.819
and our nurses, to our clinics,

00:16:48.819 --> 00:16:51.151
and asking, "Is there something in where I live

00:16:51.151 --> 00:16:53.494
and where I work that I should be aware of?"

00:16:53.494 --> 00:16:56.342
Are there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of,

00:16:56.342 --> 00:16:58.300
and more importantly, if there are barriers

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.281
that I'm surfacing, if I'm coming to you

00:17:00.281 --> 00:17:02.400
and I'm saying I think have a problem with

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.503
my apartment or at my workplace

00:17:04.503 --> 00:17:06.699
or I don't have access to transportation,

00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:08.330
or there's a park that's way too far,

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.190
so sorry doctor, I can't take your advice

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.276
to go and jog,

00:17:12.276 --> 00:17:14.157
if those problems exist,

00:17:14.157 --> 00:17:17.453
then doctor, are you willing to listen?

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:18.866
And what can we do together

00:17:18.866 --> 00:17:21.436
to improve my health where it begins?

00:17:21.436 --> 00:17:23.880
If we're all able to do this work,

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.419
doctors and healthcare systems,

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:27.499
payers, and all of us together,

00:17:27.499 --> 00:17:29.693
we'll realize something about health.

00:17:29.693 --> 00:17:33.115
Health is not just a personal
responsibility or phenomenon.

00:17:33.115 --> 00:17:36.617
Health is a common good.

00:17:36.617 --> 00:17:38.535
It comes from our personal investment in knowing

00:17:38.535 --> 00:17:40.816
that our lives matter,

00:17:40.816 --> 00:17:42.944
the context of where we live and where we work,

00:17:42.944 --> 00:17:44.680
eat, and sleep, matter,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.304
and that what we do for ourselves,

00:17:46.304 --> 00:17:48.424
we also should do for those

00:17:48.424 --> 00:17:50.440
whose living and working conditions

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.058
again, can be hard, if not harsh.

00:17:53.058 --> 00:17:55.544
We can all invest in making sure that we improve

00:17:55.544 --> 00:17:57.794
the allocation of resources upstream,

00:17:57.794 --> 00:17:59.977
but at the same time work together

00:17:59.977 --> 00:18:02.710
and show that we can move healthcare

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.747
upstream.

00:18:04.747 --> 00:18:07.820
We can improve health where it begins.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.847
Thank you.

00:18:09.847 --> 00:18:12.401
(Applause)
