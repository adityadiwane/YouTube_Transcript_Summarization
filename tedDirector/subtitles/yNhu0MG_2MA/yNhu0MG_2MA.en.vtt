00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's go back to 1957.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.696
Representatives
from six European countries

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.456
had come to Rome

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.760
to sign the treaty that was
to create the European Union.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.280
Europe was destroyed.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.080
A world war had emerged from Europe.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.936
The human suffering was unbelievable

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.680
and unprecedented.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.696
Those men

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.856
wanted to create a peaceful,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.096
democratic Europe,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.280
a Europe that works for its people.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.576
And one of the many building blocks

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.856
in that peace project

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.920
was a common European market.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.216
Already back then,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.056
they saw how markets,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.416
when left to themselves,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.495
can sort of slip into being
just the private property

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:19.240
of big businesses and cartels,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.560
meeting the needs of some businesses

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.280
and not the needs of customers.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.760
So from our very first day,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.320
in 1957,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.216
the European Union had rules

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.560
to defend fair competition.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.976
And that means competition on the merits,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.216
that you compete
on the quality of your products,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.176
the prices you can offer,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.360
the services, the innovation
that you produce.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.216
That's competition on the merits.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.520
You have a fair chance
of making it on such a market.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.336
And it's my job,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.136
as Commissioner for Competition,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.856
to make sure that companies
who do business in Europe

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.920
live by those rules.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.360
But let's take a step back.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.960
Why do we need rules
on competition at all?

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.680
Why not just let businesses compete?

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.296
Isn't that also the best for us

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.616
if they compete freely,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.896
since more competition

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.096
drives more quality,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.640
lower prices, more innovation?

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.280
Well, mostly it is.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.296
But the problem is
that sometimes, for businesses,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.240
competition can be inconvenient,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.800
because competition means
that the race is never over,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.280
the game is never won.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.056
No matter how well
you were doing in the past,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.896
there's always someone

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.200
who are out there
wanting to take your place.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.536
So the temptation to avoid competition

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.760
is powerful.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.560
It's rooted in motives
as old as Adam and Eve:

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.560
in greed for yet more money,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.096
in fear of losing
your position in the market

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.760
and all the benefits it brings.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.896
And when greed and fear

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.776
are linked to power,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.360
you have a dangerous mix.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.080
We see that in political life.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.216
In part of the world,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.616
the mix of greed and fear

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.256
means that those who get power

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.720
become reluctant to give it back.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.456
One of the many things

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.216
I like and admire in our democracies

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.056
are the norms

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.256
that make our leaders hand over power

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.880
when voters tell them to.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.840
And competition rules
can do a similar thing in the market,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.760
making sure that greed and fear
doesn't overcome fairness.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.136
Because those rules mean

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.000
that companies cannot misuse their power
to undermine competition.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.640
Think for a moment about your car.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.256
It has thousands of parts,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.656
from the foam that makes the seats

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.800
to the electrical wiring
to the light bulbs.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.976
And for many of those parts,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.576
the world's carmakers,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.640
they are dependent
on only a few suppliers.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.656
So it's hardly surprising

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.736
that it is kind of tempting
for those suppliers

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.200
to come together and fix prices.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.816
But just imagine what that could do

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.760
to the final price
of your new car in the market.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.960
Except, it's not imaginary.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.576
The European Commission

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.456
has dealt with already
seven different car parts cartels,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.560
and we're still investigating some.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.496
Here, the Department of Justice

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.160
are also looking
into the market for car parts,

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.456
and it has called it
the biggest criminal investigation

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.200
it has ever pursued.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.736
But without competition rules,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.216
there would be no investigation,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.136
and there would be nothing
to stop this collusion from happening

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.800
and the prices of your car to go up.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.936
Yet it's not only companies

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.760
who can undermine fair competition.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.480
Governments can do it, too.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.896
And governments do that
when they hand out subsidies

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.480
to just the favorite few, the selected.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.296
They may do that
when they hand out subsidies --

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.560
and, of course,
all financed by taxpayers --

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.880
to companies.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.696
That may be in the form
of special tax treatments,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.136
like the tax benefits

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.056
that firms like Fiat,
Starbucks and Apple got

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.920
from some governments in Europe.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.680
Those subsidies stop companies
from competing on equal terms.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.816
They can mean that
the companies that succeed,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.440
well, they are the companies
that got the most subsidy,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.696
the ones that are the best-connected,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.856
and not, as it should be,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.480
the companies that serve
consumers the best.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.760
So there are times when we need to step in

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.920
to make sure that competition
works the way it should.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.360
By doing that, we help
the market to work fairly,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.400
because competition gives consumers
the power to demand a fair deal.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.336
It means that companies know
that if they cannot offer good prices

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.936
or the service that's expected,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.360
well, the customers
will go somewhere else.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.336
And that sort of fairness
is more important

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.520
than we may sometimes realize.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.040
Very few people think
about politics all the time.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.760
Some even skip it at election time.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.376
But we are all in the market.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.880
Every day, we are in the market.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.520
And we don't want businesses
to agree on prices in the back office.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.240
We don't want them
to divide the market between them.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.536
We don't want one big company

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.216
just to shut out competitors

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.400
from ever showing us what they can do.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.800
If that happens,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.136
well, obviously, we feel
that someone has cheated us,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.280
that we are being ignored
or taken for granted by the market.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.256
And that may undermine
not only our trust in the market

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.960
but also our trust in the society.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.616
In a recent survey,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.056
more than two-thirds of Europeans

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.760
said that they had felt
the effects of lack of competition:

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.240
that the price
for electricity was too high,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.480
that the price for the medicines
they needed was too high,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.056
that they had no real choice

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.416
if they wanted to travel
by bus or by plane,

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.240
or they got poor service
from their internet provider.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.680
In short, they found that the market
didn't treat them fairly.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.040
And that might seem
like very small things,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.560
but they can give you this sense

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.920
that the world isn't really fair.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.576
And they see the market,
which was supposed to serve everyone,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.640
become more like the private property
of a few powerful companies.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.360
The market is not the society.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.240
Our societies are, of course,
much, much more than the market.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.376
But lack of trust in the market

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.256
can rub off on society

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.160
so we lose trust in our society as well.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.600
And it may be the most important
thing we have, trust.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.120
We can trust each other
if we are treated as equals.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.496
If we are all to have the same chances,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.200
well, we all have to follow
the same fundamental rules.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.240
Of course, some people and some businesses
are more successful than others,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.976
but we do not trust in a society

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.056
if the prizes are handed out

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.800
even before the contest begins.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.680
And this is where
competition rules come in,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.656
because when we make sure
that markets work fairly,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.896
then businesses compete on the merits,

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.176
and that helps to build the trust
that we need as citizens

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.856
to feel comfortable and in control,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.480
and the trust that allows
our society to work.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.240
Because without trust,
everything becomes harder.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.880
Just to live our daily lives,
we need to trust in strangers,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.720
to trust the banks who keep our money,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.520
the builders who build our home,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.256
the electrician
who comes to fix the wiring,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.616
the doctor who treats us when we're ill,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.456
not to mention
the other drivers on the road,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.400
and everyone knows that they are crazy.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.096
And yet, we have to trust them

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.480
to do the right thing.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.160
And the thing is
that the more our societies grow,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.896
the more important trust becomes

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.216
and the harder it is to build.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.960
And that is a paradox of modern societies.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.296
And this is especially true

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.120
when technology changes
the way that we interact.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.176
Of course, to some degree,
technology can help us

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.536
to build trust in one another
with ratings systems and other systems

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.600
that enable the sharing economy.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.136
But technology also creates
completely new challenges

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.560
when they ask us
not to trust in other people

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.840
but to trust in algorithms and computers.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.776
Of course, we all see
and share and appreciate

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.776
all the good that
new technology can do us.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.160
It's a lot of good.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.376
Autonomous cars can give people
with disabilities new independence.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.816
It can save us all time,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.520
and it can make a much, much
better use of resources.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:46.176
Algorithms that rely on crunching
enormous amounts of data

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.256
can enable our doctors
to give us a much better treatment,

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.920
and many other things.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.520
But no one is going
to hand over their medical data

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.800
or step into a car
that's driven by an algorithm

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.440
unless they trust the companies
that they are dealing with.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.920
And that trust isn't always there.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.416
Today, for example,
less than a quarter of Europeans

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.080
trust online businesses
to protect their personal information.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.320
But what if people knew

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.776
that they could rely
on technology companies

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.120
to treat them fairly?

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.696
What if they knew that those companies

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.320
respond to competition
by trying to do better,

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.680
by trying to serve consumers better,

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.456
not by using their power

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.856
to shut out competitors,

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.256
say, by pushing their services

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.016
far, far down the list of search results

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.800
and promoting themselves?

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.176
What if they knew
that compliance with the rules

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.880
was built into the algorithms by design,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.976
that the algorithm had to go
to competition rules school

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.960
before they were ever allowed to work,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.856
that those algorithms were designed

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.496
in a way that meant
that they couldn't collude,

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.536
that they couldn't form
their own little cartel

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.440
in the black box they're working in?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.280
Together with regulation,

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.240
competition rules can do that.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.016
They can help us to make sure

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.520
that new technology treats people fairly

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.160
and that everyone can compete
on a level playing field.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.056
And that can help us build the trust

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.496
that we need for real innovation

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.816
to flourish

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.440
and for societies to develop for citizens.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.160
Because trust cannot be imposed.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.480
It has to be earned.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.256
Since the very first days
of the European Union,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.600
60 years ago,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.736
our competition rules have helped

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.240
to build that trust.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.720
A lot of things have changed.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.776
It's hard to say
what those six representatives

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.324
would have made of a smartphone.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.616
But in today's world,

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.256
as well as in their world,

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.400
competition makes the market
work for everyone.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.256
And that is why I am convinced

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.456
that real and fair competition

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.536
has a vital role to play

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.736
in building the trust we need

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.880
to get the best of our societies,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.976
and that starts with enforcing our rules,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.816
actually just to make
the market work for everyone.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.216
Thank you.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.680
(Applause)

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.040
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.616
Thank you, Commissioner.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.496
Margrethe Vestager: It was a pleasure.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.256
BG: I want to ask you two questions.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.016
The first one is about data,
because I have the impression

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.456
that technology and data are changing
the way competition takes place

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.136
and the way competition regulation
is designed and enforced.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.816
Can you maybe comment on that?

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.176
MV: Well, yes, it is
definitely challenging us,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.416
because we both have to sharpen our tools

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.280
but also to develop new tools.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.976
When we were going through
the Google responses

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.736
to our statement of objection,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.960
we were going through
5.2 terabytes of data.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.600
It's quite a lot.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.616
So we had to set up new systems.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.256
We had to figure out how to do this,

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.376
because you cannot work
the way you did just a few years ago.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.280
So we are definitely
sharpening up our working methods.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.016
The other thing is
that we try to distinguish

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.736
between different kinds of data,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.336
because some data is extremely valuable

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.616
and they will form, like,
a barrier to entry in a market.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.680
Other things you can just --
it loses its value tomorrow.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.096
So we try to make sure

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:25.576
that we never, ever underestimate the fact

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:29.576
that data works
as a currency in the market

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:34.640
and as an asset that can be
a real barrier for competition.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:40.096
BG: Google. You fined them
2.8 billion euros a few months ago.

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:42.776
MV: No, that was dollars.
It's not so strong these days.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.296
BG: Ah, well, depends on the --

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.336
(Laughter)

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.856
Google appealed the case.
The case is going to court.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.440
It will last a while.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.976
Earlier, last year, you asked Apple
to pay 13 billion in back taxes,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.136
and you have also
investigated other companies,

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.216
including European and Russian companies,

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.336
not only American companies, by far.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.656
Yet the investigations
against the American companies

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.096
are the ones that have attracted
the most attention

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.136
and they have also attracted
some accusations.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.296
You have been accused, essentially,
of protectionism, of jealousy,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.216
or using legislation
to hit back at American companies

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.536
that have conquered European markets.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.016
"The Economist" just this week
on the front page writes,

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.936
"Vestager Versus The Valley."

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.280
How do you react to that?

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.816
MV: Well, first of all,
I take it very seriously,

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.160
because bias has no room
in law enforcement.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.336
We have to prove our cases
with the evidence and the facts

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.376
and the jurisprudence

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.440
in order also to present it to the courts.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.696
The second thing is
that Europe is open for business,

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.456
but not for tax evasion.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.160
(Applause)

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.536
The thing is that we are changing,

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.776
and for instance,
when I ask my daughters --

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.336
they use Google as well --

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.856
"Why do you do that?"

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.856
They say, "Well, because it works.
It's a very good product."

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.336
They would never, ever,
come up with the answer,

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.080
"It's because it's a US product."

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.816
It's just because it works.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.896
And that is of course how it should be.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.336
But just the same, it is important
that someone is looking after to say,

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.696
"Well, we congratulate you

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.256
while you grow and grow and grow,

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.016
but congratulation stops

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.320
if we find that you're
misusing your position

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.216
to harm competitors
so that they cannot serve consumers."

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.336
BG: It will be
a fascinating case to follow.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.736
Thank you for coming to TED.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.496
MV: It was a pleasure. Thanks a lot.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.280
(Applause)
