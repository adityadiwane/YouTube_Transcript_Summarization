00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.520
I want you to reimagine
how life is organized on earth.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.720
Think of the planet
like a human body that we inhabit.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.816
The skeleton is the transportation system
of roads and railways,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.576
bridges and tunnels, air and seaports

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.816
that enable our mobility
across the continents.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.096
The vascular system that powers the body

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.896
are the oil and gas pipelines
and electricity grids.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.120
that distribute energy.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.696
And the nervous system of communications

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.416
is the Internet cables,
satellites, cellular networks

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.600
and data centers that allow
us to share information.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.856
This ever-expanding infrastructural matrix

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.896
already consists of 64 million
kilometers of roads,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.736
four million kilometers of railways,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.696
two million kilometers of pipelines

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.280
and one million kilometers
of Internet cables.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.720
What about international borders?

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.520
We have less than
500,000 kilometers of borders.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.880
Let's build a better map of the world.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.160
And we can start by overcoming
some ancient mythology.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.160
There's a saying with which
all students of history are familiar:

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.936
"Geography is destiny."

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.440
Sounds so grave, doesn't it?

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.800
It's such a fatalistic adage.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.656
It tells us that landlocked countries
are condemned to be poor,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.896
that small countries
cannot escape their larger neighbors,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.840
that vast distances are insurmountable.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.456
But every journey I take around the world,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.920
I see an even greater force
sweeping the planet:

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.160
connectivity.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.816
The global connectivity revolution,
in all of its forms --

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.536
transportation, energy
and communications --

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.816
has enabled such a quantum leap
in the mobility of people,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.576
of goods, of resources, of knowledge,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.160
such that we can no longer even think
of geography as distinct from it.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.936
In fact, I view the two forces
as fusing together

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.040
into what I call "connectography."

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.216
Connectography represents a quantum leap

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.656
in the mobility of people,
resources and ideas,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.480
but it is an evolution,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.456
an evolution of the world
from political geography,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.280
which is how we legally divide the world,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.216
to functional geography,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.816
which is how we actually use the world,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.960
from nations and borders,
to infrastructure and supply chains.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.160
Our global system is evolving

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.896
from the vertically integrated
empires of the 19th century,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.176
through the horizontally interdependent
nations of the 20th century,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.440
into a global network civilization
in the 21st century.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.576
Connectivity, not sovereignty,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.816
has become the organizing principle
of the human species.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.240
(Applause)

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.696
We are becoming
this global network civilization

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.496
because we are literally building it.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.216
All of the world's defense budgets
and military spending taken together

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.336
total just under
two trillion dollars per year.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.736
Meanwhile, our global
infrastructure spending

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.136
is projected to rise
to nine trillion dollars per year

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.696
within the coming decade.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.336
And, well, it should.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.096
We have been living
off an infrastructure stock

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.720
meant for a world population
of three billion,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.736
as our population has crossed
seven billion to eight billion

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.600
and eventually nine billion and more.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.976
As a rule of thumb, we should spend
about one trillion dollars

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.240
on the basic infrastructure needs
of every billion people in the world.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.400
Not surprisingly, Asia is in the lead.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.936
In 2015, China announced the creation

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.000
of the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.056
which together with a network
of other organizations

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.495
aims to construct a network
of iron and silk roads,

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:30.720
stretching from Shanghai to Lisbon.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.816
And as all of this topographical
engineering unfolds,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.296
we will likely spend more
on infrastructure in the next 40 years,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.656
we will build more infrastructure
in the next 40 years,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.440
than we have in the past 4,000 years.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.960
Now let's stop and think
about it for a minute.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.336
Spending so much more on building
the foundations of global society

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.176
rather than on the tools to destroy it

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.776
can have profound consequences.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.856
Connectivity is how
we optimize the distribution

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.456
of people and resources around the world.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.600
It is how mankind comes to be more
than just the sum of its parts.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.440
I believe that is what is happening.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.936
Connectivity has a twin megatrend
in the 21st century:

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.040
planetary urbanization.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.280
Cities are the infrastructures
that most define us.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.056
By 2030, more than two thirds
of the world's population

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.336
will live in cities.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.096
And these are not
mere little dots on the map,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.720
but they are vast archipelagos
stretching hundreds of kilometers.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.936
Here we are in Vancouver,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.816
at the head of the Cascadia Corridor

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.680
that stretches south
across the US border to Seattle.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.936
The technology powerhouse
of Silicon Valley

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.816
begins north of San Francisco
down to San Jose

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.616
and across the bay to Oakland.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.616
The sprawl of Los Angeles
now passes San Diego

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.896
across the Mexican border to Tijuana.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.896
San Diego and Tijuana
now share an airport terminal

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.136
where you can exit into either country.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.400
Eventually, a high-speed rail network
may connect the entire Pacific spine.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.816
America's northeastern megalopolis
begins in Boston through New York

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.616
and Philadelphia to Washington.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.816
It contains more than 50 million people

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.616
and also has plans
for a high-speed rail network.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.560
But Asia is where we really see
the megacities coming together.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.536
This continuous strip of light
from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.736
contains more than 80 million people

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.440
and most of Japan's economy.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.520
It is the world's largest megacity.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.360
For now.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.336
But in China, megacity clusters
are coming together

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.256
with populations
reaching 100 million people.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.176
The Bohai Rim around Beijing,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.456
The Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.376
and the Pearl River Delta,

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.736
stretching from Hong Kong
north to Guangzhou.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.096
And in the middle,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.016
the Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.816
whose geographic footprint
is almost the same size

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.480
as the country of Austria.

00:07:03.263 --> 00:07:05.216
And any number of these megacity clusters

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.296
has a GDP approaching
two trillion dollars --

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.000
that's almost the same
as all of India today.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.216
So imagine if our global diplomatic
institutions, such as the G20,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.776
were to base their membership
on economic size

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.800
rather than national representation.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.896
Some Chinese megacities
may be in and have a seat at the table,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.040
while entire countries,
like Argentina or Indonesia would be out.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.776
Moving to India, whose population
will soon exceed that of China,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.096
it too has a number of megacity clusters,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.536
such as the Delhi Capital Region

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.016
and Mumbai.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.256
In the Middle East,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.416
Greater Tehran is absorbing
one third of Iran's population.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.296
Most of Egypt's 80 million people

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.336
live in the corridor
between Cairo and Alexandria.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.376
And in the gulf, a necklace
of city-states is forming,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.856
from Bahrain and Qatar,

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.640
through the United Arab Emirates
to Muscat in Oman.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.000
And then there's Lagos,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.656
Africa's largest city
and Nigeria's commercial hub.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.736
It has plans for a rail network

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.176
that will make it the anchor
of a vast Atlantic coastal corridor,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.256
stretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana,

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.736
to Abidjan, the capital
of the Ivory Coast.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.320
But these countries are suburbs of Lagos.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.856
In a megacity world,

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.640
countries can be suburbs of cities.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.760
By 2030, we will have as many
as 50 such megacity clusters in the world.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.256
So which map tells you more?

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.416
Our traditional map
of 200 discrete nations

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.336
that hang on most of our walls,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.360
or this map of the 50 megacity clusters?

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:50.895
And yet, even this is incomplete

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:54.936
because you cannot understand
any individual megacity

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.120
without understanding
its connections to the others.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.256
People move to cities to be connected,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.480
and connectivity
is why these cities thrive.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.976
Any number of them,
such as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.096
has a GDP approaching or exceeding
one third of one half

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.280
of their entire national GDP.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.896
But equally importantly,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.776
you cannot calculate
any of their individual value

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.456
without understanding
the role of the flows of people,

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.176
of finance, of technology

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.880
that enable them to thrive.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.376
Take the Gauteng province of South Africa,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.536
which contains Johannesburg
and the capital Pretoria.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.496
It too represents just over
a third of South Africa's GDP.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.776
But equally importantly,
it is home to the offices

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.776
of almost every single
multinational corporation

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.016
that invests directly into South Africa

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.520
and indeed, into the entire
African continent.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.376
Cities want to be part
of global value chains.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.976
They want to be part
of this global division of labor.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.840
That is how cities think.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.456
I've never met a mayor who said to me,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.040
"I want my city to be cut off."

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.896
They know that their cities belong as much

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.240
to the global network civilization
as to their home countries.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.320
Now, for many people,
urbanization causes great dismay.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.120
They think cities are wrecking the planet.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.176
But right now,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.456
there are more than 200
intercity learning networks thriving.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.816
That is as many as the number
of intergovernmental organizations

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.056
that we have.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.456
And all of these intercity networks
are devoted to one purpose,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.176
mankind's number one priority
in the 21st century:

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.280
sustainable urbanization.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.880
Is it working?

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.296
Let's take climate change.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.056
We know that summit after summit
in New York and Paris

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.880
is not going to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.856
But what we can see
is that transferring technology

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.496
and knowledge and policies between cities

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.136
is how we've actually begun to reduce
the carbon intensity of our economies.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.296
Cities are learning from each other.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.776
How to install zero-emissions buildings,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.936
how to deploy electric
car-sharing systems.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.176
In major Chinese cities,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.256
they're imposing quotas
on the number of cars on the streets.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.536
In many Western cities,

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.880
young people don't even
want to drive anymore.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.936
Cities have been part of the problem,

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.960
now they are part of the solution.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.480
Inequality is the other great challenge
to achieving sustainable urbanization.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.376
When I travel through megacities
from end to end --

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.496
it takes hours and days --

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.256
I experience the tragedy
of extreme disparity

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.200
within the same geography.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.096
And yet, our global stock
of financial assets

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.576
has never been larger,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.096
approaching 300 trillion dollars.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.520
That's almost four times
the actual GDP of the world.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.976
We have taken on such enormous debts
since the financial crisis,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.160
but have we invested them
in inclusive growth?

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.960
No, not yet.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.616
Only when we build sufficient,
affordable public housing,

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.776
when we invest in robust
transportation networks

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.336
to allow people to connect to each other
both physically and digitally,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.736
that's when our divided
cities and societies

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.616
will come to feel whole again.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.480
(Applause)

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.736
And that is why infrastructure
has just been included

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.216
in the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.560
because it enables all the others.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.896
Our political and economic leaders

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.016
are learning that connectivity
is not charity,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.240
it's opportunity.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.816
And that's why our financial community
needs to understand

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.840
that connectivity is the most
important asset class of the 21st century.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.960
Now, cities can make the world
more sustainable,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.856
they can make the world more equitable,

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.736
I also believe that
connectivity between cities

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.520
can make the world more peaceful.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.416
If we look at regions of the world
with dense relations across borders,

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.216
we see more trade, more investment

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.656
and more stability.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.176
We all know the story
of Europe after World War II,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.776
where industrial integration
kicked off a process

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.360
that gave rise to today's
peaceful European Union.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.616
And you can see that Russia, by the way,

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.640
is the least connected of major powers
in the international system.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.016
And that goes a long way
towards explaining the tensions today.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.936
Countries that have
less stake in the system

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.320
also have less to lose in disturbing it.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.616
In North America, the lines
that matter most on the map

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.416
are not the US-Canada border
or the US-Mexico border,

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.816
but the dense network of roads
and railways and pipelines

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.696
and electricity grids
and even water canals

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.536
that are forming an integrated
North American union.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.256
North America does not need more walls,
it needs more connections.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.920
(Applause)

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.216
But the real promise of connectivity
is in the postcolonial world.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.576
All of those regions where borders
have historically been the most arbitrary

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.536
and where generations of leaders

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.176
have had hostile relations
with each other.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.576
But now a new group of leaders
has come into power

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.160
and is burying the hatchet.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.936
Let's take Southeast Asia,
where high-speed rail networks

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.256
are planned to connect
Bangkok to Singapore

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.176
and trade corridors
from Vietnam to Myanmar.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.736
Now this region of 600 million people
coordinates its agricultural resources

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.160
and its industrial output.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.376
It is evolving
into what I call a Pax Asiana,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.240
a peace among Southeast Asian nations.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.176
A similar phenomenon
is underway in East Africa,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.576
where a half dozen countries

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.896
are investing in railways
and multimodal corridors

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.056
so that landlocked countries
can get their goods to market.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.656
Now these countries
coordinate their utilities

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.776
and their investment policies.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.600
They, too, are evolving
into a Pax Africana.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.096
One region we know could
especially use this kind of thinking

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.400
is the Middle East.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.456
As Arab states tragically collapse,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.216
what is left behind
but the ancient cities,

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.720
such as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad?

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.136
In fact, the nearly
400 million people of the Arab world

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.256
are almost entirely urbanized.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.176
As societies, as cities,

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.456
they are either water rich or water poor,

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.240
energy rich or energy poor.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.936
And the only way
to correct these mismatches

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.576
is not through more wars and more borders,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.440
but through more connectivity
of pipelines and water canals.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.976
Sadly, this is not yet
the map of the Middle East.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.200
But it should be,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.800
a connected Pax Arabia,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.336
internally integrated

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.656
and productively connected
to its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.776
Now, it may not seem like connectivity
is what we want right now

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.840
towards the world's most turbulent region.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.216
But we know from history
that more connectivity is the only way

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.736
to bring about stability in the long run.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.456
Because we know
that in region after region,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.416
connectivity is the new reality.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.576
Cities and countries
are learning to aggregate

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.080
into more peaceful and prosperous wholes.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.080
But the real test is going to be Asia.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.976
Can connectivity overcome
the patterns of rivalry

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.576
among the great powers of the Far East?

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.960
After all, this is where World War III
is supposed to break out.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.056
Since the end of the Cold War,
a quarter century ago,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.456
at least six major wars
have been predicted for this region.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.080
But none have broken out.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.720
Take China and Taiwan.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.176
In the 1990s, this was everyone's
leading World War III scenario.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.696
But since that time,

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.216
the trade and investment volumes
across the straits have become so intense

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.456
that last November,

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.336
leaders from both sides
held a historic summit

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.200
to discuss eventual
peaceful reunification.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.776
And even the election
of a nationalist party in Taiwan

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.576
that's pro-independence earlier this year

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.079
does not undermine
this fundamental dynamic.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.256
China and Japan have
an even longer history of rivalry

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.695
and have been deploying
their air forces and navies

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.880
to show their strength in island disputes.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.736
But in recent years,

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.896
Japan has been making
its largest foreign investments in China.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.640
Japanese cars are selling
in record numbers there.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.376
And guess where
the largest number of foreigners

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.520
residing in Japan today comes from?

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.920
You guessed it: China.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.416
China and India have fought a major war

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.496
and have three outstanding
border disputes,

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.976
but today India is the second
largest shareholder

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.416
in the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.696
They're building a trade corridor
stretching from Northeast India

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.640
through Myanmar and Bangladesh
to Southern China.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.176
Their trade volume has grown
from 20 billion dollars a decade ago

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.800
to 80 billion dollars today.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.616
Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan
have fought three wars

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.856
and continue to dispute Kashmir,

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.416
but they're also negotiating
a most-favored-nation trade agreement

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.176
and want to complete a pipeline

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.176
stretching from Iran
through Pakistan to India.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.760
And let's talk about Iran.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.080
Wasn't it just two years ago
that war with Iran seemed inevitable?

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.480
Then why is every single major power
rushing to do business there today?

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.816
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.840
I cannot guarantee
that World War III will not break out.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.640
But we can definitely see
why it hasn't happened yet.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.376
Even though Asia is home
to the world's fastest growing militaries,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.976
these same countries
are also investing billions of dollars

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.936
in each other's infrastructure
and supply chains.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.776
They are more interested
in each other's functional geography

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.256
than in their political geography.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.336
And that is why their leaders think twice,
step back from the brink,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.920
and decide to focus on economic ties
over territorial tensions.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.040
So often it seems
like the world is falling apart,

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.696
but building more connectivity

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.840
is how we put Humpty Dumpty
back together again,

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.240
much better than before.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.216
And by wrapping the world

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.696
in such seamless physical
and digital connectivity,

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.896
we evolve towards a world

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.440
in which people can rise
above their geographic constraints.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.096
We are the cells and vessels

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.336
pulsing through these global
connectivity networks.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.016
Everyday, hundreds of millions
of people go online

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.656
and work with people they've never met.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.176
More than one billion people
cross borders every year,

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.120
and that's expected to rise
to three billion in the coming decade.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.696
We don't just build connectivity,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.040
we embody it.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.296
We are the global network civilization,

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.200
and this is our map.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.640
A map of the world in which
geography is no longer destiny.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.600
Instead, the future
has a new and more hopeful motto:

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.360
connectivity is destiny.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.256
Thank you.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.509
(Applause)
