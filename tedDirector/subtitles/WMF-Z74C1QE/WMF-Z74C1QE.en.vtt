00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:19.228
As it turns out, when tens of millions
of people are unemployed

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:20.786
or underemployed,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.976
there's a fair amount of interest
in what technology might be doing

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.162
to the labor force.

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:27.075
And as I look at the conversation,

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.779
it strikes me that it's focused
on exactly the right topic,

00:00:30.803 --> 00:00:33.628
and at the same time,
it's missing the point entirely.

00:00:33.652 --> 00:00:35.193
The topic that it's focused on,

00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:39.700
the question is whether or not all these
digital technologies are affecting

00:00:39.724 --> 00:00:41.741
people's ability to earn a living,

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:43.750
or, to say it a little bit different way,

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:45.863
are the droids taking our jobs?

00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:47.824
And there's some evidence that they are.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:51.893
The Great Recession ended
when American GDP resumed

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:54.784
its kind of slow, steady march upward,

00:00:54.808 --> 00:00:58.078
and some other economic indicators
also started to rebound,

00:00:58.102 --> 00:01:00.395
and they got kind of healthy
kind of quickly.

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:02.586
Corporate profits are quite high;

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.506
in fact, if you include bank profits,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.521
they're higher than they've ever been.

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:10.032
And business investment
in gear -- in equipment

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:12.900
and hardware and software --
is at an all-time high.

00:01:12.924 --> 00:01:16.239
So the businesses are getting
out their checkbooks.

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:18.262
What they're not really doing is hiring.

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:19.812
So this red line

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:22.374
is the employment-to-population ratio,

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:26.527
in other words, the percentage
of working-age people in America

00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:27.937
who have work.

00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:31.067
And we see that it cratered
during the Great Recession,

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.988
and it hasn't started
to bounce back at all.

00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:36.931
But the story is not
just a recession story.

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:39.035
The decade that we've
just been through had

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:42.272
relatively anemic job growth
all throughout,

00:01:42.296 --> 00:01:44.919
especially when we compare it
to other decades,

00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:47.973
and the 2000s are the only time
we have on record

00:01:47.997 --> 00:01:51.529
where there were fewer people working
at the end of the decade

00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:52.955
than at the beginning.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.652
This is not what you want to see.

00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:58.367
When you graph the number
of potential employees

00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:00.947
versus the number of jobs in the country,

00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:04.821
you see the gap gets bigger
and bigger over time,

00:02:04.845 --> 00:02:08.155
and then, during the Great Recession,
it opened up in a huge way.

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.639
I did some quick calculations.

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:12.095
I took the last 20 years of GDP growth

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.391
and the last 20 years
of labor-productivity growth

00:02:15.415 --> 00:02:18.133
and used those in a fairly
straightforward way

00:02:18.157 --> 00:02:21.180
to try to project how many jobs
the economy was going to need

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:22.507
to keep growing,

00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:24.656
and this is the line that I came up with.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.422
Is that good or bad?

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.357
This is the government's projection

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.717
for the working-age
population going forward.

00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:36.839
So if these predictions are accurate,
that gap is not going to close.

00:02:36.863 --> 00:02:39.889
The problem is, I don't think
these projections are accurate.

00:02:39.913 --> 00:02:43.392
In particular, I think my projection
is way too optimistic,

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:44.863
because when I did it,

00:02:44.887 --> 00:02:49.105
I was assuming that the future
was kind of going to look like the past,

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.798
with labor productivity growth,

00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:52.693
and that's actually not what I believe.

00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:54.066
Because when I look around,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.310
I think that we ain't seen nothing yet

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:59.570
when it comes to technology's
impact on the labor force.

00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:03.933
Just in the past couple years,
we've seen digital tools

00:03:03.957 --> 00:03:08.190
display skills and abilities
that they never, ever had before,

00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:11.724
and that kind of eat deeply
into what we human beings

00:03:11.748 --> 00:03:13.030
do for a living.

00:03:13.054 --> 00:03:14.980
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:16.256
Throughout all of history,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.830
if you wanted something translated
from one language into another,

00:03:19.854 --> 00:03:21.579
you had to involve a human being.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.058
Now we have multi-language, instantaneous,

00:03:25.082 --> 00:03:29.502
automatic translation services
available for free

00:03:29.526 --> 00:03:32.669
via many of our devices,
all the way down to smartphones.

00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:34.489
And if any of us have used these,

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:38.028
we know that they're not perfect,
but they're decent.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.512
Throughout all of history,
if you wanted something written,

00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:44.873
a report or an article,
you had to involve a person.

00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:46.571
Not anymore.

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:49.568
This is an article that appeared
in Forbes online a while back,

00:03:49.592 --> 00:03:50.768
about Apple's earnings.

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:52.410
It was written by an algorithm.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.837
And it's not decent -- it's perfect.

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.038
A lot of people look at this and they say,

00:03:59.062 --> 00:04:01.367
"OK, but those are very
specific, narrow tasks,

00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:04.302
and most knowledge workers
are actually generalists.

00:04:04.326 --> 00:04:08.518
And what they do is sit on top of a very
large body of expertise and knowledge

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:12.339
and they use that to react on the fly
to kind of unpredictable demands,

00:04:12.363 --> 00:04:14.483
and that's very, very hard to automate."

00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:17.968
One of the most impressive
knowledge workers in recent memory

00:04:17.992 --> 00:04:19.513
is a guy named Ken Jennings.

00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:24.271
He won the quiz show
"Jeopardy!" 74 times in a row.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.060
Took home three million dollars.

00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:30.855
That's Ken on the right,
getting beat three-to-one

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:35.256
by Watson, the Jeopardy-playing
supercomputer from IBM.

00:04:35.902 --> 00:04:39.417
So when we look at what technology can do
to general knowledge workers,

00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:42.519
I start to think there might not be
something so special

00:04:42.543 --> 00:04:44.311
about this idea of a generalist,

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:48.665
particularly when we start doing things
like hooking Siri up to Watson,

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.958
and having technologies
that can understand what we're saying

00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:53.966
and repeat speech back to us.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.893
Now, Siri is far from perfect,
and we can make fun of her flaws,

00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:59.416
but we should also keep in mind

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.804
that if technologies like Siri and Watson
improve along a Moore's law trajectory,

00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:06.350
which they will,

00:05:06.374 --> 00:05:09.964
in six years, they're not going to be two
times better or four times better,

00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:13.458
they'll be 16 times better
than they are right now.

00:05:13.482 --> 00:05:17.328
So I start to think a lot of knowledge
work is going to be affected by this.

00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:21.088
And digital technologies are not
just impacting knowledge work,

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:24.851
they're starting to flex their muscles
in the physical world as well.

00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:28.600
I had the chance a little while back
to ride in the Google autonomous car,

00:05:28.624 --> 00:05:30.901
which is as cool as it sounds.

00:05:30.925 --> 00:05:33.113
(Laughter)

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:37.558
And I will vouch that it handled
the stop-and-go traffic on US 101

00:05:37.582 --> 00:05:38.835
very smoothly.

00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:42.510
There are about three and a half million
people who drive trucks for a living

00:05:42.534 --> 00:05:43.685
in the United States;

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:46.777
I think some of them are going
to be affected by this technology.

00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:49.901
And right now, humanoid robots
are still incredibly primitive.

00:05:49.925 --> 00:05:51.882
They can't do very much.

00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:53.878
But they're getting better quite quickly

00:05:53.902 --> 00:05:57.439
and DARPA, which is the investment arm
of the Defense Department,

00:05:57.463 --> 00:05:59.440
is trying to accelerate their trajectory.

00:05:59.464 --> 00:06:03.906
So, in short, yeah, the droids
are coming for our jobs.

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:07.997
In the short term, we can
stimulate job growth

00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:10.158
by encouraging entrepreneurship

00:06:10.182 --> 00:06:12.096
and by investing in infrastructure,

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.658
because the robots today
still aren't very good at fixing bridges.

00:06:15.682 --> 00:06:17.580
But in the not-too-long-term,

00:06:17.604 --> 00:06:21.506
I think within the lifetimes
of most of the people in this room,

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.078
we're going to transition into an economy
that is very productive,

00:06:25.102 --> 00:06:27.996
but that just doesn't need
a lot of human workers.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.132
And managing that transition
is going to be the greatest challenge

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:32.694
that our society faces.

00:06:32.718 --> 00:06:34.668
Voltaire summarized why; he said,

00:06:34.692 --> 00:06:39.871
"Work saves us from three great evils:
boredom, vice and need."

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.487
But despite this challenge --

00:06:42.511 --> 00:06:45.423
personally, I'm still
a huge digital optimist,

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.651
and I am supremely confident

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:50.263
that the digital technologies
that we're developing now

00:06:50.287 --> 00:06:52.937
are going to take us
into a Utopian future,

00:06:52.961 --> 00:06:54.673
not a dystopian future.

00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:55.848
And to explain why,

00:06:55.872 --> 00:06:58.451
I want to pose a ridiculously
broad question.

00:06:58.475 --> 00:06:59.626
I want to ask:

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.996
what have been the most important
developments in human history?

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.981
Now, I want to share some
of the answers that I've gotten

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:07.402
in response to this question.

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:10.594
It's a wonderful question to ask
and start an endless debate about,

00:07:10.618 --> 00:07:12.592
because some people are going to bring up

00:07:12.616 --> 00:07:15.916
systems of philosophy
in both the West and the East

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.163
that have changed how a lot
of people think about the world.

00:07:19.187 --> 00:07:20.680
And then other people will say,

00:07:20.704 --> 00:07:23.165
"No, actually, the big stories,
the big developments

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:25.772
are the founding
of the world's major religions,

00:07:25.796 --> 00:07:29.022
which have changed civilizations
and have changed and influenced

00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:31.640
how countless people
are living their lives."

00:07:31.664 --> 00:07:33.361
And then some other folk will say,

00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:35.775
"Actually, what changes civilizations,

00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:40.584
what modifies them and what changes
people's lives are empires,

00:07:40.608 --> 00:07:43.013
so the great developments in human history

00:07:43.037 --> 00:07:45.799
are stories of conquest and of war."

00:07:45.823 --> 00:07:48.604
And then some cheery soul
usually always pipes up and says,

00:07:48.628 --> 00:07:50.310
"Hey, don't forget about plagues!"

00:07:50.334 --> 00:07:54.243
(Laughter)

00:07:54.267 --> 00:07:56.790
There are some optimistic
answers to this question,

00:07:56.814 --> 00:07:59.228
so some people will bring up
the Age of Exploration

00:07:59.252 --> 00:08:00.797
and the opening up of the world.

00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:04.599
Others will talk about intellectual
achievements in disciplines like math

00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:07.117
that have helped us get
a better handle on the world,

00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:10.581
and other folk will talk about periods
when there was a deep flourishing

00:08:10.605 --> 00:08:12.210
of the arts and sciences.

00:08:12.234 --> 00:08:13.821
So this debate will go on and on.

00:08:13.845 --> 00:08:15.306
It's an endless debate

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.563
and there's no conclusive,
single answer to it.

00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:20.104
But if you're a geek like me,

00:08:20.128 --> 00:08:22.809
you say, "Well, what do the data say?"

00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:24.165
And you start to do things

00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:26.873
like graph things
that we might be interested in --

00:08:26.897 --> 00:08:29.976
the total worldwide
population, for example,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.365
or some measure of social development

00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:34.877
or the state of advancement of a society.

00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:39.024
And you start to plot the data,
because, by this approach,

00:08:39.048 --> 00:08:41.653
the big stories, the big
developments in human history,

00:08:41.677 --> 00:08:44.187
are the ones that will bend
these curves a lot.

00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.431
So when you do this
and when you plot the data,

00:08:46.455 --> 00:08:49.147
you pretty quickly come
to some weird conclusions.

00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:50.567
You conclude, actually,

00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:53.154
that none of these things
have mattered very much.

00:08:53.178 --> 00:08:56.772
(Laughter)

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.593
They haven't done
a darn thing to the curves.

00:09:00.617 --> 00:09:05.307
There has been one story,
one development in human history

00:09:05.331 --> 00:09:08.540
that bent the curve,
bent it just about 90 degrees,

00:09:08.564 --> 00:09:10.699
and it is a technology story.

00:09:11.223 --> 00:09:13.993
The steam engine and the other
associated technologies

00:09:14.017 --> 00:09:16.048
of the Industrial Revolution

00:09:16.072 --> 00:09:19.348
changed the world and influenced
human history so much,

00:09:19.372 --> 00:09:21.774
that in the words
of the historian Ian Morris,

00:09:21.798 --> 00:09:25.589
"... they made mockery out of all
that had come before."

00:09:25.613 --> 00:09:29.140
And they did this by infinitely
multiplying the power of our muscles,

00:09:29.164 --> 00:09:31.558
overcoming the limitations of our muscles.

00:09:31.582 --> 00:09:34.080
Now, what we're in the middle of now

00:09:34.104 --> 00:09:37.137
is overcoming the limitations
of our individual brains

00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:40.072
and infinitely multiplying
our mental power.

00:09:40.096 --> 00:09:43.273
How can this not be as big a deal

00:09:43.297 --> 00:09:46.001
as overcoming the limitations
of our muscles?

00:09:46.025 --> 00:09:48.885
So at the risk of repeating
myself a little bit,

00:09:48.909 --> 00:09:52.662
when I look at what's going on
with digital technology these days,

00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:55.796
we are not anywhere near
through with this journey.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.326
And when I look at what is happening
to our economies and our societies,

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.439
my single conclusion is that
we ain't seen nothing yet.

00:10:02.463 --> 00:10:04.189
The best days are really ahead.

00:10:04.213 --> 00:10:06.214
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:08.611
Economies don't run on energy.

00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:11.674
They don't run on capital,
they don't run on labor.

00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:14.103
Economies run on ideas.

00:10:14.127 --> 00:10:17.468
So the work of innovation,
the work of coming up with new ideas,

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:21.190
is some of the most powerful, most
fundamental work that we can do

00:10:21.214 --> 00:10:22.365
in an economy.

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:25.507
And this is kind of how
we used to do innovation.

00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:28.507
We'd find a bunch of fairly
similar-looking people ...

00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:32.027
(Laughter)

00:10:32.051 --> 00:10:34.044
We'd take them out of elite institutions,

00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:36.147
we'd put them into other
elite institutions

00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:37.757
and we'd wait for the innovation.

00:10:37.781 --> 00:10:38.950
Now --

00:10:38.974 --> 00:10:41.403
(Laughter)

00:10:41.427 --> 00:10:44.915
as a white guy who spent
his whole career at MIT and Harvard,

00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:46.965
I've got no problem with this.

00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:49.294
(Laughter)

00:10:50.605 --> 00:10:51.812
But some other people do,

00:10:51.836 --> 00:10:53.621
and they've kind of crashed the party

00:10:53.645 --> 00:10:55.790
and loosened up
the dress code of innovation.

00:10:55.814 --> 00:10:56.846
(Laughter)

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.070
So here are the winners of a Topcoder
programming challenge,

00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:02.786
and I assure you that nobody cares

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.566
where these kids grew up,
where they went to school,

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.090
or what they look like.

00:11:08.114 --> 00:11:11.957
All anyone cares about is the quality
of the work, the quality of the ideas.

00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:14.217
And over and over again,
we see this happening

00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:16.765
in the technology-facilitated world.

00:11:16.789 --> 00:11:19.286
The work of innovation
is becoming more open,

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.959
more inclusive, more transparent
and more merit-based,

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:26.681
and that's going to continue no matter
what MIT and Harvard think of it,

00:11:26.705 --> 00:11:29.270
and I couldn't be happier
about that development.

00:11:29.609 --> 00:11:32.064
I hear once in a while,
"OK, I'll grant you that,

00:11:32.088 --> 00:11:35.107
but technology is still a tool
for the rich world,

00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:36.530
and what's not happening,

00:11:36.554 --> 00:11:39.165
these digital tools are not
improving the lives

00:11:39.189 --> 00:11:41.338
of people at the bottom of the pyramid."

00:11:41.362 --> 00:11:44.028
And I want to say to that
very clearly: nonsense.

00:11:44.052 --> 00:11:47.545
The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting
hugely from technology.

00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:51.129
The economist Robert Jensen
did this wonderful study a while back

00:11:51.153 --> 00:11:53.086
where he watched, in great detail,

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.728
what happened to the fishing
villages of Kerala, India,

00:11:56.752 --> 00:11:59.633
when they got mobile phones
for the very first time.

00:11:59.657 --> 00:12:02.466
And when you write for the Quarterly
Journal of Economics,

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.372
you have to use very dry
and very circumspect language.

00:12:05.396 --> 00:12:06.658
But when I read his paper,

00:12:06.682 --> 00:12:08.889
I kind of feel Jensen
is trying to scream at us

00:12:08.913 --> 00:12:11.237
and say, "Look, this was a big deal.

00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:14.912
Prices stabilized, so people
could plan their economic lives.

00:12:14.936 --> 00:12:18.610
Waste was not reduced --
it was eliminated.

00:12:19.007 --> 00:12:21.248
And the lives of both
the buyers and the sellers

00:12:21.272 --> 00:12:23.746
in these villages measurably improved."

00:12:24.073 --> 00:12:27.863
Now, what I don't think
is that Jensen got extremely lucky

00:12:27.887 --> 00:12:30.098
and happened to land
in the one set of villages

00:12:30.122 --> 00:12:32.431
where technology made things better.

00:12:32.455 --> 00:12:35.102
What happened instead
is he very carefully documented

00:12:35.126 --> 00:12:39.205
what happens over and over again
when technology comes for the first time

00:12:39.229 --> 00:12:41.166
to an environment and a community:

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:45.027
the lives of people, the welfares
of people, improve dramatically.

00:12:45.051 --> 00:12:46.932
So as I look around at all the evidence

00:12:46.956 --> 00:12:49.393
and I think about the room
that we have ahead of us,

00:12:49.417 --> 00:12:51.245
I become a huge digital optimist

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:55.845
and I start to think that this wonderful
statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson

00:12:55.869 --> 00:12:57.607
is actually not hyperbole.

00:12:57.631 --> 00:13:00.140
This is an accurate assessment
of what's going on.

00:13:00.164 --> 00:13:02.862
Our technologies are great gifts,

00:13:02.886 --> 00:13:05.933
and we, right now,
have the great good fortune

00:13:05.957 --> 00:13:09.687
to be living at a time when
digital technology is flourishing,

00:13:09.711 --> 00:13:13.106
when it is broadening and deepening
and becoming more profound

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.408
all around the world.

00:13:14.432 --> 00:13:17.707
So, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs,

00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:21.302
but focusing on that fact
misses the point entirely.

00:13:21.326 --> 00:13:24.826
The point is that then we
are freed up to do other things,

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.137
and what we're going to do,
I am very confident,

00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:29.677
what we're going to do is reduce poverty

00:13:29.701 --> 00:13:32.170
and drudgery and misery around the world.

00:13:32.194 --> 00:13:36.199
I'm very confident we're going to learn
to live more lightly on the planet,

00:13:36.223 --> 00:13:39.648
and I am extremely confident
that what we're going to do

00:13:39.672 --> 00:13:41.047
with our new digital tools

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:44.063
is going to be so profound
and so beneficial

00:13:44.087 --> 00:13:47.571
that it's going to make a mockery
out of everything that came before.

00:13:47.595 --> 00:13:49.151
I'm going to leave the last word

00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:51.829
to a guy who had a front-row seat
for digital progress,

00:13:51.853 --> 00:13:53.425
our old friend Ken Jennings.

00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:55.692
I'm with him; I'm going to echo his words:

00:13:55.716 --> 00:13:58.632
"I, for one, welcome our new
computer overlords."

00:13:58.656 --> 00:13:59.737
(Laughter)

00:13:59.761 --> 00:14:01.245
Thanks very much.

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:02.427
(Applause)
