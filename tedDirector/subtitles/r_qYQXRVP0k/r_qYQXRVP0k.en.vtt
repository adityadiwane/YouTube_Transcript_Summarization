00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:15.157
So I'd like you to come back with me

00:00:15.157 --> 00:00:17.058
just for a few minutes

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:19.927
to a dark night in China,

00:00:19.927 --> 00:00:22.648
the night I met my husband.

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:26.091
It was a city so long ago that it was still called

00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:28.204
Peking.

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:30.825
So I went to a party.

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:34.208
I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:37.722
with owl glasses and a bow tie,

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:40.615
and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar,

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:44.179
there in China specifically to study

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.270
Sino-Soviet relations.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.670
What a gift it was to the eager,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.428
young foreign correspondent that I was then.

00:00:51.428 --> 00:00:53.436
I'd pump him for information,

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:55.093
I'm mentally scribbling notes

00:00:55.093 --> 00:00:57.402
for the stories I plan to write.

00:00:57.402 --> 00:00:59.887
I talk to him for hours.

00:00:59.887 --> 00:01:03.398
Only months later,

00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:05.772
I discover who he really was.

00:01:05.772 --> 00:01:08.545
He was the China representative

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:12.774
for the American Soybean Association.

00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:16.044
"I don't understand. Soybeans?

00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:18.799
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar."

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.687
"Well, how long would you have talked to me

00:01:20.687 --> 00:01:22.729
if I told you we're in soybeans?"

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.210
(Laughter)

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.502
I said, "You jerk."

00:01:28.502 --> 00:01:32.255
Only jerk wasn't the word I used.

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:36.402
I said, "You could've gotten me fired."

00:01:36.402 --> 00:01:39.939
And he said, "Let's get married."

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.226
(Laughter)

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:44.122
"Travel the world and have lots of kids."

00:01:44.122 --> 00:01:46.220
So we did.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.265
(Laughter)

00:01:48.265 --> 00:01:53.507
(Applause)

00:01:53.507 --> 00:01:57.247
And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley

00:01:57.247 --> 00:01:58.694
turned out to be.

00:01:58.694 --> 00:02:00.337
He was a Chinese scholar

00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:02.203
who later, in his 60s,

00:02:02.203 --> 00:02:04.755
got a Ph.D. in Chinese history.

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:07.243
He spoke six languages,

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:09.731
he played 15 musical instruments,

00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:11.507
he was a licensed pilot,

00:02:11.507 --> 00:02:14.678
he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator,

00:02:14.678 --> 00:02:17.512
he was an expert in swine nutrition,

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:21.293
dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir,

00:02:21.293 --> 00:02:25.477
and we did travel the country, and the world,

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:27.706
and we did have a lot of kids.

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:29.448
We followed my job, and it seemed like

00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:33.015
there was nothing that we couldn't do.

00:02:33.015 --> 00:02:36.797
So when we found the cancer,

00:02:36.797 --> 00:02:39.362
it doesn't seem strange to us at all

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:41.995
that without saying a word to each other,

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.421
we believed that,

00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:46.680
if we were smart enough

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.011
and strong enough and brave enough,

00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:53.484
and we worked hard enough,

00:02:53.484 --> 00:02:58.762
we could keep him from dying ever.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:02.261
And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding.

00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:05.140
The surgeon emerged from the surgery.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.417
What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say:

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:09.419
"We got it all."

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.462
Then there was a setback when the pathologists

00:03:12.462 --> 00:03:14.835
looked at the kidney cancer closely.

00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:16.464
It turned out to be a rare,

00:03:16.464 --> 00:03:18.273
exceedingly aggressive type,

00:03:18.273 --> 00:03:21.355
with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal

00:03:21.355 --> 00:03:23.746
in several weeks at most.

00:03:23.746 --> 00:03:27.456
And yet, he did not die.

00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:30.966
Mysteriously, he lived on.

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:33.050
He coached Little League for our son.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.602
He built a playhouse for our daughter.

00:03:35.602 --> 00:03:38.676
And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:40.350
looking for specialists.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.911
I'm looking for a cure.

00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:44.988
So a year goes by

00:03:44.988 --> 00:03:48.194
before the cancer, as cancers do,

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.194
reappears,

00:03:50.194 --> 00:03:52.270
and with it comes another death sentence,

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.463
this time nine months.

00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:58.477
So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.

00:03:58.477 --> 00:04:00.297
It makes him so sick, he has to quit it,

00:04:00.297 --> 00:04:03.314
yet still he lives on.

00:04:03.314 --> 00:04:05.210
Then another year goes by.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.760
Two years go by.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.249
More specialists.

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:10.169
We take the kids to Italy.

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.638
We take the kids to Australia.

00:04:12.638 --> 00:04:15.350
And then more years pass,

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.740
and the cancer begins to grow.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.275
This time, there's new treatments on the horizon.

00:04:20.275 --> 00:04:22.211
They're exotic. They're experimental.

00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:25.419
They're going to attack the cancer in new ways.

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.745
So he enters a clinical trial, and it works.

00:04:29.745 --> 00:04:31.674
The cancer begins to shrink,

00:04:31.674 --> 00:04:33.951
and for the third time,

00:04:33.951 --> 00:04:37.310
we've dodged death.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.607
So now I ask you,

00:04:40.607 --> 00:04:42.996
how do I feel

00:04:42.996 --> 00:04:45.510
when the time finally comes

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.016
and there's another dark night,

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.517
sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?

00:04:50.517 --> 00:04:53.491
This time it's on the intensive care ward

00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:55.329
when a twentysomething resident

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:57.532
that I've never met before

00:04:57.532 --> 00:05:00.125
tells me that Terence is dying,

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:02.324
perhaps tonight.

00:05:02.324 --> 00:05:05.117
So what do I say when he says,

00:05:05.117 --> 00:05:07.931
"What do you want me to do?"

00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:09.943
There's another drug out there.

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:11.631
It's newer. It's more powerful.

00:05:11.631 --> 00:05:14.200
He started it just two weeks ago.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.309
Perhaps there's still hope ahead.

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.264
So what do I say?

00:05:19.264 --> 00:05:22.620
I say, "Keep him alive if you can."

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.135
And Terence died six days later.

00:05:26.135 --> 00:05:30.183
So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.

00:05:30.183 --> 00:05:31.979
It was an exhilarating fight,

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.696
and I'd repeat the fight today

00:05:33.696 --> 00:05:36.345
without a moment's hesitation.

00:05:36.345 --> 00:05:39.296
We fought together, we lived together.

00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:41.400
It turned what could have been

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.134
seven of the grimmest years of our life

00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:47.745
into seven of the most glorious.

00:05:47.745 --> 00:05:50.520
It was also an expensive fight.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.481
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices

00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:54.115
that everyone here agrees

00:05:54.115 --> 00:05:56.520
pump up the cost of end-of-life care,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.806
and of healthcare for all of us.

00:05:58.806 --> 00:06:01.888
And for me, for us,

00:06:01.888 --> 00:06:03.970
we pushed the fight right over the edge,

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.195
and I never got the chance to say to him

00:06:07.195 --> 00:06:10.615
what I say to him now almost every day:

00:06:10.615 --> 00:06:13.692
"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."

00:06:13.692 --> 00:06:16.180
We never got the chance to say goodbye.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.459
We never thought it was the end.

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:23.638
We always had hope.

00:06:23.638 --> 00:06:27.502
So what do we make of all of this?

00:06:27.502 --> 00:06:31.080
Being a journalist, after Terence died,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.369
I wrote a book, "The Cost Of Hope."

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:36.519
I wrote it because I wanted to know

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:38.205
why I did what I did,

00:06:38.205 --> 00:06:40.006
why he did what he did,

00:06:40.006 --> 00:06:42.561
why everyone around us did what they did.

00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:44.197
And what did I discover?

00:06:44.197 --> 00:06:45.771
Well, one of the things I discovered is that

00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:48.848
experts think that one answer to

00:06:48.848 --> 00:06:51.598
what I did at the end was a piece of paper,

00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:53.756
the advance directive,

00:06:53.756 --> 00:06:58.096
to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.

00:06:58.096 --> 00:07:02.210
Yet I had that piece of paper.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.263
We both did.

00:07:04.263 --> 00:07:05.953
And they were readily available.

00:07:05.953 --> 00:07:07.892
I had them right at hand.

00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:10.251
Both of them said the same thing:

00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:14.752
Do nothing if there is no further hope.

00:07:14.752 --> 00:07:16.972
I knew Terence's wishes

00:07:16.972 --> 00:07:20.786
as clearly and as surely as I knew my own.

00:07:20.786 --> 00:07:25.990
Yet we never got to no further hope.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.747
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands,

00:07:28.747 --> 00:07:32.003
we just kept redefining hope.

00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:37.295
I believed I could keep him from dying,

00:07:37.295 --> 00:07:40.109
and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen

00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:42.320
so many people and have talked to so many people

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.994
who have felt exactly the same way.

00:07:44.994 --> 00:07:48.928
Right up until days before his death,

00:07:48.928 --> 00:07:52.254
I felt strongly

00:07:52.254 --> 00:07:56.297
and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally,

00:07:56.297 --> 00:08:01.544
that I could keep him from dying ever.

00:08:01.544 --> 00:08:04.779
Now, what do the experts call this?

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:07.126
They say it's denial.

00:08:07.126 --> 00:08:09.317
It's a strong word, isn't it?

00:08:09.317 --> 00:08:11.714
Yet I will tell you that denial

00:08:11.714 --> 00:08:16.828
isn't even close to a strong enough word

00:08:16.828 --> 00:08:19.474
to describe what those of us

00:08:19.474 --> 00:08:23.112
facing the death of our loved ones go through.

00:08:23.112 --> 00:08:25.453
And I hear the medical professionals say,

00:08:25.453 --> 00:08:27.536
"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such,

00:08:27.536 --> 00:08:29.987
but the family's in denial.

00:08:29.987 --> 00:08:32.163
The family won't listen to reason.

00:08:32.163 --> 00:08:34.185
They're in denial.

00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:36.537
How can they insist on this treatment at the end?

00:08:36.537 --> 00:08:39.841
It's so clear, yet they're in denial."

00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:41.848
Now, I think this maybe isn't

00:08:41.848 --> 00:08:44.852
a very useful way of thinking.

00:08:44.852 --> 00:08:47.130
It's not just families either.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.255
The medical professionals too,

00:08:49.255 --> 00:08:52.615
you out there, you're in denial too.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.468
You want to help. You want to fix.

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.294
You want to do.

00:08:57.294 --> 00:09:00.102
You've succeeded in everything you've done,

00:09:00.102 --> 00:09:02.144
and having a patient die,

00:09:02.144 --> 00:09:05.723
well, that must feel like failure.

00:09:05.723 --> 00:09:07.567
I saw it firsthand.

00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:10.269
Just days before Terence died,

00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:12.287
his oncologist said,

00:09:12.287 --> 00:09:15.535
"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead."

00:09:15.535 --> 00:09:17.917
Days before he died.

00:09:17.917 --> 00:09:19.350
Yet Ira Byock,

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.698
the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth

00:09:21.698 --> 00:09:24.629
said, "You know, the best doctor in the world

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:29.237
has never succeeded in making anyone immortal."

00:09:29.237 --> 00:09:35.743
So what the experts call "denial," I call "hope,"

00:09:35.743 --> 00:09:38.077
and I'd like to borrow a phrase

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:41.298
from my friends in software design.

00:09:41.298 --> 00:09:44.860
You just redefine denial and hope,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.088
and it becomes a feature of being human.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.949
It's not a bug.

00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:52.275
It's a feature.

00:09:52.275 --> 00:09:55.369
(Laughter)

00:09:55.369 --> 00:09:59.063
So we need to think more constructively

00:09:59.063 --> 00:10:03.375
about this very common, very profound

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:07.331
and very powerful human emotion.

00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:09.955
It's part of the human condition,

00:10:09.955 --> 00:10:12.132
and yet our system and our thinking

00:10:12.132 --> 00:10:15.301
isn't built to accommodate it.

00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:18.356
So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night,

00:10:18.356 --> 00:10:20.261
and I believed it.

00:10:20.261 --> 00:10:23.375
Maybe I wanted to believe it.

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:28.704
And during Terence's illness, I, we,

00:10:28.704 --> 00:10:30.426
we wanted to believe the story

00:10:30.426 --> 00:10:33.021
of our fight together too.

00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:36.757
Giving up the fight -- for that's how it felt,

00:10:36.757 --> 00:10:38.696
it felt like giving up --

00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:41.413
meant giving up not only his life

00:10:41.413 --> 00:10:45.120
but also our story,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.330
our story of us as fighters,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.260
the story of us as invincible,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.468
and for the doctors, the story of themselves

00:10:52.468 --> 00:10:55.026
as healers.

00:10:55.026 --> 00:10:57.710
So what do we need?

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.649
Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper.

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:03.596
Maybe we need a new story,

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:07.605
not a story about giving up the fight

00:11:07.605 --> 00:11:09.876
or of hopelessness,

00:11:09.876 --> 00:11:13.287
but rather a story of victory and triumph,

00:11:13.287 --> 00:11:18.130
of a valiant battle and, eventually,

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.450
a graceful retreat,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.457
a story that acknowledges

00:11:23.457 --> 00:11:27.220
that not even the greatest general defeats every foe,

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.841
that no doctor has ever succeeded

00:11:29.841 --> 00:11:32.231
in making anyone immortal,

00:11:32.231 --> 00:11:38.297
and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried,

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:42.982
has ever stopped even the bravest,

00:11:42.982 --> 00:11:47.031
wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband

00:11:47.031 --> 00:11:51.224
from dying when it was his time to go.

00:11:51.224 --> 00:11:53.537
People did mention hospice,

00:11:53.537 --> 00:11:56.908
but I wouldn't listen.

00:11:56.908 --> 00:12:00.833
Hospice was for people who were dying,

00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:03.606
and Terence wasn't dying.

00:12:03.606 --> 00:12:06.516
As a result, he spent just four days in hospice,

00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:08.333
which I'm sure, as you all know,

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:10.423
is a pretty typical outcome,

00:12:10.423 --> 00:12:11.935
and we never said goodbye

00:12:11.935 --> 00:12:14.990
because we were unprepared for the end.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.737
We have a noble path to curing the disease,

00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:21.067
patients and doctors alike,

00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:23.190
but there doesn't seem to be

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.790
a noble path to dying.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.848
Dying is seen as failing,

00:12:28.848 --> 00:12:31.500
and we had a heroic narrative

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.593
for fighting together,

00:12:33.593 --> 00:12:38.623
but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.

00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:42.741
So maybe we need a narrative

00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:46.217
for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye,

00:12:46.217 --> 00:12:48.779
and maybe our new story will be

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:53.385
about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.

00:12:53.385 --> 00:12:55.852
Terence loved poetry,

00:12:55.852 --> 00:12:59.079
and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy

00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:01.508
is one of my favorite poets.

00:13:01.508 --> 00:13:04.392
So I'll give you a couple lines from him.

00:13:04.392 --> 00:13:06.608
This is a poem about Mark Antony.

00:13:06.608 --> 00:13:09.301
You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero,

00:13:09.301 --> 00:13:11.166
Cleopatra's guy?

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:13.703
Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys.

00:13:13.703 --> 00:13:16.128
And he's been a pretty good general.

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:17.188
He's won all the fights,

00:13:17.188 --> 00:13:19.643
he's eluded all the people that are out to get him,

00:13:19.643 --> 00:13:21.431
and yet this time, finally,

00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:23.180
he's come to the city of Alexandria

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.862
and realized he's lost.

00:13:24.862 --> 00:13:26.578
The people are leaving. They're playing instruments.

00:13:26.578 --> 00:13:27.901
They're singing.

00:13:27.901 --> 00:13:30.501
And suddenly he knows he's been defeated.

00:13:30.501 --> 00:13:32.680
And he suddenly knows

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.205
he's been deserted by the gods,

00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:37.145
and it's time to let go.

00:13:37.145 --> 00:13:39.112
And the poet tells him what to do.

00:13:39.112 --> 00:13:42.378
He tells him how to say a noble goodbye,

00:13:42.378 --> 00:13:46.225
a goodbye that's fit for a hero.

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:48.974
"As if long-prepared,

00:13:48.974 --> 00:13:51.653
as if courageous,

00:13:51.653 --> 00:13:54.250
as it becomes you

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.422
who were worthy of such a city,

00:13:56.422 --> 00:13:58.825
approach the window with a firm step,

00:13:58.825 --> 00:14:01.360
and with emotion,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.559
but not with the entreaties

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:06.320
or the complaints of a coward,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.291
as a last enjoyment,

00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:10.415
listen to the sounds,

00:14:10.415 --> 00:14:13.749
the exquisite instruments of the musical troops,

00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:16.030
and bid her farewell,

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.445
the Alexandria you are losing."

00:14:20.445 --> 00:14:24.135
That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life,

00:14:24.135 --> 00:14:26.153
a goodbye for a man

00:14:26.153 --> 00:14:28.127
for whom anything,

00:14:28.127 --> 00:14:31.235
well, almost anything,

00:14:31.235 --> 00:14:33.125
was possible,

00:14:33.125 --> 00:14:36.265
a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.

00:14:36.265 --> 00:14:38.458
And isn't that what we're missing?

00:14:38.458 --> 00:14:40.517
How can we learn that people's decisions

00:14:40.517 --> 00:14:42.027
about their loved ones

00:14:42.027 --> 00:14:45.956
are often based strongly, powerfully,

00:14:45.956 --> 00:14:48.808
many times irrationally,

00:14:48.808 --> 00:14:51.152
on the slimmest of hopes?

00:14:51.152 --> 00:14:54.174
The overwhelming presence of hope

00:14:54.174 --> 00:14:55.597
isn't denial.

00:14:55.597 --> 00:14:58.417
It's part of our DNA as humans,

00:14:58.417 --> 00:15:00.735
and maybe it's time our healthcare system --

00:15:00.735 --> 00:15:05.219
doctors, patients, insurance companies, us,

00:15:05.219 --> 00:15:09.193
started accounting for the power of that hope.

00:15:09.193 --> 00:15:11.493
Hope isn't a bug.

00:15:11.493 --> 00:15:13.862
It's a feature.

00:15:13.862 --> 00:15:16.357
Thank you.

00:15:16.357 --> 00:15:19.412
(Applause)
