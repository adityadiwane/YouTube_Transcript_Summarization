00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:15.578
So, a few years ago I was at JFK Airport

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:17.370
about to get on a flight,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.186
when I was approached by two women

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:20.848
who I do not think would be insulted

00:00:20.848 --> 00:00:22.242
to hear themselves described

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:26.184
as tiny old tough-talking Italian-American broads.

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:29.330
The taller one, who is like up here,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.381
she comes marching up to me, and she goes,

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:33.700
"Honey, I gotta ask you something.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.128
You got something to do with that whole

00:00:35.128 --> 00:00:38.150
'Eat, Pray, Love' thing that's been going on lately?"

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.264
And I said, "Yes, I did."

00:00:40.264 --> 00:00:42.052
And she smacks her friend and she goes,

00:00:42.052 --> 00:00:44.206
"See, I told you, I said, that's that girl.

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:46.156
That's that girl who wrote that book

00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:48.190
based on that movie."

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.344
(Laughter)

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:52.520
So that's who I am.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.225
And believe me, I'm extremely
grateful to be that person,

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:58.223
because that whole "Eat, Pray, Love" thing

00:00:58.223 --> 00:00:59.967
was a huge break for me.

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:02.475
But it also left me in a really tricky position

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:04.383
moving forward as an author

00:01:04.383 --> 00:01:06.110
trying to figure out how in the world

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.364
I was ever going to write a book again

00:01:07.364 --> 00:01:09.209
that would ever please anybody,

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:11.199
because I knew well in advance

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:14.151
that all of those people who
had adored "Eat, Pray, Love"

00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:15.740
were going to be incredibly disappointed

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.123
in whatever I wrote next

00:01:17.123 --> 00:01:18.951
because it wasn't going to be "Eat, Pray, Love,"

00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:21.397
and all of those people who
had hated "Eat, Pray, Love"

00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:22.765
were going to be incredibly disappointed

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:24.208
in whatever I wrote next

00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:26.661
because it would provide evidence that I still lived.

00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:29.823
So I knew that I had no way to win,

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:32.279
and knowing that I had no way to win

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.183
made me seriously consider for a while

00:01:34.183 --> 00:01:35.625
just quitting the game

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:39.267
and moving to the country to raise corgis.

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:41.327
But if I had done that, if I had given up writing,

00:01:41.327 --> 00:01:43.391
I would have lost my beloved vocation,

00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:45.599
so I knew that the task was that I had to find

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:47.998
some way to gin up the inspiration

00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:49.430
to write the next book

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.926
regardless of its inevitable negative outcome.

00:01:51.926 --> 00:01:53.534
In other words, I had to find a way to make sure

00:01:53.534 --> 00:01:56.177
that my creativity survived its own success.

00:01:56.177 --> 00:01:58.600
And I did, in the end, find that inspiration,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.138
but I found it in the most unlikely

00:02:00.138 --> 00:02:01.552
and unexpected place.

00:02:01.552 --> 00:02:04.692
I found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life

00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:07.800
about how creativity can survive its own failure.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.406
So just to back up and explain,

00:02:09.406 --> 00:02:11.719
the only thing I have ever wanted to be

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.316
for my whole life was a writer.

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:15.688
I wrote all through childhood,
all through adolescence,

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:17.504
by the time I was a teenager I was sending

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:19.340
my very bad stories to The New Yorker,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.616
hoping to be discovered.

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:23.060
After college, I got a job as a diner waitress,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.196
kept working, kept writing,

00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:27.444
kept trying really hard to get published,

00:02:27.444 --> 00:02:29.156
and failing at it.

00:02:29.156 --> 00:02:30.628
I failed at getting published

00:02:30.628 --> 00:02:32.204
for almost six years.

00:02:32.204 --> 00:02:33.812
So for almost six years, every single day,

00:02:33.812 --> 00:02:35.468
I had nothing but rejection letters

00:02:35.468 --> 00:02:37.120
waiting for me in my mailbox.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.870
And it was devastating every single time,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.114
and every single time, I had to ask myself

00:02:41.114 --> 00:02:43.500
if I should just quit while I was behind

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.190
and give up and spare myself this pain.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.484
But then I would find my resolve,

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:50.006
and always in the same way,

00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:52.151
by saying, "I'm not going to quit,

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:53.972
I'm going home."

00:02:53.972 --> 00:02:54.920
And you have to understand that for me,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.492
going home did not mean
returning to my family's farm.

00:02:58.492 --> 00:03:00.050
For me, going home

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.601
meant returning to the work of writing

00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:03.486
because writing was my home,

00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:06.702
because I loved writing more
than I hated failing at writing,

00:03:06.702 --> 00:03:08.207
which is to say that I loved writing

00:03:08.207 --> 00:03:09.780
more than I loved my own ego,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.184
which is ultimately to say

00:03:11.184 --> 00:03:13.776
that I loved writing more than I loved myself.

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:15.742
And that's how I pushed through it.

00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:17.606
But the weird thing is that 20 years later,

00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:19.104
during the crazy ride of "Eat, Pray, Love,"

00:03:19.104 --> 00:03:21.710
I found myself identifying all over again

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.110
with that unpublished young diner waitress

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.278
who I used to be, thinking about her constantly,

00:03:26.278 --> 00:03:28.136
and feeling like I was her again,

00:03:28.136 --> 00:03:29.901
which made no rational sense whatsoever

00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:31.878
because our lives could not
have been more different.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.326
She had failed constantly.

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:35.970
I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.320
We had nothing in common.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.486
Why did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again?

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:42.856
And it was only when I was trying to unthread that

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:44.458
that I finally began to comprehend

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.862
the strange and unlikely psychological connection

00:03:46.862 --> 00:03:49.396
in our lives between the way
we experience great failure

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.632
and the way we experience great success.

00:03:51.632 --> 00:03:53.102
So think of it like this:

00:03:53.102 --> 00:03:54.852
For most of your life, you live out your existence

00:03:54.852 --> 00:03:57.295
here in the middle of the chain of human experience

00:03:57.295 --> 00:04:00.373
where everything is normal
and reassuring and regular,

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:03.833
but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:06.767
into the blinding darkness of disappointment.

00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:10.321
Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far

00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:11.689
way out over here

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.551
into the equally blinding glare

00:04:13.551 --> 00:04:16.403
of fame and recognition and praise.

00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:17.605
And one of these fates

00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:19.822
is objectively seen by the world as bad,

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:21.879
and the other one is objectively
seen by the world as good,

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:24.527
but your subconscious is completely incapable

00:04:24.527 --> 00:04:27.255
of discerning the difference between bad and good.

00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:29.396
The only thing that it is capable of feeling

00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:32.856
is the absolute value of this emotional equation,

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.471
the exact distance that you have been flung

00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:36.839
from yourself.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.895
And there's a real equal danger in both cases

00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:40.441
of getting lost out there

00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:42.465
in the hinterlands of the psyche.

00:04:42.465 --> 00:04:43.998
But in both cases, it turns out that there is

00:04:43.998 --> 00:04:46.822
also the same remedy for self-restoration,

00:04:46.822 --> 00:04:50.420
and that is that you have got to
find your way back home again

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.687
as swiftly and smoothly as you can,

00:04:52.687 --> 00:04:54.159
and if you're wondering what your home is,

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.245
here's a hint:

00:04:55.245 --> 00:04:57.471
Your home is whatever in this world you love

00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.385
more than you love yourself.

00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:01.471
So that might be creativity, it might be family,

00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:03.447
it might be invention, adventure,

00:05:03.447 --> 00:05:06.239
faith, service, it might be raising corgis,

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.139
I don't know, your home is that thing

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.911
to which you can dedicate your energies

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.957
with such singular devotion

00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:15.359
that the ultimate results become inconsequential.

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:17.863
For me, that home has always been writing.

00:05:17.863 --> 00:05:20.435
So after the weird, disorienting success

00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:22.133
that I went through with "Eat, Pray, Love,"

00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:23.547
I realized that all I had to do was exactly

00:05:23.547 --> 00:05:25.531
the same thing that I used to have to do all the time

00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:27.761
when I was an equally disoriented failure.

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:29.539
I had to get my ass back to work,

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.047
and that's what I did, and that's how, in 2010,

00:05:32.047 --> 00:05:34.401
I was able to publish the dreaded follow-up

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:35.289
to "Eat, Pray, Love."

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.865
And you know what happened with that book?

00:05:36.865 --> 00:05:39.576
It bombed, and I was fine.

00:05:39.576 --> 00:05:41.425
Actually, I kind of felt bulletproof,

00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:43.545
because I knew that I had broken the spell

00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:45.190
and I had found my way back home

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.801
to writing for the sheer devotion of it.

00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:49.937
And I stayed in my home of writing after that,

00:05:49.937 --> 00:05:51.769
and I wrote another book that just came out last year

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:53.414
and that one was really beautifully received,

00:05:53.414 --> 00:05:54.910
which is very nice, but not my point.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.200
My point is that I'm writing another one now,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.387
and I'll write another book after that

00:05:58.387 --> 00:06:00.217
and another and another and another

00:06:00.217 --> 00:06:01.415
and many of them will fail,

00:06:01.415 --> 00:06:03.043
and some of them might succeed,

00:06:03.043 --> 00:06:04.639
but I will always be safe

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.011
from the random hurricanes of outcome

00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:10.561
as long as I never forget where I rightfully live.

00:06:10.561 --> 00:06:12.963
Look, I don't know where you rightfully live,

00:06:12.963 --> 00:06:14.633
but I know that there's something in this world

00:06:14.633 --> 00:06:16.705
that you love more than you love yourself.

00:06:16.705 --> 00:06:18.120
Something worthy, by the way,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.111
so addiction and infatuation don't count,

00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:24.218
because we all know that those
are not safe places to live. Right?

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:26.265
The only trick is that you've got to identify

00:06:26.265 --> 00:06:28.729
the best, worthiest thing that you love most,

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.100
and then build your house right on top of it

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.977
and don't budge from it.

00:06:32.977 --> 00:06:35.321
And if you should someday, somehow

00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:37.265
get vaulted out of your home

00:06:37.265 --> 00:06:39.705
by either great failure or great success,

00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:41.870
then your job is to fight your
way back to that home

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.655
the only way that it has ever been done,

00:06:43.655 --> 00:06:45.844
by putting your head down and performing

00:06:45.844 --> 00:06:47.666
with diligence and devotion

00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:49.352
and respect and reverence

00:06:49.352 --> 00:06:51.396
whatever the task is that love

00:06:51.396 --> 00:06:53.476
is calling forth from you next.

00:06:53.476 --> 00:06:55.660
You just do that, and keep doing that

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.309
again and again and again,

00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:59.965
and I can absolutely promise you,
from long personal experience

00:06:59.965 --> 00:07:02.220
in every direction, I can assure you

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.290
that it's all going to be okay.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.981
Thank you.

00:07:05.981 --> 00:07:09.981
(Applause)
