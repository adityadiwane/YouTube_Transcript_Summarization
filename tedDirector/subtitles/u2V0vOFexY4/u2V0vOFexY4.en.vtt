00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I'm a neuroscientist, a professor at the University of California.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
And over the past 35 years,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
I've studied behavior

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
on the basis of everything from genes

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
through neurotransmitters, dopamine, things like that,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
all the way through circuit analysis.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
So that's what I normally do.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
But then, for some reason,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
I got into something else, just recently.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
And it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
to analyze a bunch of brains

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
of psychopathic killers.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
And so this would be the typical talk I would give.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
And the question is, "How do you end up with a psychopathic killer?"

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
What I mean by psychopathic killer

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
are these people, these types of people.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
And so some of the brains that I've studied

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
are people you know about.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
When I get the brains I don't know what I'm looking at.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
It's blind experiments. They also gave me normal people and everything.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
So I've looked at about 70 of these.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
And what came up was a number of pieces of data.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
So we look at these sorts of things theoretically,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
on the basis of genetics,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
and brain damage, and interaction with environment,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
and exactly how that machine works.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
So we're interested in exactly where in the brain,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
and what's the most important part of the brain.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
So we've been looking at this:

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
the interaction of genes,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
what's called epigenetic effects,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
brain damage, and environment,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
and how these are tied together.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
And how you end up with a psychopath, and a killer,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
depends on exactly when the damage occurs.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
It's really a very precisely timed thing.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
You get different kinds of psychopaths.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
So we're going along with this. And here's, just to give you the pattern.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
The pattern is that those people, every one of them I looked at,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
who was a murderer, and was a serial killer,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.330
had damage to their orbital cortex,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
which is right above the eyes, the orbits,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
and also the interior part of the temporal lobe.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
So there is the pattern that every one of them had,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
but they all were a little different too.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
They had other sorts of brain damage.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
A key thing is that

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
the major violence genes,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
it's called the MAO-A gene.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.330
And there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Some of you have this. And it's sex-linked.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
It's on the X chromosome. And so in this way

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
you can only get it from your mother.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.330
And in fact this is probably why mostly men, boys,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
are psychopathic killers,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
or are very aggressive.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
Because a daughter can get one X from the father,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
one X from the mother, it's kind of diluted out.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
But for a son, he can only get

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
the X chromosome from his mother.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
So this is how it's passed from mother to son.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.330
And it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
which is kind of interesting because serotonin

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
is supposed to make you calm and relaxed.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
But if you have this gene, in utero

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
your brain is bathed in this,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
so it doesn't work later on in life.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
And I'd given this one talk in Israel,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
just this past year.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
And it does have some consequences.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
Theoretically what this means

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
is that in order to express this gene,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
in a violent way,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
very early on, before puberty,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic --

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
not a little stress, not being spanked or something,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
but really seeing violence,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
or being involved in it, in 3D.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
Right? That's how the mirror neuron system works.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
And so, if you have that gene,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
and you see a lot of violence

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
in a certain situation,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
this is the recipe for disaster, absolute disaster.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
And what I think might happen in these areas of the world,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
where we have constant violence,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
you end up having generations of kids

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
that are seeing all this violence.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
And if I was a young girl, somewhere in a violent area,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
you know, a 14 year old, and I want to find a mate,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.330
I'd find some tough guy, right, to protect me.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.330
Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
And now the boys and the girls get them.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
So I think after several generations,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
and here is the idea, we really have a tinderbox.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
So that was the idea.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
But then my mother said to me, "I hear you've been going around talking

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
about psychopathic killers.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
And you're talking as if you come from a normal family."

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
I said, "What the hell are you talking about?"

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
She then told me about our own family tree.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
Now she blamed this on my father's side, of course.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.330
This was one of these cases, because she has no violence in her background,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
but my father did.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
Well she said, "There is good news and bad news.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
One of your cousins is Ezra Cornell, founder of Cornell university.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
But the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.330
Now I said, "Okay, so what? We have Lizzie."

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
She goes, "No it gets worse, read this book."

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
And here is this "Killed Strangely," and it's this historical book.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
And the first murder

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
of a mother by a son

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
was my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
Okay, so that's the first case of matricide.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
And that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
and how people thought back then.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
But it doesn't stop there.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
There were seven more men, on my father's side,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.330
starting then, Cornells, that were all murderers.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
Okay, now this gives one a little pause.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
(Laughter)

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
Because my father himself,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
and my three uncles, in World War II,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
were all conscientious objectors, all pussycats.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
But every once in a while, like Lizzie Borden, like three times a century,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
and we're kind of due.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
(Laughter)

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
So the moral of the story is:

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
But more likely is this.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.330
(Laughter)

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
And we had to take action. Now our kids found out about it.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
And they all seemed to be OK.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.330
But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
So what we've done is I've started to do PET scans

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
of everybody in the family.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.330
(Laughter)

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
We started to do PET scans, EEGs and genetic analysis

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
to see where the bad news is.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
Now the only person -- it turns out

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
one son and one daughter, siblings,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
didn't get along and their patterns are exactly the same.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
They have the same brain, and the same EEG.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
And now they are close as can be.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
But there's gonna be bad news somewhere.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
And we don't know where it's going to pop up.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
So that's my talk.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.330
(Laughter)
