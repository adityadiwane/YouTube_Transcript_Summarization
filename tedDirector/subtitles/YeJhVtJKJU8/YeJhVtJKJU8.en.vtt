00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.799
This is a river.

00:00:21.117 --> 00:00:22.458
This is a stream.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.934
This is a river.

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.029
This is happening all over the country.

00:00:28.615 --> 00:00:33.109
There are tens of thousands of miles
of dewatered streams in the United States.

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:38.265
On this map, the colored areas
represent water conflicts.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.226
Similar problems
are emerging in the East as well.

00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:46.429
The reasons vary state to state,
but mostly in the details.

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:51.869
There are 4,000 miles
of dewatered streams in Montana alone.

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:56.005
They would ordinarily
support fish and other wildlife.

00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:59.465
They're the veins of the ecosystem,

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.312
and they're often empty veins.

00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:06.471
I want to tell you the story
of just one of these streams,

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:09.935
because it's an archetype
for the larger story.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.699
This is Prickly Pear Creek.

00:01:11.723 --> 00:01:16.248
It runs through a populated area
from East Helena to Lake Helena.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.852
It supports wild fish including cutthroat,
brown and rainbow trout.

00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:26.848
Nearly every year
for more than a hundred years ...

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.579
it looked like this in the summer.

00:01:30.603 --> 00:01:31.863
How did we get here?

00:01:33.087 --> 00:01:36.262
Well, it started back in the late 1800s

00:01:36.286 --> 00:01:39.236
when people started settling
in places like Montana.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.402
In short, there was a lot of water
and there weren't very many people.

00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:46.361
But as more people
showed up wanting water,

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:49.338
the folks who were there first
got a little concerned,

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:53.300
and in 1865, Montana passed
its first water law.

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:58.031
It basically said, everybody
near the stream can share in the stream.

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.527
Oddly, a lot of people showed up
wanting to share the stream,

00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:03.178
and the folks who were there first

00:02:03.202 --> 00:02:05.546
got concerned enough
to bring out their lawyers.

00:02:05.894 --> 00:02:09.361
There were precedent-setting suits
in 1870 and 1872,

00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:11.573
both involving Prickly Pear Creek.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.236
And in 1921,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.335
the Montana Supreme Court
ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:23.954
that the folks who were there first
had the first, or "senior water rights."

00:02:24.824 --> 00:02:27.446
These senior water rights are key.

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:31.901
The problem is that all over the West
now it looks like this.

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:33.706
Some of these creeks have claims

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.028
for 50 to 100 times more water
than is actually in the stream.

00:02:38.568 --> 00:02:43.414
And the senior water rights holders,
if they don't use their water right,

00:02:43.438 --> 00:02:45.588
they risk losing their water right --

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.010
along with the economic value
that goes with it.

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:51.696
So they have no incentive to conserve.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.942
So it's not just
about the number of people;

00:02:55.781 --> 00:02:59.170
the system itself creates
a disincentive to conserve

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:02.291
because you can lose your water
right if you don't use it.

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:07.554
So after decades of lawsuits
and 140 years, now, of experience,

00:03:07.578 --> 00:03:09.260
we still have this.

00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:12.880
It's a broken system.

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:14.904
There's a disincentive to conserve,

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:18.519
because if you don't use your water right,
you can lose your water right.

00:03:18.543 --> 00:03:21.772
And I'm sure you all know,
this has created significant conflicts

00:03:21.796 --> 00:03:24.849
between the agricultural
and environmental communities.

00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:28.236
OK, now I'm going to change gears here.

00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:32.970
Most of you will be happy to know that
the rest of the presentation's free ...

00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:34.021
(Laughter)

00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:36.829
and some of you'll be happy
to know that it involves beer.

00:03:36.853 --> 00:03:39.824
(Laughter)

00:03:39.848 --> 00:03:42.298
There's another thing
happening around the country,

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.813
which is that companies
are starting to get concerned

00:03:44.837 --> 00:03:46.471
about their water footprint.

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:49.583
They're concerned about securing
an adequate supply of water,

00:03:49.607 --> 00:03:52.490
they're trying to be really efficient
with their water use,

00:03:52.514 --> 00:03:54.726
and they're concerned
about how their water use

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.415
affects the image of their brand.

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.080
Well, it's a national problem,

00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:01.784
but I'm going to tell you
another story from Montana ...

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.961
and it involves beer.

00:04:03.985 --> 00:04:06.932
I bet you didn't know,
it takes about 5 pints of water

00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:08.569
to make a pint of beer.

00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:10.562
If you include all the drain,

00:04:10.586 --> 00:04:14.137
it takes more than a hundred pints
of water to make a pint of beer.

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:15.609
Now the brewers in Montana

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:19.563
have already done a lot
to reduce their water consumption,

00:04:19.587 --> 00:04:21.852
but they still use
millions of gallons of water.

00:04:21.876 --> 00:04:24.106
I mean, there's water in beer.

00:04:25.428 --> 00:04:31.735
So what can they do
about this remaining water footprint

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.995
that can have serious effects
on the ecosystem?

00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:37.724
These ecosystems are really important

00:04:37.748 --> 00:04:39.786
to the Montana brewers
and their customers.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.455
After all, there's a strong correlation
between water and fishing,

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.706
and for some, there's a strong correlation
between fishing and beer.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.237
(Laughter)

00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:52.772
So the Montana brewers
and their customers are concerned

00:04:52.885 --> 00:04:55.562
and they're looking for some way
to address the problem.

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:59.205
So how can they address
this remaining water footprint?

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.734
Remember Prickly Pear.

00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:04.937
Up until now, business water stewardship

00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:08.236
has been limited
to measuring and reducing,

00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:12.356
and we're suggesting
that the next step is to restore.

00:05:13.383 --> 00:05:14.555
Remember Prickly Pear.

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:15.803
It's a broken system.

00:05:15.827 --> 00:05:17.870
You've got a disincentive to conserve,

00:05:17.894 --> 00:05:21.639
because if you don't use your water right,
you risk losing your water right.

00:05:21.663 --> 00:05:24.050
Well, we decided to connect
these two worlds --

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:27.395
the world of the companies
with their water footprints

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.026
and the world of the farmers

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.499
with their senior water rights
on these creeks.

00:05:31.523 --> 00:05:32.829
In some states,

00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:38.236
senior water rights holders
can leave their water in the stream

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.414
while legally protecting it from others,

00:05:42.303 --> 00:05:44.969
and maintaining their water right.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.414
After all, it is their water right,

00:05:48.438 --> 00:05:52.537
and if they want to use that water right
to help the fish grow in the stream,

00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:54.568
it's their right to do so.

00:05:55.395 --> 00:05:59.236
But they have no incentive to do so.

00:06:00.062 --> 00:06:05.336
So, working with local water trusts,
we created an incentive to do so.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.512
We pay them to leave
their water in stream.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:10.930
That's what's happening here.

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:15.757
This individual has made the choice
and is closing this water diversion,

00:06:15.781 --> 00:06:17.956
leaving the water in the stream.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.621
He doesn't lose the water right,

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:24.414
he just chooses to apply that right,
or some portion of it,

00:06:24.438 --> 00:06:26.941
to the stream, instead of to the land.

00:06:27.692 --> 00:06:30.073
Because he's the senior
water-rights holder,

00:06:30.097 --> 00:06:33.236
he can protect the water
from other users in the stream.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.510
OK?

00:06:35.534 --> 00:06:38.236
He gets paid to leave
the water in the stream.

00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:42.571
This guy's measuring the water
that this leaves in the stream.

00:06:43.825 --> 00:06:46.311
We then take the measured water,

00:06:46.335 --> 00:06:48.990
we divide it into
thousand-gallon increments.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.134
Each increment gets a serial number
and a certificate,

00:06:53.158 --> 00:06:56.546
and then the brewers and others
buy those certificates

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.635
as a way to return water
to these degraded ecosystems.

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:03.812
The brewers pay
to restore water to the stream.

00:07:05.932 --> 00:07:09.173
It provides a simple,
inexpensive and measurable way

00:07:10.133 --> 00:07:12.843
to return water
to these degraded ecosystems,

00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:15.760
while giving farmers an economic choice

00:07:15.784 --> 00:07:18.668
and giving businesses
concerned about their water footprints

00:07:18.692 --> 00:07:20.236
an easy way to deal with them.

00:07:20.737 --> 00:07:26.807
After 140 years of conflict
and 100 years of dry streams,

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:31.562
a circumstance that litigation
and regulation has not solved,

00:07:33.047 --> 00:07:37.229
we put together a market-based,
willing buyer, willing seller solution --

00:07:37.253 --> 00:07:39.935
a solution that
does not require litigation.

00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:46.617
It's about giving folks
concerned about their water footprints

00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:50.468
a real opportunity to put water
where it's critically needed,

00:07:51.246 --> 00:07:53.744
into these degraded ecosystems,

00:07:53.768 --> 00:07:59.366
while at the same time providing farmers
a meaningful economic choice

00:07:59.523 --> 00:08:01.432
about how their water is used.

00:08:01.456 --> 00:08:04.139
These transactions
create allies, not enemies.

00:08:04.163 --> 00:08:06.618
They connect people
rather than dividing them.

00:08:06.642 --> 00:08:10.356
And they provide needed economic
support for rural communities.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.364
And most importantly, it's working.

00:08:12.388 --> 00:08:17.057
We've returned more than four billion
gallons of water to degraded ecosystems.

00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:19.110
We've connected senior
water-rights holders

00:08:19.134 --> 00:08:20.582
with brewers in Montana,

00:08:20.606 --> 00:08:23.318
with hotels and tea companies in Oregon,

00:08:23.342 --> 00:08:26.947
and with high-tech companies
that use a lot of water in the Southwest.

00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:29.359
And when we make these connections,

00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:32.588
we can and we do turn this ...

00:08:33.223 --> 00:08:34.373
into this.

00:08:34.823 --> 00:08:36.193
(Applause)

00:08:36.217 --> 00:08:37.670
Thank you very much.

00:08:37.694 --> 00:08:41.394
(Applause)
