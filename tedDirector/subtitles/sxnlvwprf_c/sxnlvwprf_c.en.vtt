00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
A few months ago,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
in a hospital close to where I live,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and she was brought in confused.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
Her blood pressure was an alarming

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
230 over 170.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Within a few minutes, she went into cardiac collapse.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
She was resuscitated, stabilized,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
whisked over to a CAT scan suite

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
right next to the emergency room,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And the CAT scan revealed

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
no blood clots in the lung,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.260
but it showed bilateral, visible, palpable breast masses,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
breast tumors,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
that had metastasized widely

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
all over the body.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And the real tragedy was, if you look through her records,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
she had been seen

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
in four or five other health care institutions

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
in the preceding two years.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Four or five opportunities

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
to see the breast masses, touch the breast mass,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
intervene at a much earlier stage

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
than when we saw her.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
that is not an unusual story.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Unfortunately, it happens all the time.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I joke, but I only half joke,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
no one will believe you till they get a CAT scan, MRI

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
or orthopedic consult.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
I am not a Luddite.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
I teach at Stanford.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
I'm a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
But I'd like to make the case to you

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
in the next 17 minutes

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.260
that when we shortcut the physical exam,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
when we lean towards ordering tests

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
instead of talking to and examining the patient,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
we not only overlook simple diagnoses

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
that can be diagnosed at a treatable, early stage,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
but we're losing much more than that.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
We're losing a ritual.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
We're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative, transcendent,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and is at the heart

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
of the patient-physician relationship.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
This may actually be heresy to say this at TED,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
but I'd like to introduce you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
to the most important innovation,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
I think, in medicine

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
to come in the next 10 years,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and that is the power of the human hand --

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
to touch, to comfort, to diagnose

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and to bring about treatment.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
I'd like to introduce you first to this person

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
whose image you may or may not recognize.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Since we're in Edinburgh, I'm a big fan of Conan Doyle.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
here in Edinburgh,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and his character, Sherlock Holmes,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And Conan Doyle, writing about Bell,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
described the following exchange

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
between Bell and his students.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
students all around him,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
patients signing up in the emergency room

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and being registered and being brought in.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And a woman comes in with a child,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and Conan Doyle describes the following exchange.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.260
The woman says, "Good Morning."

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Bell says, "What sort of crossing did you have

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
on the ferry from Burntisland?"

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
She says, "It was good."

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And he says, "What did you do with the other child?"

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
She says, "I left him with my sister at Leith."

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And he says,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
"And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
to get here to the infirmary?"

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
She says, "I did."

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.260
And he says, "Would you still be working at the linoleum factory?"

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And she says, "I am."

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And Bell then goes on to explain to the students.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
He says, "You see, when she said, 'Good morning,'

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
I picked up her Fife accent.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
And the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
And so she must have taken the ferry over.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
You notice that the coat she's carrying

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
is too small for the child who is with her,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
and therefore, she started out the journey with two children,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
but dropped one off along the way.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
You notice the clay on the soles of her feet.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
except in the botanical gardens.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And therefore, she took a short cut down Inverleith Row

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
to arrive here.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And finally, she has a dermatitis

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
on the fingers of her right hand,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
a dermatitis that is unique

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
to the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland."

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And when Bell actually strips the patient,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
begins to examine the patient,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
you can only imagine how much more he would discern.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And as a teacher of medicine, as a student myself,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
I was so inspired by that story.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
But you might not realize

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
that our ability to look into the body

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
in this simple way, using our senses,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
is quite recent.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
The picture I'm showing you is of Leopold Auenbrugger

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
who, in the late 1700s,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
discovered percussion.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And the story is that Leopold Auenbrugger

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
was the son of an innkeeper.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And his father used to go down into the basement

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
to tap on the sides of casks of wine

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
to determine how much wine was left

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
and whether to reorder.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And so when Auenbrugger became a physician,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
he began to do the same thing.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
He began to tap on the chests of his patients,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
on their abdomens.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And basically everything we know about percussion,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.260
which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day --

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
organ enlargement, fluid around the heart, fluid in the lungs,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
abdominal changes --

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
"Inventum Novum," "New Invention,"

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
which would have disappeared into obscurity,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
except for the fact that this physician, Corvisart,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
a famous French physician --

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
famous only because he was physician to this gentleman --

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.260
Corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
And it was followed a year or two later

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
by Laennec discovering the stethoscope.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Laennec, it is said, was walking in the streets of Paris

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and saw two children playing with a stick.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
One was scratching at the end of the stick,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
another child listened at the other end.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
using what he called "the cylinder."

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
Later he renamed it the stethoscope.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.260
And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
So within a few years,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
in the late 1800s, early 1900s,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
all of a sudden,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
the barber surgeon had given way

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
If you'll recall, prior to that time,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
no matter what ailed you, you went to see the barber surgeon

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
who wound up cupping you,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
bleeding you, purging you.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And, oh yes, if you wanted,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
he would give you a haircut -- short on the sides, long in the back --

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and pull your tooth while he was at it.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
He made no attempt at diagnosis.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
In fact, some of you might well know

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
that the barber pole, the red and white stripes,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and the receptacles on either end

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
represent the pots in which the blood was collected.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
But the arrival of auscultation and percussion

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
represented a sea change,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
And this particular painting, I think,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
represents the pinnacle, the peak, of that clinical era.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
This is a very famous painting:

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
"The Doctor" by Luke Fildes.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
who then established the Tate Gallery.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
of social importance.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And it's interesting that Fildes picked this topic.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Fildes' oldest son, Philip,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
after a brief illness.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
And Fildes was so taken by the physician

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.260
who held vigil at the bedside for two, three nights,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
that he decided that he would try and depict

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
the physician in our time --

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
almost a tribute to this physician.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And hence the painting "The Doctor," a very famous painting.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
It's been on calendars, postage stamps in many different countries.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
I've often wondered, what would Fildes have done

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
had he been asked to paint this painting

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
in the modern era,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
in the year 2011?

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Would he have substituted a computer screen

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
for where he had the patient?

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
I've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
for saying that the patient in the bed

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
has almost become an icon

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
for the real patient who's in the computer.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
I've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
I call it the iPatient.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
The real patient often wonders,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
where is everyone?

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
When are they going to come by and explain things to me?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
Who's in charge?

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
There's a real disjunction between the patient's perception

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
I want to show you a picture

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
of what rounds looked like

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
when I was in training.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
The focus was around the patient.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
We went from bed to bed. The attending physician was in charge.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
Too often these days,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
rounds look very much like this,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
where the discussion is taking place

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
in a room far away from the patient.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
The discussion is all about images on the computer, data.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
And the one critical piece missing

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
is that of the patient.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Now I've been influenced in this thinking

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
by two anecdotes that I want to share with you.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
had a small breast cancer detected --

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
This is when I was in Texas.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And she then spent a lot of time researching

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
to find the best cancer center in the world

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
to get her subsequent care.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And she found the place and decided to go there, went there.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
Which is why I was surprised a few months later

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
to see her back in our own town,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
And I pressed her, and I asked her,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
"Why did you come back and get your care here?"

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And she was reluctant to tell me.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
She said, "The cancer center was wonderful.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
It had a beautiful facility,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
giant atrium, valet parking,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
a piano that played itself,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
a concierge that took you around from here to there.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
But," she said,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.260
"but they did not touch my breasts."

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
Now you and I could argue

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
that they probably did not need to touch her breasts.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
They had her scanned inside out.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level;

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
they had no need to touch her breasts.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
But to her, it mattered deeply.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.260
It was enough for her to make the decision

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
to get her subsequent care with her private oncologist

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
who, every time she went,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
examined both breasts including the axillary tail,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
examined her axilla carefully,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
examined her cervical region, her inguinal region,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
did a thorough exam.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.260
And to her, that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
I was very influenced by that anecdote.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
I was also influenced by another experience that I had,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
again, when I was in Texas, before I moved to Stanford.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
I had a reputation

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
as being interested in patients

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
with chronic fatigue.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.260
This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
I say that because these are difficult patients.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
They have often been rejected by their families,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
have had bad experiences with medical care

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
and they come to you fully prepared

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
for you to join the long list of people

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
who's about to disappoint them.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
And I learned very early on with my first patient

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
that I could not do justice

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
to this very complicated patient

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
with all the records they were bringing

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
in a new patient visit of 45 minutes.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
There was just no way.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And if I tried, I'd disappoint them.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
And so I hit on this method

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
where I invited the patient

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
to tell me the story for their entire first visit,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
and I tried not to interrupt them.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
We know the average American physician

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
interrupts their patient in 14 seconds.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
And if I ever get to heaven,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
it will be because I held my piece for 45 minutes

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
and did not interrupt my patient.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
and when the patient came for the physical,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
I was able to do a thorough physical,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
because I had nothing else to do.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
I like to think that I do a thorough physical exam,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
but because the whole visit was now about the physical,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
I could do an extraordinarily thorough exam.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.260
And I remember my very first patient in that series

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
continued to tell me more history

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
during what was meant to be the physical exam visit.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
And I began my ritual.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
I always begin with the pulse,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
then I examine the hands, then I look at the nail beds,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
and I was into my ritual.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And when my ritual began,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
this very voluble patient

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
began to quiet down.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
And I remember having a very eerie sense

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
that the patient and I

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
had slipped back into a primitive ritual

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
in which I had a role

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
and the patient had a role.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
And when I was done,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
the patient said to me with some awe,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
"I have never been examined like this before."

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
Now if that were true,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
it's a true condemnation of our health care system,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
because they had been seen in other places.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
I then proceeded to tell the patient,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
once the patient was dressed,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
which is, "This is not in your head.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
This is real.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
The good news, it's not cancer, it's not tuberculosis,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
it's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
The bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
but here's what you should do, here's what we should do."

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
And I would lay out all the standard treatment options

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
that the patient had heard elsewhere.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
And I always felt

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
that if my patient gave up the quest

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
for the magic doctor, the magic treatment

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
and began with me on a course towards wellness,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
it was because I had earned the right

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
to tell them these things

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
by virtue of the examination.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.260
Something of importance had transpired in the exchange.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
I took this to my colleagues

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
at Stanford in anthropology

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
and told them the same story.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
And they immediately said to me,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
"Well you are describing a classic ritual."

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
And they helped me understand

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
that rituals are all about transformation.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
We marry, for example,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
with great pomp and ceremony and expense

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
to signal our departure

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
to one of eternal bliss.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
I'm not sure why you're laughing.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
That was the original intent, was it not?

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
We signal transitions of power

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
with rituals.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
We signal the passage of a life with rituals.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Rituals are terribly important.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
They're all about transformation.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Well I would submit to you

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
that the ritual

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
of one individual coming to another

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
and telling them things

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
that they would not tell their preacher or rabbi,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
and then, incredibly on top of that,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
disrobing and allowing touch --

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.260
I would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
And if you shortchange that ritual

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
by not undressing the patient,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
by not doing a complete exam,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
you have bypassed on the opportunity

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.260
to seal the patient-physician relationship.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
I am a writer,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.260
and I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrote

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
that has to do very much with this scene.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
I'm an infectious disease physician,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
and in the early days of HIV, before we had our medications,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.260
I presided over so many scenes like this.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
I remember, every time I went to a patient's deathbed,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
whether in the hospital or at home,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.260
I remember my sense of failure --

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
the feeling of I don't know what I have to say;

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
I don't know what I can say;

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
And out of that sense of failure,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
I remember, I would always examine the patient.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
I would pull down the eyelids.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
I would look at the tongue.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
I would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
I would feel the abdomen.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
I remember so many patients,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
their names still vivid on my tongue,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
their faces still so clear.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.260
I remember so many huge, hollowed out, haunted eyes

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
staring up at me as I performed this ritual.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
And then the next day,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
I would come, and I would do it again.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
And I wanted to read you this one closing passage

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
about one patient.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
"I recall one patient

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
who was at that point

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
no more than a skeleton

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
encased in shrinking skin,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
unable to speak,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
his mouth crusted with candida

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
that was resistant to the usual medications.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
When he saw me

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
his hands moved as if in slow motion.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
And as I wondered what he was up to,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
his stick fingers made their way

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
up to his pajama shirt,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
fumbling with his buttons.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
I realized that he was wanting

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
to expose his wicker-basket chest to me.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
It was an offering, an invitation.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
I did not decline.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
I percussed. I palpated. I listened to the chest.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
I think he surely must have known by then

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
that it was vital for me

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
just as it was necessary for him.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
Neither of us could skip this ritual,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
or finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
No, this ritual was about the one message

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260
that physicians have needed to convey to their patients.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
Although, God knows, of late, in our hubris,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
we seem to have drifted away.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
We seem to have forgotten --

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
as though, with the explosion of knowledge,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
the whole human genome mapped out at our feet,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
we are lulled into inattention,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
necessary for the patient --

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
forgetting that the ritual has meaning

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.260
and a singular message to convey to the patient.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
And the message, which I didn't fully understand then,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
even as I delivered it,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.260
and which I understand better now is this:

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
I will always, always, always be there.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
I will see you through this.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
I will never abandon you.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
I will be with you through the end."

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:26.260
(Applause)
