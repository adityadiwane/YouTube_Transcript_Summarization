00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Do you know

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
how many species of flowering plants there are?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about --

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And flowers are a real bugger.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
They're really difficult for plants to produce.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Why would they go to that bother?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
is sex.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important --

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
You can take cuttings;

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
they can sort of have sex with themselves;

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
they can pollinate themselves.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
But they really need to spread their genes

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
to mix with other genes

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
so that they can adapt to environmental niches.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Evolution works that way.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Now the way that plants transmit that information

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
is through pollen.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
to be able to see these.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And there is as many different kinds of pollen

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
as there are flowering plants.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
is from plants that use the wind

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
to disseminate the pollen,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
and that's a very inefficient process,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
which is why it gets up our noses so much.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
which are held within the pollen,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
will somehow reach another flower just by chance.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and most of the trees

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
have wind-borne pollen.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
But most species

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
actually use insects to do their bidding,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and that's more intelligent in a way,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
The insects

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and other species

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
can take the pollen,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
transfer it directly to where it's required.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
between insects and plants.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
There's a symbiotic relationship there,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
whether it's flies or birds or bees,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
they're getting something in return,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
and that something in return is generally nectar.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Sometimes that symbiosis

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
has led to wonderful adaptations --

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
the hummingbird hawk-moth

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
is beautiful in its adaptation.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
The plant gets something,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Plants have evolved

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
to create little landing strips here and there

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
for bees that might have lost their way.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
There are markings on many plants

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
that look like other insects.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
These are the anthers of a lily,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
cleverly done

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
so that when the unsuspecting insect

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
lands on it,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
the anther flips up and whops it on the back

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And there's an orchid

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
that might look to you as if it's got jaws,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Orchids: there are 20,000, at least,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
species of orchids --

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
amazingly, amazingly diverse.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And they get up to all sorts of tricks.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
They have to try and attract pollinators

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
to do their bidding.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
because it's one that he studied

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
you can see that there's a very long nectar tube

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
that descends down

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
from the orchid.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And basically what the insect has to do --

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
we're in the middle of the flower --

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
it has to stick its little proboscis

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
right into the middle of that

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and all the way down that nectar tube

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
to get to the nectar.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
And Darwin said, looking at this flower,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
"I guess something has coevolved with this."

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And sure enough,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
there's the insect.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
but in its erect form,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
that's what it looks like.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
Now you can imagine

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
that if nectar

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
is such a valuable thing

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and expensive for the plant to produce

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and it attracts lots of pollinators,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
then, just as in human sex,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
people might start to deceive.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Now this is a plant.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
This is a plant here

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.260
that insects in South Africa just love,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
and they've evolved with a long proboscis

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
to get the nectar at the bottom.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And this is the mimic.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And here is the long-probosced fly

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
So not only has the fly

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
not got the nectar from the mimic plant,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
it's also -- if you look very closely

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
that it would be transmitting to another plant,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
if only some botanist hadn't come along

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
and stuck it to a blue piece of card.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.260
(Laughter)

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
This flower with its black dots:

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
they might look like black dots to us,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
that looks like two females

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
who are really, really hot to trot.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
(Laughter)

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And when the insect gets there and lands on it,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.260
if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
you can see that there are actually some patterning there,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
which is three-dimensional.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
So it probably even feels good for the insect,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
as well as looking good.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And these electron microscope pictures --

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect --

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
you can see that different parts of the structure

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
have different colors and different textures to our eye,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
have very, very different textures

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
to what an insect might perceive.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
And this one is evolved to mimic

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
a glossy metallic surface

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
you see on some beetles.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
And under the scanning electron microscope,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
you can see the surface there --

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.260
really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Sometimes the whole plant

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
mimics an insect, even to us.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
It's a wonderful, amazing thing.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
This one's clever. It's called obsidian.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
I think of it as insidium sometimes.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
To the right species of bee,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
this looks like another very aggressive bee,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
and, of course, covers itself with pollen.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
The other thing it does

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
is that this plant mimics another orchid

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
that has a wonderful store

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
of food for insects.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
And this one doesn't have anything for them.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
So it's deceiving on two levels --

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
fabulous.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
(Laughter)

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Here we see ylang ylang,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
the component of many perfumes.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
to any insect that'll have it.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
This one doesn't smell so good.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
This is a flower

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
that really, really smells pretty nasty

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and is designed, again, evolved,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
to look like carrion.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
So flies love this.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
They fly in and they pollinate.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.260
This, which is helicodiceros,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
is also known as dead horse arum.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
but this one probably smells pretty much like it.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
It's really horrible.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
And blowflies just can't help themselves.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
They fly into this thing,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
and they fly all the way down it.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
They lay their eggs in it,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
thinking it's a nice bit of carrion,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
because the bristles release

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and the flies disappear

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
Here's arum, arum maculatum,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
"lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
This thing heats up

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature --

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
amazing.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And if you look down into it,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
there's this sort of dam past the spadix,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
flies get attracted by the heat --

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges --

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
and they get trapped underneath in this container.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
They drink this fabulous nectar

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
and then they're all a bit sticky.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
At night they get covered in pollen,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
which showers down over them,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
and then the bristles that we saw above,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen --

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
fabulous thing.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
This is the philodendron selloum.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
This is the most amazing thing.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
That sort of phallic bit there

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
is about a foot long.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And it does something

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
that no other plant that I know of does,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
and that is that when it flowers --

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
that's the spadix in the middle there --

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
for a period of about two days,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
it metabolizes in a way

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
which is rather similar to mammals.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
So instead of having starch,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
which is the food of plants,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
it takes something rather similar to brown fat

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
and burns it at such a rate

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
that it's burning fat, metabolizing,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
about the rate of a small cat.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
than a hummingbird --

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
absolutely astonishing.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
This thing does something else which is unusual.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
but it keeps constant temperature.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
that keeps constant temperature.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
"Now why does it do this," I hear you ask.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Now wouldn't you know it,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.260
there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
And they get inside, and they get it all on.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
(Laughter)

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
And the plant showers them with pollen,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
and off they go and pollinate.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
And what a wonderful thing it is.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
Now most pollinators

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
that we think about are insects,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
but actually in the tropics,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
many birds and butterflies pollinate.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And many of the tropical flowers are red,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
and that's because butterflies and birds

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
see similarly to us, we think,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and can see the color red very well.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
But if you look at the spectrum,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
birds and us, we see red, green and blue

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
and see that spectrum.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
and they see various shades of ultraviolet.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
So there's something that goes on off the end there.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
"And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is," I hear you ask.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
Well yes we can.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
So what is an insect seeing?

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
helianthemum, in Dorset.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
These are little yellow flowers like we all see,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
little yellow flowers all over the place.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
And this is what it looks like with visible light.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Most bees don't perceive red.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
and took a very, very long exposure

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and this is what I got.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Now we don't know

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
exactly what a bee sees,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
any more than you know what I'm seeing

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
when I call this red.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's --

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
another human being's mind.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
But the contrast will look something like that,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
so standing out a lot from the background.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
Here's another little flower --

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
different range of ultraviolet frequencies,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
different filters

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
to match the pollinators.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
Just in case you think

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
that all yellow flowers have this property --

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
no flower was damaged in the process of this shot;

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
it was just attached to the tripod,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
not killed --

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
then under ultraviolet light,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
look at that.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
Finally, there's one of evening primrose

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me --

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
fantastic hidden pattern.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
And I love the idea of something hidden.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
I think there's something poetic here,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
the main use of that filter

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus --

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
actually the clouds of Venus.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
That's the main use of that filter.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
which is the flower story.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
trying to get pollinators to do their bidding,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
and give them to each other

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.260
at times of birth and death,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
and particularly at marriage,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
which, when you think of it,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
is the moment that encapsulates

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
the transfer of genetic material

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
from one organism to another.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
Thank you very much.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:42.260
(Applause)
