00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm going to tell you two things today:

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
One is what we have lost,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and two, a way to bring it back.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
And let me start with this.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
This is my baseline:

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
This is the Mediterranean coast

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
with no fish, bare rock

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Something like this is what I first saw

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
when I jumped in the water for the first time

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
in the Mediterranean coast off Spain.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Now, if an alien came to earth --

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
let's call him Joe --

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
what would Joe see?

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
If Joe jumped in a coral reef,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
there are many things the alien could see.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Very unlikely, Joe would jump

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
on a pristine coral reef,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
a virgin coral reef with lots of coral, sharks, crocodiles,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
manatees, groupers,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
turtles, etc.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
So, probably, what Joe would see

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
would be in this part, in the greenish part of the picture.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Here we have the extreme with dead corals,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
microbial soup and jellyfish.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And where the diver is,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
with very few corals, algae overgrowing the corals,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
lots of bacteria,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and where the large animals are gone.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And this is what most marine scientists have seen too.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
This is their baseline. This is what they think is natural

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
because we started modern science

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
with scuba diving long after

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
we started degrading marine ecosystems.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
So I'm going to get us all on a time machine,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and we're going to the left; we're going to go back to the past

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
to see what the ocean was like.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And let's start with this time machine, the Line Islands,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
where we have conducted a series

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
of National Geographic expeditions.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
that spans across the equator

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and it has several uninhabited,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
unfished, pristine islands

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and a few inhabited islands.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
So let's start with the first one: Christmas Island, over 5,000 people.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Most of the reefs are dead,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
most of the corals are dead -- overgrown by algae --

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and most of the fish are smaller than

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
the pencils we use to count them.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
We did 250 hours of diving here

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
in 2005.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
We didn't see a single shark.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
and he described a huge abundance of sharks

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
while they were going ashore.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Let's move the dial a little bit to the past.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Fanning Island, 2,500 people.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
The corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
This is what many divers would consider paradise.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
This is where you can see most

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And many people think this is really, really beautiful,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
if this is your baseline.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
If we go back to a place

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
like Palmyra Atoll,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
the corals are doing better and there are sharks.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
You can see sharks in every single dive.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
But then, if we shift the dial

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
200, 500 years back,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
then we get to the places where the corals

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
are absolutely healthy and gorgeous,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
forming spectacular structures,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
and where the predators

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
are the most conspicuous thing,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
What have we learned from these places?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
This is what we thought was natural.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
This is what we call the biomass pyramid.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
this is what we would expect.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Most of the biomass is low on the food chain, the herbivores,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
the parrotfish, the surgeonfish that eat the algae.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Then the plankton feeders, these little damselfish,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
the little animals floating in the water.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and a lower biomass of top head,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
or the sharks, the large snappers, the large groupers.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
But this is a consequence.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
This view of the world is a consequence

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
of having studied degraded reefs.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
When we went to pristine reefs,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
we realized that the natural world

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
was upside down;

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
this pyramid was inverted.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
The top head does account for most of the biomass,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
in some places up to 85 percent,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
like Kingman Reef, which is now protected.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
The good news is that, in addition to having more predators,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
there's more of everything.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
The size of these boxes is bigger.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
We have more sharks, more biomass of snappers,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
more biomass of herbivores, too,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
like these parrot fish that are like marine goats.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
They clean the reef; everything that grows enough to be seen,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
they eat, and they keep the reef clean

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and allow the corals to replenish.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Not only do these places --

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
these ancient, pristine places -- have lots of fish,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
but they also have other important components

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
of the ecosystem like the giant clams;

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
pavements of giant clams in the lagoons,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
up to 20, 25 per square meter.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and they filter the water;

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
they keep the water clean from

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
microbes and pathogens.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
But still, now we have global warming.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
If we don't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
or their remoteness, this is great.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
But the water gets warmer for too long

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and the corals die.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
So how are these fish,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
these predators going to help?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Well, what we have seen is that

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
in this particular area

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
during El Nino, year '97, '98,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
the water was too warm for too long,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and many corals bleached

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
and many died.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
In Christmas, where the food web is really trimmed down,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
where the large animals are gone,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
the corals have not recovered.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
In Fanning Island, the corals are not recovered.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
But you see here

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
a big table coral that died and collapsed.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And the fish have grazed the algae,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
so the turf of algae is a little lower.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Then you go to Palmyra Atoll

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
that has more biomass of herbivores,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and the dead corals are clean,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
and the corals are coming back.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
And when you go to the pristine side,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
did this ever bleach?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
These places bleached too, but they recovered faster.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
The more intact, the more complete,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
[and] the more complex your food web,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
the higher the resilience, [and] the more likely

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
that the system is going to recover

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
from the short-term impacts of warming events.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
And that's good news, so we need to recover that structure.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
so the ecosystem can adapt

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
to the effects of global warming.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
So if we have to reset the baseline,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
how can we do it?

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Well, there are several ways.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
One very clear way is the marine protected areas,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
especially no-take reserves

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
that we set aside

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
to allow for the recovery for marine life.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And let me go back to that image

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
of the Mediterranean.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
This was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And at the same time I was watching

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
Jacques Cousteau's shows on TV,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
with all this richness and abundance and diversity.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
And I thought that this richness

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
belonged to tropical seas,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
But, little did I know,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And this is what I saw, lots of fish.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
After a few years, between five and seven years,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
fish come back, they eat the urchins,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and then the algae grow again.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
So you have this little algal forest,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and in the size of a laptop

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
you can find more than 100 species of algae,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
mostly microscopic fit

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
hundreds of species of little animals

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
that then feed the fish,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
so that the system recovers.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
And this particular place, the Medes Islands Marine Reserve,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
is only 94 hectares,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
20 times more than fishing,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and it represents 88 percent

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
of all the tourist revenue.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
So these places not only help the ecosystem

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
but also help the people

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
who can benefit from the ecosystem.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
So let me just give you a summary

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
of what no-take reserves do.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
These places, when we protect them,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby, this is what happens.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
The number of species increases 21 percent;

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
so if you have 1,000 species

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
This is very substantial.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
The size of organisms increases a third,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
so your fish are now this big.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
The abundance, how many fish you have per square meter,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
increases almost 170 percent.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And the biomass -- this is the most spectacular change --

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
4.5 times greater biomass

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
on average, just after five to seven years.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
In some places up to 10 times

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
larger biomass inside the reserves.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
So we have all these things

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
inside the reserve that grow, and what do they do?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
They reproduce. That's population biology 101.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
If you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
they grow larger and they reproduce a lot.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
And same thing for invertebrates. This is the example.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
These are egg cases

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
laid by a snail off the coast of Chile,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Outside the reserve,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
you cannot even detect this.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
One point three million eggs per square meter

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
So these organisms reproduce,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
the little larvae juveniles spill over,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
they all spill over,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and then people can benefit from them outside too.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
This is in the Bahamas: Nassau grouper.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
and the closer you get to the reserve,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
the more fish you have.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
So the fishermen are catching more.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
You can see where the limits of the reserve are

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
because you see the boats lined up.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
So there is spill over;

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
that help people around them,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
while at the same time

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
the reserve is protecting

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
the entire habitat. It is building resilience.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
So what we have now --

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
or a world without reserves --

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
is like a debit account

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
where we withdraw all the time

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
and we never make any deposit.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Reserves are like savings accounts.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
We have this principal that we don't touch;

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
that produces returns,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
social, economic and ecological.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
this is like compound interest.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Two examples, again,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
of how these reserves can benefit people.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
This is how much fishermen get

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
everyday in Kenya, fishing

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
over a series of years,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
in a place where

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
there is no protection; it's a free-for-all.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
Once the most degrading fishing gear,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
seine nets, were removed,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
the fishermen were catching more.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
If you fish less, you're actually catching more.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
the fishermen are still making more money

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
by fishing less around an area that is protected.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
Another example:

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
This is grouper sex,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
and the groupers aggregate around the full moons

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
of December and January for a week.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
They used to aggregate up to the

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
tens of thousands, 30,000 groupers about this big

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
in one hectare, in one aggregation.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
Fishermen knew about these things; they caught them, and they depleted them.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
When I went there for the first time in 2000,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
there were only 3,000 groupers left.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
of the entire spawning population every year.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
So we did a simple analysis,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
and it doesn't take rocket science

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
to figure out that, if you take 30 percent every year,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
your fishery is going to collapse very quickly.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And with the fishery, the entire reproductive ability

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
of the species goes extinct.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
It happened in many places around the Caribbean.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And they would make 4,000 dollars per year,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
total, for the entire fishery,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
several fishing boats.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Now, if you do an economic analysis

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and project what would happen

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
if the fish were not cut,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
if we brought just 20 divers

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
one month per year,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
the revenue would be more than 20 times higher

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and that would be sustainable over time.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
So how much of this do we have?

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
If this is so good, if this is such a no-brainer, how much of this do we have?

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
And you already heard that

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
less than one percent of the ocean's protected.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
We're getting closer to one percent now,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
of the ocean should be protected.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
for a series of goals of biodiversity

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
and fishery enhancement and resilience.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
Now, is this possible? People would ask: How much would that cost?

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
Well, let's think about

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
how much we are paying now

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
to subsidize fishing:

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
35 billion dollars per year.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
Well, there are a couple estimates

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
of how much it would cost to create

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
a network of protected areas

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
covering 20 percent of the ocean

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
that would be only a fraction

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
of what we are now paying;

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
the government hands out to a fishery

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
that is collapsing.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
A creation of a network of reserves

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
would provide direct employment for more than a million people

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
So how can we do that?

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
If it's so clear that these savings accounts

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
are good for the environment and for people,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
why don't we have 20, 50 percent of the ocean?

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
And how can we reach that goal?

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
Well, there are two ways of getting there.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
like the Chagos Archipelago.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
The problem is that we can create these large reserves

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
only in places where there are no people, where there is no social conflict,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
where the political cost is really low

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
and the economic cost is also low.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
And a few of us, a few organizations in this room and elsewhere

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
are working on this.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
But what about the rest of the coast of the world,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
where people live and make a living out of fishing?

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Well, there are three main reasons why

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
we don't have tens of thousands of small reserves:

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
The first one is that people have no idea

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
what marine reserves do,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
and fishermen tend to be really, really defensive

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
when it comes to regulating or closing

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
an area, even if it's small.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Second, the governance is not right

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
because most coastal communities around the world

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
don't have the authority

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
It's a top down hierarchical structure

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
where people wait for

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
government agents to come

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
and this is not effective. And the government doesn't have enough resources.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
Which takes us to the third reason,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
why we don't have many more reserves,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
is that the funding models have been wrong.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
NGOs and governments

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
spend a lot of time and energy and resources

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
in a few small areas, usually.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
So marine conservation and coastal protection

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
has become a sink for government or philanthropic money,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
and this is not sustainable.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
So the solutions are just

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
fixing these three issues.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
First, we need to develop a global awareness campaign

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
to inspire local communities and governments

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
to create no-take reserves

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
that are better than what we have now.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
It's the savings accounts

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
versus the debit accounts with no deposits.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
Second, we need to redesign our governance

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
so conservation efforts can be decentralized,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
so conservation efforts don't depend on

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
work from NGOs

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
or from government agencies

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
and can be created by the local communities,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
And third, and very important,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
we need to develop new business models.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
is not sustainable.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
We really need to develop models, business models,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
where coastal conservation

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
is an investment,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
because we already know

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
that these marine reserves provide

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
social, ecological and economic benefits.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
And I'd like to finish with one thought,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
which is that no one

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
organization alone

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
is going to save the ocean.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
There has been a lot of competition in the past,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
and we need to develop

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
a new model of partnership,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
truly collaborative,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
where we are looking for complementing,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
not substituting.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
The stakes are just too high

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
to continue the way we are going.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
So let's do that. Thank you very much.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:38.260
(Applause)

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
Chris Anderson: Thank you Enric.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
Enric Sala: Thank you.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
CA: That was a masterful job

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
of pulling things together.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
First of all, your pyramid, your inverted pyramid,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
showing 85 percent biomass in the predators,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
that seems impossible.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
How could 85 percent

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
survive on 15 percent?

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
ES: Well, imagine that you have two gears

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
of a watch, a big one and a small one.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
The big one is moving very slowly, and the small one is moving fast.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
That's basically it.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
The animals at the lower parts of the food chain,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
they reproduce very fast; they grow really fast; they produce millions of eggs.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
Up there, you have sharks and large fish that live 25, 30 years.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
They reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism;

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
and, basically, they just maintain their biomass.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
So, basically, the production surplus of these guys down there

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
is enough to maintain this biomass

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
that is not moving.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.260
They are like capacitors of the system.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
CA: That's very fascinating.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
So, really, our picture of a food pyramid

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
is just -- we have to change that completely.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.260
ES: At least in the seas.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
is the equivalent of the Serengeti,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
with five lions per wildebeest.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
And on land, this cannot work.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
But at least on coral reefs are systems

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
where there is a bottom component with structure.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
We think this is universal.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260
But we have started studying pristine reefs

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
only very recently.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260
CA: So the numbers you presented really are astonishing.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
You're saying we're spending 35 billion dollars

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
now on subsidies.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
It would only cost 16 billion to set up

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
20 percent of the ocean as

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
marine protected areas

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
that actually give new living choices

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
to the fishermen as well.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
If the world was a smarter place,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
We've got 19 billion to spend on health care or something.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.260
ES: And then we have the under-performance of fisheries

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
that is 50 billion dollars.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
So again, one of the big solutions is

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.260
to sustainable practices.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
CA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
about ending this subsidies madness.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
So thank you for those numbers.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
The last one's a personal question.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
A lot of the experience of people here

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
who've been in the oceans for a long time

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.260
has just been seeing this degradation, the places they saw that were beautiful

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.260
getting worse, depressing.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.260
of going to these pristine areas

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
and seeing things coming back.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260
ES: It is a spiritual experience.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
We go there to try to understand the ecosystems,

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.260
to try to measure or count fish and sharks

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.260
and see how these places are different from the places we know.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.260
But the best feeling

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.260
is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.260
where humans have this sense of awe and wonder

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.260
in front of untamed nature, of raw nature.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
And there, only there,

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.260
you really feel that you are part of a larger thing

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.260
or of a larger global ecosystem.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.260
And if it were not for these places that show hope,

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.260
I don't think I could continue doing this job.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.260
It would be just too depressing.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.260
CA: Well, Enric, thank you so much for sharing

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.260
some of that spiritual experience with us all. Thank you.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.260
ES: Thank you very much.
