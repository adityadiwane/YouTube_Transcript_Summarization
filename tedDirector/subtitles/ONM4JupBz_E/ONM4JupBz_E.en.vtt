00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:18.190
In System D, this

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.237
is a store,

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:22.564
and what I mean by that is that this is a photograph

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:27.879
I took in Makoko, shantytown in Lagos, Nigeria.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.262
It's built over the lagoon, and there are no streets

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:32.078
where there can be stores to shop,

00:00:32.078 --> 00:00:33.968
and so the store comes to you.

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:35.753
And in the same community,

00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:37.505
this is business synergy.

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:41.611
This is the boat that that lady was paddling around in,

00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:44.351
and this artisan makes the boat and the paddles

00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:45.656
and sells directly

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:47.820
to the people who need the boat and the paddles.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.002
And this is a global business.

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:54.128
Ogandiro smokes fish in Makoko in Lagos,

00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:57.089
and I asked her, "Where does the fish come from?"

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.815
And I thought she'd say, "Oh, you know,

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:02.716
up the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa,"

00:01:02.716 --> 00:01:04.147
but you'll be happy to know she said

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.204
it came from here, it comes from the North Sea.

00:01:06.204 --> 00:01:08.530
It's caught here, frozen, shipped down to Lagos,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.617
smoked, and sold for a tiny increment of profit

00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:13.139
on the streets of Lagos.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.990
And this is a business incubator.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.692
This is Olusosun dump, the largest garbage dump in Lagos,

00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:21.763
and 2,000 people work here, and I found this out

00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:24.181
from this fellow, Andrew Saboru.

00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:28.341
Andrew spent 16 years scavenging materials on the dump,

00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:31.569
earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler,

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.179
which meant he carried a scale and went around and

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.403
weighed all the materials that people had scavenged

00:01:36.403 --> 00:01:39.426
from the dump. Now he's a scrap dealer.

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:41.827
That's his little depot behind him,

00:01:41.827 --> 00:01:46.338
and he earns twice the Nigerian minimum wage.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:48.600
This is a shopping mall.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.775
This is Oshodi Market in Lagos.

00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:53.121
Jorge Luis Borges had a story called "The Aleph,"

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.944
and the Aleph is a point in the world

00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:57.239
where absolutely everything exists,

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.584
and for me, this image is a point in the world

00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:02.048
where absolutely everything exists.

00:02:02.048 --> 00:02:04.897
So, what am I talking about when I talk about System D?

00:02:04.897 --> 00:02:07.196
It's traditionally called the informal economy,

00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:10.824
the underground economy, the black market.

00:02:10.824 --> 00:02:13.117
I don't conceive of it that way.

00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:15.874
I think it's really important to understand that something like

00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:20.354
this is totally open. It's right there for you to find.

00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:23.081
All of this is happening openly, and aboveboard.

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:25.603
There's nothing underground about it.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.985
It's our prejudgment that it's underground.

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:33.490
I've pirated the term System D from the former French colonies.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.586
There's a word in French that is débrouillardise,

00:02:36.586 --> 00:02:38.706
that means to be self-reliant,

00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:42.069
and the former French colonies have turned that into

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.626
System D for the economy of self-reliance,

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:47.884
or the DIY economy.

00:02:47.884 --> 00:02:51.013
But governments hate the DIY economy,

00:02:51.013 --> 00:02:54.257
and that's why -- I took this picture in 2007,

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:58.809
and this is the same market in 2009 --

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.115
and I think, when the organizers of this conference

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:02.542
were talking about radical openness,

00:03:02.542 --> 00:03:05.098
they didn't mean that the streets should be open

00:03:05.098 --> 00:03:06.841
and the people should be gone.

00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:10.784
I think what we have is a pickle problem.

00:03:10.784 --> 00:03:13.724
I had a friend who worked at a pickle factory,

00:03:13.724 --> 00:03:15.625
and the cucumbers would come flying down

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:19.628
this conveyer belt, and his job was to pick off the ones

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:21.977
that didn't look so good and throw them in the bin

00:03:21.977 --> 00:03:23.883
labeled "relish" where they'd be crushed and mixed

00:03:23.883 --> 00:03:27.209
with vinegar and used for other kinds of profit.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.520
This is the pickle economy.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.025
We're all focusing on — this is a statistic from

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:34.604
earlier this month in the Financial Times —

00:03:34.604 --> 00:03:38.147
we're all focusing on the luxury economy.

00:03:38.147 --> 00:03:40.890
It's worth 1.5 trillion dollars every year, and that's

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.634
a vast amount of money, right?

00:03:42.634 --> 00:03:45.882
That's three times the Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland.

00:03:45.882 --> 00:03:50.680
So it's vast. But it should come with an asterisk,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.873
and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers

00:03:54.873 --> 00:03:55.926
of the world.

00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:59.315
1.8 billion people around the world work

00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:04.851
in the economy that is unregulated and informal.

00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:08.131
That's a huge number, and what does that mean?

00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:12.884
Well, it means if it were united in a single political system,

00:04:12.884 --> 00:04:17.139
one country, call it

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.140
"The United Street Sellers Republic," the U.S.S.R.,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.973
or "Bazaaristan,"

00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:26.249
it would be worth 10 trillion dollars every year,

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.305
and that would make it the second largest economy

00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:30.786
in the world, after the United States.

00:04:30.786 --> 00:04:33.626
And given that projections are that the bulk

00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:37.291
of economic growth over the next 15 years will come

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:40.663
from emerging economies in the developing world,

00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:42.794
it could easily overtake the United States

00:04:42.794 --> 00:04:46.160
and become the largest economy in the world.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.695
So the implications of that are vast, because it means

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:53.218
that this is where employment is — 1.8 billion people —

00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:57.840
and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.811
because people are actually able to earn money and live

00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:04.806
and thrive, as Andrew Saboru did.

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:06.967
Big businesses have recognized this,

00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:08.946
and what's fascinating about this slide,

00:05:08.946 --> 00:05:11.204
it's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads

00:05:11.204 --> 00:05:13.719
and run around without dropping them off.

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.814
it's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that's made

00:05:16.814 --> 00:05:19.524
by a global company called UAC foods

00:05:19.524 --> 00:05:22.091
that's active throughout Africa and the Middle East,

00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:25.780
but the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.117
UAC foods has recognized that it won't sell if it's in stores.

00:05:29.117 --> 00:05:33.222
It's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkers

00:05:33.222 --> 00:05:36.035
who run around the streets of Lagos at bus stations

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:40.508
and in traffic jams and sell it as a snack,

00:05:40.508 --> 00:05:43.530
and it's been sold that way for 40 years.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.700
It's a business plan for a corporation.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.193
And it's not just in Africa.

00:05:48.193 --> 00:05:51.306
Here's Mr. Clean looking amorously at all the other

00:05:51.306 --> 00:05:53.226
Procter &amp; Gamble products,

00:05:53.226 --> 00:05:55.674
and Procter &amp; Gamble, you know,

00:05:55.674 --> 00:05:58.251
the statistic always cited is that Wal-Mart

00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:03.092
is their largest customer, and it's true, as one store,

00:06:03.107 --> 00:06:06.294
Wal-Mart buys 15 percent, thus 15 percent

00:06:06.294 --> 00:06:09.394
of Procter &amp; Gamble's business is with Wal-Mart,

00:06:09.394 --> 00:06:12.955
but their largest market segment is something that they call

00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:15.875
"high frequency stores," which is all these tiny kiosks

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:19.186
and the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses

00:06:19.186 --> 00:06:24.533
that exist in System D, the informal economy,

00:06:24.533 --> 00:06:27.931
and Procter &amp; Gamble makes 20 percent of its money

00:06:27.931 --> 00:06:29.980
from that market segment,

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.416
and it's the only market segment that's growing.

00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:36.524
So Procter &amp; Gamble says, "We don't care whether a store

00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:39.418
is incorporated or registered or anything like that.

00:06:39.418 --> 00:06:43.251
We want our products in that store."

00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:45.423
And then there's mobile phones.

00:06:45.423 --> 00:06:47.263
This is an ad for MTN,

00:06:47.263 --> 00:06:49.905
which is a South African multinational

00:06:49.905 --> 00:06:52.654
active in about 25 countries,

00:06:52.654 --> 00:06:54.215
and when they came into Nigeria —

00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:56.172
Nigeria is the big dog in Africa.

00:06:56.172 --> 00:06:58.496
One in seven Africans is a Nigerian,

00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:01.198
and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market

00:07:01.198 --> 00:07:03.232
in Nigeria. And when MTN came in, they wanted

00:07:03.232 --> 00:07:06.192
to sell the mobile service like I get in the United States

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:09.966
or like people get here in the U.K. or in Europe --

00:07:09.966 --> 00:07:13.855
expensive monthly plans, you get a phone,

00:07:13.855 --> 00:07:15.855
you pay overages,

00:07:15.855 --> 00:07:17.983
you're killed with fees --

00:07:17.983 --> 00:07:19.787
and their plan crashed and burned.

00:07:19.787 --> 00:07:21.827
And they went back to the drawing board, and they retooled,

00:07:21.827 --> 00:07:23.331
and they came up with another plan:

00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:25.517
We don't sell you the phone,

00:07:25.517 --> 00:07:27.347
we don't sell you the monthly plan.

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:30.483
We only sell you airtime.

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:32.396
And where's the airtime sold?

00:07:32.396 --> 00:07:36.489
It's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets,

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:40.213
where people are unregistered, unlicensed,

00:07:40.213 --> 00:07:42.918
but MTN makes most of its profits,

00:07:42.918 --> 00:07:45.605
perhaps 90 percent of its profits,

00:07:45.605 --> 00:07:50.267
from selling through System D, the informal economy.

00:07:50.267 --> 00:07:52.103
And where do the phones come from?

00:07:52.103 --> 00:07:54.977
Well, they come from here. This is in Guangzhou, China,

00:07:54.977 --> 00:07:58.413
and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy looking

00:07:58.413 --> 00:08:03.039
electronics mall, you find the Guangzhou Dashatou

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.912
second-hand trade center,

00:08:05.912 --> 00:08:09.096
and if you go in there, you follow the guys with the muscles

00:08:09.096 --> 00:08:11.758
who are carrying the boxes, and where are they going?

00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:14.575
They're going to Eddy in Lagos.

00:08:14.575 --> 00:08:17.279
Now, most of the phones there are not second-hand at all.

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:18.586
The name is a misnomer.

00:08:18.586 --> 00:08:21.494
Most of them are pirated. They have the name brand

00:08:21.494 --> 00:08:24.575
on them, but they're not manufactured by the name brand.

00:08:24.575 --> 00:08:27.231
Now, are there downsides to that?

00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:30.479
Well, I guess. You know, China has no —

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:33.771
(Laughter) — no intellectual property, right?

00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:35.672
Versace without the vowels.

00:08:35.672 --> 00:08:37.734
Zhuomani instead of Armani.

00:08:37.734 --> 00:08:42.741
S. Guuuci, and -- (Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:45.870
All around the world this is how products

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.390
are being distributed, so, for instance,

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.549
in one street market on Rua 25 de Março

00:08:51.549 --> 00:08:53.518
in São Paulo, Brazil,

00:08:53.518 --> 00:08:56.814
you can buy fake designer glasses.

00:08:56.814 --> 00:08:58.877
You can buy cloned cologne.

00:08:58.877 --> 00:09:01.652
You can buy pirated DVDs, of course.

00:09:01.652 --> 00:09:04.509
You can buy New York Yankees caps

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:07.715
in all sorts of unauthorized patterns.

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:10.804
You can buy cuecas baratas, designer underwear

00:09:10.804 --> 00:09:13.101
that isn't really manufactured by a designer,

00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:17.475
and even pirated evangelical mixtapes. (Laughter)

00:09:17.475 --> 00:09:20.229
Now, businesses tend to complain about this,

00:09:20.229 --> 00:09:23.768
and their, they, I don't want to take away from their

00:09:23.768 --> 00:09:25.806
entire validity of complaining about it,

00:09:25.806 --> 00:09:30.304
but I did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year

00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:33.201
what they thought about piracy,

00:09:33.201 --> 00:09:34.548
and they told me, "Well, you can't quote me on this,

00:09:34.548 --> 00:09:36.648
because if you quote me on this, I have to kill you,"

00:09:36.648 --> 00:09:42.352
but they use piracy as market research.

00:09:42.352 --> 00:09:45.576
The sneaker manufacturer told me that if

00:09:45.576 --> 00:09:49.263
they find that Pumas are being pirated, or Adidas

00:09:49.263 --> 00:09:52.549
are being pirated and their sneakers aren't being pirated,

00:09:52.549 --> 00:09:55.434
they know they've done something wrong. (Laughter)

00:09:55.434 --> 00:09:58.511
So it's very important to them to track piracy

00:09:58.511 --> 00:10:00.875
exactly because of this, and the people who are buying,

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:02.995
the pirates, are not their customers anyway,

00:10:02.995 --> 00:10:05.727
because their customers want the real deal.

00:10:05.727 --> 00:10:07.220
Now, there's another problem.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.552
This is a real street sign in Lagos, Nigeria.

00:10:10.552 --> 00:10:13.616
All of System D really doesn't pay taxes, right?

00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:15.421
And when I think about that, first of all I think that

00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:19.135
government is a social contract between the people and

00:10:19.135 --> 00:10:21.651
the government, and if the government isn't transparent,

00:10:21.651 --> 00:10:23.872
then the people aren't going to be transparent either,

00:10:23.872 --> 00:10:26.920
but also that we're blaming the little guy

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.857
who doesn't pay his taxes, and we're not recognizing

00:10:28.857 --> 00:10:31.630
that everyone's fudging things all over the world,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.663
including some extremely respected businesses,

00:10:35.663 --> 00:10:36.803
and I'll give you one example.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:40.954
There was one company that paid 4,000 bribes

00:10:40.954 --> 00:10:43.352
in the first decade of this millennium, and

00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:48.253
a million dollars in bribes every business day, right?

00:10:48.253 --> 00:10:50.548
All over the world. And that company

00:10:50.548 --> 00:10:53.454
was the big German electronics giant Siemens.

00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:57.332
So this goes on in the formal economy

00:10:57.332 --> 00:10:59.530
as well as the informal economy,

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.660
so it's wrong of us to blame — and I'm not singling out

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.379
Siemens, I'm saying everyone does it. Okay?

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:08.828
I just want to end by saying that if Adam Smith

00:11:08.828 --> 00:11:11.668
had framed out a theory of the flea market

00:11:11.668 --> 00:11:14.979
instead of the free market, what would be some

00:11:14.979 --> 00:11:16.988
of the principles?

00:11:16.988 --> 00:11:20.748
First, it would be to understand that it could be

00:11:20.748 --> 00:11:22.939
considered a cooperative, and this is a thought

00:11:22.939 --> 00:11:27.524
from the Brazilian legal scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger.

00:11:27.524 --> 00:11:30.117
Cooperative development is a way forward.

00:11:30.117 --> 00:11:34.795
Secondly, from the [Austrian] anarchist philosopher Paul Feyerabend,

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:39.083
facts are relative, and what is a massive right

00:11:39.083 --> 00:11:42.068
of self-reliance to a Nigerian businessperson

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:46.079
is considered unauthorized and horrible to other people,

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:48.096
and we have to recognize that there are differences

00:11:48.096 --> 00:11:50.153
in how people define things and what their facts are.

00:11:50.153 --> 00:11:53.253
And third is, and I'm taking this from

00:11:53.253 --> 00:11:56.533
the great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg,

00:11:56.533 --> 00:11:59.685
that alternate economies barter and

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:02.436
different kinds of currency, alternate currencies

00:12:02.436 --> 00:12:05.278
are also very important, and he talked about

00:12:05.278 --> 00:12:08.269
buying what he needed just with his good looks.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.900
And so I just want to leave you there, and say that

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.116
this economy is a tremendous force for global development

00:12:16.116 --> 00:12:18.083
and we need to think about it that way.

00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:21.099
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:12:21.099 --> 00:12:24.224
(Applause)
