00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.728
So, I'm an artist.

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:20.182
I live in New York, and I've been working in advertising

00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:22.827
for -- ever since I left school,

00:00:22.827 --> 00:00:24.448
so about seven, eight years now,

00:00:24.448 --> 00:00:26.004
and it was draining.

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.717
I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends,

00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:31.887
and I found myself never having time for all the projects

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:34.189
that I wanted to work on on my own.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:36.151
And one day I was at work and I saw a talk

00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:38.382
by Stefan Sagmeister on TED,

00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:40.037
and it was called "The power of time off,"

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:42.673
and he spoke about how every seven years,

00:00:42.673 --> 00:00:44.780
he takes a year off from work so he could

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.445
do his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired,

00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:51.834
and I just said, "I have to do that. I have to take a year off.

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:56.313
I need to take time to travel and spend time with my family

00:00:56.313 --> 00:00:58.599
and start my own creative ideas."

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:02.238
So the first of those projects ended up being

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:05.804
something I called "One Second Every Day."

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:08.138
Basically I'm recording one second of every day of my life

00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:10.873
for the rest of my life,

00:01:10.873 --> 00:01:13.810
chronologically compiling these one-second

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.112
tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video

00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:23.789
until, you know, I can't record them anymore.

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.146
The purpose of this project is, one:

00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:30.870
I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.580
There's all these things that I've done with my life

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.494
that I have no recollection of

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:37.210
unless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think,

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.781
"Oh yeah, that's something that I did."

00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:42.422
And something that I realized early on in the project

00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:45.146
was that if I wasn't doing anything interesting,

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:47.625
I would probably forget to record the video.

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:51.098
So the day -- the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me,

00:01:51.098 --> 00:01:53.573
because it's something that I really wanted to --

00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:55.769
from the moment that I turned 30, I wanted

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:59.119
to keep this project going until forever,

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.565
and having missed that one second, I realized,

00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:05.318
it just kind of created this thing in my head

00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:07.581
where I never forgot ever again.

00:02:10.858 --> 00:02:13.857
So if I live to see 80 years of age,

00:02:13.857 --> 00:02:16.490
I'm going to have a five-hour video

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.239
that encapsulates 50 years of my life.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.631
When I turn 40, I'll have a one-hour video

00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:26.868
that includes just my 30s.

00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:28.396
This has really

00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:31.671
invigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up,

00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:34.558
to try and do something interesting with my day.

00:02:42.017 --> 00:02:45.525
Now, one of the things that I have issues with is that,

00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:49.723
as the days and weeks and months go by,

00:02:49.723 --> 00:02:51.540
time just seems to start blurring

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.462
and blending into each other

00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:57.193
and, you know, I hated that,

00:02:57.193 --> 00:03:02.222
and visualization is the way to trigger memory.

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:13.141
You know, this project for me is a way for me

00:03:13.141 --> 00:03:16.435
to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done.

00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:19.002
Even just this one second allows me to remember

00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:21.279
everything else I did that one day.

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.941
It's difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.

00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:27.125
On a good day, I'll have maybe three or four seconds

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:28.838
that I really want to choose,

00:03:28.838 --> 00:03:30.987
but I'll just have to narrow it down to one,

00:03:30.987 --> 00:03:32.951
but even narrowing it down to that one allows me

00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.431
to remember the other three anyway.

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:38.972
It's also kind of a protest, a personal protest,

00:03:38.972 --> 00:03:41.367
against the culture we have now where people

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:43.809
just are at concerts with their cell phones out

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.958
recording the whole concert, and they're disturbing you.

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.193
They're not even enjoying the show.

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:50.298
They're watching the concert through their cell phone.

00:03:50.298 --> 00:03:54.266
I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit,

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:57.084
back in the day, and I've decided that the best way

00:03:57.084 --> 00:04:02.665
for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life

00:04:02.665 --> 00:04:05.751
and not be that person, is to just record that one second

00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:08.020
that will allow me to trigger that memory of,

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.395
"Yeah, that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert."

00:04:11.395 --> 00:04:16.813
And it just takes a quick, quick second.

00:04:16.813 --> 00:04:19.692
I was on a three-month road trip this summer.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:22.546
It was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life,

00:04:22.546 --> 00:04:25.039
just driving around the U.S. and Canada

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.278
and just figuring out where to go the next day,

00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:30.883
and it was kind of outstanding.

00:04:30.883 --> 00:04:34.595
I actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road trip

00:04:34.595 --> 00:04:37.585
for the savings that I had to take my year off,

00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:40.479
so I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some time

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.029
with friends working on a really neat project.

00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:55.131
One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family,

00:04:55.131 --> 00:04:58.541
and this really tragic thing happened where

00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:00.146
my sister-in-law,

00:05:00.146 --> 00:05:03.582
her intestine suddenly strangled one day,

00:05:03.582 --> 00:05:06.360
and we took her to the emergency room,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.652
and she was, she was in really bad shape.

00:05:09.652 --> 00:05:11.727
We almost lost her a couple of times,

00:05:11.727 --> 00:05:15.139
and I was there with my brother every day.

00:05:19.168 --> 00:05:21.944
It helped me realize something else during this project,

00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:28.459
is that recording that one second on a really bad day

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:29.692
is extremely difficult.

00:05:29.692 --> 00:05:34.889
It's not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things.

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.313
Or we're, "Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a picture."

00:05:37.313 --> 00:05:40.315
But we rarely do that when we're having a bad day,

00:05:40.315 --> 00:05:42.196
and something horrible is happening.

00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:45.616
And I found that it's actually been very, very important

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:49.160
to record even just that one second of a really bad moment.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.861
It really helps you appreciate the good times.

00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:57.148
It's not always a good day, so when you have a bad one,

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.046
I think it's important to remember it,

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:04.670
just as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.606
Now one of the things that I do is I don't use any filters,

00:06:15.606 --> 00:06:19.385
I don't use anything to -- I try to capture the moment

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:25.012
as much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes.

00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:27.747
I started a rule of first person perspective.

00:06:27.747 --> 00:06:29.820
Early on, I think I had a couple of videos where

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.033
you would see me in it, but I realized that wasn't the way to go.

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:35.880
The way to really remember what I saw

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.746
was to record it as I actually saw it.

00:06:47.797 --> 00:06:52.059
Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are,

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:58.034
wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this?

00:06:58.034 --> 00:07:04.289
I turned 31 last week, which is there.

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:06.017
I think it would be interesting to see

00:07:06.017 --> 00:07:07.865
what everyone did with a project like this.

00:07:07.865 --> 00:07:09.857
I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.

00:07:09.857 --> 00:07:14.595
I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.

00:07:14.595 --> 00:07:17.446
Personally, I'm tired of forgetting,

00:07:17.446 --> 00:07:20.017
and this is a really easy thing to do.

00:07:20.017 --> 00:07:22.886
I mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now --

00:07:22.886 --> 00:07:24.716
most people in this room, I bet --

00:07:24.716 --> 00:07:26.306
and it's something that's --

00:07:26.306 --> 00:07:28.564
I never want to forget another day that I've ever lived,

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:30.845
and this is my way of doing that,

00:07:30.845 --> 00:07:33.630
and it'd be really interesting also to see,

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.600
if you could just type in on a website,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.806
"June 18, 2018,"

00:07:38.806 --> 00:07:41.157
and you would just see a stream of people's lives

00:07:41.157 --> 00:07:42.851
on that particular day from all over the world.

00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:46.073
And I don't know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities,

00:07:46.073 --> 00:07:49.720
and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.567
so you can never forget that that day, you lived.

00:07:51.567 --> 00:07:53.271
Thank you.

00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:57.708
(Applause)
