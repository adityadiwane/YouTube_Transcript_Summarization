00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:14.230
So this is my niece.

00:00:14.644 --> 00:00:16.179
Her name is Yahli.

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:17.714
She is nine months old.

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:20.729
Her mum is a doctor,
and her dad is a lawyer.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.275
By the time Yahli goes to college,

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:26.552
the jobs her parents do
are going to look dramatically different.

00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:32.420
In 2013, researchers at Oxford University
did a study on the future of work.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.905
They concluded that almost one
in every two jobs have a high risk

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:38.753
of being automated by machines.

00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:42.293
Machine learning is the technology

00:00:42.317 --> 00:00:44.595
that's responsible for most
of this disruption.

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:47.409
It's the most powerful branch
of artificial intelligence.

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.315
It allows machines to learn from data

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.931
and mimic some of the things
that humans can do.

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:55.370
My company, Kaggle, operates
on the cutting edge of machine learning.

00:00:55.394 --> 00:00:57.780
We bring together
hundreds of thousands of experts

00:00:57.804 --> 00:01:00.922
to solve important problems
for industry and academia.

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:04.501
This gives us a unique perspective
on what machines can do,

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:05.760
what they can't do

00:01:05.784 --> 00:01:08.723
and what jobs they might
automate or threaten.

00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:12.866
Machine learning started making its way
into industry in the early '90s.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.014
It started with relatively simple tasks.

00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:19.521
It started with things like assessing
credit risk from loan applications,

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:23.598
sorting the mail by reading
handwritten characters from zip codes.

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:27.205
Over the past few years, we have made
dramatic breakthroughs.

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:31.502
Machine learning is now capable
of far, far more complex tasks.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.091
In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:38.304
to build an algorithm
that could grade high-school essays.

00:01:38.328 --> 00:01:40.932
The winning algorithms
were able to match the grades

00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:42.621
given by human teachers.

00:01:43.092 --> 00:01:46.076
Last year, we issued
an even more difficult challenge.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.053
Can you take images of the eye
and diagnose an eye disease

00:01:49.077 --> 00:01:50.771
called diabetic retinopathy?

00:01:51.164 --> 00:01:55.204
Again, the winning algorithms
were able to match the diagnoses

00:01:55.228 --> 00:01:57.053
given by human ophthalmologists.

00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:00.773
Now, given the right data,
machines are going to outperform humans

00:02:00.797 --> 00:02:01.962
at tasks like this.

00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:05.978
A teacher might read 10,000 essays
over a 40-year career.

00:02:06.407 --> 00:02:08.767
An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes.

00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:12.704
A machine can read millions of essays
or see millions of eyes

00:02:12.728 --> 00:02:14.004
within minutes.

00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:17.314
We have no chance of competing
against machines

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:19.659
on frequent, high-volume tasks.

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:24.389
But there are things we can do
that machines can't do.

00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:26.991
Where machines have made
very little progress

00:02:27.015 --> 00:02:28.869
is in tackling novel situations.

00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:32.792
They can't handle things
they haven't seen many times before.

00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:35.905
The fundamental limitations
of machine learning

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.323
is that it needs to learn
from large volumes of past data.

00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:41.101
Now, humans don't.

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:44.155
We have the ability to connect
seemingly disparate threads

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:46.417
to solve problems we've never seen before.

00:02:46.808 --> 00:02:51.219
Percy Spencer was a physicist
working on radar during World War II,

00:02:51.243 --> 00:02:54.256
when he noticed the magnetron
was melting his chocolate bar.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.265
He was able to connect his understanding
of electromagnetic radiation

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:59.773
with his knowledge of cooking

00:02:59.797 --> 00:03:03.055
in order to invent -- any guesses? --
the microwave oven.

00:03:03.444 --> 00:03:06.517
Now, this is a particularly remarkable
example of creativity.

00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:10.205
But this sort of cross-pollination
happens for each of us in small ways

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:12.057
thousands of times per day.

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:14.162
Machines cannot compete with us

00:03:14.186 --> 00:03:16.437
when it comes to tackling
novel situations,

00:03:16.461 --> 00:03:19.578
and this puts a fundamental limit
on the human tasks

00:03:19.602 --> 00:03:21.319
that machines will automate.

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:24.446
So what does this mean
for the future of work?

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:29.336
The future state of any single job lies
in the answer to a single question:

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.341
To what extent is that job reducible
to frequent, high-volume tasks,

00:03:34.365 --> 00:03:37.618
and to what extent does it involve
tackling novel situations?

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:42.010
On frequent, high-volume tasks,
machines are getting smarter and smarter.

00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:44.748
Today they grade essays.
They diagnose certain diseases.

00:03:44.772 --> 00:03:47.929
Over coming years,
they're going to conduct our audits,

00:03:47.953 --> 00:03:50.920
and they're going to read boilerplate
from legal contracts.

00:03:50.944 --> 00:03:52.941
Accountants and lawyers are still needed.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.647
They're going to be needed
for complex tax structuring,

00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:57.028
for pathbreaking litigation.

00:03:57.052 --> 00:03:58.769
But machines will shrink their ranks

00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:00.665
and make these jobs harder to come by.

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:01.840
Now, as mentioned,

00:04:01.864 --> 00:04:04.813
machines are not making progress
on novel situations.

00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:08.294
The copy behind a marketing campaign
needs to grab consumers' attention.

00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:10.033
It has to stand out from the crowd.

00:04:10.057 --> 00:04:12.501
Business strategy means
finding gaps in the market,

00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:14.281
things that nobody else is doing.

00:04:14.305 --> 00:04:18.423
It will be humans that are creating
the copy behind our marketing campaigns,

00:04:18.447 --> 00:04:21.964
and it will be humans that are developing
our business strategy.

00:04:21.988 --> 00:04:24.805
So Yahli, whatever you decide to do,

00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:27.190
let every day bring you a new challenge.

00:04:27.587 --> 00:04:30.396
If it does, then you will stay
ahead of the machines.

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:32.302
Thank you.

00:04:32.326 --> 00:04:35.430
(Applause)
