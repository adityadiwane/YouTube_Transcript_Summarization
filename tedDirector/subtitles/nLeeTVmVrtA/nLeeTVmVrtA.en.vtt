Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:16.468
I was born and raised in North Korea.

00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:21.268
Although my family constantly struggled against poverty,

00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:24.796
I was always loved and cared for first,

00:00:24.796 --> 00:00:26.947
because I was the only son

00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:30.117
and the youngest of two in the family.

00:00:30.117 --> 00:00:33.724
But then the great famine began in 1994.

00:00:33.724 --> 00:00:36.183
I was four years old.

00:00:36.183 --> 00:00:39.980
My sister and I would go searching for firewood

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.956
starting at 5 in the morning

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:44.762
and come back after midnight.

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:48.650
I would wander the streets searching for food,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.823
and I remember seeing a small child

00:00:50.823 --> 00:00:53.645
tied to a mother's back eating chips,

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:56.869
and wanting to steal them from him.

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.702
Hunger is humiliation. Hunger is hopelessness.

00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:04.905
For a hungry child, politics and freedom

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:07.657
are not even thought of.

00:01:07.657 --> 00:01:10.345
On my ninth birthday, my parents

00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:13.774
couldn't give me any food to eat.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:17.718
But even as a child, I could feel the heaviness

00:01:17.718 --> 00:01:20.753
in their hearts.

00:01:20.753 --> 00:01:25.953
Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time,

00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:29.664
and in 2003, when I was 13 years old,

00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:32.577
my father became one of them.

00:01:32.577 --> 00:01:36.465
I saw my father wither away and die.

00:01:36.465 --> 00:01:40.597
In the same year, my mother disappeared one day,

00:01:40.597 --> 00:01:42.402
and then my sister told me

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.003
that she was going to China to earn money,

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:49.198
but that she would return with money and food soon.

00:01:49.198 --> 00:01:52.149
Since we had never been separated,

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.119
and I thought we would be together forever,

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.992
I didn't even give her a hug when she left.

00:01:58.992 --> 00:02:03.205
It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life.

00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:04.916
But again, I didn't know

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:08.404
it was going to be a long goodbye.

00:02:08.404 --> 00:02:13.341
I have not seen my mom or my sister since then.

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:17.560
Suddenly, I became an orphan and homeless.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.649
My daily life became very hard,

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.701
but very simple.

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:26.724
My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash.

00:02:26.724 --> 00:02:29.631
But that is no way to survive.

00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:34.349
I started to realize, begging would not be the solution.

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.675
So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets.

00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:42.640
Sometimes, I found small jobs

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.970
in exchange for food.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.116
Once, I even spent two months in the winter

00:02:48.116 --> 00:02:49.859
working in a coal mine,

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.634
33 meters underground without any protection

00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:59.067
for up to 16 hours a day.

00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:01.431
I was not uncommon.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:08.992
Many other orphans survived this way, or worse.

00:03:08.992 --> 00:03:13.128
When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold

00:03:13.128 --> 00:03:14.595
or hunger pains,

00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:17.443
I hoped that, the next morning,

00:03:17.443 --> 00:03:20.006
my sister would come back to wake me up

00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:22.276
with my favorite food.

00:03:22.276 --> 00:03:25.426
That hope kept me alive.

00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:28.224
I don't mean big, grand hope.

00:03:28.224 --> 00:03:31.346
I mean the kind of hope that made me believe

00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:33.809
that the next trash can had bread,

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.942
even though it usually didn't.

00:03:36.942 --> 00:03:40.385
But if I didn't believe it, I wouldn't even try,

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:42.478
and then I would die.

00:03:42.478 --> 00:03:46.416
Hope kept me alive.

00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:49.176
Every day, I told myself,

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:51.904
no matter how hard things got,

00:03:51.904 --> 00:03:55.806
still I must live.

00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:59.936
After three years of waiting for my sister's return,

00:03:59.936 --> 00:04:04.288
I decided to go to China to look for her myself.

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:07.148
I realized

00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:10.798
I couldn't survive much longer this way.

00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:13.603
I knew the journey would be risky,

00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:16.500
but I would be risking my life either way.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.686
I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea,

00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:24.144
or at least I could try for a better life

00:04:24.144 --> 00:04:27.380
by escaping to China.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.610
I had learned that many people tried to cross

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.397
the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen.

00:04:35.397 --> 00:04:39.355
North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people

00:04:39.355 --> 00:04:42.728
trying to cross the border without permission.

00:04:42.728 --> 00:04:45.379
Chinese soldiers will catch

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.233
and send back North Koreans,

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:51.573
where they face severe punishment.

00:04:51.573 --> 00:04:54.654
I decided to cross during the day,

00:04:54.654 --> 00:05:00.087
first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark,

00:05:00.087 --> 00:05:04.736
second because I knew I was already taking a risk,

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:08.151
and since not many people tried to cross during the day,

00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:09.841
I thought I might be able to cross

00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:13.266
without being seen by anyone.

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:17.174
I made it to China on February 15, 2006.

00:05:17.174 --> 00:05:19.402
I was 16 years old.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.322
I thought things in China would be easier,

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.595
since there was more food.

00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:28.651
I thought more people would help me.

00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:32.664
But it was harder than living in North Korea,

00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:34.359
because I was not free.

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:37.104
I was always worried about being caught

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:39.899
and sent back.

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:43.170
By a miracle, some months later,

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.613
I met someone who was running

00:05:44.613 --> 00:05:47.955
an underground shelter for North Koreans,

00:05:47.955 --> 00:05:50.563
and was allowed to live there

00:05:50.563 --> 00:05:55.915
and eat regular meals for the first time in many years.

00:05:55.915 --> 00:06:00.396
Later that year, an activist helped me escape China

00:06:00.396 --> 00:06:04.617
and go to the United States as a refugee.

00:06:04.617 --> 00:06:07.917
I went to America without knowing a word of English,

00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:12.296
yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school.

00:06:12.296 --> 00:06:16.495
Even in North Korea, I was an F student.

00:06:16.495 --> 00:06:17.879
(Laughter)

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.586
And I barely finished elementary school.

00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:24.890
And I remember I fought in school more than once a day.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.828
Textbooks and the library were not my playground.

00:06:28.828 --> 00:06:32.573
My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying,

00:06:32.573 --> 00:06:35.124
but it didn't work.

00:06:35.124 --> 00:06:38.267
At one point, my father gave up on me.

00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:42.236
He said, "You're not my son anymore."

00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:46.988
I was only 11 or 12, but it hurt me deeply.

00:06:46.988 --> 00:06:49.649
But nevertheless, my level of motivation

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:54.356
still didn't change before he died.

00:06:54.356 --> 00:06:57.161
So in America, it was kind of ridiculous

00:06:57.161 --> 00:07:00.188
that they said I should go to high school.

00:07:00.188 --> 00:07:02.612
I didn't even go to middle school.

00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:05.996
I decided to go, just because they told me to,

00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:08.404
without trying much.

00:07:08.404 --> 00:07:11.817
But one day, I came home and my foster mother

00:07:11.817 --> 00:07:15.026
had made chicken wings for dinner.

00:07:15.026 --> 00:07:18.280
And during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.476
but I realized there were not enough for everyone,

00:07:21.476 --> 00:07:24.973
so I decided against it.

00:07:24.973 --> 00:07:27.298
When I looked down at my plate,

00:07:27.298 --> 00:07:32.434
I saw the last chicken wing, that my foster father had given me his.

00:07:32.434 --> 00:07:34.752
I was so happy.

00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:37.015
I looked at him sitting next to me.

00:07:37.015 --> 00:07:40.331
He just looked back at me very warmly,

00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:43.003
but said no words.

00:07:43.003 --> 00:07:47.847
Suddenly I remembered my biological father.

00:07:47.847 --> 00:07:50.820
My foster father's small act of love

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.041
reminded me of my father,

00:07:53.041 --> 00:07:56.041
who would love to share his food with me

00:07:56.041 --> 00:08:00.678
when he was hungry, even if he was starving.

00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:05.010
I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.477
yet my father died of starvation.

00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:12.680
My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.171
and that night I also thought of what else I could do

00:08:16.171 --> 00:08:18.387
to honor him.

00:08:18.387 --> 00:08:21.121
And my answer was to promise to myself

00:08:21.121 --> 00:08:24.551
that I would study hard and get the best education

00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:28.115
in America to honor his sacrifice.

00:08:28.115 --> 00:08:30.651
I took school seriously,

00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:33.451
and for the first time ever in my life,

00:08:33.451 --> 00:08:37.348
I received an academic award for excellence,

00:08:37.348 --> 00:08:42.962
and made dean's list from the first semester in high school.

00:08:42.962 --> 00:08:50.594
(Applause)

00:08:50.594 --> 00:08:53.324
That chicken wing changed my life.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:57.381
(Laughter)

00:08:57.381 --> 00:09:00.973
Hope is personal. Hope is something

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:03.482
that no one can give to you.

00:09:03.482 --> 00:09:06.402
You have to choose to believe in hope.

00:09:06.402 --> 00:09:09.569
You have to make it yourself.

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:12.809
In North Korea, I made it myself.

00:09:12.809 --> 00:09:15.522
Hope brought me to America.

00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:18.522
But in America, I didn't know what to do,

00:09:18.522 --> 00:09:23.554
because I had this overwhelming freedom.

00:09:23.554 --> 00:09:27.605
My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction,

00:09:27.605 --> 00:09:31.131
and he motivated me and gave me a purpose

00:09:31.131 --> 00:09:35.058
to live in America.

00:09:35.058 --> 00:09:38.178
I did not come here by myself.

00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:43.132
I had hope, but hope by itself is not enough.

00:09:43.132 --> 00:09:47.286
Many people helped me along the way to get here.

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:51.274
North Koreans are fighting hard to survive.

00:09:51.274 --> 00:09:54.063
They have to force themselves to survive,

00:09:54.063 --> 00:09:56.818
have hope to survive,

00:09:56.818 --> 00:10:01.579
but they cannot make it without help.

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:03.925
This is my message to you.

00:10:03.925 --> 00:10:06.634
Have hope for yourself,

00:10:06.634 --> 00:10:09.746
but also help each other.

00:10:09.746 --> 00:10:16.328
Life can be hard for everyone, wherever you live.

00:10:16.328 --> 00:10:20.114
My foster father didn't intend to change my life.

00:10:20.114 --> 00:10:24.486
In the same way, you may also change someone's life

00:10:24.486 --> 00:10:29.006
with even the smallest act of love.

00:10:29.006 --> 00:10:34.124
A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger,

00:10:34.124 --> 00:10:37.225
and having the hope will bring you bread

00:10:37.225 --> 00:10:39.510
to keep you alive.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.727
But I confidently believe that

00:10:42.727 --> 00:10:46.185
your act of love and caring

00:10:46.185 --> 00:10:49.589
can also save another Joseph's life

00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:55.031
and change thousands of other Josephs

00:10:55.031 --> 00:10:59.033
who are still having hope to survive.

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.340
Thank you.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:09.438
(Applause)

00:11:36.561 --> 00:11:39.386
Adrian Hong: Joseph, thank you for sharing

00:11:39.386 --> 00:11:42.568
that very personal and special story with us.

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:45.793
I know you haven't seen your sister for, you said,

00:11:45.793 --> 00:11:48.253
it was almost exactly a decade,

00:11:48.253 --> 00:11:50.670
and in the off chance that she may be able to see this,

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.497
we wanted to give you an opportunity

00:11:52.497 --> 00:11:54.725
to send her a message.

00:11:54.725 --> 00:11:55.861
Joseph Kim: In Korean?

00:11:55.861 --> 00:11:58.469
AH: You can do English, then Korean as well.

00:11:58.469 --> 00:12:02.377
(Laughter)

00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:04.718
JK: Okay, I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean

00:12:04.718 --> 00:12:07.459
because I don't think I can make it

00:12:07.459 --> 00:12:11.115
without tearing up.

00:12:11.115 --> 00:12:15.836
Nuna, it has been already 10 years

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:22.357
that I haven’t seen you.

00:12:22.357 --> 00:12:25.749
I just wanted to say

00:12:25.749 --> 00:12:29.933
that I miss you, and I love you,

00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:34.276
and please come back to me and stay alive.

00:12:34.276 --> 00:12:39.162
And I -- oh, gosh.

00:12:39.162 --> 00:12:43.482
I still haven't given up my hope to see you.

00:12:45.591 --> 00:12:50.253
I will live my life happily

00:12:50.253 --> 00:12:53.572
and study hard

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.649
until I see you,

00:12:55.649 --> 00:13:00.228
and I promise I will not cry again.

00:13:00.228 --> 00:13:01.785
(Laughter)

00:13:01.785 --> 00:13:04.373
Yes, I'm just looking forward to seeing you,

00:13:04.373 --> 00:13:06.644
and if you can't find me,

00:13:06.644 --> 00:13:09.716
I will also look for you,

00:13:09.716 --> 00:13:12.452
and I hope to see you one day.

00:13:12.452 --> 00:13:15.788
And can I also make a small message to my mom?

00:13:15.788 --> 00:13:17.439
AH: Sure, please.

00:13:17.439 --> 00:13:20.228
JK: I haven't spent much time with you,

00:13:20.228 --> 00:13:22.140
but I know that you still love me,

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.084
and you probably still pray for me

00:13:25.084 --> 00:13:28.204
and think about me.

00:13:28.204 --> 00:13:30.356
I just wanted to say thank you

00:13:30.356 --> 00:13:33.890
for letting me be in this world.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:35.359
Thank you.

00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:40.683
(Applause)
