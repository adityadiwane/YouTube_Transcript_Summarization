00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.756
This story begins in 1985,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.756
when at age 22,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.156
I became the World Chess Champion

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.380
after beating Anatoly Karpov.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.556
Earlier that year,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.196
I played what is called
simultaneous exhibition

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.516
against 32 of the world's
best chess-playing machines

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.900
in Hamburg, Germany.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.180
I won all the games,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.556
and then it was not considered
much of a surprise

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.620
that I could beat 32 computers
at the same time.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.876
To me, that was the golden age.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.996
(Laughter)

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.540
Machines were weak,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.836
and my hair was strong.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.060
(Laughter)

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.596
Just 12 years later,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.236
I was fighting for my life
against just one computer

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.460
in a match

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.236
called by the cover of "Newsweek"

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.036
"The Brain's Last Stand."

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.276
No pressure.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.820
(Laughter)

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.436
From mythology to science fiction,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.196
human versus machine

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.980
has been often portrayed
as a matter of life and death.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.356
John Henry,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.076
called the steel-driving man

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.876
in the 19th century
African American folk legend,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.276
was pitted in a race

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.036
against a steam-powered hammer

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.420
bashing a tunnel through mountain rock.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.820
John Henry's legend
is a part of a long historical narrative

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.580
pitting humanity versus technology.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.900
And this competitive rhetoric
is standard now.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.340
We are in a race against the machines,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.260
in a fight or even in a war.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.316
Jobs are being killed off.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.900
People are being replaced
as if they had vanished from the Earth.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.556
It's enough to think that the movies
like "The Terminator" or "The Matrix"

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.780
are nonfiction.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.780
There are very few instances of an arena

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.436
where the human body and mind
can compete on equal terms

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.300
with a computer or a robot.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.958
Actually, I wish there were a few more.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.780
Instead,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.316
it was my blessing and my curse

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.036
to literally become the proverbial man

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.156
in the man versus machine competition

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.060
that everybody is still talking about.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.956
In the most famous human-machine
competition since John Henry,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.556
I played two matches

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.020
against the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.036
Nobody remembers
that I won the first match --

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.396
(Laughter)

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.820
(Applause)

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.716
In Philadelphia, before losing the rematch
the following year in New York.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.500
But I guess that's fair.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.236
There is no day in history,
special calendar entry

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.756
for all the people
who failed to climb Mt. Everest

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.516
before Sir Edmund Hillary
and Tenzing Norgay

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.740
made it to the top.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.540
And in 1997, I was still
the world champion

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.540
when chess computers finally came of age.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.316
I was Mt. Everest,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.940
and Deep Blue reached the summit.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.476
I should say of course,
not that Deep Blue did it,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.636
but its human creators --

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.996
Anantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.220
Hats off to them.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.076
As always, machine's triumph
was a human triumph,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.860
something we tend to forget when humans
are surpassed by our own creations.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.620
Deep Blue was victorious,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.420
but was it intelligent?

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.940
No, no it wasn't,

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.076
at least not in the way Alan Turing
and other founders of computer science

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.300
had hoped.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.836
It turned out that chess
could be crunched by brute force,

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.116
once hardware got fast enough

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.100
and algorithms got smart enough.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.276
Although by the definition of the output,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.516
grandmaster-level chess,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.820
Deep Blue was intelligent.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.540
But even at the incredible speed,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.580
200 million positions per second,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.380
Deep Blue's method

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.780
provided little of the dreamed-of insight
into the mysteries of human intelligence.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.596
Soon,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.196
machines will be taxi drivers

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.636
and doctors and professors,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.260
but will they be "intelligent?"

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.156
I would rather leave these definitions

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.740
to the philosophers and to the dictionary.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.140
What really matters is how we humans

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.740
feel about living and working
with these machines.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.236
When I first met Deep Blue
in 1996 in February,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.860
I had been the world champion
for more than 10 years,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.916
and I had played 182
world championship games

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.036
and hundreds of games against
other top players in other competitions.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.116
I knew what to expect from my opponents

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.820
and what to expect from myself.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.676
I was used to measure their moves

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.316
and to gauge their emotional state

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.180
by watching their body language
and looking into their eyes.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.700
And then I sat across
the chessboard from Deep Blue.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.636
I immediately sensed something new,

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.980
something unsettling.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.060
You might experience a similar feeling

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.676
the first time you ride
in a driverless car

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.540
or the first time your new computer
manager issues an order at work.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.740
But when I sat at that first game,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.036
I couldn't be sure

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.740
what is this thing capable of.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.900
Technology can advance in leaps,
and IBM had invested heavily.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.700
I lost that game.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.916
And I couldn't help wondering,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.500
might it be invincible?

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.780
Was my beloved game of chess over?

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.756
These were human doubts, human fears,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.460
and the only thing I knew for sure

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.116
was that my opponent Deep Blue
had no such worries at all.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.900
(Laughter)

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.140
I fought back

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.900
after this devastating blow

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.020
to win the first match,

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.420
but the writing was on the wall.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.356
I eventually lost to the machine

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.436
but I didn't suffer the fate of John Henry

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.500
who won but died
with his hammer in his hand.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.076
It turned out that the world of chess

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.340
still wanted to have
a human chess champion.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.420
And even today,

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.356
when a free chess app
on the latest mobile phone

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.396
is stronger than Deep Blue,

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.900
people are still playing chess,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.740
even more than ever before.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.836
Doomsayers predicted
that nobody would touch the game

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.116
that could be conquered by the machine,

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.356
and they were wrong, proven wrong,

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.836
but doomsaying has always been
a popular pastime

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.220
when it comes to technology.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.916
What I learned from my own experience

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.596
is that we must face our fears

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.340
if we want to get the most
out of our technology,

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.556
and we must conquer those fears

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.820
if we want to get the best
out of our humanity.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.715
While licking my wounds,

00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:51.700
I got a lot of inspiration

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.595
from my battles against Deep Blue.

00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:58.740
As the old Russian saying goes,
if you can't beat them, join them.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.076
Then I thought,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.436
what if I could play with a computer --

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.620
together with a computer at my side,
combining our strengths,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.756
human intuition
plus machine's calculation,

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.476
human strategy, machine tactics,

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.916
human experience, machine's memory.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.140
Could it be the perfect game ever played?

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.500
My idea came to life

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.116
in 1998 under the name of Advanced Chess

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.820
when I played this human-plus-machine
competition against another elite player.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.996
But in this first experiment,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:43.380
we both failed to combine
human and machine skills effectively.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.980
Advanced Chess found
its home on the internet,

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.836
and in 2005, a so-called
freestyle chess tournament

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.220
produced a revelation.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.596
A team of grandmasters
and top machines participated,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.356
but the winners were not grandmasters,

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.740
not a supercomputer.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.836
The winners were a pair
of amateur American chess players

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.020
operating three ordinary PCs
at the same time.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.396
Their skill of coaching their machines

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:26.196
effectively counteracted
the superior chess knowledge

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.796
of their grandmaster opponents

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.980
and much greater
computational power of others.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.380
And I reached this formulation.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.756
A weak human player plus a machine

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.036
plus a better process is superior

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.476
to a very powerful machine alone,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.396
but more remarkably,
is superior to a strong human player

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.380
plus machine

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.340
and an inferior process.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.300
This convinced me that we would need

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.500
better interfaces
to help us coach our machines

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.060
towards more useful intelligence.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.436
Human plus machine isn't the future,

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.676
it's the present.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.836
Everybody that's used online translation

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.156
to get the gist of a news article
from a foreign newspaper,

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.820
knowing its far from perfect.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.596
Then we use our human experience

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.716
to make sense out of that,

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.516
and then the machine
learns from our corrections.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.500
This model is spreading and investing
in medical diagnosis, security analysis.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.380
The machine crunches data,

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.876
calculates probabilities,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.556
gets 80 percent of the way, 90 percent,

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.956
making it easier for analysis

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.580
and decision-making of the human party.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.940
But you are not going to send your kids

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.380
to school in a self-driving car
with 90 percent accuracy,

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.020
even with 99 percent.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.236
So we need a leap forward

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:16.420
to add a few more crucial decimal places.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:23.020
Twenty years after
my match with Deep Blue,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.636
second match,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:31.956
this sensational
"The Brain's Last Stand" headline

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.556
has become commonplace

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.116
as intelligent machines

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.340
move

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.580
in every sector, seemingly every day.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.076
But unlike in the past,

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.740
when machines replaced

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.676
farm animals, manual labor,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.196
now they are coming
after people with college degrees

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.500
and political influence.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.036
And as someone
who fought machines and lost,

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.700
I am here to tell you
this is excellent, excellent news.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.036
Eventually, every profession

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.156
will have to feel these pressures

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:12.780
or else it will mean humanity
has ceased to make progress.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.780
We don't

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.980
get to choose

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.020
when and where
technological progress stops.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.340
We cannot

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.276
slow down.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.116
In fact,

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.060
we have to speed up.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.060
Our technology excels at removing

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.380
difficulties and uncertainties
from our lives,

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.636
and so we must seek out

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.516
ever more difficult,

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.620
ever more uncertain challenges.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.220
Machines have

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.516
calculations.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.116
We have understanding.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.180
Machines have instructions.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.516
We have purpose.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.820
Machines have

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.116
objectivity.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.340
We have passion.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:26.396
We should not worry
about what our machines can do today.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.996
Instead, we should worry
about what they still cannot do today,

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:36.516
because we will need the help
of the new, intelligent machines

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.620
to turn our grandest dreams into reality.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.140
And if we fail,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.716
if we fail, it's not because our machines
are too intelligent,

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.140
or not intelligent enough.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.100
If we fail, it's because
we grew complacent

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.060
and limited our ambitions.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.380
Our humanity is not defined by any skill,

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.780
like swinging a hammer
or even playing chess.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.396
There's one thing only a human can do.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.620
That's dream.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.476
So let us dream big.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.716
Thank you.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.627
(Applause)
