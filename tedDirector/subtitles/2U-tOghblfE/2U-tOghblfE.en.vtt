00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
For me, this story begins about 15 years ago,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
when I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And I was taking care of people who were dying and their families

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
in the South Side of Chicago.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And I was observing what happened to people and their families

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
over the course of their terminal illness.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And in my lab, I was studying the widower effect,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
which is a very old idea in the social sciences,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
going back 150 years,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
known as "dying of a broken heart."

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
So, when I die, my wife's risk of death can double,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
for instance, in the first year.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And I had gone to take care of one particular patient,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
a woman who was dying of dementia.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And in this case, unlike this couple,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
she was being cared for

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
by her daughter.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And the daughter's husband,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
he also was sick

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
from his wife's exhaustion.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And I was driving home one day,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and I get a phone call from the husband's friend,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
calling me because he was depressed

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
about what was happening to his friend.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
So here I get this call from this random guy

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
that's having an experience

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
that's being influenced by people

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
at some social distance.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And so I suddenly realized two very simple things:

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
First, the widowhood effect

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
was not restricted to husbands and wives.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
And second, it was not restricted to pairs of people.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And I started to see the world

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
in a whole new way,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
like pairs of people connected to each other.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And then I realized that these individuals

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And then, in fact, these people

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
were embedded in other sorts of relationships:

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
marriage and spousal

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and friendship and other sorts of ties.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And that, in fact, these connections were vast

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and that we were all embedded in this

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
broad set of connections with each other.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So I started to see the world in a completely new way

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and I became obsessed with this.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I became obsessed with how it might be

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
that we're embedded in these social networks,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and how they affect our lives.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
So, social networks are these intricate things of beauty,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and they're so elaborate and so complex

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and so ubiquitous, in fact,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
that one has to ask what purpose they serve.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Why are we embedded in social networks?

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
I mean, how do they form? How do they operate?

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And how do they effect us?

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
So my first topic with respect to this,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
was not death, but obesity.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
It had become trendy

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
to speak about the "obesity epidemic."

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And, along with my collaborator, James Fowler,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
and could it spread from person to person

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
like the four people I discussed earlier.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
So this is a slide of some of our initial results.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
It's 2,200 people in the year 2000.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Every dot is a person. We make the dot size

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
proportional to people's body size;

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
so bigger dots are bigger people.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
In addition, if your body size,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
if your BMI, your body mass index, is above 30 --

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
if you're clinically obese --

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
we also colored the dots yellow.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
So, if you look at this image, right away you might be able to see

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
that there are clusters of obese and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
non-obese people in the image.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
But the visual complexity is still very high.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
It's not obvious exactly what's going on.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
In addition, some questions are immediately raised:

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
How much clustering is there?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone?

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
How big are the clusters? How far do they reach?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And, most importantly,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
what causes the clusters?

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
So we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
This here shows, on the Y-axis,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
the increase in the probability that a person is obese

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
given that a social contact of theirs is obese

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and, on the X-axis, the degrees of separation between the two people.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
On the far left, you see the purple line.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
It says that, if your friends are obese,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
your risk of obesity is 45 percent higher.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And the next bar over, the [red] line,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
says if your friend's friends are obese,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
And then the next line over says

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
if your friend's friend's friend, someone you probably don't even know, is obese,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
that there's no longer a relationship

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
between that person's body size and your own body size.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Well, what might be causing this clustering?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
There are at least three possibilities:

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
One possibility is that, as I gain weight,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
it causes you to gain weight.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
A kind of induction, a kind of spread from person to person.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Another possibility, very obvious, is homophily,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
or, birds of a feather flock together;

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
here, I form my tie to you

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
because you and I share a similar body size.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And the last possibility is what is known as confounding,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
And here, the idea is not that my weight gain

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
is causing your weight gain,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
nor that I preferentially form a tie with you

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
because you and I share the same body size,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
but rather that we share a common exposure

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
to something, like a health club

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
that makes us both lose weight at the same time.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
When we studied these data, we found evidence for all of these things,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
including for induction.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And we found that if your friend becomes obese,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
in the same given time period.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
There can be many mechanisms for this effect:

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
One possibility is that your friends say to you something like --

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
you know, they adopt a behavior that spreads to you --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
like, they say, "Let's go have muffins and beer,"

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
which is a terrible combination. (Laughter)

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
But you adopt that combination,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and then you start gaining weight like them.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Another more subtle possibility

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
is that they start gaining weight, and it changes your ideas

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
of what an acceptable body size is.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Here, what's spreading from person to person

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
is not a behavior, but rather a norm:

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
An idea is spreading.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Now, headline writers

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
had a field day with our studies.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
I think the headline in The New York Times was,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
"Are you packing it on?

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Blame your fat friends." (Laughter)

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
What was interesting to us is that the European headline writers

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
had a different take: They said,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
"Are your friends gaining weight? Perhaps you are to blame."

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.260
(Laughter)

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
And we thought this was a very interesting comment on America,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
and a kind of self-serving,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
"not my responsibility" kind of phenomenon.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Now, I want to be very clear: We do not think our work

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
should or could justify prejudice

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
against people of one or another body size at all.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
Our next questions was:

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Could we actually visualize this spread?

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
Was weight gain in one person actually spreading

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
to weight gain in another person?

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
And this was complicated because

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
the architecture of the ties, was changing across time.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
In addition, because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
there's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic --

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
if we find that guy, there was a spread of obesity out from him --

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
it's a multicentric epidemic.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Lots of people are doing things at the same time.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
And I'm about to show you a 30 second video animation

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
that took me and James five years of our lives to do.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
So, again, every dot is a person.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Every tie between them is a relationship.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
We're going to put this into motion now,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
taking daily cuts through the network for about 30 years.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
The dot sizes are going to grow,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
you're going to see a sea of yellow take over.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
You're going to see people be born and die --

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
dots will appear and disappear --

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
ties will form and break, marriages and divorces,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
friendings and defriendings.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
A lot of complexity, a lot is happening

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
just in this 30-year period

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
that includes the obesity epidemic.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And, by the end, you're going to see clusters

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
of obese and non-obese individuals

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
within the network.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
Now, when looked at this,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
it changed the way I see things,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
because this thing, this network

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
that's changing across time,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
it has a memory, it moves,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
things flow within it,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
it has a kind of consistency --

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
people can die, but it doesn't die;

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
it still persists --

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
and it has a kind of resilience

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
that allows it to persist across time.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And so, I came to see these kinds of social networks

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
as living things,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
to study and analyze and understand.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
And we used a variety of techniques to do this.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
We looked at smoking and drinking behavior,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
and voting behavior,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and divorce -- which can spread --

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and altruism.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
And, eventually, we became interested in emotions.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Now, when we have emotions,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
we show them.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
Why do we show our emotions?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
I mean, there would be an advantage to experiencing

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
our emotions inside, you know, anger or happiness.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
But we don't just experience them, we show them.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
And not only do we show them, but others can read them.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
And, not only can they read them, but they copy them.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
There's emotional contagion

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
that takes place in human populations.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
And so this function of emotions

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
suggests that, in addition to any other purpose they serve,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
they're a kind of primitive form of communication.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And that, in fact, if we really want to understand human emotions,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
we need to think about them in this way.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
Now, we're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
in simple, sort of, brief periods of time.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
So, for example,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
I was giving this talk recently in New York City,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
and I said, "You know when you're on the subway

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
and the other person across the subway car

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
smiles at you,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and you just instinctively smile back?"

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
And they looked at me and said, "We don't do that in New York City." (Laughter)

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
And I said, "Everywhere else in the world,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
that's normal human behavior."

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
And so there's a very instinctive way

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
And, in fact, emotional contagion can be broader still.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
as in riots.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
The question that we wanted to ask was:

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
Could emotion spread,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
in a more sustained way than riots, across time

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and involve large numbers of people,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car?

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Maybe there's a kind of below the surface, quiet riot

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
that animates us all the time.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Maybe there are emotional stampedes

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
that ripple through social networks.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Maybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
not just an individual existence.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
And this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Again, a social network,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
but now we color the people yellow if they're happy

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
and blue if they're sad and green in between.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
And if you look at this image, you can right away see

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
clusters of happy and unhappy people,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
again, spreading to three degrees of separation.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
And you might form the intuition

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
that the unhappy people

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
occupy a different structural location within the network.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
There's a middle and an edge to this network,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
and the unhappy people seem to be

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
located at the edges.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
So to invoke another metaphor,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
if you imagine social networks as a kind of

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
vast fabric of humanity --

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
I'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance --

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
this fabric is actually like

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
an old-fashioned American quilt,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
and it has patches on it: happy and unhappy patches.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
And whether you become happy or not

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
(Laughter)

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
So, this work with emotions,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
which are so fundamental,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
then got us to thinking about: Maybe

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
the fundamental causes of human social networks

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
are somehow encoded in our genes.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
Because human social networks, whenever they are mapped,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
always kind of look like this:

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
the picture of the network.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
But they never look like this.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
Why do they not look like this?

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Why don't we form human social networks

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
that look like a regular lattice?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Well, the striking patterns of human social networks,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
their ubiquity and their apparent purpose

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
beg questions about whether we evolved to have

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
human social networks in the first place,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
and whether we evolved to form networks

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
with a particular structure.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
And notice first of all -- so, to understand this, though,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
we need to dissect network structure a little bit first --

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
and notice that every person in this network

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
has exactly the same structural location as every other person.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
But that's not the case with real networks.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
So, for example, here is a real network of college students

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
at an elite northeastern university.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
And now I'm highlighting a few dots.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
If you look here at the dots,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
compare node B in the upper left

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
to node D in the far right;

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
B has four friends coming out from him

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
and D has six friends coming out from him.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
And so, those two individuals have different numbers of friends.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
That's very obvious, we all know that.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
But certain other aspects

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
of social network structure are not so obvious.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Compare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Now, those people both have four friends,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
but A's friends all know each other,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
and B's friends do not.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
So the friend of a friend of A's

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
is, back again, a friend of A's,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
whereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
but is farther away in the network.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
This is known as transitivity in networks.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And, finally, compare nodes C and D:

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
C and D both have six friends.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
If you talk to them, and you said, "What is your social life like?"

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
they would say, "I've got six friends.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
That's my social experience."

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
But now we, with a bird's eye view looking at this network,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
can see that they occupy very different social worlds.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you:

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Who would you rather be

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
if a deadly germ was spreading through the network?

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Would you rather be C or D?

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
You'd rather be D, on the edge of the network.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
And now who would you rather be

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you --

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
was spreading through the network? (Laughter)

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
Now, you would rather be C.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
So different structural locations

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
have different implications for your life.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
And, in fact, when we did some experiments looking at this,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
what we found is that 46 percent of the variation

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
in how many friends you have

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
is explained by your genes.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
And this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
and some are born gregarious. That's obvious.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
But we also found some non-obvious things.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
For instance, 47 percent in the variation

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
in whether your friends know each other

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
is attributable to your genes.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Whether your friends know each other

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
has not just to do with their genes, but with yours.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
And we think the reason for this is that some people

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
like to introduce their friends to each other -- you know who you are --

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
And so some people knit together the networks around them,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
creating a kind of dense web of ties

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
in which they're comfortably embedded.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And finally, we even found that

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
30 percent of the variation

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
can also be attributed to their genes.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
So whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
is also partially heritable.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Now, what is the point of this?

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
How does this help us understand?

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
How does this help us

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days?

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Well, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
They are a kind of social capital.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
New properties emerge

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
because of our embeddedness in social networks,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and these properties inhere

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
in the structure of the networks,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
not just in the individuals within them.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
So think about these two common objects.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
They're both made of carbon,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left --

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
and you get graphite, which is soft and dark.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
But if you take the same carbon atoms

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
and interconnect them a different way,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
you get diamond, which is clear and hard.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
do not reside in the carbon atoms;

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
or at least arise because of the

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
interconnections between the carbon atoms.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
So, similarly, the pattern of connections among people

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
confers upon the groups of people

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
different properties.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
It is the ties between people

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
And so it is not just what's happening to these people --

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
whether they're losing weight or gaining weight, or becoming rich or becoming poor,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
or becoming happy or not becoming happy -- that affects us;

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
it's also the actual architecture

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
of the ties around us.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
Our experience of the world

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
depends on the actual structure

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
of the networks in which we're residing

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
through the network.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Now, the reason, I think, that this is the case

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
is that human beings assemble themselves

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
and form a kind of superorganism.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
Now, a superorganism is a collection of individuals

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
which show or evince behaviors or phenomena

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
that are not reducible to the study of individuals

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
and that must be understood by reference to,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
and by studying, the collective.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
Like, for example, a hive of bees

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
that's finding a new nesting site,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
or a flock of birds that's evading a predator,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
and navigate and find a tiny speck

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
of an island in the middle of the Pacific,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
or a pack of wolves that's able

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
to bring down larger prey.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
Superorganisms have properties

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
I think understanding social networks

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
and how they form and operate

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
can help us understand not just health and emotions

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
but all kinds of other phenomena --

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
like crime, and warfare,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
and economic phenomena like bank runs

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
and market crashes

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
and the adoption of innovation

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
and the spread of product adoption.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
Now, look at this.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
I think we form social networks

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
because the benefits of a connected life

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
outweigh the costs.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
If I was always violent towards you

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
or gave you misinformation

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
you would cut the ties to me,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
and the network would disintegrate.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
So the spread of good and valuable things

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
is required to sustain and nourish social networks.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
Similarly, social networks are required

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
for the spread of good and valuable things,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
like love and kindness

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
and happiness and altruism

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
and ideas.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
I think, in fact, that if we realized

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
how valuable social networks are,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
we'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
because I think social networks

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
are fundamentally related to goodness.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
And what I think the world needs now

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
is more connections.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
Thank you.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
(Applause)
