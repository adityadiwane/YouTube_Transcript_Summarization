00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'd like to ask you,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.260
what do these three people have in common?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Well, you probably recognize the first person.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
I'm sure you're all avid "American Idol" watchers.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
who is a contestant, indeed a finalist,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
in the Poet of the Millions competition,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
and seen throughout the Arab world.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
In this contest

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
people have to write and recite

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
original poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
which is the traditional Bedouin form.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And Lima Sahar was a finalist

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
in the Afghan Star singing competition.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Now, before I go any further,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.260
yes, I know it all began with "Britain's Got Talent."

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
But my point in discussing this

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
is to show you -- I hope I'll be able to show you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.260
how these merit-based competitions,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
with equal access to everyone,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
with the winner selected via voting by SMS,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
are changing tribal societies.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and the Arab world with the UAE,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
how they're changing tribal societies,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
not by introducing Western ideas,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.260
but by being integrated into the language in those places.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
It all begins with enjoyment.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Video: We are late to watch "Afghan Star."

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
We are going to watch "Afghan Star." We are late.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
We are running late.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
We must go to watch "Afghan Star."

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Cynthia Schneider: These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
In Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengths

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
to be able to watch this program.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
People watch it all over the country

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
also in public places.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
But it goes beyond watching,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
because also, part of this

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
is campaigning.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
People become so engaged

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.260
that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
who fan out over the countryside,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
campaigning for their candidate.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Contestants also put themselves forward.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Now, of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
This has opened up the door,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
particularly for women.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And in the last season there were two women in the finalists.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
a very conservative part of the country.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And here she relates, in the documentary film "Afghan Star,"

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
how her friends urged her not to do this

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and told her that she was leaving them for democracy.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
But she also confides that

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
she knows that members of the Taliban

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.260
are actually SMS-ing votes in for her.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and put herself out, to compete

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
in the Poet of the Millions competition.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.260
I have to say, her husband backed her from the start.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
But her tribe and family urged her not to compete

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
and were very much against it.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
But, once she started to win,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
then they got behind her again.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.260
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
And she's out there.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Her poetry is about women,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and the life of women in society.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
So just by presenting herself

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
and being in competition with men --

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
this shows the voting on the program --

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
it sets a very important example for young women --

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
these are young women in the audience of the program --

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.260
in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
Now you'd think that "American Idol"

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
would introduce a measure of Americanization.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
But actually, just the opposite is happening.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
By using this engaging popular format

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
for traditional, local culture,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
it actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
of interest in Nabati poetry,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.260
also in traditional dress and dance and music.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And for Afghanistan,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
where the Taliban banned music for many years,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
it is reintroducing their traditional music.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
They don't sing pop songs,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
they sing Afghan music.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And they also have learned how to lose gracefully,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
without avenging the winner.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
(Laughter)

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
No small thing.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And the final, sort of, formulation

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
of this "American Idol" format,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
which has just appeared in Afghanistan,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
is a new program called "The Candidate."

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And in this program, people present

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
policy platforms that are then voted on.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Many of them are too young to run for president,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
but by putting the issues out there,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
they are influencing the presidential race.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
So for me, the substance of things unseen

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.260
is how reality TV is driving reality.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
Thank you.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.260
(Applause)
