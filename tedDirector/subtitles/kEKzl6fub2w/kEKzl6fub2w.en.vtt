00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.374
So recently,

00:00:14.374 --> 00:00:17.176
some white guys and some black women

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:19.808
swapped Twitter avatars, or pictures online.

00:00:19.808 --> 00:00:21.093
They didn't change their content,

00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:22.904
they kept tweeting the same as usual,

00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:25.702
but suddenly, the white guys noticed

00:00:25.702 --> 00:00:27.603
they were getting called the n-word all the time

00:00:27.603 --> 00:00:30.331
and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse,

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:32.891
whereas the black women all of a sudden

00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:35.962
noticed things got a lot more pleasant for them.

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:37.897
Now, if you're my five-year-old,

00:00:37.897 --> 00:00:41.130
your Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.285
and occasionally fairies riding puppies.

00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:46.030
That's a thing. Google it.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.324
But the rest of us know that the Internet

00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:51.182
can be a really ugly place.

00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:54.157
I'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates

00:00:54.157 --> 00:00:56.445
that I think are healthy for our democracy.

00:00:56.445 --> 00:00:59.823
I'm talking about nasty personal attacks.

00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:01.947
Maybe it's happened to you, but it's at least

00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:04.738
twice as likely to happen, and be worse,

00:01:04.738 --> 00:01:06.741
if you're a woman, a person of color, or gay,

00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.675
or more than one at the same time.

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:11.364
In fact, just as I was writing this talk,

00:01:11.364 --> 00:01:14.363
I found a Twitter account called @SallyKohnSucks.

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:19.215
The bio says that I'm a

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:22.724
"man-hater and a bull dyke and the only
thing I've ever accomplished with my career

00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:25.289
is spreading my perverse sexuality."

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.466
Which, incidentally, is only a third correct.

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:31.116
I mean, lies! (Laughter)

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.113
But seriously, we all say we hate this crap.

00:01:35.113 --> 00:01:36.930
The question is whether you're willing to make

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.118
a personal sacrifice to change it.

00:01:40.118 --> 00:01:41.980
I don't mean giving up the Internet.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.182
I mean changing the way you click,

00:01:44.182 --> 00:01:47.037
because clicking is a public act.

00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:48.710
It's no longer the case

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.121
that a few powerful elites control all the media

00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:53.360
and the rest of us are just passive receivers.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.172
Increasingly, we're all the media.

00:01:56.172 --> 00:01:59.332
I used to think, oh, okay, I get dressed up,

00:01:59.332 --> 00:02:01.238
I put on a lot of makeup,

00:02:01.238 --> 00:02:03.116
I go on television, I talk about the news.

00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:06.457
That is a public act of making media.

00:02:06.457 --> 00:02:08.516
And then I go home and I browse the web

00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:09.652
and I'm reading Twitter,

00:02:09.652 --> 00:02:11.769
and that's a private act of consuming media.

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.326
I mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas.

00:02:14.326 --> 00:02:16.152
Wrong.

00:02:16.152 --> 00:02:18.266
Everything we blog, everything we Tweet,

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:21.621
and everything we click

00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:24.937
is a public act of making media.

00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:26.481
We are the new editors.

00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:28.313
We decide what gets attention

00:02:28.313 --> 00:02:31.110
based on what we give our attention to.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.457
That's how the media works now.

00:02:32.457 --> 00:02:34.870
There's all these hidden algorithms that decide

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.133
what you see more of and what we all see more of

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:38.890
based on what you click on,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.956
and that in turn shapes our whole culture.

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:44.911
Over three out of five Americans think we have

00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:48.901
a major incivility problem in our country right now,

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.635
but I'm going to guess that at least three out of five

00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:54.655
Americans are clicking on the same insult-oriented,

00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:56.803
rumor-mongering trash that feeds

00:02:56.803 --> 00:02:59.860
the nastiest impulses in our society.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.833
In an increasingly noisy media landscape,

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:07.213
the incentive is to make more noise to be heard,

00:03:07.213 --> 00:03:10.140
and that tyranny of the loud

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.477
encourages the tyranny of the nasty.

00:03:13.477 --> 00:03:16.395
It does not have to be that way.

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:17.957
It does not.

00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:20.832
We can change the incentive.

00:03:20.832 --> 00:03:22.452
For starters, there are two things we can all do.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:26.385
First, don't just stand by the sidelines
when you see someone getting hurt.

00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:30.065
If someone is being abused online, do something.

00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:32.194
Be a hero. This is your chance.

00:03:32.194 --> 00:03:34.545
Speak up. Speak out. Be a good person.

00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:36.841
Drown out the negative with the positive.

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:40.230
And second, we've got to stop clicking

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.633
on the lowest-common-denominator, bottom-feeding

00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:43.999
linkbait.

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.571
If you don't like the 24/7 all Kardashian

00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:49.253
all the time programming,

00:03:49.253 --> 00:03:51.127
you've got to stop clicking on the stories

00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:55.070
about Kim Kardashian's sideboob.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.874
I know you do it. (Applause)

00:03:57.874 --> 00:03:59.814
You too, apparently.

00:03:59.814 --> 00:04:00.939
I mean, really, same example:

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.436
if you don't like politicians calling each other names,

00:04:03.436 --> 00:04:05.147
stop clicking on the stories

00:04:05.147 --> 00:04:08.207
about what one guy in one party called
the other guy in the other party.

00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:10.998
Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it.

00:04:10.998 --> 00:04:12.920
It makes it worse, the fire spreads.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.917
Our whole culture gets burned.

00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:20.050
If what gets the most clicks wins,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.921
then we have to start shaping the world we want

00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:24.890
with our clicks,

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.776
because clicking is a public act.

00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:31.256
So click responsibly. Thank you.

00:04:31.256 --> 00:04:35.256
(Applause)
