00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.121
Getting a college education

00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:17.300
is a 20-year investment.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.875
When you're growing up poor,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.836
you're not accustomed
to thinking that far ahead.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.196
Instead, you're thinking about
where you're going to get your next meal

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.076
and how your family
is going to pay rent that month.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.236
Besides, my parents
and my friends' parents

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.900
seemed to be doing just fine
driving taxis and working as janitors.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.636
It wasn't until I was a teenager

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.140
when I realized I didn't
want to do those things.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.556
By then, I was two-thirds of the way
through my education,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.900
and it was almost too late
to turn things around.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.820
When you grow up poor,
you want to be rich.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.820
I was no different.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.156
I'm the second-oldest of seven,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.596
and was raised by a single mother
on government aid

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.820
in Queens, New York.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.476
By virtue of growing up low-income,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.836
my siblings and I went
to some of New York City's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.380
most struggling public schools.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.220
I had over 60 absences
when I was in seventh grade,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100
because I didn't feel like going to class.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.756
My high school had
a 55 percent graduation rate,

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:18.076
and even worse,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.396
only 20 percent of the kids graduating

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.620
were college-ready.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.916
When I actually did make it to college,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.356
I told my friend Brennan

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.076
how our teachers would always ask us
to raise our hands

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.100
if we were going to college.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.956
I was taken aback when Brennan said,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.660
"Karim, I've never been asked
that question before."

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.516
It was always, "What college
are you going to?"

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.476
Just the way that question is phrased

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.260
made it unacceptable for him
not to have gone to college.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.820
Nowadays I get asked a different question.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.780
"How were you able to make it out?"

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.940
For years I said I was lucky,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.340
but it's not just luck.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.676
When my older brother and I
graduated from high school

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.956
at the very same time

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.196
and he later dropped out
of a two-year college,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.676
I wanted to understand why he dropped out

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.900
and I kept studying.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.436
It wasn't until I got to Cornell
as a Presidential Research Scholar

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.196
that I started to learn about
the very real educational consequences

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.995
of being raised by a single mother
on government aid

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.820
and attending the schools that I did.

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.580
That's when my older brother's trajectory
began to make complete sense to me.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.476
I also learned that our most admirable
education reformers,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.156
people like Arne Duncan,
the former US Secretary of Education,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.876
or Wendy Kopp, the founder
of Teach For America,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.700
had never attended an inner city
public school like I had.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.156
So much of our education reform
is driven by a sympathetic approach,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.436
where people are saying,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.476
"Let's go and help
these poor inner city kids,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500
or these poor black and Latino kids,"

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.516
instead of an empathetic approach,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.956
where someone like me, who had grown up
in this environment, could say,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.196
"I know the adversities that you're facing

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.060
and I want to help you overcome them."

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.076
Today when I get questions
about how I made it out,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.596
I share that one of the biggest reasons

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.700
is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.276
In a typical middle class
or affluent household,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.076
if a kid is struggling,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.036
there's a good chance that a parent
or a teacher will come to their rescue

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.996
even if they don't ask for help.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.156
However, if that same kid
is growing up poor

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.420
and doesn't ask for help,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.380
there's a good chance
that no one will help them.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.700
There are virtually
no social safety nets available.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.356
So seven years ago,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.196
I started to reform
our public education system

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.540
shaped by my firsthand perspective.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.352
And I started with summer school.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.116
Research tells us that two-thirds
of the achievement gap,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.476
which is the disparity
in educational attainment

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.676
between rich kids and poor kids

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.836
or black kids and white kids,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.540
could be directly attributed
to the summer learning loss.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.276
In low-income neighborhoods,
kids forget almost three months

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.356
of what they learned
during the school year

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.716
over the summer.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.356
They return to school in the fall,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.436
and their teachers
spend another two months

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.876
reteaching them old material.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.396
That's five months.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.036
The school year in the United States
is only 10 months.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.676
If kids lose five months of learning
every single year,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.180
that's half of their education.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.140
Half.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.060
If kids were in school over the summer,
then they couldn't regress,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.140
but traditional summer school
is poorly designed.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.796
For kids it feels like punishment,

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.860
and for teachers
it feels like babysitting.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.156
But how can we expect principals
to execute an effective summer program

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.636
when the school year
ends the last week of June

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.020
and then summer school starts
just one week later?

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.356
There just isn't enough time
to find the right people,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.636
sort out the logistics,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.860
and design an engaging curriculum
that excites kids and teachers.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.556
But what if we created a program
over the summer

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.276
that empowered teachers
as teaching coaches

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.300
to develop aspiring educators?

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.276
What if we empowered
college-educated role models

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.580
as teaching fellows

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.916
to help kids realize
their college ambitions?

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.196
What if empowered high-achieving kids

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.636
as mentors to tutor their younger peers

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.980
and inspire them
to invest in their education?

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.196
What if we empowered all kids as scholars,

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.436
asked them what colleges
they were going to,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.420
designed a summer school
they want to attend

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.756
to completely eliminate
the summer learning loss

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.980
and close two-thirds
of the achievement gap?

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.716
By this summer, my team will have served
over 4,000 low-income children,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.676
trained over 300 aspiring teachers

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.996
and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.060
across some of New York City's
most disadvantaged neighborhoods.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.620
(Applause)

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.996
And our kids are succeeding.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.996
Two years of independent evaluations

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.956
tell us that our kids
eliminate the summer learning loss

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.156
and make growth of one month in math

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.420
and two months in reading.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.516
So instead of returning to school
in the fall three months behind,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.180
they now go back four months ahead in math

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.436
and five months ahead in reading.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.860
(Applause)

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.516
Ten years ago, if you would have told me

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.716
that I'd graduate in the top 10 percent
of my class from an Ivy League institution

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.716
and have an opportunity to make a dent
on our public education system

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.780
just by tackling two months
of the calendar year,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.236
I would have said,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.380
"Nah. No way."

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.036
What's even more exciting

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.236
is that if we can prevent
five months of lost time

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.220
just by redesigning two months,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.956
imagine the possibilities
that we can unlock

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.540
by tackling the rest of the calendar year.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.196
Thank you.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.881
(Applause)
