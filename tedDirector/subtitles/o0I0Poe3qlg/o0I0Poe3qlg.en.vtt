00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:15.428
If there's any power in design,

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:17.771
that's the power of synthesis.

00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:19.466
The more complex the problem,

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.967
the more the need for simplicity.

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:24.304
So allow me to share three cases

00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:26.114
where we tried to apply

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:29.117
design's power of synthesis.

00:00:29.117 --> 00:00:33.218
Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization.

00:00:33.218 --> 00:00:36.896
It's a fact that people are moving towards cities.

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:40.361
and even if counterintuitive, it's good news.

00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:44.444
Evidence shows that people are better off in cities.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.593
But there's a problem that I would call

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:48.899
the "3S" menace:

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.632
The scale, speed, and scarcity of means

00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:54.827
with which we will have to
respond to this phenomenon

00:00:54.827 --> 00:00:57.465
has no precedence in history.

00:00:57.465 --> 00:00:58.654
For you to have an idea,

00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:01.880
out of the three billion 
people living in cities today,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.271
one billion are under the line of poverty.

00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:09.210
By 2030, out of the five billion people

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.480
that will be living in cities,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.837
two billion are going to 
be under the line of poverty.

00:01:14.837 --> 00:01:19.266
That means that we will have to build

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:28.445
a one million-person city per week

00:01:30.114 --> 00:01:35.672
with 10,000 dollars per family

00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:37.482
during the next 15 years.

00:01:37.482 --> 00:01:40.206
A one million-person city per week

00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:42.330
with 10,000 dollars per family.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.995
If we don't solve this equation,

00:01:43.995 --> 00:01:46.043
it is not that people 
will stop coming to cities.

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:47.952
They will come anyhow,

00:01:47.952 --> 00:01:50.958
but they will live in slums, favelas

00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.368
and informal settlements.

00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:55.246
So what to do? Well, an answer may come

00:01:55.246 --> 00:01:59.840
from favelas and slums themselves.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.433
A clue could be in this 
question we were asked

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:04.890
10 years ago.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.521
We were asked to accommodate 100 families

00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:10.939
that had been occupying illegally

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.234
half a hectare in the center

00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:16.134
of the city of Iquique 
in the north of Chile

00:02:16.134 --> 00:02:19.062
using a $10,000 subsidy

00:02:19.062 --> 00:02:22.176
with which we had to buy the land,

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:23.909
provide the infrastructure,

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.230
and build the houses that, 
in the best of the cases,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.894
would be of around 40 square meters.

00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:33.099
And by the way, they said,

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.750
the cost of the land,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.806
because it's in the center of the city,

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:38.550
is three times more

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.108
than what social housing can normally afford.

00:02:42.108 --> 00:02:44.334
Due to the difficulty of the question,

00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:46.516
we decided to include the families

00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:50.612
in the process of understanding the constraints,

00:02:50.612 --> 00:02:53.193
and we started a participatory design process,

00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:56.840
and testing what was 
available there in the market.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.538
Detached houses,

00:02:58.538 --> 00:03:01.494
30 families could be accommodated.

00:03:01.494 --> 00:03:05.456
Row houses, 60 families.

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:08.598
["100 families"]
The only way to accommodate all of them

00:03:08.598 --> 00:03:10.920
was by building in height,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.552
and they threatened us

00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:14.860
to go on a hunger strike

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.158
if we even dared to offer this

00:03:17.158 --> 00:03:18.584
as a solution,

00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:21.655
because they could not 
make the tiny apartments

00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:23.109
expand.

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.798
So the conclusion with the families â€”

00:03:25.798 --> 00:03:27.676
and this is important, 
not our conclusion â€”

00:03:27.676 --> 00:03:30.207
with the families, was that we had a problem.

00:03:30.207 --> 00:03:31.945
We had to innovate.

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.611
So what did we do?

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.619
Well, a middle-class family

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.499
lives reasonably well

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.850
in around 80 square meters,

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.522
but when there's no money,

00:03:46.522 --> 00:03:47.864
what the market does

00:03:47.864 --> 00:03:52.122
is to reduce the size of the house

00:03:52.122 --> 00:03:54.971
to 40 square meters.

00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:56.719
What we said was,

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.239
what if,

00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:05.378
instead of thinking of 40 square meters

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:08.059
as a small house,

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:10.385
why don't we consider it

00:04:10.385 --> 00:04:13.191
half of a good one?

00:04:13.191 --> 00:04:14.958
When you rephrase the problem

00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.664
as half of a good house

00:04:17.664 --> 00:04:19.299
instead of a small one,

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.508
the key question is, which half do we do?

00:04:22.508 --> 00:04:25.210
And we thought we had 
to do with public money

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.619
the half that families won't 
be able to do individually.

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:33.147
We identified five design conditions

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:35.505
that belonged to the hard half of a house,

00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:38.601
and we went back to the 
families to do two things:

00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:42.600
join forces and split tasks.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.584
Our design was something in between

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:48.265
a building and a house.

00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:50.357
As a building, it could pay

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:53.349
for expensive, well-located land,

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.970
and as a house, it could expand.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.554
If, in the process of not being expelled

00:04:59.554 --> 00:05:01.920
to the periphery while getting a house,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.733
families kept their 
network and their jobs,

00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:08.980
we knew that the expansion 
would begin right away.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.536
So we went from this initial social housing

00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:17.930
to a middle-class unit achieved
by families themselves

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.666
within a couple of weeks.

00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:22.439
This was our first project

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:24.766
in Iquique 10 years ago.

00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:28.243
This is our last project in Chile.

00:05:28.243 --> 00:05:31.194
Different designs, same principle:

00:05:31.194 --> 00:05:32.760
You provide the frame,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.598
and from then on, families take over.

00:05:36.598 --> 00:05:40.698
So the purpose of design,

00:05:40.698 --> 00:05:43.708
trying to understand and 
trying to give an answer

00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:45.360
to the "3S" menace,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.826
scale, speed, and scarcity,

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:50.309
is to channel people's own building capacity.

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:54.714
We won't solve the one million
people per week equation

00:05:54.714 --> 00:05:59.399
unless we use people's own power for building.

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:01.634
So, with the right design,

00:06:01.634 --> 00:06:05.035
slums and favelas may not be the problem

00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:08.784
but actually the only possible solution.

00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:11.819
The second case is how design can contribute

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:13.871
to sustainability.

00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:16.264
In 2012, we entered the competition

00:06:16.264 --> 00:06:18.830
for the Angelini Innovation Center,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.842
and the aim was to build

00:06:20.842 --> 00:06:25.176
the right environment for knowledge creation.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.660
It is accepted that for such an aim,

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.196
knowledge creation,

00:06:29.196 --> 00:06:31.783
interaction among people, 
face-to-face contact,

00:06:31.783 --> 00:06:33.980
it's important, and we agreed on that.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.556
But for us, the question 
of the right environment

00:06:37.556 --> 00:06:39.722
was a very literal question.

00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:41.842
We wanted to have a working space

00:06:41.842 --> 00:06:44.595
with the right light, with the right temperature,

00:06:44.595 --> 00:06:46.477
with the right air.

00:06:46.477 --> 00:06:48.555
So we asked ourselves:

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:51.145
Does the typical office building

00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:53.256
help us in that sense?

00:06:53.256 --> 00:06:56.870
Well, how does that 
building look, typically?

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.454
It's a collection of floors,

00:06:59.454 --> 00:07:01.361
one on top of each other,

00:07:01.361 --> 00:07:04.401
with a core in the center

00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:09.090
with elevators, stairs, 
pipes, wires, everything,

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.677
and then a glass skin on the outside

00:07:12.677 --> 00:07:16.553
that, due to direct sun radiation,

00:07:16.553 --> 00:07:21.761
creates a huge greenhouse effect inside.

00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:23.695
In addition to that, let's say a guy

00:07:23.695 --> 00:07:25.431
working on the seventh floor

00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:28.142
goes every single day 
through the third floor,

00:07:28.142 --> 00:07:31.180
but has no idea what the guy on that floor

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.909
is working on.

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:36.305
So we thought, well, maybe 
we have to turn this scheme

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:38.106
inside out.

00:07:38.106 --> 00:07:39.928
And what we did was,

00:07:39.928 --> 00:07:44.110
let's have an open atrium,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.999
a hollowed core,

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:47.613
the same collection of floors,

00:07:47.613 --> 00:07:52.053
but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter,

00:07:52.053 --> 00:07:56.317
so that when the sun hits,

00:07:56.317 --> 00:08:02.444
it's not impacting directly glass, but a wall.

00:08:02.444 --> 00:08:05.181
When you have an open atrium inside,

00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:07.330
you are able to see what others are doing

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.181
from within the building, and you have

00:08:09.181 --> 00:08:11.380
a better way to control light,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.783
and when you place the mass and the walls

00:08:14.783 --> 00:08:16.439
in the perimeter,

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:19.872
then you are preventing direct sun radiation.

00:08:19.872 --> 00:08:21.792
You may also open those windows

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:24.688
and get cross-ventilation.

00:08:24.688 --> 00:08:27.623
We just made those openings

00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:29.715
of such a scale that they could work

00:08:29.715 --> 00:08:31.728
as elevated squares,

00:08:31.728 --> 00:08:33.472
outdoor spaces throughout

00:08:33.472 --> 00:08:37.135
the entire height of the building.

00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:38.984
None of this is rocket science.

00:08:38.984 --> 00:08:41.683
You don't require sophisticated programming.

00:08:41.683 --> 00:08:43.416
It's not about technology.

00:08:43.416 --> 00:08:48.838
This is just archaic, 
primitive common sense,

00:08:48.838 --> 00:08:50.806
and by using common sense,

00:08:50.806 --> 00:08:53.787
we went from 120 kilowatts

00:08:53.787 --> 00:08:56.127
per square meter per year,

00:08:56.127 --> 00:08:58.298
which is the typical energy consumption

00:08:58.298 --> 00:09:00.290
for cooling a glass tower,

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.620
to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.897
So with the right design,

00:09:06.897 --> 00:09:09.441
sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use

00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:13.174
of common sense.

00:09:13.174 --> 00:09:16.147
Last case I would like 
to share is how design

00:09:16.147 --> 00:09:18.442
can provide more comprehensive answers

00:09:18.442 --> 00:09:20.830
against natural disasters.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.895
You may know that Chile, in 2010,

00:09:23.895 --> 00:09:27.700
was hit by an 8.8 Richter scale

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.823
earthquake and tsunami,

00:09:29.823 --> 00:09:31.698
and we were called to work

00:09:31.698 --> 00:09:33.940
in the reconstruction of the ConstituciÃ³n,

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.850
in the southern part of the country.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.347
We were given 100 days, three months,

00:09:39.347 --> 00:09:41.263
to design almost everything,

00:09:41.263 --> 00:09:43.580
from public buildings to public space,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.670
street grid, transportation, housing,

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.424
and mainly how to protect the city

00:09:48.424 --> 00:09:50.679
against future tsunamis.

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:53.829
This was new in Chilean urban design,

00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:57.202
and there were in the 
air a couple of alternatives.

00:09:57.202 --> 00:09:58.454
First one:

00:09:58.454 --> 00:10:01.103
Forbid installation on ground zero.

00:10:01.103 --> 00:10:03.140
Thirty million dollars spent mainly

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.524
in land expropriation.

00:10:05.524 --> 00:10:08.786
This is exactly what's being
discussed in Japan nowadays,

00:10:08.786 --> 00:10:10.833
and if you have a disciplined population

00:10:10.833 --> 00:10:13.173
like the Japanese, this may work,

00:10:13.173 --> 00:10:14.658
but we know that in Chile,

00:10:14.658 --> 00:10:18.471
this land is going to be 
occupied illegally anyhow,

00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:22.543
so this alternative was 
unrealistic and undesirable.

00:10:22.543 --> 00:10:25.936
Second alternative: build a big wall,

00:10:25.936 --> 00:10:28.253
heavy infrastructure to resist

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.195
the energy of the waves.

00:10:30.195 --> 00:10:32.314
This alternative was conveniently lobbied

00:10:32.314 --> 00:10:33.675
by big building companies,

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:37.882
because it meant 42 million 
dollars in contracts,

00:10:37.882 --> 00:10:40.235
and was also politically preferred,

00:10:40.235 --> 00:10:44.227
because it required no land expropriation.

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.977
But Japan proved that trying to resist

00:10:46.977 --> 00:10:50.290
the force of nature is useless.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.653
So this alternative was irresponsible.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.747
As in the housing process,

00:10:55.747 --> 00:10:57.624
we had to include the community

00:10:57.624 --> 00:11:00.972
in the way of finding a solution for this,

00:11:00.972 --> 00:11:04.145
and we started a participatory design process.

00:11:04.145 --> 00:11:06.416
(Video) [In Spanish] Loudspeaker:
What kind of city do you want?

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:07.958
Vote for ConstituciÃ³n.

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.263
Go to the Open House and express your options.

00:11:10.263 --> 00:11:12.436
Participate!

00:11:12.436 --> 00:11:14.510
Fisherman: I am a fisherman.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.619
Twenty-five fishermen work for me.

00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:18.958
Where should I take them? To the forest?

00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.343
Man: So why can't we have a concrete defense?

00:11:22.343 --> 00:11:24.251
Done well, of course.

00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:26.141
Man 2: I am the history of ConstituciÃ³n.

00:11:26.141 --> 00:11:30.101
And you come here to tell me
that I cannot keep on living here?

00:11:30.101 --> 00:11:32.299
My whole family has lived here,

00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:33.771
I raised my children here,

00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:35.856
and my children will also 
raise their children here.

00:11:35.856 --> 00:11:38.364
and my grandchildren 
and everyone else will.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.890
But why are you imposing this on me?

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.767
You! You are imposing this on me!

00:11:42.767 --> 00:11:44.558
In danger zone I am not authorized to build.

00:11:44.558 --> 00:11:46.145
He himself is saying that.

00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:48.230
Man 3: No, no, no, Nieves...

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.228
Alejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able

00:11:53.228 --> 00:11:55.513
to read the subtitles, but you can tell

00:11:55.513 --> 00:11:57.157
from the body language

00:11:57.157 --> 00:11:58.435
that participatory design

00:11:58.435 --> 00:12:00.759
is not a hippie, romantic,

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:04.010
let's-all-dream-together-about-
the-future-of-the-city

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.077
kind of thing.

00:12:06.077 --> 00:12:09.570
It is actually â€” (Applause)

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.970
It is actually not even with the families

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.016
trying to find the right answer.

00:12:15.016 --> 00:12:17.829
It is mainly trying to identify with precision

00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:19.900
what is the right question.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.987
There is nothing worse than answering well

00:12:21.987 --> 00:12:24.091
the wrong question.

00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:27.410
So it was pretty obvious after this process

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.941
that, well, we chicken out here

00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:33.517
and go away because it's too tense,

00:12:33.517 --> 00:12:35.543
or we go even further in asking,

00:12:35.543 --> 00:12:36.938
what else is bothering you?

00:12:36.938 --> 00:12:38.691
What other problems do you have

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:41.273
and you want us to take 
care of now that the city

00:12:41.273 --> 00:12:45.595
will have to be rethought from scratch?

00:12:45.595 --> 00:12:47.791
And what they said was,

00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:50.577
look, fine to protect the city 
against future tsunamis,

00:12:50.577 --> 00:12:55.334
we really appreciate, but the next one 
is going to come in, what, 20 years?

00:12:55.334 --> 00:12:57.427
But every single year, we have problems

00:12:57.427 --> 00:13:00.290
of flooding due to rain.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.490
In addition, we are in the middle

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.289
of the forest region of the country,

00:13:04.289 --> 00:13:07.109
and our public space sucks.

00:13:07.109 --> 00:13:10.900
It's poor and it's scarce.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.484
And the origin of the city, our identity,

00:13:13.484 --> 00:13:16.370
is not really connected to the buildings that fell,

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.984
it is connected to the river,

00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:20.798
but the river cannot be accessed publicly,

00:13:20.798 --> 00:13:24.500
because its shores are privately owned.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:29.303
So we thought that we had
to produce a third alternative,

00:13:29.303 --> 00:13:33.847
and our approach was 
against geographical threats,

00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:37.467
have geographical answers.

00:13:37.467 --> 00:13:41.254
What if, in between the city

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.983
and the sea

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.768
we have a forest,

00:13:51.768 --> 00:13:54.354
a forest that doesn't try to resist

00:13:54.354 --> 00:13:56.212
the energy of nature,

00:13:56.212 --> 00:14:00.271
but dissipates it by introducing friction?

00:14:00.271 --> 00:14:04.164
A forest that may be able to laminate the water

00:14:04.164 --> 00:14:06.515
and prevent the flooding?

00:14:06.515 --> 00:14:11.599
That may pay the historical debt of public space,

00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:14.242
and that may provide, finally,

00:14:14.242 --> 00:14:16.660
democratic access to the river.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.601
So as a conclusion of the participatory design,

00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:22.604
the alternative was validated politically and socially,

00:14:22.604 --> 00:14:25.715
but there was still the problem of the cost:

00:14:25.715 --> 00:14:28.919
48 million dollars.

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:31.323
So what we did was a survey

00:14:31.323 --> 00:14:33.875
in the public investment system,

00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:36.190
and found out that there 
were three ministries

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.333
with three projects in 
the exact same place,

00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:42.297
not knowing of the existence 
of the other projects.

00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:46.634
The sum of them: 52 million dollars.

00:14:46.634 --> 00:14:49.310
So design's power of synthesis

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.426
is trying to make a more efficient use

00:14:51.426 --> 00:14:54.283
of the scarcest resource in cities,

00:14:54.283 --> 00:14:57.696
which is not money but coordination.

00:14:57.696 --> 00:15:00.478
By doing so, we were able to save

00:15:00.478 --> 00:15:03.320
four million dollars, and 
that is why the forest

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.900
is today under construction.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.516
(Applause)

00:15:09.516 --> 00:15:13.140
So be it the force of self construction,

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.245
the force of common sense,

00:15:16.245 --> 00:15:19.350
or the force of nature, all these forces

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.781
need to be translated into form,

00:15:22.781 --> 00:15:26.447
and what that form is modeling and shaping

00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:29.677
is not cement, bricks, or wood.

00:15:29.677 --> 00:15:31.922
It is life itself.

00:15:31.922 --> 00:15:34.260
Design's power of synthesis

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.680
is just an attempt to put

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.312
at the innermost core of architecture

00:15:40.312 --> 00:15:42.180
the force of life.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.969
Thank you so much.

00:15:44.969 --> 00:15:48.890
(Applause)
