00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.964
My name is Harry Baker.
Harry Baker is my name.

00:00:15.964 --> 00:00:20.867
If your name was Harry Baker,
then our names would be the same.

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:22.307
(Laughter)

00:00:22.307 --> 00:00:24.494
It's a short introductory part.

00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:26.486
Yeah, I'm Harry.

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:29.063
I study maths. I write poetry.

00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:33.266
So I thought I'd start
with a love poem about prime numbers.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.915
(Laughter)

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:38.281
This is called "59."

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:41.171
I was going to call it
"Prime Time Loving."

00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:43.071
That reaction is why I didn't.

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:44.560
(Laughter)

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.836
So, "59."

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:51.359
59 wakes up on the wrong 
side of the bed.

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.910
Realizes all his hair is 
on one side of his head.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.797
Takes just under a minute to work out that
it’s because of the way that he slept.

00:00:57.797 --> 00:00:59.713
He finds some clothes and gets dressed.

00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:02.539
He can’t help but look in the mirror
and be subtly impressed

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.372
How he looks rough around the edges
and yet casually messed.

00:01:05.372 --> 00:01:08.993
And as he glances out the window, he
sees the sight that he gets blessed with

00:01:08.993 --> 00:01:10.495
of 60 from across the street.

00:01:10.495 --> 00:01:12.288
Now 60 was beautiful.

00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:15.316
With perfectly trimmed cuticles,
dressed in something suitable.

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:16.753
Never rude or crude at all.

00:01:16.753 --> 00:01:20.036
Unimprovable, right on time as usual,
more on cue than a snooker ball

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:22.183
but liked to play it super cool.

00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:25.490
59 wanted to tell her
that he knew her favorite flower.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.162
He thought of her every second,
every minute, every hour.

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:30.801
But he knew it wouldn’t work,
he’d never get the girl.

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:32.911
Because although she lived 
across the street

00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:34.451
they came from different worlds.

00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:36.881
While 59 admired 60’s
perfectly round figure,

00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:41.597
60 thought 59 was odd.
(Laughter)

00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:47.752
One of his favorite films
was "101 Dalmatians."

00:01:47.752 --> 00:01:50.754
She preferred the sequel.

00:01:50.754 --> 00:01:53.870
He romanticized the idea
they were star-crossed lovers.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.043
They could overcome the odds
and evens because they had each other.

00:01:57.043 --> 00:02:00.243
While she maintained the strict views
imposed on her by her mother

00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:02.040
That separate could not be equal.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.208
And though at the time he felt
stupid and dumb

00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:06.850
For trying to love a girl controlled
by her stupid mum,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.239
He should have been comforted
by the simple sum.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.669
Take 59 away from 60,
and you’re left with the one.

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.197
Sure enough after two months
of moping around,

00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:16.649
61 days later, 61 was who he found,

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:18.871
He had lost his keys 
and his parents were out.

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.993
So one day after school 
he went into a house

00:02:20.993 --> 00:02:23.506
As he noticed the slightly wonky
numbers on the door,

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:25.991
He wondered why he’d never
introduced himself before,

00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:28.119
As she let him in, his jaw 
dropped in awe.

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.308
61 was like 60, but a little bit more.
(Laughter)

00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:34.710
She had prettier eyes,
and an approachable smile,

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.136
And like him, rough around
the edges, casual style,

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:39.512
And like him, everything
was in disorganized piles,

00:02:39.512 --> 00:02:42.345
And like him, her mum didn’t mind
if friends stayed a while.

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:44.440
Because she was like him, 
and he liked her.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.198
He reckoned she would like him
if she knew he was like her,

00:02:47.198 --> 00:02:50.076
And it was different this time.
I mean, this girl was wicked,

00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:52.636
So he plucked up the courage
and asked for her digits.

00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:57.350
She said, "I'm 61."
He grinned, said, "I'm 59."

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.983
Today I’ve had a really nice time,

00:02:58.983 --> 00:03:01.556
So tomorrow if you wanted
you could come over to mine?

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:02.419
She said, "Sure."

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.603
She loved talking to someone 
just as quirky,

00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:06.551
She agreed to this unofficial first date.

00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:08.711
In the end he was only
ready one minute early,

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.435
But it didn’t matter because
she arrived one minute late.

00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:13.879
And from that moment on
there was nonstop chatter,

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.354
How they loved "X Factor,"
how they had two factors,

00:03:16.354 --> 00:03:20.454
How that did not matter,
distinctiveness made them better,

00:03:20.454 --> 00:03:23.239
By the end of the night they knew
they were meant together.

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.213
And one day she was talking
about stuck-up 60,

00:03:26.213 --> 00:03:28.140
She noticed that 59 looked a bit shifty.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.837
He blushed, told her of his crush:

00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:32.604
“The best thing that never happened
because it led to us.”

00:03:32.604 --> 00:03:35.446
61 was clever, see,
not prone to jealousy,

00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:38.148
She looked him in the eyes
and told him quite tenderly,

00:03:38.148 --> 00:03:43.140
"You’re 59, I’m 61, together we combine
to become twice what 60 could ever be."

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.483
(Laughter)

00:03:46.483 --> 00:03:48.770
At this point 59 had tears in his eyes,

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.388
Was so glad to have
this one-of-a-kind girl in his life.

00:03:51.388 --> 00:03:53.588
He told her the very
definition of being prime

00:03:53.588 --> 00:03:56.345
Was that with only one
and himself could his heart divide,

00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:58.769
And she was the one he wanted
to give his heart to,

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.098
She said she felt the same
and now she knew the films were half true.

00:04:02.098 --> 00:04:04.919
Because that wasn't real love,
that love was just a sample,

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.193
When it came to real love,
they were a prime example.

00:04:08.193 --> 00:04:09.888
Cheers.

00:04:09.888 --> 00:04:14.648
(Applause)

00:04:20.522 --> 00:04:22.334
That was the first poem that I wrote

00:04:22.334 --> 00:04:26.753
and it was for a prime number-themed 
poetry night -- (Laughter) --

00:04:26.753 --> 00:04:29.973
which turned out to be
a prime number-themed poetry competition.

00:04:29.973 --> 00:04:33.200
And I became a prime number-themed
poetry competition winner,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.709
or as I like to call it,
a prime minister. (Laughter)

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:39.657
And this is how I discovered
these things called poetry slams,

00:04:39.657 --> 00:04:41.791
and if you don't know what 
a poetry slam is,

00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:44.485
it was a format come up with
in America 30 years ago

00:04:44.485 --> 00:04:47.457
as a way of tricking people
into going to poetry events

00:04:47.457 --> 00:04:50.312
by putting an exciting word
like "slam" on the end.

00:04:50.312 --> 00:04:51.706
(Laughter)

00:04:51.706 --> 00:04:54.608
And each performer got
three minutes to perform

00:04:54.608 --> 00:04:57.403
and then random audience members
would hold up scorecards,

00:04:57.403 --> 00:04:59.530
and they would end up
with a numerical score,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.738
and what this meant is,

00:05:00.738 --> 00:05:03.943
it kind of broke down the barrier
between performer and audience

00:05:03.943 --> 00:05:06.653
and encouraged the kind
of connection with the listener.

00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:08.681
And what it also means is you can win.

00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:13.021
And if you win a poetry slam,
you can call yourself a slam champion

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.412
and pretend you're a wrestler,

00:05:15.412 --> 00:05:19.476
and if you lose a poetry slam you can say,
"Oh, what? Poetry's a subjective art form,

00:05:19.476 --> 00:05:21.774
you can't put numbers on such things."

00:05:21.774 --> 00:05:23.467
(Laughter)

00:05:23.467 --> 00:05:25.814
But I loved it, and I
got involved in these slams,

00:05:25.814 --> 00:05:28.113
and I became the U.K. slam champion

00:05:28.113 --> 00:05:31.178
and got invited to
the Poetry World Cup in Paris,

00:05:31.178 --> 00:05:32.617
which was unbelievable.

00:05:32.617 --> 00:05:36.133
It was people from all around the world
speaking in their native languages

00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:38.585
to be judged by five French strangers.

00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:40.744
(Laughter)

00:05:40.744 --> 00:05:44.715
And somehow, I won, which was great,

00:05:44.715 --> 00:05:47.849
and I've been able
to travel the world since doing it,

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.892
but it also means that this next piece

00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:53.375
is technically the best poem in the world.

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:57.369
(Laughter)

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:58.785
So...

00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:03.638
(Applause)

00:06:03.638 --> 00:06:06.633
According to five French strangers.

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:10.557
So this is "Paper People."

00:06:10.557 --> 00:06:12.636
I like people.

00:06:12.636 --> 00:06:14.992
I'd like some paper people.

00:06:14.992 --> 00:06:18.173
They’d be purple paper people.
Maybe pop-up purple paper people.

00:06:18.173 --> 00:06:20.913
Proper pop-up purple paper people.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:23.839
"How do you prop up
pop-up purple paper people?"

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:26.253
I hear you cry. Well I ...

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:29.011
I’d probably prop up proper
pop-up purple paper people

00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:32.662
with a proper pop-up
purple people paperclip,

00:06:32.662 --> 00:06:35.399
but I’d pre-prepare appropriate
adhesives as alternatives,

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:38.171
a cheeky pack of Blu Tack
just in case the paper slipped.

00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:40.254
Because I could build a pop-up metropolis.

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:43.135
but I wouldn’t wanna deal with all the
paper people politics.

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:45.496
paper politicians with their
paper-thin policies,

00:06:45.496 --> 00:06:47.720
broken promises
without appropriate apologies.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.575
There’d be a little paper me.
And a little paper you.

00:06:51.575 --> 00:06:54.799
And we could watch paper TV
and it would all be pay-per-view.

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:56.273
(Laughter)

00:06:56.273 --> 00:06:59.539
We’d see the poppy paper rappers
rap about their paper package

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:04.509
or watch paper people carriers
get stuck in paper traffic on the A4.

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:07.248
(Laughter) Paper.

00:07:07.248 --> 00:07:12.402
There’d be a paper princess Kate
but we’d all stare at paper Pippa,

00:07:12.402 --> 00:07:15.385
and then we’d all live in fear of
killer Jack the Paper-Ripper,

00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:18.439
because the paper propaganda
propagates the people's prejudices,

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:21.095
papers printing pictures of the
photogenic terrorists.

00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:23.615
A little paper me.
And a little paper you.

00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:26.288
And in a pop-up population
people’s problems pop up too.

00:07:26.288 --> 00:07:29.295
There’d be a pompous paper parliament
who remained out of touch,

00:07:29.295 --> 00:07:32.282
and who ignored the people's protests
about all the paper cuts,

00:07:32.282 --> 00:07:35.524
then the peaceful paper protests
would get blown to paper pieces,

00:07:35.524 --> 00:07:38.064
by the confetti cannons
manned by pre-emptive police.

00:07:38.064 --> 00:07:41.639
And yes there’d still be paper money,
so there’d still be paper greed,

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.358
and the paper piggy bankers
pocketing more than they need,

00:07:44.358 --> 00:07:47.106
purchasing the potpourri
to pepper their paper properties,

00:07:47.106 --> 00:07:49.776
others live in poverty
and ain’t acknowledged properly.

00:07:49.776 --> 00:07:52.248
A proper poor economy
where so many are proper poor,

00:07:52.248 --> 00:07:55.153
but while their needs are ignored
the money goes to big wars.

00:07:55.153 --> 00:07:57.245
Origami armies
unfold plans for paper planes

00:07:57.245 --> 00:07:59.605
and we remain imprisoned
in our own paper chains,

00:07:59.605 --> 00:08:03.264
but the greater shame
is that it always seems to stay the same,

00:08:03.264 --> 00:08:06.172
what changes is who’s in power
choosing how to lay the blame,

00:08:06.172 --> 00:08:09.611
they’re naming names,
forgetting these are names of people,

00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:12.697
because in the end
it all comes down to people.

00:08:12.697 --> 00:08:14.144
I like people.

00:08:14.144 --> 00:08:15.965
'Cause even when the situation’s dire,

00:08:15.965 --> 00:08:18.224
it is only ever people
who are able to inspire,

00:08:18.224 --> 00:08:21.459
and on paper,
it’s hard to see how we all cope.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.120
But in the bottom of Pandora’s box
there’s still hope,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.953
and I still hope
'cause I believe in people.

00:08:26.953 --> 00:08:29.275
People like my grandparents.

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:31.090
Who every single day since I was born,

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.305
have taken time out of their morning
to pray for me.

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:37.719
That’s 7892 days straight
of someone checking I’m okay,

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:39.713
and that’s amazing.

00:08:39.713 --> 00:08:42.417
People like my aunt who puts on
plays with prisoners.

00:08:42.417 --> 00:08:44.601
People who are capable
of genuine forgiveness.

00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:46.520
People like the persecuted Palestinians.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.174
People who go out of their way
to make your life better,

00:08:49.174 --> 00:08:50.868
and expect nothing in return.

00:08:50.868 --> 00:08:53.043
You see, people have potential
to be powerful.

00:08:53.043 --> 00:08:56.198
Just because the people in power
tend to pretend to be victims

00:08:56.198 --> 00:08:58.250
we don’t need to succumb to that system.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.595
And a paper population is no different.

00:09:00.595 --> 00:09:04.313
There’s a little paper me.
And a little paper you.

00:09:04.313 --> 00:09:06.941
And in a pop-up population
people's problems pop up too,

00:09:06.941 --> 00:09:10.324
but even if the whole world fell apart
then we’d still make it through.

00:09:10.324 --> 00:09:12.785
Because we’re people.

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:15.247
Thank you.

00:09:15.247 --> 00:09:19.496
(Applause)

00:09:30.688 --> 00:09:33.543
Thank you very much.
I've just got time for one more.

00:09:33.543 --> 00:09:37.038
For me, poetry has been the ultimate way
of ideas without frontiers.

00:09:37.038 --> 00:09:38.040
When I first started,

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.145
the people who inspired me
were the ones with the amazing stories,

00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:45.281
and I thought, as an 18-year-old
with a happy life, it was too normal,

00:09:45.281 --> 00:09:49.007
but I could create these worlds
where I could talk about my experiences

00:09:49.007 --> 00:09:50.331
and dreams and beliefs.

00:09:50.331 --> 00:09:53.326
So it's amazing to be here
in front of you today.

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:54.742
Thank you for being here.

00:09:54.742 --> 00:09:56.019
If you weren't here,

00:09:56.019 --> 00:09:58.759
it would be pretty much
like the sound check yesterday.

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:00.826
(Laughter)

00:10:00.826 --> 00:10:03.403
And this is more fun.

00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:05.563
So this last one is called
"The Sunshine Kid."

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:08.697
Thank you very much for listening.

00:10:08.697 --> 00:10:12.087
Old man sunshine was proud of his sun,

00:10:12.087 --> 00:10:14.553
And it brightened his day
to see his little boy run,

00:10:14.553 --> 00:10:17.219
Not because of what he’d done,
nor the problems overcome,

00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:20.134
But that despite that his disposition
remained a sunny one.

00:10:20.134 --> 00:10:22.730
It hadn’t always been like this.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.461
There’d been times when he’d tried
to hide his brightness,

00:10:25.461 --> 00:10:27.597
You see, every star
hits periods of hardship,

00:10:27.597 --> 00:10:30.801
It takes a brighter light
to inspire them through the darkness.

00:10:30.801 --> 00:10:33.155
If we go back to when
he was born in a nebula,

00:10:33.155 --> 00:10:35.474
We know that he never
was thought of as regular,

00:10:35.474 --> 00:10:37.210
Because he had a flair about him,

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.765
To say the Midas touch is wrong

00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:41.203
But all he went near
seemed to turn a little bronze,

00:10:41.203 --> 00:10:43.847
Yes this sun was loved
by some more than others,

00:10:43.847 --> 00:10:46.579
It was a case of Joseph
and his dreamcoat and his brothers

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:49.516
Because standing out from the crowd
had its pros and its cons,

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:52.106
And jealousy created enemies
in those he outshone

00:10:52.106 --> 00:10:53.417
Such as the Shadow People.

00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:55.818
Now the Shadow People
didn’t like the Sunshine Kid,

00:10:55.818 --> 00:10:58.585
Because he showed up the dark things
the Shadow People did,

00:10:58.585 --> 00:11:01.735
And when he shone he showed
the places where the Shadow People hid,

00:11:01.735 --> 00:11:04.353
So the Shadow People had
an evil plan to get rid of him,

00:11:04.353 --> 00:11:06.707
First up -- they made fun of his sunspots,

00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:09.525
Shooting his dreams from the sky,
their words were gunshots,

00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:12.103
Designed to remind him
he wasn’t very cool

00:11:12.103 --> 00:11:14.587
And he didn’t fit in with any
popular kids at school.

00:11:14.587 --> 00:11:18.152
They said his head was up in space
and they would bring him down to Earth,

00:11:18.152 --> 00:11:21.143
Essentially he came from nothing
and that is what he was worth,

00:11:21.143 --> 00:11:23.277
He’d never get to go
to university to learn,

00:11:23.277 --> 00:11:26.046
Only degrees he’d ever show
would be the first degree burns

00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:27.754
From those that came too close,

00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:29.342
they told him he was too bright,

00:11:29.342 --> 00:11:31.519
That’s why no one ever
looked him in the eyes,

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.991
His judgment became clouded

00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:34.915
So did the sky,
With evaporated tears

00:11:34.915 --> 00:11:36.158
as the sun started to cry.

00:11:36.158 --> 00:11:41.405
Because the sunshine kid was bright,
with a warm personality,

00:11:41.405 --> 00:11:43.332
And inside he burned savagely

00:11:43.332 --> 00:11:45.701
Hurt by the words and curses
of the shadowy folk

00:11:45.701 --> 00:11:48.278
who spoke holes in his soul
and left cavities,

00:11:48.278 --> 00:11:52.016
And as his heart hardened,
his spark darkened,

00:11:52.016 --> 00:11:54.600
Every time they called him names
it cooled his flames,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.277
He thought they might like him
if he kept his light dim

00:11:57.277 --> 00:12:00.468
But they were busy telling lightning
she had terrible aim,

00:12:00.468 --> 00:12:03.254
He couldn’t quite get to grips
with what they said,

00:12:03.254 --> 00:12:06.096
So he let his light be eclipsed
by what they said,

00:12:06.096 --> 00:12:08.235
He fell into a Lone Star State like Texas,

00:12:08.235 --> 00:12:10.661
And felt like he’d been punched
in his solar plexus.

00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:14.718
But that’s when
Little Miss Sunshine came along

00:12:14.718 --> 00:12:17.650
Singing her favorite song
about how we’re made to be strong,

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.156
And you don’t have to be wrong to belong,
Just be true to who you are,

00:12:21.156 --> 00:12:23.362
because we are all stars at heart.

00:12:23.362 --> 00:12:27.193
Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff,

00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:29.458
The kind of girl when you looked at her

00:12:29.458 --> 00:12:31.174
you forgot stuff,

00:12:31.174 --> 00:12:33.164
But for him, there was no forgetting her,

00:12:33.164 --> 00:12:35.645
The minute he saw her
her image burned in his retina,

00:12:35.645 --> 00:12:37.957
She was out of this world,
and she accepted him,

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:41.220
Something about this girl meant he knew
whenever she was next to him,

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.121
Things weren’t as dark as they seemed,
and he dared to dream,

00:12:44.121 --> 00:12:47.055
Shadows were nowhere to be seen;
when she was there he beamed,

00:12:47.055 --> 00:12:49.528
His eyes would light up
in ways that can’t be faked,

00:12:49.528 --> 00:12:52.667
When she grinned her rays erased
the razor-tipped words of hate,

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:55.865
They gave each other nicknames,
they were "cool star" and "fun sun,"

00:12:55.865 --> 00:12:58.615
And gradually the shadowy
damage became undone,

00:12:58.615 --> 00:13:02.552
She was one in a septillion,
and she was brilliant,

00:13:02.552 --> 00:13:05.371
Could turn the coldest blooded
reptilians vermillion,

00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:08.038
Loved by billions,
from Chileans to Brazilians,

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.730
And taught the Sunshine Kid
the meaning of resilience.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.562
She said: “All the darkness in the world

00:13:13.562 --> 00:13:16.836
cannot put out the light
from a single candle

00:13:16.836 --> 00:13:18.946
So how the hell can they
handle your light?

00:13:18.946 --> 00:13:21.875
Only you can choose to dim it,
and the sky is the limit,

00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:23.692
so silence the critics by burning.”

00:13:23.692 --> 00:13:26.861
And if eyes are windows to the soul
then she drew back the curtains

00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:28.841
And let the sun shine
through the hurting.

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:31.429
In a universe of adversity
these stars stuck together,

00:13:31.429 --> 00:13:34.335
And though days became nights
the memories would last forever,

00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:37.031
Whether the weatherman
said it or not, it would be fine,

00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:39.668
'Cause even behind the clouds
the kid could still shine.

00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:42.531
Yes, the Sunshine Kid was bright,
with a warm personality,

00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:44.188
And inside he burned savagely,

00:13:44.188 --> 00:13:47.532
Fueled by the fire
inspired across galaxies

00:13:47.532 --> 00:13:50.318
By the girl who showed him belief.

00:13:50.318 --> 00:13:53.058
Thank you very much.

00:13:53.058 --> 00:13:59.722
(Applause)
