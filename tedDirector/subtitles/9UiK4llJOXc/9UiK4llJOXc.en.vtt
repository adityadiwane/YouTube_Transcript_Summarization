00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.561
I want to talk to you about,

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:19.122
or share with you, a
breakthrough new approach

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:22.464
for managing items of
inventory inside of a warehouse.

00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:25.022
We're talking about a pick,
pack and ship setting here.

00:00:25.022 --> 00:00:27.845
So as a hint,

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:31.998
this solution involves
hundreds of mobile robots,

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:34.422
sometimes thousands
of mobile robots,

00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:37.020
moving around a warehouse.
And I'll get to the solution.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.240
But for a moment, just think

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.766
about the last time that
you ordered something online.

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.830
You were sitting
on your couch

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.890
and you decided that you
absolutely had to have this red t-shirt.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.186
So — click! — you put it
into your shopping cart.

00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:51.084
And then you decided
that green pair of pants

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.982
looks pretty good too — click!

00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:54.882
And maybe a blue
pair of shoes — click!

00:00:54.882 --> 00:00:56.932
So at this point you've
assembled your order.

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:58.700
You didn't stop to think 
for a moment that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.468
that might not be a great outfit.

00:01:00.468 --> 00:01:02.238
But you hit
"submit order."

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:06.412
And two days later, this package
shows up on your doorstep.

00:01:06.412 --> 00:01:09.366
And you open the box and you're
like, wow, there's my goo.

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.327
Did you ever stop to think about
how those items of inventory

00:01:12.327 --> 00:01:16.540
actually found their way inside
that box in the warehouse?

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.358
So I'm here to tell you 
it's that guy right there.

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:23.978
So deep in the
middle of that picture,

00:01:23.978 --> 00:01:26.493
you see a classic
pick-pack worker

00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:29.718
in a distribution or
order fulfillments setting.

00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:33.600
Classically these pick workers will 
spend 60 or 70 percent of their day

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.512
wandering around
the warehouse.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:38.223
They'll often walk
as much as 5 or 10 miles

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.884
in pursuit of
those items of inventory.

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:45.305
Not only is this an
unproductive way to fill orders,

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:49.362
it also turns out to be an
unfulfilling way to fill orders.

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:52.993
So let me tell you where I
first bumped into this problem.

00:01:52.993 --> 00:01:57.047
I was out in the Bay area 
in '99, 2000, the dot com boom.

00:01:57.047 --> 00:02:01.109
I worked for a fabulously
spectacular flame-out called Webvan.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:02.930
(Laughter)

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.660
This company raised hundreds of
millions of dollars with the notion that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.442
we will deliver
grocery orders online.

00:02:08.442 --> 00:02:12.615
And it really came down to the fact
that we couldn't do it cost effectively.

00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:16.577
Turns out e-commerce was something
that was very hard and very costly.

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:20.828
In this particular instance we were trying
to assemble 30 items of inventory

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:24.800
into a few totes, onto a van
to deliver to the home.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.600
And when you think about it,
it was costing us 30 dollars.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.686
Imagine, we had an
89¢ can of soup

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:35.362
that was costing us one dollar to
pick and pack into that tote.

00:02:35.362 --> 00:02:38.570
And that's before we actually
tried to deliver it to the home.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.357
So long story short,
during my one year at Webvan,

00:02:41.357 --> 00:02:44.593
what I realized by talking to 
all the material-handling providers

00:02:44.593 --> 00:02:49.231
was that there was no solution designed
specifically to solve each base picking.

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:53.254
Red item, green, blue, getting
those three things in a box.

00:02:53.254 --> 00:02:56.239
So we said, there's just
got to be a better way to do this.

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.766
Existing material handling
was set up to pump

00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:02.533
pallets and cases of
goo to retail stores.

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:06.330
Of course Webvan went out of business,
and about a year and a half later,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.910
I was still noodling on this problem.
It was still nagging at me.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.778
And I started
thinking about it again.

00:03:11.778 --> 00:03:16.905
And I said, let me just focus briefly
on what I wanted as a pick worker,

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.236
or my vision for
how it should work.

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:20.650
(Laughter)

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.572
I said, let's focus
on the problem.

00:03:22.572 --> 00:03:26.427
I have an order here and what
I want to do is I want to put

00:03:26.427 --> 00:03:28.647
red, green and blue
in this box right here.

00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:31.499
What I need is a system where I put out
my hand and — poof! —

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.022
the product shows up 
and I pack it into the order,

00:03:34.022 --> 00:03:35.715
and now we're thinking,

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:39.729
this would be a very operator-centric
approach to solving the problem.

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:43.956
This is what I need. What technology
is available to solve this problem?

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:47.897
But as you can see, orders can come
and go, products can come and go.

00:03:47.897 --> 00:03:52.580
It allows us to focus on making the
pick worker the center of the problem,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.204
and providing them the tools to make
them as productive as possible.

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:59.304
So how did I
arrive at this notion?

00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:02.837
Well, actually it came from
a brainstorming exercise,

00:04:02.837 --> 00:04:05.677
probably a technique
that many of you use,

00:04:05.677 --> 00:04:07.833
It's this notion of
testing your ideas.

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:09.563
Take a blank sheet, of course,

00:04:09.563 --> 00:04:13.593
but then test your ideas
at the limits — infinity, zero.

00:04:13.593 --> 00:04:16.775
In this particular case, we
challenged ourselves with the idea:

00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:19.751
What if we had to build a
distribution center in China,

00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:22.365
where it's a very,
very low-cost market?

00:04:22.365 --> 00:04:25.578
And say, labor is cheap,
land is cheap.

00:04:25.578 --> 00:04:27.224
And we said specifically,

00:04:27.224 --> 00:04:30.230
"What if it was zero dollars
an hour for direct labor

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.946
and we could build a million-
square-foot distribution center?"

00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:35.021
So naturally that
led to ideas that said,

00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:36.829
"Let's put lots of people
in the warehouse."

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:39.374
And I said, "Hold on,
zero dollars per hour,

00:04:39.374 --> 00:04:42.231
what I would do is 'hire'

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:46.358
10,000 workers to come to the
warehouse every morning at 8 a.m.,

00:04:46.358 --> 00:04:49.477
walk into the warehouse and
pick up one item of inventory

00:04:49.477 --> 00:04:51.210
and then just stand there.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.749
So you hold Captain Crunch,
you hold the Mountain Dew,

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.172
you hold the Diet Coke.

00:04:55.172 --> 00:04:57.428
If I need it, I'll call you,
otherwise just stand there.

00:04:57.428 --> 00:05:00.815
But when I need Diet Coke and I call it,
you guys talk amongst yourselves.

00:05:00.815 --> 00:05:04.936
Diet Coke walks up to the front —
pick it, put it in the tote, away it goes."

00:05:04.936 --> 00:05:09.588
Wow, what if the products
could walk and talk on their own?

00:05:09.588 --> 00:05:11.926
That's a very interesting,
very powerful way

00:05:11.926 --> 00:05:14.520
that we could potentially
organize this warehouse.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.868
So of course,
labor isn't free,

00:05:16.868 --> 00:05:20.176
on that practical
versus awesome spectrum.

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:21.866
(Laughter)

00:05:21.866 --> 00:05:24.983
So we said mobile shelving —
We'll put them on mobile shelving.

00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:29.776
We'll use mobile robots and
we'll move the inventory around.

00:05:29.776 --> 00:05:34.194
And so we got underway on that and
then I'm sitting on my couch in 2008.

00:05:34.194 --> 00:05:38.013
Did any of you see the Beijing
Olympics, the opening ceremonies?

00:05:38.013 --> 00:05:41.054
I about fell out of my
couch when I saw this.

00:05:41.054 --> 00:05:42.527
I'm like, that was the idea!

00:05:42.527 --> 00:05:47.026
(Laughter and Applause)

00:05:47.026 --> 00:05:50.917
We'll put thousands of people on
the warehouse floor, the stadium floor.

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:54.952
But interestingly enough, this
actually relates to the idea

00:05:54.952 --> 00:06:00.364
in that these guys were creating some
incredibly powerful, impressive digital art,

00:06:00.364 --> 00:06:02.440
all without computers,
I'm told,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.886
it was all peer-to-peer
coordination and communication.

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:06.462
You stand up,
I'll squat down.

00:06:06.462 --> 00:06:08.107
And they made
some fabulous art.

00:06:08.107 --> 00:06:10.795
It speaks to the
power of emergence

00:06:10.795 --> 00:06:14.763
in systems when you let things
start to talk with each other.

00:06:14.763 --> 00:06:18.541
So that was a little
bit of the journey.

00:06:18.541 --> 00:06:22.579
So of course, now what became
the practical reality of this idea?

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:24.385
Here is a warehouse.

00:06:24.385 --> 00:06:28.161
It's a pick, pack and ship center
that has about 10,000 different SKUs.

00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:32.298
We'll call them red pens,
green pens, yellow Post-It Notes.

00:06:32.298 --> 00:06:35.677
We send the little orange robots
out to pick up the blue shelving pods.

00:06:35.677 --> 00:06:37.845
And we deliver them
to the side of the building.

00:06:37.845 --> 00:06:40.981
So all the pick workers now
get to stay on the perimeter.

00:06:40.981 --> 00:06:43.323
And the game here is
to pick up the shelves,

00:06:43.323 --> 00:06:46.647
take them down the highway and
deliver them straight to the pick worker.

00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:48.784
This pick worker's life
is completely different.

00:06:48.784 --> 00:06:52.201
Rather than wandering around
the warehouse, she gets to stay still

00:06:52.201 --> 00:06:53.789
in a pick station like this

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.787
and every product in the
building can now come to her.

00:06:57.787 --> 00:07:01.065
So the process
is very productive.

00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:05.260
Reach in, pick an item,
scan the bar code, pack it out.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.909
By the time
you turn around,

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:09.948
there's another product there
ready to be picked and packed.

00:07:09.948 --> 00:07:12.958
So what we've done is take
out all of the non-value added

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.642
walking, searching,
wasting, waited time,

00:07:15.642 --> 00:07:19.920
and we've developed a very 
high-fidelity way to pick these orders,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.084
where you point at it with
a laser, scan the UPC barcode,

00:07:24.084 --> 00:07:27.278
and then indicate with a light
which box it needs to go into.

00:07:27.278 --> 00:07:30.764
So more productive, more
accurate and, it turns out,

00:07:30.764 --> 00:07:35.070
it's a more interesting office
environment for these pick workers.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.507
They actually complete
the whole order.

00:07:37.507 --> 00:07:40.034
So they do red, green and blue,
not just a part of the order.

00:07:40.034 --> 00:07:43.648
And they feel a little bit more
in control of their environment.

00:07:43.648 --> 00:07:46.846
So the side effects
of this approach

00:07:46.846 --> 00:07:48.414
are what really surprised us.

00:07:48.414 --> 00:07:49.992
We knew it was going 
to be more productive.

00:07:49.992 --> 00:07:54.062
But we didn't realize just how
pervasive this way of thinking

00:07:54.062 --> 00:07:59.292
extended to other
functions in the warehouse.

00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:04.124
But what effectively this approach
is doing inside of the DC

00:08:04.124 --> 00:08:08.588
is turning it into a massively
parallel processing engine.

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:11.211
So this is again a
cross-fertilization of ideas.

00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:13.150
Here's a warehouse
and we're thinking about

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.669
parallel processing
supercomputer architectures.

00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:19.066
The notion here is that you have

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:21.863
10 workers on 
the right side of the screen

00:08:21.863 --> 00:08:26.111
that are now all independent
autonomous pick workers.

00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:30.015
If the worker in station three decides
to leave and go to the bathroom,

00:08:30.015 --> 00:08:33.499
it has no impact on the
productivity of the other nine workers.

00:08:33.499 --> 00:08:37.869
Contrast that, for a moment, with the
traditional method of using a conveyor.

00:08:37.869 --> 00:08:39.928
When one person
passes the order to you,

00:08:39.928 --> 00:08:42.427
you put something in
and pass it downstream.

00:08:42.427 --> 00:08:45.544
Everyone has to be in place
for that serial process to work.

00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:48.721
This becomes a more robust
way to think about the warehouse.

00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:53.265
And then underneath the hoods gets
interesting in that we're tracking

00:08:53.265 --> 00:08:55.003
the popularity
of the products.

00:08:55.003 --> 00:08:57.827
And we're using dynamic
and adaptive algorithms

00:08:57.827 --> 00:09:02.281
to tune the floor
of the warehouse.

00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:07.165
So what you see here potentially
the week leading up to Valentine's Day.

00:09:07.165 --> 00:09:11.008
All that pink chalky candy has
moved to the front of the building

00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:14.901
and is now being picked into a
lot of orders in those pick stations.

00:09:14.901 --> 00:09:19.064
Come in two days after Valentine's Day,
and that candy, the leftover candy,

00:09:19.064 --> 00:09:21.337
has all drifted to the
back of the warehouse

00:09:21.337 --> 00:09:25.630
and is occupying the cooler
zone on the thermal map there.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.113
One other side effect of this
approach using the parallel processing

00:09:29.113 --> 00:09:32.108
is these things can
scale to ginormous.

00:09:32.108 --> 00:09:33.635
(Laughter)

00:09:33.635 --> 00:09:36.369
So whether you're doing
two pick stations, 20 pick stations,

00:09:36.369 --> 00:09:39.642
or 200 pick stations, the
path planning algorithms

00:09:39.642 --> 00:09:42.185
and all of the inventory
algorithms just work.

00:09:42.185 --> 00:09:46.541
In this example you
see that the inventory

00:09:46.541 --> 00:09:48.867
has now occupied all the
perimeter of the building

00:09:48.867 --> 00:09:51.213
because that's where
the pick stations were.

00:09:51.213 --> 00:09:53.231
They sorted it
out for themselves.

00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:55.518
So I'll conclude with
just one final video

00:09:55.518 --> 00:09:58.502
that shows how
this comes to bear

00:09:58.502 --> 00:10:02.096
on the pick worker's actual
day in the life of.

00:10:02.096 --> 00:10:06.432
So as we mentioned, the process is
to move inventory along the highway

00:10:06.432 --> 00:10:09.084
and then find your way
into these pick stations.

00:10:09.084 --> 00:10:11.555
And our software in the background

00:10:11.555 --> 00:10:14.306
understands what's going on 
in each station,

00:10:14.306 --> 00:10:16.917
we direct the pods
across the highway

00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:19.631
and we're attempting to
get into a queuing system

00:10:19.631 --> 00:10:22.515
to present the work
to the pick worker.

00:10:22.515 --> 00:10:25.760
What's interesting is we can even
adapt the speed of the pick workers.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.686
The faster pickers get more pods
and the slower pickers get few.

00:10:29.686 --> 00:10:32.824
But this pick worker now is
literally having that experience

00:10:32.824 --> 00:10:34.677
that we described before.

00:10:34.677 --> 00:10:37.221
She puts out her hand.
The product jumps into it.

00:10:37.221 --> 00:10:39.426
Or she has to reach in and get it.

00:10:39.426 --> 00:10:41.871
She scans it and 
she puts it in the bucket.

00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:45.667
And all of the rest of the technology
is kind of behind the scenes.

00:10:45.667 --> 00:10:49.528
So she gets to now focus on the
picking and packing portion of her job.

00:10:49.528 --> 00:10:52.802
Never has any idle time,
never has to leave her mat.

00:10:52.802 --> 00:10:56.942
And actually we think
not only a more productive

00:10:56.942 --> 00:11:00.212
and more accurate
way to fill orders.

00:11:00.212 --> 00:11:03.622
We think it's a more
fulfilling way to fill orders.

00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:06.830
The reason we can say
that, though, is that workers

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.972
in a lot of these
buildings now compete

00:11:08.972 --> 00:11:12.154
for the privilege of working
in the Kiva zone that day.

00:11:12.154 --> 00:11:14.817
And sometimes we'll catch
them on testimonial videos

00:11:14.817 --> 00:11:16.934
saying such things as,

00:11:16.934 --> 00:11:21.180
they have more energy after the
day to play with their grandchildren,

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.776
or in one case a guy said, "the
Kiva zone is so stress-free

00:11:25.776 --> 00:11:28.891
that I've actually stopped taking
my blood pressure medication."

00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:30.725
(Laughter)

00:11:30.725 --> 00:11:34.724
That was at a pharmaceutical distributor,
so they told us not to use that video.

00:11:34.724 --> 00:11:38.292
(Laughter)

00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:41.316
So what I wanted to leave you
with today is the notion that

00:11:41.316 --> 00:11:44.171
when you let things start
to think and walk

00:11:44.171 --> 00:11:49.462
and talk on their own, interesting
processes and productivities can emerge.

00:11:49.462 --> 00:11:52.403
And now I think next time
you go to your front step

00:11:52.403 --> 00:11:54.914
and pick up that box that
you just ordered online,

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:57.138
you break it open and
the goo is in there,

00:11:57.138 --> 00:11:59.891
you'll have some wonderment
as to whether a robot

00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:02.484
assisted in the picking
and packing of that order.

00:12:02.484 --> 00:12:04.163
Thank you.

00:12:04.163 --> 00:12:08.793
(Applause)
