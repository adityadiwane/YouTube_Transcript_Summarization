Guillaume Néry, France.

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:43.841
Constant weight, 123 meters,

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.123
three minutes and 25 seconds.

00:00:46.147 --> 00:00:48.341
National record attempt.

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:21.175
70 meters.

00:01:32.056 --> 00:01:34.119
[123 meters]

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:24.124

Guillaume Néry! National record!

00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:30.991
Guillaume Néry: Thank you.

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:34.048
(Applause)

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.394
Thank you very much,
thanks for the warm welcome.

00:02:37.418 --> 00:02:40.622
That dive you just watched is a journey --

00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:42.860
a journey between two breaths.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:45.662
A journey that takes place
between two breaths --

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:47.940
the last one before diving into the water,

00:02:47.964 --> 00:02:50.794
and the first one,
coming back to the surface.

00:02:51.394 --> 00:02:55.768
That dive is a journey
to the very limits of human possibility,

00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:57.728
a journey into the unknown.

00:02:58.315 --> 00:03:01.846
But it's also, and above all,
an inner journey,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.264
where a number of things happen,

00:03:04.288 --> 00:03:06.617
physiologically as well as mentally.

00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.657
And that's why I'm here today,

00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:12.014
to share my journey with you
and to take you along with me.

00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:14.503
So, we start with the last breath.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:19.062
(Breathing in)

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.119
(Breathing out)

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:35.586
As you noticed, that last breath
in is slow, deep and intense.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.166
It ends with a special technique
called the carp,

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.831
which allows me to store one to two
extra liters of air in my lungs

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:43.968
by compressing it.

00:03:43.992 --> 00:03:48.587
When I leave the surface,
I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:53.060
As soon as I leave the surface
the first mechanism kicks in:

00:03:53.084 --> 00:03:54.520
the diving reflex.

00:03:54.544 --> 00:03:59.428
The first thing the diving reflex does
is make your heart rate drop.

00:03:59.452 --> 00:04:02.285
My heart beat will drop
from about 60-70 per minute

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.089
to about 30-40 beats per minute

00:04:04.113 --> 00:04:07.034
in a matter of seconds;
almost immediately.

00:04:07.058 --> 00:04:10.147
Next, the diving reflex causes
peripheral vasoconstriction,

00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:14.341
which means that the blood flow
will leave the body's extremities

00:04:14.365 --> 00:04:17.709
to feed the most important organs:

00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:21.803
the lungs, the heart and the brain.

00:04:22.602 --> 00:04:26.086
This mechanism is innate.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.526
I cannot control it.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.342
If you go underwater,
even if you've never done it before,

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:32.711
you'll experience the exact same effects.

00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:36.358
All human beings
share this characteristic.

00:04:36.382 --> 00:04:38.308
And what's extraordinary

00:04:38.332 --> 00:04:41.849
is that we share this instinct
with marine mammals --

00:04:41.873 --> 00:04:45.531
all marine mammals:
dolphins, whales, sea lions, etc.

00:04:45.555 --> 00:04:50.151
When they dive deep into the ocean,
these mechanisms become activated,

00:04:50.175 --> 00:04:51.508
but to a greater extent.

00:04:51.532 --> 00:04:54.055
And, of course, it works
much better for them.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.364
It's absolutely fascinating.

00:04:57.388 --> 00:04:58.814
Right as I leave the surface,

00:04:58.838 --> 00:05:01.147
nature gives me a push
in the right direction,

00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:03.563
allowing me to descend with confidence.

00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:05.603
So as I dive deeper into the blue,

00:05:05.627 --> 00:05:09.619
the pressure slowly starts
to squeeze my lungs.

00:05:10.338 --> 00:05:13.589
And since it's the amount of air
in my lungs that makes me float,

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:16.541
the farther down I go,
the more pressure there is on my lungs,

00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:20.168
the less air they contain
and the easier it is for my body to fall.

00:05:20.192 --> 00:05:22.995
And at one point,
around 35 or 40 meters down,

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:25.708
I don't even need to swim.

00:05:26.468 --> 00:05:31.239
My body is dense and heavy enough
to fall into the depths by itself,

00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:33.858
and I enter what's called
the free fall phase.

00:05:33.882 --> 00:05:36.604
The free fall phase
is the best part of the dive.

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.506
It's the reason I still dive.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.490
Because it feels like
you're being pulled down

00:05:43.401 --> 00:05:45.098
and you don't need to do anything.

00:05:45.122 --> 00:05:49.016
I can go from 35 meters to 123 meters
without making a single movement.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.982
I let myself be pulled by the depths,

00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:52.944
and it feels like I'm flying underwater.

00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:56.951
It's truly an amazing feeling --
an extraordinary feeling of freedom.

00:05:56.975 --> 00:05:59.958
And so I slowly continue
sliding to the bottom.

00:05:59.982 --> 00:06:01.262
40 meters down,

00:06:01.286 --> 00:06:02.583
50 meters down,

00:06:02.607 --> 00:06:06.834
and between 50 and 60 meters,
a second physiological response kicks in.

00:06:07.702 --> 00:06:10.218
My lungs reach residual volume,

00:06:10.242 --> 00:06:15.181
below which they're not supposed
to be compressed, in theory.

00:06:15.205 --> 00:06:18.731
And this second response
is called blood shift,

00:06:18.755 --> 00:06:21.358
or "pulmonary erection" in French.

00:06:22.236 --> 00:06:23.545
I prefer "blood shift."

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:24.726
(Laughter)

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.495
So blood shift -- how does it work?

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:32.093
The capillaries in the lungs
become engorged with blood --

00:06:32.117 --> 00:06:33.710
which is caused by the suction --

00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:35.445
so the lungs can harden

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:38.141
and protect the whole chest cavity
from being crushed.

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:42.068
It prevents the two walls
of the lungs from collapsing,

00:06:42.092 --> 00:06:44.054
from sticking together and caving in.

00:06:44.078 --> 00:06:47.967
Thanks to this phenomenon,
which we also share with marine mammals,

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.694
I'm able to continue with my dive.

00:06:49.718 --> 00:06:53.294
60, 70 meters down,
I keep falling, faster and faster,

00:06:53.318 --> 00:06:56.230
because the pressure is crushing
my body more and more.

00:06:56.254 --> 00:06:57.777
Below 80 meters,

00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:00.370
the pressure becomes a lot stronger,

00:07:00.394 --> 00:07:02.465
and I start to feel it physically.

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:04.494
I really start to feel the suffocation.

00:07:04.518 --> 00:07:06.978
You can see what it looks like --
not pretty at all.

00:07:07.002 --> 00:07:11.240
The diaphragm is completely collapsed,
the rib cage is squeezed in,

00:07:11.824 --> 00:07:14.307
and mentally, there is something
going on as well.

00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:17.098
You may be thinking,
"This doesn't look enjoyable.

00:07:17.122 --> 00:07:18.421
How do you do it?"

00:07:18.445 --> 00:07:20.246
If I relied on my earthly reflexes --

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.733
what do we do above water
when there's a problem?

00:07:23.757 --> 00:07:25.966
We resist, we go against it.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.333
We fight.

00:07:27.357 --> 00:07:28.889
Underwater, that doesn't work.

00:07:28.913 --> 00:07:31.505
If you try that underwater,
you might tear your lungs,

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:33.095
spit up blood, develop an edema

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:36.254
and you'll have to stop diving
for a good amount of time.

00:07:36.278 --> 00:07:39.452
So what you need to do, mentally,
is to tell yourself

00:07:39.476 --> 00:07:42.246
that nature and the elements
are stronger than you.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.896
And so I let the water crush me.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.768
I accept the pressure and go with it.

00:07:48.481 --> 00:07:50.825
At this point, my body
receives this information,

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:52.707
and my lungs start relaxing.

00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:55.874
I relinquish all control,
and relax completely.

00:07:55.898 --> 00:07:59.748
The pressure starts crushing me,
and it doesn't feel bad at all.

00:07:59.772 --> 00:08:03.082
I even feel like
I'm in a cocoon, protected.

00:08:03.106 --> 00:08:05.678
And the dive continues.

00:08:05.702 --> 00:08:07.400
80, 85 meters down,

00:08:07.424 --> 00:08:08.643
90,

00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:09.850
100.

00:08:09.874 --> 00:08:12.460
100 meters -- the magic number.

00:08:13.024 --> 00:08:14.886
In every sport, it's a magic number.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.740
For swimmers and athletes
and also for us, free divers,

00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:19.410
it's a number everyone dreams of.

00:08:19.434 --> 00:08:22.832
Everyone wishes one day
to be able to get to 100 meters.

00:08:22.856 --> 00:08:24.641
And it's a symbolic number for us,

00:08:24.665 --> 00:08:28.532
because in the 1970s,
doctors and physiologists did their math,

00:08:28.556 --> 00:08:33.865
and predicted that the human body
would not be able to go below 100 meters.

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:36.745
Below that, they said,
the human body would implode.

00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:38.881
And then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol --

00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:41.198
you all know him as the hero
in "The Big Blue" --

00:08:41.222 --> 00:08:44.475
came along and dived down to 100 meters.

00:08:44.499 --> 00:08:46.064
He even reached 105 meters.

00:08:46.088 --> 00:08:47.984
At that time, he was doing "no limits."

00:08:48.008 --> 00:08:51.357
He'd use weights to descend faster
and come back up with a balloon,

00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:52.553
just like in the movie.

00:08:52.577 --> 00:08:55.155
Today, we go down 200 meters
in no limit free diving.

00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:58.035
I can do 123 meters
by simply using muscle strength.

00:08:58.059 --> 00:09:01.790
And in a way, it's all thanks to him,
because he challenged known facts,

00:09:01.814 --> 00:09:06.181
and with a sweep of his hand,
got rid of the theoretical beliefs

00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:09.606
and all the mental limits
that we like to impose on ourselves.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.246
He showed us that the human body
has an infinite ability to adapt.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.989
So I carry on with my dive.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:17.147
105, 110, 115.

00:09:17.171 --> 00:09:18.941
The bottom is getting closer.

00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:20.441
120,

00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:21.655
123 meters.

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:22.958
I'm at the bottom.

00:09:22.982 --> 00:09:26.592
And now, I'd like to ask you to join me
and put yourself in my place.

00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:28.251
Close your eyes.

00:09:28.752 --> 00:09:31.521
Imagine you get to 123 meters.

00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:36.125
The surface is far, far away.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.176
You're alone.

00:09:39.864 --> 00:09:41.621
There's hardly any light.

00:09:42.324 --> 00:09:43.579
It's cold --

00:09:43.603 --> 00:09:44.960
freezing cold.

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:47.037
The pressure is crushing you completely --

00:09:47.061 --> 00:09:49.147
13 times stronger than on the surface.

00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:52.123
And I know what you're thinking:

00:09:52.147 --> 00:09:54.096
"This is horrible.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.976
What the hell am I doing here?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.690
He's insane."

00:09:58.484 --> 00:09:59.650
But no.

00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:02.291
That's not what I think
when I'm down there.

00:10:02.315 --> 00:10:04.040
When I'm at the bottom, I feel good.

00:10:04.064 --> 00:10:06.321
I get this extraordinary
feeling of well-being.

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:09.234
Maybe it's because I've completely
released all tensions

00:10:09.258 --> 00:10:10.979
and let myself go.

00:10:11.003 --> 00:10:14.464
I feel great, without the need to breathe.

00:10:17.238 --> 00:10:21.198
Although, you'd agree,
I should be worried.

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:24.322
I feel like a tiny dot,
a little drop of water,

00:10:24.346 --> 00:10:26.196
floating in the middle of the ocean.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.855
And each time, I picture the same image.

00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:32.045
[The Pale Blue Dot]

00:10:32.473 --> 00:10:34.927
It's that small dot
the arrow is pointing to.

00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:36.473
Do you know what it is?

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.870
It's planet Earth.

00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:42.139
Planet Earth, photographed
by the Voyager probe,

00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:44.315
from 4 billion kilometers away.

00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:48.435
And it shows that our home
is that small dot over there,

00:10:48.459 --> 00:10:50.102
floating in the middle of nothing.

00:10:50.126 --> 00:10:52.047
That's how I feel

00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:54.222
when I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters.

00:10:54.246 --> 00:10:55.961
I feel like a small dot,

00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:58.540
a speck of dust, stardust,

00:10:58.564 --> 00:11:00.779
floating in the middle of the cosmos,

00:11:00.803 --> 00:11:03.247
in the middle of nothing,
in the immensity of space.

00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:04.712
It's a fascinating sensation,

00:11:04.736 --> 00:11:08.791
because when I look up, down,
left, right, in front, behind,

00:11:08.815 --> 00:11:12.006
I see the same thing:
the infinite deep blue.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.046
Nowhere else on Earth
you can experience this --

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.633
looking all around you,
and seeing the same thing.

00:11:18.657 --> 00:11:19.907
It's extraordinary.

00:11:20.562 --> 00:11:22.002
And at that moment,

00:11:22.026 --> 00:11:25.027
I still get that feeling each time,
building up inside of me --

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:27.573
the feeling of humility.

00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:31.781
Looking at this picture,
I feel very humble --

00:11:31.805 --> 00:11:34.336
just like when I'm all the way
down at the bottom --

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.637
because I'm nothing,

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:38.986
I'm a little speck of nothingness
lost in all of time and space.

00:11:39.652 --> 00:11:41.969
And it still is absolutely fascinating.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.463
I decide to go back to the surface,
because this is not where I belong.

00:11:46.487 --> 00:11:48.716
I belong up there, on the surface.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.917
So I start heading back up.

00:11:52.018 --> 00:11:56.269
I get something of a shock

00:11:56.293 --> 00:11:58.756
at the very moment when I decide to go up.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.687
First, because it takes a huge effort
to tear yourself away from the bottom.

00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:05.191
It pulled you down on the way in,

00:12:05.215 --> 00:12:07.098
and will do the same on the way up.

00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:08.937
You have to swim twice as hard.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.508
Then, I'm hit with another
phenomenon known as narcosis.

00:12:13.522 --> 00:12:15.294
I don't know if you've heard of that.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:17.445
It's called nitrogen narcosis.

00:12:17.469 --> 00:12:19.606
It's something that happens
to scuba divers,

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.249
but it can happen to free divers.

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:24.802
It's caused by nitrogen
dissolving in the blood,

00:12:24.826 --> 00:12:26.720
which causes confusion

00:12:26.744 --> 00:12:29.347
between the conscious
and unconscious mind.

00:12:30.212 --> 00:12:34.419
A flurry of thoughts goes spinning
through your head.

00:12:34.443 --> 00:12:37.439
You can't control them,
and you shouldn't try to --

00:12:37.463 --> 00:12:39.047
you have to let it happen.

00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:42.778
The more you try to control it,
the harder it is to manage.

00:12:43.223 --> 00:12:44.691
Then, a third thing happens:

00:12:44.715 --> 00:12:45.984
the desire to breathe.

00:12:46.008 --> 00:12:48.318
I'm not a fish, I'm a human being,

00:12:48.342 --> 00:12:51.863
and the desire to breathe
reminds me of that fact.

00:12:51.887 --> 00:12:53.751
Around 60, 70 meters,

00:12:55.551 --> 00:12:57.804
you start to feel the need to breathe.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.086
And with everything else that's going on,

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.047
you can very easily lose your ground

00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:06.610
and start to panic.

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:10.292
When that happens, you think,
"Where's the surface?

00:13:10.316 --> 00:13:12.251
I want to go up. I want to breathe now."

00:13:12.275 --> 00:13:13.907
You should not do that.

00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:15.765
Never look up to the surface --

00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:18.418
not with your eyes, or your mind.

00:13:19.161 --> 00:13:21.890
You should never
picture yourself up there.

00:13:21.914 --> 00:13:23.552
You have to stay in the present.

00:13:23.576 --> 00:13:28.398
I look at the rope right in front of me,
leading me back to the surface.

00:13:28.834 --> 00:13:31.344
And I focus on that,
on the present moment.

00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:34.005
Because if I think
about the surface, I panic.

00:13:34.029 --> 00:13:35.718
And if I panic, it's over.

00:13:36.925 --> 00:13:39.136
Time goes faster this way.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.255
And at 30 meters: deliverance.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.683
I'm not alone any more.

00:13:42.707 --> 00:13:46.106
The safety divers,
my guardian angels, join me.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.453
They leave the surface,
we meet at 30 meters,

00:13:48.477 --> 00:13:50.631
and they escort me
for the final few meters,

00:13:50.655 --> 00:13:53.331
where potential problems could arise.

00:13:53.881 --> 00:13:56.226
Every time I see them, I think to myself,

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.841
"It's thanks to you."

00:13:58.865 --> 00:14:00.961
It's thanks to them,
my team, that I'm here.

00:14:00.985 --> 00:14:03.166
It brings back the sense of humility.

00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:07.056
Without my team, without all
the people around me,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.435
the adventure into the deep
would be impossible.

00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:12.687
A journey into the deep
is above all a group effort.

00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:15.617
So I'm happy to finish
my journey with them,

00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:18.135
because I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for them.

00:14:18.159 --> 00:14:19.750
20 meters, 10 meters,

00:14:19.774 --> 00:14:22.021
my lungs slowly return
to their normal volume.

00:14:22.045 --> 00:14:24.392
Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface.

00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:27.964
Five meters below the surface,
I start to breathe out,

00:14:27.988 --> 00:14:31.253
so that as soon as I get
to the surface all I do is breathe in.

00:14:31.277 --> 00:14:33.242
And so I arrive at the surface.

00:14:33.544 --> 00:14:36.469
(Breathing in)

00:14:39.667 --> 00:14:41.661
Air floods into my lungs.

00:14:41.685 --> 00:14:44.073
It's like being born again, a relief.

00:14:44.896 --> 00:14:46.051
It feels good.

00:14:46.075 --> 00:14:47.941
Though the journey was extraordinary,

00:14:47.965 --> 00:14:51.917
I do need to feel those small
oxygen molecules fueling my body.

00:14:52.385 --> 00:14:55.970
It's an extraordinary sensation,
but at the same time it's traumatizing.

00:14:55.994 --> 00:14:58.391
It's a shock to the system,
as you can you imagine.

00:14:58.415 --> 00:15:01.188
I go from complete darkness
to the light of day,

00:15:01.212 --> 00:15:05.434
from the near-silence of the depths
to the commotion up top.

00:15:06.388 --> 00:15:10.921
In terms of touch, I go from the soft,
velvety feeling of the water,

00:15:10.945 --> 00:15:13.247
to air rubbing across my face.

00:15:13.271 --> 00:15:16.248
In terms of smell,

00:15:16.272 --> 00:15:18.908
there is air rushing into my lungs.

00:15:18.932 --> 00:15:21.344
And in return, my lungs open up.

00:15:21.368 --> 00:15:23.911
They were completely squashed
just 90 seconds ago,

00:15:23.935 --> 00:15:25.623
and now, they've opened up again.

00:15:25.647 --> 00:15:29.483
So all of this affects
quite a lot of things.

00:15:29.507 --> 00:15:31.827
I need a few seconds to come back,

00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:33.430
and to feel "all there" again.

00:15:33.454 --> 00:15:35.036
But that needs to happen quickly,

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.172
because the judges are there
to verify my performance;

00:15:38.196 --> 00:15:40.781
I need to show them
I'm in perfect physical condition.

00:15:40.805 --> 00:15:43.657
You saw in the video,
I was doing a so-called exit protocol.

00:15:43.681 --> 00:15:47.844
Once at the surface, I have 15 seconds
to take off my nose clip,

00:15:48.684 --> 00:15:51.565
give this signal and say
(English) "I am OK."

00:15:51.989 --> 00:15:53.487
Plus, you need to be bilingual.

00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:54.953
(Laughter)

00:15:54.977 --> 00:15:56.143
On top of everything --

00:15:56.167 --> 00:15:57.436
that's not very nice.

00:15:58.897 --> 00:16:02.548
Once the protocol is completed,
the judges show me a white card,

00:16:02.572 --> 00:16:04.169
and that's when the joy starts.

00:16:04.501 --> 00:16:07.201
I can finally celebrate
what has just happened.

00:16:07.976 --> 00:16:10.254
So, the journey I've just described to you

00:16:10.278 --> 00:16:13.451
is a more extreme version of free diving.

00:16:13.921 --> 00:16:16.112
Luckily, it's far from just that.

00:16:16.136 --> 00:16:17.343
For the past few years,

00:16:17.367 --> 00:16:20.054
I've been trying to show
another side of free diving,

00:16:20.078 --> 00:16:23.185
because the media mainly talks
about competitions and records.

00:16:23.209 --> 00:16:25.090
But free diving is more than just that.

00:16:25.114 --> 00:16:27.042
It's about being at ease in the water.

00:16:27.066 --> 00:16:30.050
It's extremely beautiful,
very poetic and artistic.

00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:32.138
So my wife and I decided to film it

00:16:32.162 --> 00:16:34.688
and try to show another side of it,

00:16:35.284 --> 00:16:37.728
mostly to make people want
to go into the water.

00:16:38.089 --> 00:16:42.584
Let me show you some images
to finish my story.

00:16:43.854 --> 00:16:46.036
It's a mix of beautiful underwater photos.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.212
(Music)

00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:52.295
I'd like you to know that if one day
you try to stop breathing,

00:16:52.319 --> 00:16:54.615
you'll realize that
when you stop breathing,

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.726
you stop thinking, too.

00:16:57.355 --> 00:16:59.147
It calms your mind.

00:16:59.934 --> 00:17:03.220
Today, in the 21st century,
we're under so much pressure.

00:17:03.244 --> 00:17:06.271
Our minds are overworked,
we think at a million miles an hour,

00:17:06.295 --> 00:17:08.175
we're always stressed.

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:11.203
Being able to free dive
lets you, just for a moment,

00:17:11.227 --> 00:17:12.702
relax your mind.

00:17:13.362 --> 00:17:15.354
Holding your breath underwater

00:17:15.378 --> 00:17:19.374
means giving yourself the chance
to experience weightlessness.

00:17:19.398 --> 00:17:22.352
It means being underwater, floating,

00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:26.199
with your body completely relaxed,
letting go of all your tensions.

00:17:26.223 --> 00:17:28.102
This is our plight in the 21st century:

00:17:28.126 --> 00:17:30.443
our backs hurt, our necks hurt,
everything hurts,

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.676
because we're stressed
and tense all the time.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.129
But when you're in the water,

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:36.743
you let yourself float,
as if you were in space.

00:17:37.151 --> 00:17:38.835
You let yourself go completely.

00:17:38.859 --> 00:17:40.352
It's an extraordinary feeling.

00:17:40.376 --> 00:17:46.033
You can finally get in touch
with your body, mind and spirit.

00:17:46.476 --> 00:17:48.514
Everything feels better, all at once.

00:17:49.952 --> 00:17:54.147
Learning how to free dive is also
about learning to breathe correctly.

00:17:54.718 --> 00:17:59.176
We breathe with our first breath
at birth, up until our last one.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.754
Breathing gives rhythm to our lives.

00:18:02.778 --> 00:18:06.127
Learning how to breathe better
is learning how to live better.

00:18:06.746 --> 00:18:09.881
Holding your breath in the sea,
not necessarily at 100 meters,

00:18:09.905 --> 00:18:11.180
but maybe at two or three,

00:18:11.204 --> 00:18:13.270
putting on your goggles,
a pair of flippers,

00:18:13.294 --> 00:18:14.990
means you can go see another world,

00:18:15.014 --> 00:18:17.072
another universe, completely magical.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:20.501
You can see little fish, seaweed,
the flora and fauna,

00:18:20.525 --> 00:18:22.843
you can watch it all discreetly,

00:18:22.867 --> 00:18:26.153
sliding underwater, looking around,
and coming back to the surface,

00:18:26.177 --> 00:18:27.684
leaving no trace.

00:18:28.096 --> 00:18:32.152
It's an amazing feeling
to become one with nature like that.

00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:35.691
And if I may say one more thing,

00:18:36.509 --> 00:18:41.676
holding your breath, being in the water,
finding this underwater world --

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.669
it's all about connecting with yourself.

00:18:43.693 --> 00:18:47.986
You heard me talk a lot
about the body's memory

00:18:48.621 --> 00:18:51.522
that dates back millions of years,
to our marine origins.

00:18:51.546 --> 00:18:54.212
The day you get back into the water,

00:18:54.236 --> 00:18:56.727
when you hold your breath
for a few seconds,

00:18:56.751 --> 00:18:59.671
you will reconnect with those origins.

00:19:00.243 --> 00:19:01.762
And I guarantee

00:19:01.786 --> 00:19:03.127
it's absolute magic.

00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:04.604
I encourage you to try it out.

00:19:04.628 --> 00:19:05.794
Thank you.

00:19:05.818 --> 00:19:09.539
(Applause)
