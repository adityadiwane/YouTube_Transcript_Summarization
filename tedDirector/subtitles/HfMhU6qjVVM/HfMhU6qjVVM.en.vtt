00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.660
"You have cancer."

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.940
Sadly, about 40 percent of us will hear
those three words within our lifetime,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.780
and half will not survive.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.636
This means that two out of five
of your closest friends and relatives

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.116
will be diagnosed
with some form of cancer,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.620
and one will die.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.556
Beyond the physical hardships,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.756
roughly one-third
of cancer survivors here in the US

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.516
will go into debt from treatment.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.276
And they're at least two and a half times
more likely to declare bankruptcy

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.540
than those without cancer.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.876
This disease is pervasive.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.476
It's emotionally draining

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.716
and, for many,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.140
financially destructive.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.260
But a cancer diagnosis
doesn't have to be a death sentence.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.596
Finding cancer early,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.836
closer its genesis,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.476
is one of the critical factors
to improving treatment options,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.476
reducing its emotional impact

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.460
and minimizing financial burdens.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.595
Most importantly,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.876
finding cancer early --

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.796
which is one of the primary
aims of my research --

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.980
greatly enhances your odds of survival.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.676
If we just look at the case
of breast cancer for example,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.196
we find that those who are diagnosed
and treated at stage one

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.980
have a five-year survival rate
of nearly 100 percent --

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.580
odds that decrease to just 22 percent
if treated at stage four.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.820
And similar trends are found
for colorectal and ovarian cancer.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.276
Now, we're all aware
that an early diagnosis that is accurate

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.420
is critical for survival.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.236
The problem is that many
cancer diagnostic tools are invasive,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.476
costly,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.716
often inaccurate

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.380
and they can take an agonizing
amount of time to get the results back.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.756
Still worse, when it comes
to some forms of cancer,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.076
such as ovarian,
liver or pancreatic cancer,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.780
good screening methods simply don't exist,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.756
meaning that often people wait
until physical symptoms surface,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.260
which are themselves already
indicators of late-stage progression.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.316
Like a tornado strike in an area
without an early warning system,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.236
there is no alarm to warn,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.116
for the danger is already at your doorstep

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.180
when your odds of survival
are greatly reduced.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.476
Having the convenience and accessibility
of regular screening options

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.836
that are affordable, noninvasive
and could provide results much sooner,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.300
would provide us with a formidable
weapon in the fight against cancer.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.636
An early warning would allow us
to get out ahead of the disease

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.396
instead of merely
following in its relentless wake.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.396
And this is exactly what I've been doing.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.556
For the past three years,
I've been developing technologies

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.316
that could ultimately aid clinicians

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.260
with rapid, early-stage
cancer diagnostics.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.596
And I've been fueled
by a deep scientific curiosity,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.140
and a passion to change these statistics.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.900
Last year however,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.540
this fight became much more personal

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.180
when my wife was diagnosed
with breast cancer.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.796
It was an experience that added a strong
and unexpected emotional dimension

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.020
to these efforts.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.340
I know firsthand how life-altering
treatment can be,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.996
and I'm keenly aware
of the emotional havoc

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.476
that cancer can wreak on a family,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.900
which in our case
included our two young daughters.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.356
Because we found it early
during a routine mammogram,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.076
we were able to focus
primarily on treatment options

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.636
for the localized tumor,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.060
reaffirming to me
how important an early diagnosis is.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.260
Unlike other forms of cancer,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.876
mammograms do offer an early-stage
screening option for breast cancer.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.116
Still, not everyone has this done,

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.726
or they may develop breast cancer

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.870
before the middle age recommendation
for having a mammogram.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.636
So, there's still
a lot of room for improvement,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.916
even for cancers
that do have screening options,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.780
and, of course, considerable benefits
for those that don't.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.236
A key challenge then
for cancer researchers

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.556
is to develop methods

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.116
that make regular screening
for many types of cancers

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.380
much more accessible.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.796
Imagine a scenario
where during your regular checkup,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.596
your doctor can take
a simple, noninvasive urine sample,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.860
or other liquid biopsy,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.064
and present you with the results
before you even leave the doctor's office.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.156
Such a technology could
dramatically reduce the number of people

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.420
who slip through the net
of an early-stage cancer diagnosis.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.476
My research team
of engineers and biochemists

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.540
is working on exactly this challenge.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.276
We're working on ways to frequently
activate an early-stage cancer alarm

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.636
by enabling regular screenings
that would start when a person is healthy

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.956
so that action could be taken
to stop cancer the moment it emerges,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.660
and before it can progress
beyond its infancy.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.476
The silver bullet in this case
are tiny vesicles,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.940
little escape pods regularly shed
by cells called exosomes.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.236
Exosomes are important biomarkers

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.540
that provide an early-warning system
for the development of cancer.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.956
And because they're abundantly present
in just about every bodily fluid,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.476
including blood, urine and saliva,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.700
they're extremely attractive
for noninvasive liquid biopsies.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.436
There's just one problem.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.756
An automated system for rapidly sorting
these important biomarkers

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.380
is not currently available.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.796
We've created a technology
that we call nano-DLD

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.940
that is capable of precisely this:

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.436
automated exosome isolation

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.940
to aid rapid cancer diagnostics.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.396
Exosomes are the newest
early-warning weapon, if you will,

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.476
to emerge on the liquid biopsy front.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.796
And they're really, really small.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.340
They measure just 30 to 150
nanometers in diameter.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.396
This is so tiny

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.060
that you could fit about a million
of them into a single red blood cell.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.956
That's roughly the difference
between a golf ball

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.700
and a fine grain piece of sand.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.436
Once thought to be little bins
for unwanted cellular waste,

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.436
it has been found
that cells actually communicate

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.596
by producing and absorbing these exosomes

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.996
which contain surface receptors,

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.020
proteins and other genetic material
collected from their cell of origin.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.996
When absorbed by a neighboring cell,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.836
exosomes release their contents
into the receiving cell,

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.076
and can set in motion
fundamental changes in gene expression --

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.316
some good,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.076
and this is where cancer comes in,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.676
some bad.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.476
Because they are clothed
in the material of the mother cell,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.436
and contain a sample of its environment,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.540
they provide a genetic snapshot
of that cell's health and its origin.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.156
All of these qualities
make exosomes invaluable messengers

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.796
that potentially allow physicians

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.740
to eavesdrop on your health
at the cellular level.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.556
To catch cancer early, however,

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.516
you have to frequently
intercept these messages

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.036
to determine when cancer-causing
troublemakers within your body

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.876
decide to start staging a coup,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.916
which is why regular
screening is so critical

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.780
and why we're developing
technologies to make this possible.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.596
While the first exosome-based diagnostics
emerged on the market just this year,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.900
they are not yet part
of mainstream healthcare options.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.996
In addition to their recent emergence,

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.476
another factor that's limiting
their widespread adoption

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.436
is that currently, no automated
exosome isolation system exists

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.660
to make regular screening
economically accessible.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.356
The current gold standard
for exosome isolation

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.316
includes ultracentrifugation,

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.596
a process requiring
expensive laboratory equipment,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.876
a trained lab tech

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.940
and about 30 hours of time
to process a sample.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.076
We've come up with a different approach
for achieving automated exosome isolation

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.540
from a sample such as urine.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.636
We use a chip-based, continuous flow
separation technique

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.636
called deterministic lateral displacement.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.036
And we have done with it

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.516
what the semiconductor industry has done
so successfully for the past 50 years.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.596
We shrunk the dimensions
of this technology

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.260
from the micron scale
to the true nanoscale.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.996
So how does it work?

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.276
In a nutshell,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.276
a set of tiny pillars
separated by nanoscopic gaps

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.556
are arranged in such a way

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.636
that the system divides
the fluid into streamlines,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.036
with the larger cancer-related
nanoparticles being separated

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.956
through a process of redirection
from the smaller, healthier ones,

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.516
which can in contrast

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.076
move around the pillars
in a zigzag-type motion

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.660
in the direction of fluid flow.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.900
The net result is a complete separation
of these two particle populations.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.956
You can visualize this separation process

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.836
similar to traffic on a highway
that separates into two roads,

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.316
with one road going into
a low-clearance tunnel under a mountain,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.396
and the other road going around it.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.196
Here, smaller cars
can go through the tunnel

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.516
while larger trucks,
carrying potentially hazardous material,

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.300
are forced to take the detour route.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.516
Traffic is effectively separated
by size and contents

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.556
without impeding its flow.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.860
And this is exactly how our system works
on a much, much smaller scale.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.276
The idea here is that
the separation process for screening

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.356
could be as simple as processing
a sample of urine, blood or saliva,

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.676
which is a near-term possibility
within the next few years.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.996
Ultimately, it could be used
to isolate and detect target exosomes

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.236
associated with
a particular type of cancer,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.700
sensing and reporting
their presence within minutes.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.620
This would make rapid diagnostics
virtually painless.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.796
Broadly speaking,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.476
the ability to separate
and enrich biomarkers

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.220
with nanoscale precision
in an automated way,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.596
opens the door to better understanding
diseases such as cancer,

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.596
with applications ranging
from sample preparation to diagnostics,

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.100
and from drug resistance
monitoring to therapeutics.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.276
Even before my wife's bout with cancer,

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.780
it was a dream of mine to facilitate
the automation of this process --

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.596
to make regular screening more accessible,

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.516
similar to the way Henry Ford
made the automobile accessible

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.116
to the general population

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.396
through development of the assembly line.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.180
Automation is the key to accessibility.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.956
And in the spirit of the Hoover dream,

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.876
"a chicken in every pot
and a car in every garage,"

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.316
we're developing a technology

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.156
that could ultimately place
an early-warning cancer detection system

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.380
in every home.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.876
This would allow
every man, woman and child

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.036
the opportunity to be regularly tested
while they're still healthy,

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.940
catching cancer when it first emerges.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.716
It is my hope and dream

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.436
to help people around the world
avoid the high costs --

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.996
physical, financial and emotional --

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.740
faced by today's cancer patients,

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.740
hardships that I'm well acquainted with.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.596
I'm also happy to report that because
we caught my wife's cancer early,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.276
her treatment was successful,

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.556
and she is now, thankfully, cancer-free.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.780
(Applause)

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.380
It is an outcome that I would like to see
for everyone with a cancer diagnosis.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.156
With the work that my team
has already done

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.916
on separation of nanoscale biomarkers

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.876
for rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.436
I am optimistic
that within the next decade,

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.036
this type of technology will be available,

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.940
helping protect our friends,
our family and future generations.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.396
Even if we are so unlucky
as to be diagnosed with cancer,

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.300
that early-stage alarm
will provide a strong beacon of hope.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.316
Thank you.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:25.129
(Applause)
