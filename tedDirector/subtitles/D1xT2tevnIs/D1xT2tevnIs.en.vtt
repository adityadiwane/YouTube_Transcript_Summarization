00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.697
I'm going to start
by asking you a question:

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:19.776
Is anyone familiar
with the blue algae problem?

00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:21.825
Okay, so most of you are.

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.871
I think we can all agree
it's a serious issue.

00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:27.953
Nobody wants to drink
blue algae-contaminated water,

00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:32.788
or swim in a blue algae-infested lake.

00:00:33.328 --> 00:00:34.703
Right?

00:00:34.703 --> 00:00:36.779
I hope you won't be disappointed,

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:39.985
but today,
I won't be talking about blue algae.

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:43.810
Instead,
I'll be talking about the main cause

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.775
at the root of this issue,

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:50.170
which I will be referring to as
the phosphorus crisis.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.078
Why have I chosen to talk to you
about the phosphorus crisis today?

00:00:54.078 --> 00:00:57.337
For the simple reason
that nobody else is talking about it.

00:00:57.337 --> 00:01:01.604
And by the end of my presentation,
I hope that the general public

00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:06.170
will be more aware of this crisis
and this issue.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.534
Now, the problem is that if I ask,

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:12.588
why do we find ourselves
in this situation with blue algae?

00:01:12.588 --> 00:01:16.001
The answer is
that it comes from how we farm.

00:01:16.262 --> 00:01:20.036
We use fertilizers in our farming,
chemical fertilizers.

00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:23.103
Why do we use chemical fertilizers
in agriculture?

00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:27.453
Basically, to help plants grow
and to produce a better yield.

00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:30.787
The issue is that this is set to engender

00:01:30.787 --> 00:01:34.081
an environmental problem
that is without precedent.

00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:39.037
Before going further, let me give you
a crash course in plant biology.

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:41.502
So, what does a plant need
in order to grow?

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:46.052
A plant, quite simply,
needs light, it needs CO2,

00:01:46.052 --> 00:01:49.667
but even more importantly,
it needs nutrients,

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.692
which it draws from the soil.

00:01:53.282 --> 00:01:56.897
Several of these nutrients
are essential chemical elements:

00:01:56.897 --> 00:01:59.943
phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium.

00:01:59.943 --> 00:02:04.672
So, the plant’s roots will extract
these resources.

00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:08.536
Today I'll be focusing on a major problem
that is linked to phosphorus.

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:10.223
Why phosphorus in particular?

00:02:10.223 --> 00:02:12.862
Because it is
the most problematic chemical element.

00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:16.553
By the end of my presentation,
you will have seen

00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:19.889
what these problems are,
and where we are today.

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.772
Phosphorus is a chemical element

00:02:23.772 --> 00:02:27.165
that is essential to life.
This is a very important point.

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:30.816
I’d like everyone to understand precisely
what the phosphorus issue is.

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:34.988
Phosphorus is a key component
in several molecules,

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.641
in many of our molecules of life.

00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:39.634
Experts in the field will know

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:42.597
that cellular communication
is phosphorus-based --

00:02:42.597 --> 00:02:44.811
phosphorylation, dephosphorylation.

00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:50.122
Cell membranes are phosphorus-based:
These are called phospholipids.

00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:55.572
The energy in all living things,
ATP, is phosphorus-based.

00:02:55.572 --> 00:03:01.655
And more importantly still,
phosphorus is a key component of DNA,

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:07.055
something everyone is familiar with,
and which is shown in this image.

00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:10.339
DNA is our genetic heritage.

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:14.690
It is extremely important, and once again,
phosphorus is a key player.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.808
Now, where do we find this phosphorus?

00:03:19.308 --> 00:03:22.869
As humans, where do we find it?

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.358
As I explained earlier,

00:03:24.358 --> 00:03:28.857
plants extract phosphorus
from the soil, through water.

00:03:29.147 --> 00:03:31.832
So, we humans get it
from the things we eat:

00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:35.117
plants, vegetables, fruits,

00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:38.402
and also from eggs, meat and milk.

00:03:38.912 --> 00:03:41.969
It’s true that some humans
eat better than others.

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.945
Some are happier than others.

00:03:44.605 --> 00:03:48.786
And now, looking at this picture,
which speaks for itself,

00:03:49.076 --> 00:03:50.892
we see modern agriculture,

00:03:50.892 --> 00:03:54.448
which I also refer to
as intensive agriculture.

00:03:54.448 --> 00:03:58.904
Intensive agriculture is based
on the use of chemical fertilizers.

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:01.932
Without them,
we would not manage to produce enough

00:04:01.932 --> 00:04:04.960
to feed the world's population.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.438
Speaking of humans, there are currently
7 billion of us on Earth.

00:04:08.738 --> 00:04:11.864
In less than 40 years,
there will be 9 billion of us.

00:04:11.864 --> 00:04:15.254
And the question is a simple one:
Do we have enough phosphorus

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:18.124
to feed our future generations?

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:23.216
So, in order to understand these issues,
where do we find our phosphorus?

00:04:23.216 --> 00:04:24.837
Let me explain.

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:27.574
But first, let’s just suppose

00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:32.750
that we are using
100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.818
Only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant.
Eighty-five percent is lost.

00:04:42.278 --> 00:04:45.677
It goes into the soil,
ending its journey in the lakes,

00:04:45.947 --> 00:04:49.673
resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus,
which leads to the blue algae problem.

00:04:49.673 --> 00:04:53.411
So, you’ll see there’s a problem here,
something that is illogical.

00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:57.500
A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used,
but only 15 percent goes to the plant.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.784
You’re going to tell me it’s wasteful.

00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:04.401
Yes, it is. What is worse
is that it is very expensive.

00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:07.783
Nobody wants to throw their money
out the window,

00:05:07.783 --> 00:05:10.123
but unfortunately
that's what is happening here.

00:05:10.513 --> 00:05:13.319
Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost.

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:20.701
Modern agriculture
depends on phosphorus.

00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:25.300
And because in order to get 15 percent of it
to the plant, all the rest is lost,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.221
we have to add more and more.

00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:30.595
Now, where will we get
this phosphorus from?

00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:34.469
Basically, we get it out of mines.

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:37.236
This is the cover
of an extraordinary article

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:39.273
published in Nature in 2009,

00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:42.460
which really launched the discussion
about the phosphorus crisis.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.423
Phosphorus, a nutrient essential to life,
which is becoming increasingly scarce,

00:05:47.423 --> 00:05:49.246
yet nobody is talking about it.

00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:55.110
And everyone agrees:
Politicians and scientists are in agreement

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.451
that we are headed
for a phosphorus crisis.

00:05:57.451 --> 00:06:00.899
What you are seeing here
is an open-pit mine in the U.S.,

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:04.000
and to give you an idea
of the dimensions of this mine,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.554
if you look in the top right-hand corner,
the little crane you can see,

00:06:07.554 --> 00:06:09.019
that is a giant crane.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.403
So that really puts it into perspective.

00:06:12.403 --> 00:06:14.601
So, we get phosphorus from mines.

00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:17.049
And if I make a comparison with oil,

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:21.180
there’s an oil crisis, we talk about it,
we talk about global warming,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.204
yet we never mention
the phosphorus crisis.

00:06:23.204 --> 00:06:27.036
To come back to the oil problem,
oil is something we can replace.

00:06:27.406 --> 00:06:31.768
We can use biofuels, or solar power,

00:06:31.768 --> 00:06:35.532
or hydropower,
but phosphorus is an essential element,

00:06:35.532 --> 00:06:39.256
indispensable to life,
and we can’t replace it.

00:06:41.106 --> 00:06:44.769
What is the current state
of the world's phosphorus reserves?

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:48.880
This graph gives you a rough idea
of where we are today.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.531
The black line represents predictions
for phosphorus reserves.

00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:56.155
In 2030, we’ll reach the peak.

00:06:56.155 --> 00:06:59.481
By the end of this century,
it will all be gone.

00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:03.546
The dotted line shows where we are today.

00:07:03.976 --> 00:07:07.448
As you can see, they meet in 2030,
I’ll be retired by then.

00:07:08.658 --> 00:07:12.227
But we are indeed heading
for a major crisis,

00:07:12.227 --> 00:07:15.499
and I’d like people to become aware
of this problem.

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:17.729
Do we have a solution?

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.561
What are we to do?
We are faced with a paradox.

00:07:22.531 --> 00:07:24.838
Less and less phosphorus
will be available.

00:07:25.118 --> 00:07:28.314
By 2050 there will be 9 billion of us,

00:07:28.484 --> 00:07:34.848
and according to
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,

00:07:35.098 --> 00:07:39.841
we will need to produce twice as much food
in 2050 than we do today.

00:07:39.841 --> 00:07:43.611
So, we will have less phosphorus,
but we'll need to produce more food.

00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:45.759
What should we do?

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:48.289
It truly is a paradoxical situation.

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:51.777
Do we have a solution,
or an alternative

00:07:51.777 --> 00:07:54.745
which will allow us to optimize
phosphorus use?

00:07:54.745 --> 00:07:58.115
Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost.

00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:07.669
The solution I'm offering today is one
that has existed for a very long time,

00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:10.067
even before plants existed on Earth,

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:13.885
and it's a microscopic mushroom
that is very mysterious,

00:08:13.885 --> 00:08:17.393
very simple,
and yet also extremely complex.

00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:22.621
I've been fascinated by this little mushroom
for over 16 years now.

00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:26.466
It has led me to further my research

00:08:26.466 --> 00:08:29.836
and to use it as a model
for my laboratory research.

00:08:29.836 --> 00:08:33.290
This mushroom exists in symbiosis
with the roots.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:38.937
By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional
and mutually beneficial association

00:08:38.937 --> 00:08:41.965
which is also called mycorrhiza.

00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:47.142
This slide illustrates the elements
of a mycorrhiza.

00:08:47.142 --> 00:08:49.407
You’re looking at the root of wheat,

00:08:49.407 --> 00:08:52.751
one of the world’s most important plants.

00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:56.340
Normally, a root will find phosphorus
all by itself.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.372
It will go in search of phosphorus,

00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:01.614
but only within the one millimeter
which surrounds it.

00:09:02.044 --> 00:09:05.119
Beyond one millimeter,
the root is ineffective.

00:09:05.119 --> 00:09:07.444
It cannot go further
in its search for phosphorus.

00:09:07.444 --> 00:09:10.180
Now, imagine this tiny,
microscopic mushroom.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.441
It grows much faster,

00:09:12.441 --> 00:09:15.237
and is much better designed
to seek out phosphorus.

00:09:15.237 --> 00:09:18.616
It can go beyond
the root’s one-millimeter scope

00:09:18.616 --> 00:09:20.703
to seek out phosphorus.

00:09:20.703 --> 00:09:22.759
I haven’t invented anything at all;

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:26.257
it's a biotechnology that has existed
for 450 million years.

00:09:26.257 --> 00:09:30.170
And over time, this mushroom
has evolved and adapted to seek out

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.663
even the tiniest trace of phosphorus,
and to put it to use,

00:09:33.663 --> 00:09:35.996
to make it available to the plant.

00:09:36.716 --> 00:09:40.649
What you’re seeing here,
in the real world, is a carrot root,

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:43.920
and the mushroom
with its very fine filaments.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.327
Looking closer,
we can see that this mushroom

00:09:46.327 --> 00:09:48.414
is very gentle in its penetration.

00:09:48.414 --> 00:09:52.103
It will proliferate
between the root's cells,

00:09:52.103 --> 00:09:55.186
eventually penetrating a cell

00:09:55.596 --> 00:10:00.280
and starting to form
a typical arbuscular structure,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.477
which will considerably increase
the exchange interface

00:10:05.477 --> 00:10:08.036
between the plant and the mushroom.

00:10:08.036 --> 00:10:11.481
And it is through this structure
that mutual exchanges will occur.

00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:13.117
It’s a win-win trade:

00:10:13.117 --> 00:10:15.682
I give you phosphorus, and you feed me.

00:10:15.992 --> 00:10:18.262
True symbiosis.

00:10:20.602 --> 00:10:23.370
Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.630
into the diagram I used earlier.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.707
And instead of using a 100 percent dose,
I’m going to reduce it to 25 percent.

00:10:31.707 --> 00:10:36.681
You’ll see that of this 25 percent,
most will benefit the plant,

00:10:36.681 --> 00:10:38.237
more than 90 percent.

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:41.817
A very small amount of phosphorus
will remain in the soil.

00:10:41.817 --> 00:10:44.117
That's completely natural.

00:10:45.577 --> 00:10:49.448
What's more is that in certain cases,
we don't even need to add phosphorus.

00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:51.860
If you recall the graphs
I showed you earlier,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.081
85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil,

00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:58.326
and the plants are unable to access it.

00:10:58.326 --> 00:11:02.134
Even though it is present in the soil,
it is in insoluble form.

00:11:02.134 --> 00:11:05.144
The plant is only able to seek out
soluble forms.

00:11:05.144 --> 00:11:08.956
The mushroom is capable
of dissolving this insoluble form

00:11:08.956 --> 00:11:12.397
and making it available
for the plant to use.

00:11:12.397 --> 00:11:15.948
To further support my argument,
here is a picture that speaks for itself.

00:11:15.948 --> 00:11:19.836
These are trials
in a field of sorghum.

00:11:19.836 --> 00:11:24.348
On the left side, you see the yield
produced using conventional agriculture,

00:11:24.348 --> 00:11:26.930
with a 100 percent phosphorus dose.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.303
On the other side,
the dose was reduced to 50 percent,

00:11:30.303 --> 00:11:31.836
and just look at the yield.

00:11:31.836 --> 00:11:37.417
With only a half-dose,
we achieved a better yield.

00:11:37.417 --> 00:11:42.247
This is to show you
that this method works.

00:11:42.247 --> 00:11:46.816
And in some cases, in Cuba,
Mexico and India,

00:11:46.816 --> 00:11:50.103
the dose can be reduced to 25 percent,
and in several other cases,

00:11:50.103 --> 00:11:52.257
there's no need to add
any phosphorus at all,

00:11:52.257 --> 00:11:54.701
because the mushrooms are so well adapted

00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:57.437
to finding phosphorus
and drawing it from the soil.

00:11:57.897 --> 00:12:02.415
This is an example of soy production
in Canada.

00:12:03.735 --> 00:12:10.677
Mycorrhiza was used in one field
but not in the other.

00:12:11.347 --> 00:12:19.273
And here, where blue indicates a better yield,
and yellow a weaker yield.

00:12:20.763 --> 00:12:23.586
The black rectangle is the plot

00:12:23.586 --> 00:12:25.969
from which the mycorrhiza was added.

00:12:25.969 --> 00:12:29.337
In other words, as I already said,
I have invented nothing.

00:12:29.337 --> 00:12:32.087
Mycorrhiza has existed
for 450 million years,

00:12:32.087 --> 00:12:36.346
and it has even helped
modern-day plant species to diversify.

00:12:36.346 --> 00:12:40.905
So, this it isn't something
that is still undergoing lab tests.

00:12:40.905 --> 00:12:43.321
Mycorrhiza exists, it works,

00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:47.760
it's produced at an industrial scale
and commercialized worldwide.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.070
The problem is
that people are not aware of it.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.066
People like food producers and farmers
are still not aware of this problem.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:57.694
We have a technology that works,

00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:04.791
and one that, if used correctly,
will alleviate some of the pressure

00:13:04.791 --> 00:13:08.444
we are putting
on the world's phosphorus reserves.

00:13:09.214 --> 00:13:13.678
In conclusion,
I am a scientist and a dreamer.

00:13:14.368 --> 00:13:16.127
I'm passionate about this topic.

00:13:16.127 --> 00:13:19.415
So if you were to ask me
what my retirement dream is,

00:13:19.415 --> 00:13:22.241
which will be at the moment we reach
that phosphorus peak,

00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:26.197
it would be that we use one label,
"Made with mycorrhiza,"

00:13:26.197 --> 00:13:29.107
and that my children and grandchildren

00:13:29.107 --> 00:13:32.115
buy products bearing that label too.

00:13:32.115 --> 00:13:33.815
Thank you for your attention.

00:13:33.815 --> 00:13:36.316
