00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.130
I come from Lebanon,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.210
and I believe that running
can change the world.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.070
I know what I have just said
is simply not obvious.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.100
You know, Lebanon as a country
has been once destroyed

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.230
by a long and bloody civil war.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.190
Honestly, I don't know
why they call it civil war

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.190
when there is nothing civil about it.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.170
With Syria to the north,
Israel and Palestine to the south,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.230
and our government
even up till this moment

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.240
is still fragmented and unstable.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.080
For years, the country has been divided
between politics and religion.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.090
However, for one day a year,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.230
we truly stand united,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.240
and that's when the marathon takes place.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.240
I used to be a marathon runner.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.040
Long distance running
was not only good for my well-being

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.040
but it helped me meditate and dream big.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.060
So the longer distances I ran,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.040
the bigger my dreams became.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.080
Until one fateful morning,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.080
and while training, I was hit by a bus.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.230
I nearly died, was in a coma,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.020
stayed at the hospital for two years,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.070
and underwent 36 surgeries
to be able to walk again.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.140
As soon as I came out of my coma,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.180
I realized that I was no longer
the same runner I used to be,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.230
so I decided, if I couldn't run myself,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.070
I wanted to make sure that others could.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.080
So out of my hospital bed,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.080
I asked my husband to start taking notes,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.100
and a few months later,
the marathon was born.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.230
Organizing a marathon
as a reaction to an accident

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.140
may sound strange,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.120
but at that time, even during
my most vulnerable condition,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.120
I needed to dream big.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.110
I needed something
to take me out of my pain,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.170
an objective to look forward to.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.040
I didn't want to pity myself,
nor to be pitied,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.160
and I thought by organizing
such a marathon,

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.160
I'll be able to pay back to my community,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.060
build bridges with the outside world,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.230
and invite runners to come to Lebanon

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.130
and run under the umbrella of peace.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.090
Organizing a marathon in Lebanon

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.100
is definitely not like organizing
one in New York.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.130
How do you introduce
the concept of running

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.020
to a nation that is constantly
at the brink of war?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.160
How do you ask those
who were once fighting

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.160
and killing each other

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.150
to come together and run
next to each other?

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.070
More than that, how do you convince people
to run a distance of 26.2 miles

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.150
at a time they were not even familiar
with the word "marathon"?

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.130
So we had to start from scratch.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.180
For almost two years,
we went all over the country

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.200
and even visited remote villages.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.210
I personally met with people
from all walks of life --

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.230
mayors, NGOs, schoolchildren,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.000
politicians, militiamen,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.230
people from mosques, churches,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.080
the president of the country,
even housewives.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.060
I learned one thing:

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.140
When you walk the talk,
people believe you.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.170
Many were touched by my personal story,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.030
and they shared their stories in return.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.110
It was honesty and transparency
that brought us together.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.230
We spoke one common language
to each other,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.210
and that was from one human to another.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.040
Once that trust was built,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.010
everybody wanted
to be part of the marathon

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.140
to show the world the true colors
of Lebanon and the Lebanese

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.000
and their desire to live
in peace and harmony.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.140
In October 2003, over 6,000 runners

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.030
from 49 different nationalities

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.010
came to the start line, all determined,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.180
and when the gunfire went off,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.180
this time it was a signal
to run in harmony,

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.240
for a change.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.050
The marathon grew.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.060
So did our political problems.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.160
But for every disaster we had,

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.230
the marathon found ways
to bring people together.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.020
In 2005, our prime minister
was assassinated,

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.070
and the country came
to a complete standstill,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.110
so we organized a five-kilometer
United We Run campaign.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.160
Over 60,000 people came to the start line,

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.090
all wearing white T-shirts
with no political slogans.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.090
That was a turning point for the marathon,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.000
where people started
looking at it as a platform

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.050
for peace and unity.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.230
Between 2006 up to 2009,
our country, Lebanon,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.160
went through unstable years,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.190
invasions, and more assassinations

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.090
that brought us close to a civil war.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.200
The country was divided again,

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.050
so much that our parliament resigned,

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.100
we had no president for a year,
and no prime minister.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.190
But we did have a marathon.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:27.050
(Applause)

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:33.050
So through the marathon, we learned
that political problems can be overcome.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.230
When the opposition party decided
to shut down part of the city center,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.110
we negotiated alternative routes.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.210
Government protesters
became sideline cheerleaders.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.100
They even hosted juice stations.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.110
(Laughter)

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:57.000
You know, the marathon
has really become one of its kind.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.210
It gained credibility

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:04.030
from both the Lebanese
and the international community.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.230
Last November 2012, over 33,000 runners
from 85 different nationalities

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.130
came to the start line,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.170
but this time, they challenged
a very stormy and rainy weather.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.170
The streets were flooded,
but people didn't want to miss out

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.040
on the opportunity of being part
of such a national day.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.180
BMA has expanded.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.150
We include everyone:
the young, the elderly,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.150
the disabled, the mentally challenged,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.020
the blind, the elite, the amateur runners,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.090
even moms with their babies.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.080
Themes have included
runs for the environment,

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.240
breast cancer, for the love
of Lebanon, for peace,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
or just simply to run.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:58.130
The first annual all-women-and-girls
race for empowerment,

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.230
which is one of its kind in the region,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.090
has just taken place only a few weeks ago,

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:09.200
with 4,512 women,
including the first lady,

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.210
and this is only the beginning.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.220
Thank you.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.110
(Applause)

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.020
BMA has supported charities and volunteers

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.040
who have helped reshape Lebanon,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.160
raising funds for their causes

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.060
and encouraging others to give.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.100
The culture of giving and doing good
has become contagious.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.110
Stereotypes have been broken.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:44.000
Change-makers and future leaders
have been created.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.170
I believe these are the building blocks
for future peace.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.180
BMA has become such a respected
event in the region

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.120
that government officials in the region,

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.110
like Iraq, Egypt and Syria,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.090
have asked the organization to help them
structure a similar sporting event.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.110
We are now one of the largest
running events in the Middle East,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.110
but most importantly,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.230
it is a platform for hope and cooperation

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.160
in an ever-fragile
and unstable part of the world.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:31.150
From Boston to Beirut, we stand as one.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:37.230
(Applause)

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.220
After 10 years in Lebanon,

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.140
from national marathons
or from national events

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.210
to smaller regional races,

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:50.090
we've seen that people want
to run for a better future.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:56.120
After all, peacemaking is not a sprint.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.110
It is more of a marathon.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.120
Thank you.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.140
(Applause)
