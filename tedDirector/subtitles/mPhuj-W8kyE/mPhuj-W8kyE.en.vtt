00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
The future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
I think about this every day; it's quite literally my job.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.160
I'm co-founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.160
and since then we and our growing global team of contributors

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.160
have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
that are out there, right now and on the near horizon.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.160
In a little over two years, we've written up about 4,000 items --

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.160
replicable models, technological tools, emerging ideas --

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
all providing a path to a future

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.160
that's more sustainable, more equitable and more desirable.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional. 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
There are tons of places to go, online and off,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
if what you want to find is the latest bit of news

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.160
about just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.160
We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.160
We focus primarily on the planet's environment,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
but we also address issues of global development,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.160
international conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
even the rise of the so-called Second Superpower

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
and much, much more.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
The scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.160
but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.160
and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
but to give you a sense of what we cover:

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
tools for rapid disaster relief,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
such as this inflatable concrete shelter;

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
innovative uses of bioscience,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines;

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
ultra high-efficiency designs for homes and offices;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
distributed power generation using solar power, wind power,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
ocean power, other clean energy sources;

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
ultra, ultra high-efficiency vehicles of the future;

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
ultra high-efficiency vehicles you can get right now;

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
and better urban design, 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
so you don't need to drive as much in the first place; 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
bio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.160
the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings;

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
distributed computing projects

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
that will help us model the future of the climate.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
Also, a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.160
at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging:

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
cradle-to-cradle design, MIT's Fab Labs,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160
the consequences of extreme longevity,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.160
the One Laptop per Child project, even Gapminder.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
As a born-in-the-mid-1960s Gen X-er,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.160
I'm naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
has convinced me, much to my own surprise,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160
that successful responses to the world's problems

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
are nonetheless possible.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.160
Moreover, I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.160
can really blind you to the very possibility of success.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
"Pessimism is a luxury of good times ...

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
In difficult times, pessimism is

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
a self-fulfilling, self-inflicted death sentence."

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
The truth is, we can build a better world,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
and we can do so right now.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
We have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
and we're coming up with new ones all the time.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
We have the knowledge,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
and our understanding of the planet improves every day.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
Most importantly, we have the motive:

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
we have a world that needs fixing, and nobody's going to do it for us.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.160
Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.160
and write up every day have some important aspects in common:

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.160
transparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.160
and an appreciation of science -- or, more appropriately, science!

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160
(Laughter)

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.160
The majority of models, tools and ideas on Worldchanging

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
encompass combinations of these characteristics, so I want to give you

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
a few concrete examples of how these principles combine

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
in world-changing ways.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.160
We can see world-changing values in the emergence of tools

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
to make the invisible visible -- that is,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
to make apparent the conditions of the world around us

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160
that would otherwise be largely imperceptible.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
We know that people often change their behavior

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
when they can see and understand the impact of their actions.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
As a small example, many of us have experienced

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
the change in driving behavior that comes from having

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
a real time display of mileage showing precisely

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
in how we measure and display aspects of the world

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.160
that can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.160
Simple technologies, like wall-mounted devices

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
that display how much power your household is using,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights --

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
these can actually have a direct positive impact

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160
on your energy footprint.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
Community tools, like text messaging, that can tell you

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
or a natural disaster is unfolding,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.160
can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.160
allow us to better understand the context and the flow

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
of processes that affect us all.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.160
We can see world-changing values in research projects

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
that seek to meet the world's medical needs

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
through open access to data and collaborative action.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.160
Now, some people emphasize the risks of knowledge-enabled dangers,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.160
but I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge-enabled solutions

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
are far more important.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.160
For example, open-access journals, like the Public Library of Science,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
make cutting-edge scientific research free to all --

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
everyone in the world.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
And actually, a growing number of science publishers

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
are adopting this model.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.160
Last year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
around the world worked together

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
for some of the developing world's worst diseases:

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
That genome data can now be found

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160
on open-access genetic data banks around the world,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
and it's an enormous boon to researchers

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
trying to come up with treatments.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
But my favorite example has to be the global response

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
to the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.160
worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
The U.S. National Research Council

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
in its follow-up report on the outbreak specifically

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
And we can see world-changing values

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
in something as humble as a cell phone.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
who do not use a mobile phone --

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
and where is Aubrey, because I know he doesn't?

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
(Laughter)

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
For many of us, cell phones have really become

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
almost an extension of ourselves,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
and we're really now beginning to see the social changes

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
that mobile phones can bring about.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
You may already know some of the big-picture aspects:

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
globally, more camera phones were sold last year

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
than any other kind of camera,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.160
and over the network -- and sometimes enter history books.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.160
In the developing world, mobile phones have become economic drivers.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.160
A study last year showed a direct correlation

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
between the growth of mobile phone use

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
and subsequent GDP increases across Africa.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
In Kenya, mobile phone minutes

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
have actually become an alternative currency.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
to the Blairwatch Project in the UK,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
(Laughter)

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
And it's just going to get more wild.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
Pervasive, always-on networks, high quality sound and video,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.160
will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
It's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.160
may be among the world's most important technologies.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
And in this rapidly evolving context,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.160
something far more than a medium for social interaction.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
I've long admired the Witness project,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.160
and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
in his profoundly moving presentation.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
to send in their recordings over the Internet,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
rather than just hand-carrying the videotape.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.160
Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
for documenting abuses,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.160
it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.160
Now, imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
of what's happening to the planet:

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
from activists and researchers

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
to businesspeople and political figures.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
It would highlight the changes that are underway,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.160
but would more importantly give voice

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
to the people who are willing to work

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
to see a new world, a better world, come about.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
It would give everyday citizens

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.160
It would be, in essence, an "Earth Witness" project.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160
Now, just to be clear, in this talk I'm using the name "Earth Witness"

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
as part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.160
for what this imaginary project could aspire to,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:50.160
not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.160
It could just as easily be called, "Environmental Transparency Project,"

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.160
"Smart Mobs for Natural Security" --

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
Now, many of the people who participate in Earth Witness

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.160
would focus on ecological problems, human-caused or otherwise,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
especially environmental crimes

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
That's understandable and important.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.160
if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.160
But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160
In the best Worldchanging tradition,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.160
it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.160
and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
Earth Witness would show us two worlds:

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
the world we're leaving behind,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
and the world we're building for generations to come.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
And what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
we could do it today.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
The key components are already widely available.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
Camera phones, of course, would be fundamental to the project.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.160
And for a lot of us, they're as close as we have yet

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160
to always-on, widely available information tools.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.160
wherever we go, but very few of us forget our phones.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.160
You could even imagine a version of this scenario

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
in which people actually build their own phones.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.160
Over the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
have come up with multiple models

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
for usable, Linux-based mobile phones,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.160
and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
At the other end of the network, there'd be

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
a server for people to send photos and messages to,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.160
accessible over the Web, combining a photo-sharing service,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:36.160
social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.160
Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
but for those of you for whom that last sentence

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.160
was in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this:

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
the online part of the Earth Witness project

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.160
would be created by the users, working together and working openly.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.160
That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.160
of what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
Now, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
but students and engineers around the world

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160
have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.160
and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons --

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
using bird-mounted sensors

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
on a phone carried by a person.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.160
Now, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new:

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.160
phone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.160
Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.160
a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
uploading the data, displaying the results.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.160
Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
designing a prototype phone

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.160
that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.160
Now, there's an enormous variety of tiny, inexpensive sensors

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.160
on the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160
a phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
the presence of some biotoxins --

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.160
potentially, in a few years, maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
You could see that some kind of system like this

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160
would actually be a really good fit

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.160
with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
Now, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.160
and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
And that's worth noting in particular.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
The impact of open-access online maps over the last year or two

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
has been simply phenomenal.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
Developers around the world have come up with

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
from bus routes and crime statistics

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
to the global progress of avian flu.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160
Earth Witness would take this further, linking what you see

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.160
with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
It's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
if something like this ever existed.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
We'd have a far better -- far better knowledge

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
of what's happening on our planet environmentally

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
than could be gathered with satellites

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
and a handful of government sensor nets alone.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160
It would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
to environmental awareness and protection,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160
able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way --

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.160
and if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.160
And most important,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.160
you can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
This is a system that could put the next generation

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
at the front lines of gathering environmental data.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
the worst effects of climate disruption,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
every little bit of information matters.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.160
A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us 

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.160
to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
the improvement of the planet itself.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
Now, as I suggested at the outset,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
so why have I spent the bulk of my time

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
telling you about something that doesn't exist?

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.160
Because this is what tomorrow could look like:

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.160
bottom-up, technology-enabled global collaboration

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.160
to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.160
We can save the planet, but we can't do it alone -- we need each other.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.160
Nobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
making use of technological innovations and human communities alike,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.160
we might just be able to fix it ourselves.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
powerful tools, and innovative ideas

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160
that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.160
We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all;

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.160
we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
There's a staggering array of wonders out there,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
across diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing:

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160
success can be ours if we're willing to try.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
And as we say at Worldchanging,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.160
another world isn't just possible; another world is here.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.160
We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much.
