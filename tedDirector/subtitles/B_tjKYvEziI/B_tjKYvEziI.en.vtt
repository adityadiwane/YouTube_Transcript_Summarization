00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:18.317
Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.237
There's still some confusion
about that question,

00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:24.871
as this is a fairly new field of research.

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:28.928
For example, I was talking
to one of my colleagues, Robert,

00:00:28.952 --> 00:00:30.260
who is an oncologist,

00:00:30.284 --> 00:00:31.585
and he was telling me,

00:00:32.014 --> 00:00:33.769
"Sandrine, this is puzzling.

00:00:33.793 --> 00:00:38.107
Some of my patients that have been told
they are cured of their cancer

00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:40.528
still develop symptoms of depression."

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.815
And I responded to him,

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:45.179
"Well, from my point of view
that makes sense.

00:00:45.203 --> 00:00:49.741
The drug you give to your patients
that stops the cancer cells multiplying

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:54.868
also stops the newborn neurons
being generated in their brain."

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.606
And then Robert looked at me
like I was crazy and said,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.812
"But Sandrine, these are adult patients --

00:01:00.836 --> 00:01:03.408
adults do not grow new nerve cells."

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:08.209
And much to his surprise, I said,
"Well actually, we do."

00:01:09.098 --> 00:01:13.924
And this is a phenomenon
that we call neurogenesis.

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:15.138
[Neurogenesis]

00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:18.932
Now Robert is not a neuroscientist,

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:23.581
and when he went to medical school
he was not taught what we know now --

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:27.344
that the adult brain
can generate new nerve cells.

00:01:29.217 --> 00:01:33.587
So Robert, you know,
being the good doctor that he is,

00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:35.310
wanted to come to my lab

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:38.158
to understand the topic
a little bit better.

00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:41.136
And I took him for a tour

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.073
of one of the most exciting
parts of the brain

00:01:44.097 --> 00:01:46.270
when it comes to neurogenesis --

00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:48.382
and this is the hippocampus.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.932
So this is this gray structure
in the center of the brain.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.035
And what we've known already
for very long,

00:01:56.059 --> 00:02:00.824
is that this is important for learning,
memory, mood and emotion.

00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:04.390
However, what we
have learned more recently

00:02:04.414 --> 00:02:09.072
is that this is one of the unique
structures of the adult brain

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:11.746
where new neurons can be generated.

00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:14.716
And if we slice through the hippocampus

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.008
and zoom in,

00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:18.833
what you actually see here in blue

00:02:18.857 --> 00:02:23.430
is a newborn neuron
in an adult mouse brain.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.824
So when it comes to the human brain --

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:31.380
my colleague Jonas FrisÃ©n
from the Karolinska Institutet,

00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:37.144
has estimated that we produce
700 new neurons per day

00:02:37.168 --> 00:02:38.366
in the hippocampus.

00:02:39.183 --> 00:02:40.858
You might think this is not much,

00:02:40.882 --> 00:02:43.271
compared to the billions
of neurons we have.

00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:46.715
But by the time we turn 50,

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.415
we will have all exchanged the neurons
we were born with in that structure

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.654
with adult-born neurons.

00:02:55.248 --> 00:03:00.284
So why are these new neurons important
and what are their functions?

00:03:01.324 --> 00:03:05.022
First, we know that they're important
for learning and memory.

00:03:05.046 --> 00:03:06.563
And in the lab we have shown

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:09.823
that if we block the ability
of the adult brain

00:03:09.847 --> 00:03:12.407
to produce new neurons in the hippocampus,

00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:14.947
then we block certain memory abilities.

00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:22.633
And this is especially new and true
for spatial recognition --

00:03:22.657 --> 00:03:25.455
so like, how you navigate
your way in the city.

00:03:26.181 --> 00:03:27.659
We are still learning a lot,

00:03:27.683 --> 00:03:30.746
and neurons are not only important
for memory capacity,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.673
but also for the quality of the memory.

00:03:33.697 --> 00:03:37.742
And they will have been helpful
to add time to our memory

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:42.448
and they will help differentiate
very similar memories, like:

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.552
how do you find your bike

00:03:44.576 --> 00:03:48.092
that you park at the station
every day in the same area,

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:50.258
but in a slightly different position?

00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:54.552
And more interesting
to my colleague Robert

00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:59.438
is the research we have been doing
on neurogenesis and depression.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.948
So in an animal model of depression,

00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:05.976
we have seen that we have
a lower level of neurogenesis.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.743
And if we give antidepressants,

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:12.221
then we increase the production
of these newborn neurons,

00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:15.388
and we decrease
the symptoms of depression,

00:04:15.412 --> 00:04:20.872
establishing a clear link
between neurogenesis and depression.

00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:25.500
But moreover, if you
just block neurogenesis,

00:04:25.524 --> 00:04:28.357
then you block the efficacy
of the antidepressant.

00:04:29.714 --> 00:04:31.477
So by then, Robert had understood

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:35.199
that very likely his patients
were suffering from depression

00:04:35.223 --> 00:04:37.818
even after being cured of their cancer,

00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:42.223
because the cancer drug had stopped
newborn neurons from being generated.

00:04:42.247 --> 00:04:45.875
And it will take time
to generate new neurons

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:48.105
that reach normal functions.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.189
So, collectively, now we think
we have enough evidence

00:04:54.213 --> 00:04:57.928
to say that neurogenesis
is a target of choice

00:04:57.952 --> 00:05:01.566
if we want to improve
memory formation or mood,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.153
or even prevent the decline
associated with aging,

00:05:05.177 --> 00:05:07.311
or associated with stress.

00:05:08.288 --> 00:05:10.019
So the next question is:

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:12.217
can we control neurogenesis?

00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:14.257
The answer is yes.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.423
And we are now going to do a little quiz.

00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:21.382
I'm going to give you a set
of behaviors and activities,

00:05:21.406 --> 00:05:26.090
and you tell me if you think
they will increase neurogenesis

00:05:26.114 --> 00:05:28.280
or if they will decrease neurogenesis.

00:05:28.804 --> 00:05:29.963
Are we ready?

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.709
OK, let's go.

00:05:32.034 --> 00:05:33.621
So what about learning?

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:35.701
Increasing?

00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:36.884
Yes.

00:05:36.908 --> 00:05:40.694
Learning will increase the production
of these new neurons.

00:05:40.718 --> 00:05:42.034
How about stress?

00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:48.168
Yes, stress will decrease the production
of new neurons in the hippocampus.

00:05:48.192 --> 00:05:49.804
How about sleep deprivation?

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:54.074
Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.

00:05:54.098 --> 00:05:55.319
How about sex?

00:05:56.414 --> 00:05:57.566
Oh, wow!

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.857
(Laughter)

00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:02.634
Yes, you are right, it will increase
the production of new neurons.

00:06:02.658 --> 00:06:04.810
However, it's all about balance here.

00:06:04.834 --> 00:06:07.047
We don't want to fall in a situation --

00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:08.999
(Laughter)

00:06:09.023 --> 00:06:11.857
about too much sex
leading to sleep deprivation.

00:06:11.881 --> 00:06:14.110
(Laughter)

00:06:14.753 --> 00:06:16.944
How about getting older?

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:23.328
So the neurogenesis rate
will decrease as we get older,

00:06:23.352 --> 00:06:25.098
but it is still occurring.

00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:28.233
And then finally, how about running?

00:06:29.912 --> 00:06:32.721
I will let you judge that one by yourself.

00:06:33.563 --> 00:06:35.359
So this is one of the first studies

00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:39.786
that was carried out by one of my mentors,
Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.084
showing that the environment
can have an impact

00:06:42.108 --> 00:06:43.997
on the production of new neurons.

00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:48.275
And here you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:50.544
that had no running wheel in its cage.

00:06:50.568 --> 00:06:54.603
And the little black dots you see
are actually newborn neurons-to-be.

00:06:55.246 --> 00:07:00.384
And now, you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse

00:07:00.408 --> 00:07:03.004
that had a running wheel in its cage.

00:07:03.028 --> 00:07:04.551
So you see the massive increase

00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:07.388
of the black dots representing
the new neurons-to-be.

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.612
So activity impacts neurogenesis,
but that's not all.

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:16.286
What you eat will have an effect

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.224
on the production of new neurons
in the hippocampus.

00:07:19.248 --> 00:07:22.208
So here we have a sample of diet --

00:07:22.232 --> 00:07:25.509
of nutrients that have been shown
to have efficacy.

00:07:25.973 --> 00:07:28.568
And I'm just going
to point a few out to you:

00:07:28.592 --> 00:07:33.686
Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:34.128 --> 00:07:37.610
Intermittent fasting --
spacing the time between your meals --

00:07:37.634 --> 00:07:39.773
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:39.797 --> 00:07:41.120
Intake of flavonoids,

00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:44.147
which are contained
in dark chocolate or blueberries,

00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:45.994
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:46.355 --> 00:07:47.861
Omega-3 fatty acids,

00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:50.096
present in fatty fish, like salmon,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.558
will increase the production
of these new neurons.

00:07:53.502 --> 00:07:57.603
Conversely, a diet rich
in high saturated fat

00:07:57.627 --> 00:08:00.367
will have a negative impact
on neurogenesis.

00:08:01.232 --> 00:08:05.414
Ethanol -- intake of alcohol --
will decrease neurogenesis.

00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:08.703
However, not everything is lost;

00:08:08.727 --> 00:08:11.779
resveratrol, which is
contained in red wine,

00:08:11.803 --> 00:08:15.294
has been shown to promote
the survival of these new neurons.

00:08:15.708 --> 00:08:17.574
So next time you are at a dinner party,

00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:21.602
you might want to reach for this possibly
"neurogenesis-neutral" drink.

00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:24.042
(Laughter)

00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:26.567
And then finally,
let me point out the last one --

00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:27.749
a quirky one.

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:31.668
So Japanese groups are fascinated
with food textures,

00:08:31.692 --> 00:08:36.995
and they have shown that actually
soft diet impairs neurogenesis,

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:41.740
as opposed to food that requires
mastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food.

00:08:42.827 --> 00:08:44.620
So all of this data,

00:08:44.644 --> 00:08:47.225
where we need to look
at the cellular level,

00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:49.756
has been generated using animal models.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.851
But this diet has also been given
to human participants,

00:08:54.875 --> 00:09:01.033
and what we could see is that
the diet modulates memory and mood

00:09:01.057 --> 00:09:04.541
in the same direction
as it modulates neurogenesis,

00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:09.322
such as: calorie restriction
will improve memory capacity,

00:09:09.346 --> 00:09:14.445
whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate
symptoms of depression --

00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:18.333
as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids,
which increase neurogenesis,

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:22.540
and also help to decrease
the symptoms of depression.

00:09:23.643 --> 00:09:28.460
So we think that the effect of diet

00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:32.079
on mental health, on memory and mood,

00:09:32.103 --> 00:09:36.575
is actually mediated by the production
of the new neurons in the hippocampus.

00:09:36.994 --> 00:09:38.914
And it's not only what you eat,

00:09:38.938 --> 00:09:42.003
but it's also the texture
of the food, when you eat it

00:09:42.027 --> 00:09:43.851
and how much of it you eat.

00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:49.874
On our side -- neuroscientists
interested in neurogenesis --

00:09:49.898 --> 00:09:53.563
we need to understand better
the function of these new neurons,

00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:57.571
and how we can control their survival
and their production.

00:09:57.896 --> 00:10:02.435
We also need to find a way to protect
the neurogenesis of Robert's patients.

00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:04.648
And on your side --

00:10:04.672 --> 00:10:07.102
I leave you in charge
of your neurogenesis.

00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:08.849
Thank you.

00:10:08.873 --> 00:10:14.832
(Applause)

00:10:14.856 --> 00:10:17.188
Margaret Heffernan:
Fantastic research, Sandrine.

00:10:17.212 --> 00:10:19.457
Now, I told you you changed my life --

00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:21.259
I now eat a lot of blueberries.

00:10:21.283 --> 00:10:22.830
Sandrine Thuret: Very good.

00:10:23.528 --> 00:10:25.972
MH: I'm really interested
in the running thing.

00:10:26.869 --> 00:10:28.520
Do I have to run?

00:10:29.368 --> 00:10:32.010
Or is it really just
about aerobic exercise,

00:10:32.034 --> 00:10:33.639
getting oxygen to the brain?

00:10:33.663 --> 00:10:35.798
Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise?

00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:37.838
ST: So for the moment,

00:10:37.862 --> 00:10:41.102
we can't really say
if it's just the running itself,

00:10:41.126 --> 00:10:46.163
but we think that anything that indeed
will increase the production --

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:49.267
or moving the blood flow to the brain,

00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:50.893
should be beneficial.

00:10:51.353 --> 00:10:53.980
MH: So I don't have to get
a running wheel in my office?

00:10:54.004 --> 00:10:55.167
ST: No, you don't!
