00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Let's pretend right here we have a machine.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
A big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and it's a time machine.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And everyone in this room has to get into it.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And you can go backwards, you can go forwards;

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
you cannot stay where you are.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
this question a lot lately and they all want to go back.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
or Twitter or "American Idol."

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I don't know.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And I understand that.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
It's because possibilities on this planet,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
they don't go back, they go forward.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
by any measure that you wish to choose:

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
health, wealth,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
mobility, opportunity,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
declining rates of disease ...

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
There's never been a time like this.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
My great-grandparents died, all of them,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
by the time they were 60.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
My grandparents pushed that number to 70.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
My parents are closing in on 80.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
So there better be

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
a nine at the beginning of my death number.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
But it's not even about people like us,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
because this is a bigger deal than that.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
A kid born in New Delhi today

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
can expect to live as long as

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
the richest man in the world did 100 years ago.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Think about that, it's an incredible fact.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And why is it true?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
of people on this planet.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
It reshaped the demography of the globe

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
in a way that no war ever has.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
It's gone. It's vanished.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
We vanquished it. Puff.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
In the rich world,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
no longer exist, hardly.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Diphtheria, rubella, polio ...

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
does anyone even know what those things are?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Vaccines, modern medicine,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
our ability to feed billions of people,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
those are triumphs of the scientific method.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And to my mind, the scientific method --

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
trying stuff out,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't --

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
is one of the great accomplishments of humanity.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
So that's the good news.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Unfortunately, that's all the good news

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And one of them is that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
despite all our accomplishments,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
a billion people go to bed hungry

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
in this world every day.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And not only that, we've used our imagination

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
to thoroughly trash this globe.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Potable water, arable land,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
rainforests, oil, gas:

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
they're going away, and they're going away soon,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and unless we innovate our way out of this mess,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
we're going away too.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
So the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
I think it's clear that we can make food

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
I think we can power this world with energy

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
that doesn't also destroy it.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
But here's the thing that keeps me up at night --

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
one of the things that keeps me up at night:

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
And we've also never been in a position

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
to deploy it properly in the way that we can today.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
We're on the verge of amazing, amazing events

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
in many fields,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and yet I actually think we'd have to go back

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
hundreds, 300 years, before the Enlightenment,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
to find a time when we battled progress,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
when we fought about these things

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
more vigorously, on more fronts, than we do now.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
People wrap themselves in their beliefs,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Not even the truth will set them free.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion;

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
they're even entitled to their opinion about progress.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
But you know what you're not entitled to?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And this took me awhile to figure out.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
for The New Yorker. A little story.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And I was amazed to find opposition:

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
opposition to what is, after all,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
the most effective public health measure in human history.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
I didn't know what to do,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And soon after that,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
I wrote a story about genetically engineered food.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Same thing, only bigger.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
People were going crazy.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
So I wrote a story about that too,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and I couldn't understand why

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
people thought this was "Frankenfoods,"

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
why they thought moving molecules around

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
in a specific, rather than a haphazard way,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
was trespassing on nature's ground.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
I mean, I'm a journalist.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
(Laughter)

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
But these stories bothered me,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
weren't actually fanatics at all.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
They were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
They were exactly like the people in this room.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
And it just disturbed me so much.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
But then I thought, you know, let's be honest.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
We're at a point in this world

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
We talk about it ambivalently.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it:

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
"progress."

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
We've lost faith in institutions,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
in authority,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and sometimes in science itself,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and there's no reason we shouldn't have.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
You can just say a few names

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and people will understand.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
hanging chads.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
You know, you can choose your list.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
There are questions and problems

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
with the people we used to believe were always right,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
so be skeptical.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Ask questions, demand proof, demand evidence.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
Don't take anything for granted.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
But here's the thing: When you get proof,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And the reason that I can say that is because

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
we're now in an epidemic of fear

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
About 12 years ago, there was a story published,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
a horrible story,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
that linked the epidemic of autism

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
Very scary.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Tons of studies were done to see if this was true.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Tons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
The data came back.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
The data came back from the United States, from England,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
from Sweden, from Canada,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and it was all the same: no correlation,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
no connection, none at all.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
because we believe anecdotes,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
we believe what we see, what we think we see,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
what makes us feel real.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
We don't believe a bunch of documents

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
from a government official giving us data,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and I do understand that, I think we all do.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
But you know what?

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
The result of that has been disastrous.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Disastrous because here's a fact:

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
The United States is one of the only countries in the world

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
where the vaccine rate for measles is going down.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
That is disgraceful,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
and we should be ashamed of ourselves.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
It's horrible.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
What kind of a thing happened

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
that we could do that?

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Now, I understand it. I do understand it.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
Because, did anyone have measles here?

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles?

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Doesn't happen very much.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Doesn't happen in this country at all,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
That's a lot of death of measles --

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
20 an hour.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and people like Jenny McCarthy

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
can go around preaching messages

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
of fear and illiteracy from platforms

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
like "Oprah" and "Larry King Live."

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And they can do it because

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
they don't link causation and correlation.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
They don't understand that these things seem the same,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
but they're almost never the same.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
That guy in the middle, not so much.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
His name is Paul Offit.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
It'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
in the developing world every year.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
Pretty good, right?

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and says how valuable they are

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
and that people ought to just stop the whining.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
And he actually says it that way.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
So, Paul's a terrorist.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
When Paul speaks in a public hearing,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
he can't testify without armed guards.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
He gets called at home

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
because people like to tell him

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
that they remember where his kids go to school.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
And why? Because Paul made a vaccine.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
You take them away, disease comes back,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
horrible diseases. And that's happening.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
We have measles in this country now.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
And it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
And they're not just going to die of measles.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
What about polio? Let's have that. Why not?

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
she thought I was a little strident.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
No one's ever said that before.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
no way.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Fine.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
Why? Because we don't have polio. And you know what?

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
We didn't have polio in this country yesterday.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
and he's going to come to Long Beach,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
and we don't either because that's the way the world works.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
Everyone take their vitamins this morning?

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
Echinacea, a little antioxidant

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
to get you going.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
I know you did because half of Americans do every day.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
They take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
and it doesn't matter how often

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
we find out that they're useless.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
The data says it all the time.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
(Laughter)

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine?

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
I'm totally with you.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
(Laughter)

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Dark urine. Dark.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
Well, I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
It's cruel to millions of people.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
It's absolutely astonishingly cold

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
So we run away from it, and where do we run?

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
We leap into the arms of Big Placebo.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
(Laughter)

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.260
(Applause)

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
But, you know, it's really a serious thing

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
because this stuff is crap,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and we spend billions of dollars on it.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And I have all sorts of little props here.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
None of it ... ginkgo, fraud;

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
echinacea, fraud;

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
acai -- I don't even know what that is

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
but we're spending billions of dollars on it -- it's fraud.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
And you know what? When I say this stuff, people scream at me,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and they say, "What do you care? Let people do what they want to do.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
It makes them feel good."

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
And you know what? You're wrong.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Because I don't care

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
if it's the secretary of HHS

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
who's saying, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
of my experts on mammograms,"

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
with coffee enemas.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
When you start down the road

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
where belief and magic replace evidence and science,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
you end up in a place you don't want to be.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
He killed 400,000 of his people

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
by insisting that beetroot,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
garlic and lemon oil

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
we know can slow the course of AIDS.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
in a country that has been plagued

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
worse than any other by this disease.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Please, don't tell me

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
there are no consequences to these things.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
There are. There always are.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
Now, the most mindless epidemic

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
we're in the middle of right now

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
is this absurd battle

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
between proponents of genetically engineered food

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
and the organic elite.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
It's a debate about words, about metaphors.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
It's ideology, it's not science.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
every sprig of parsley,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
every Brussels sprout

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
has been modified by man.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
You know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
There wasn't any cantaloupe. (Laughter)

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
We made it over the last 11,000 years.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
And some of it worked, and some of it didn't.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
We got rid of the stuff that didn't.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Now we can do it in a more precise way --

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
and there are risks, absolutely --

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
but we can put something like vitamin A into rice,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
and that stuff can help millions of people,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
millions of people, prolong their lives.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
You don't want to do that?

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
I have to say, I don't understand it.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
We object to genetically engineered food.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
Why do we do that?

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
Well, the things I constantly hear are:

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Too many chemicals,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
pesticides, hormones,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
monoculture, we don't want giant fields

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
of the same thing, that's wrong.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
We don't companies patenting life.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
We don't want companies owning seeds.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
And you know what my response to all of that is?

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Yes, you're right. Let's fix it.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
It's true, we've got a huge food problem,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
but this isn't science.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
This has nothing to do with science.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
It's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
You know science isn't a company.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
It's not a country.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
It's not even an idea; it's a process.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
but the idea that we should not allow

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
science to do its job

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
because we're afraid,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
is really very deadening,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
and it's preventing millions of people

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
from prospering.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
You know, in the next 50 years

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
70 percent.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
This investment in Africa over the last 30 years.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Disgraceful. Disgraceful.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
They need it, and we're not giving it to them.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And why? Genetically engineered food.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
We don't want to encourage people

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
to eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
Cassava's something that half a billion people eat.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
It's kind of like a potato.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
It's just a bunch of calories. It sucks.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
and scientists are engineering

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
all of that into it right now.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
They wouldn't starve, and you know what?

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
That would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
but it would be nice.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
And all I can say about this is:

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
Why are we fighting it?

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
I mean, let's ask ourselves: Why are we fighting it?

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
Because we don't want to move genes around?

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
our insistence on having bigger food,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
better food, singular food.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
This isn't about Rice Krispies,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
this is about keeping people alive,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and it's about time we started to understand what that meant.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
Because, you know something?

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of:

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
high-tech colonialism.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
There's no other way to describe what's going on here.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
It's selfish, it's ugly,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
it's beneath us,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
and we really have to stop it.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
So after this amazingly fun conversation,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
(Laughter)

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
you might want to say, "So, you still want to get in this

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
ridiculous time machine and go forward?"

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
It's stuck in the present right now,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
but we have an amazing opportunity.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
We can set that time machine on anything we want.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
We can move it where we want to move it,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
and we're going to move it where we want to move it.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
We have to have these conversations and we have to think,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
we're going to be happy we do.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
I know that we can,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
and as far as I'm concerned,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
that's something the world needs right now.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
(Applause)

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
Thank you.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
Thank you.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.260
Thank you. Thank you.
