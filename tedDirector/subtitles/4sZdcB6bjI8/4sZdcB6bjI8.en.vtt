00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:15.358
Raise your hand if you've ever
been asked the question

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:18.382
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:20.322
Now if you had to guess,

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:23.763
how old would you say you were
when you were first asked this question?

00:00:23.787 --> 00:00:25.386
You can just hold up fingers.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.632
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK.

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:35.332
Now, raise your hand if the question

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:37.378
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:39.932
has ever caused you any anxiety.

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.586
(Laughter)

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.832
Any anxiety at all.

00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:47.975
I'm someone who's never
been able to answer the question

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.289
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:00:50.313 --> 00:00:53.749
See, the problem wasn't
that I didn't have any interests --

00:00:53.773 --> 00:00:55.975
it's that I had too many.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:00.450
In high school, I liked English
and math and art and I built websites

00:01:00.474 --> 00:01:04.810
and I played guitar in a punk band
called Frustrated Telephone Operator.

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:06.975
Maybe you've heard of us.

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:09.299
(Laughter)

00:01:09.323 --> 00:01:11.228
This continued after high school,

00:01:11.252 --> 00:01:15.660
and at a certain point, I began
to notice this pattern in myself

00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:18.237
where I would become interested in an area

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:21.420
and I would dive in, become all-consumed,

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:24.975
and I'd get to be pretty good
at whatever it was,

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.601
and then I would hit this point
where I'd start to get bored.

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:32.822
And usually I would try
and persist anyway,

00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:35.743
because I had already devoted
so much time and energy

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:38.263
and sometimes money into this field.

00:01:38.287 --> 00:01:40.590
But eventually this sense of boredom,

00:01:40.614 --> 00:01:45.394
this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this,
this isn't challenging anymore --

00:01:45.418 --> 00:01:47.053
it would get to be too much.

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:49.410
And I would have to let it go.

00:01:50.262 --> 00:01:52.763
But then I would become interested
in something else,

00:01:52.787 --> 00:01:55.975
something totally unrelated,
and I would dive into that,

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.261
and become all-consumed,
and I'd be like, "Yes! I found my thing,"

00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:04.582
and then I would hit this point again
where I'd start to get bored.

00:02:05.352 --> 00:02:08.147
And eventually, I would let it go.

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:12.174
But then I would discover
something new and totally different,

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:13.769
and I would dive into that.

00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:18.842
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety,

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:20.048
for two reasons.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.292
The first was that I wasn't sure

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:26.329
how I was going to turn
any of this into a career.

00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:29.151
I thought that I would eventually
have to pick one thing,

00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:31.389
deny all of my other passions,

00:02:31.413 --> 00:02:34.809
and just resign myself to being bored.

00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:37.914
The other reason it caused me
so much anxiety

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:39.572
was a little bit more personal.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.948
I worried that there
was something wrong with this,

00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:47.090
and something wrong with me
for being unable to stick with anything.

00:02:47.677 --> 00:02:50.064
I worried that I was afraid of commitment,

00:02:50.088 --> 00:02:53.549
or that I was scattered,
or that I was self-sabotaging,

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:55.239
afraid of my own success.

00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:00.975
If you can relate to my story
and to these feelings,

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.273
I'd like you to ask yourself a question

00:03:03.297 --> 00:03:05.883
that I wish I had asked myself back then.

00:03:06.796 --> 00:03:12.222
Ask yourself where you learned to assign
the meaning of wrong or abnormal

00:03:12.246 --> 00:03:14.067
to doing many things.

00:03:15.741 --> 00:03:17.480
I'll tell you where you learned it:

00:03:17.504 --> 00:03:19.590
you learned it from the culture.

00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:25.865
We are first asked the question
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.457
when we're about five years old.

00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:31.174
And the truth is that no one really cares
what you say when you're that age.

00:03:31.198 --> 00:03:32.199
(Laughter)

00:03:32.223 --> 00:03:34.598
It's considered an innocuous question,

00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:36.982
posed to little kids
to elicit cute replies,

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:40.679
like, "I want to be an astronaut,"
or "I want to be a ballerina,"

00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:42.586
or "I want to be a pirate."

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.560
Insert Halloween costume here.

00:03:44.584 --> 00:03:46.095
(Laughter)

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:50.531
But this question gets asked of us
again and again as we get older

00:03:50.555 --> 00:03:54.432
in various forms -- for instance,
high school students might get asked

00:03:54.456 --> 00:03:56.683
what major they're going
to pick in college.

00:03:57.088 --> 00:03:58.970
And at some point,

00:03:58.994 --> 00:04:01.022
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:04:01.046 --> 00:04:04.404
goes from being
the cute exercise it once was

00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:06.700
to the thing that keeps us up at night.

00:04:07.137 --> 00:04:08.287
Why?

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.494
See, while this question inspires kids
to dream about what they could be,

00:04:14.518 --> 00:04:17.930
it does not inspire them to dream
about all that they could be.

00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:20.352
In fact, it does just the opposite,

00:04:20.376 --> 00:04:23.392
because when someone asks you
what you want to be,

00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:26.212
you can't reply with 20 different things,

00:04:26.236 --> 00:04:29.131
though well-meaning adults
will likely chuckle and be like,

00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:33.207
"Oh, how cute, but you can't be
a violin maker and a psychologist.

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.034
You have to choose."

00:04:36.105 --> 00:04:37.874
This is Dr. Bob Childs --

00:04:37.898 --> 00:04:40.975
(Laughter)

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.899
and he's a luthier and psychotherapist.

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:49.124
And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor
turned illustrator, entrepreneur,

00:04:49.148 --> 00:04:51.095
teacher and creative director.

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:53.825
But most kids don't hear
about people like this.

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.975
All they hear

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:58.299
is that they're going to have to choose.

00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:01.379
But it's more than that.

00:05:01.403 --> 00:05:04.395
The notion of the narrowly focused life

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.791
is highly romanticized in our culture.

00:05:07.218 --> 00:05:11.398
It's this idea of destiny
or the one true calling,

00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:14.179
the idea that we each have one great thing

00:05:14.203 --> 00:05:16.536
we are meant to do
during our time on this earth,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.443
and you need to figure out
what that thing is

00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:21.952
and devote your life to it.

00:05:23.135 --> 00:05:26.246
But what if you're someone
who isn't wired this way?

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.404
What if there are a lot of different
subjects that you're curious about,

00:05:30.428 --> 00:05:32.453
and many different things you want to do?

00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:37.123
Well, there is no room for someone
like you in this framework.

00:05:37.814 --> 00:05:39.785
And so you might feel alone.

00:05:40.412 --> 00:05:42.625
You might feel like you don't
have a purpose.

00:05:43.017 --> 00:05:45.702
And you might feel like
there's something wrong with you.

00:05:46.758 --> 00:05:48.480
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:05:48.908 --> 00:05:52.501
What you are is a multipotentialite.

00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:54.975
(Laughter)

00:05:54.999 --> 00:06:01.964
(Applause)

00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:07.265
A multipotentialite is someone
with many interests and creative pursuits.

00:06:07.852 --> 00:06:09.798
It's a mouthful to say.

00:06:09.822 --> 00:06:12.672
It might help if you break it up
into three parts:

00:06:12.696 --> 00:06:16.688
multi, potential, and ite.

00:06:16.712 --> 00:06:19.932
You can also use one of the other terms
that connote the same idea,

00:06:19.956 --> 00:06:22.922
such as polymath, the Renaissance person.

00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:24.890
Actually, during the Renaissance period,

00:06:24.914 --> 00:06:28.573
it was considered the ideal
to be well-versed in multiple disciplines.

00:06:29.026 --> 00:06:31.633
Barbara Sher refers to us as "scanners."

00:06:32.214 --> 00:06:35.437
Use whichever term you like,
or invent your own.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:38.516
I have to say I find it sort of fitting
that as a community,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.002
we cannot agree on a single identity.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:43.026
(Laughter)

00:06:45.017 --> 00:06:47.414
It's easy to see your multipotentiality

00:06:47.438 --> 00:06:51.351
as a limitation or an affliction
that you need to overcome.

00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:53.768
But what I've learned
through speaking with people

00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:56.260
and writing about these
ideas on my website,

00:06:56.284 --> 00:07:00.735
is that there are some tremendous
strengths to being this way.

00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:03.617
Here are three

00:07:03.641 --> 00:07:06.526
multipotentialite super powers.

00:07:07.384 --> 00:07:10.560
One: idea synthesis.

00:07:10.584 --> 00:07:13.277
That is, combining two or more fields

00:07:13.301 --> 00:07:15.967
and creating something new
at the intersection.

00:07:17.633 --> 00:07:20.899
Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew
from their shared interests

00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:26.419
in cartography, data visualization,
travel, mathematics and design,

00:07:26.443 --> 00:07:28.063
when they founded Meshu.

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:34.671
Meshu is a company that creates
custom geographically-inspired jewelry.

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:37.835
Sha and Rachel came up
with this unique idea

00:07:37.859 --> 00:07:43.609
not despite, but because of their eclectic
mix of skills and experiences.

00:07:45.077 --> 00:07:48.336
Innovation happens at the intersections.

00:07:48.797 --> 00:07:50.908
That's where the new ideas come from.

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:54.678
And multipotentialites,
with all of their backgrounds,

00:07:54.702 --> 00:07:58.237
are able to access a lot of these
points of intersection.

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:03.071
The second multipotentialite superpower

00:08:03.095 --> 00:08:04.586
is rapid learning.

00:08:05.404 --> 00:08:08.266
When multipotentialites
become interested in something,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.345
we go hard.

00:08:10.369 --> 00:08:13.140
We observe everything
we can get our hands on.

00:08:13.164 --> 00:08:14.907
We're also used to being beginners,

00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:18.053
because we've been beginners
so many times in the past,

00:08:18.077 --> 00:08:21.356
and this means that we're less afraid
of trying new things

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.762
and stepping out of our comfort zones.

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:27.815
What's more, many skills
are transferable across disciplines,

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:31.694
and we bring everything we've learned
to every new area we pursue,

00:08:31.718 --> 00:08:34.011
so we're rarely starting from scratch.

00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:38.597
Nora Dunn is a full-time traveler
and freelance writer.

00:08:39.121 --> 00:08:42.928
As a child concert pianist,
she honed an incredible ability

00:08:42.952 --> 00:08:44.657
to develop muscle memory.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.810
Now, she's the fastest typist she knows.

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:49.298
(Laughter)

00:08:49.322 --> 00:08:52.559
Before becoming a writer,
Nora was a financial planner.

00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:54.789
She had to learn
the finer mechanics of sales

00:08:54.813 --> 00:08:56.559
when she was starting her practice,

00:08:56.583 --> 00:09:00.552
and this skill now helps her
write compelling pitches to editors.

00:09:01.727 --> 00:09:05.597
It is rarely a waste of time
to pursue something you're drawn to,

00:09:05.621 --> 00:09:07.311
even if you end up quitting.

00:09:07.335 --> 00:09:10.639
You might apply that knowledge
in a different field entirely,

00:09:10.663 --> 00:09:13.270
in a way that you couldn't
have anticipated.

00:09:14.643 --> 00:09:17.414
The third multipotentialite superpower

00:09:17.438 --> 00:09:19.285
is adaptability;

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:22.852
that is, the ability to morph
into whatever you need to be

00:09:22.876 --> 00:09:24.652
in a given situation.

00:09:26.295 --> 00:09:31.186
Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director,
sometimes a web designer,

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.923
sometimes a Kickstarter consultant,
sometimes a teacher,

00:09:34.947 --> 00:09:37.338
and sometimes, apparently, James Bond.

00:09:37.362 --> 00:09:39.052
(Laughter)

00:09:39.076 --> 00:09:41.544
He's valuable because he does good work.

00:09:41.568 --> 00:09:44.829
He's even more valuable
because he can take on various roles,

00:09:44.853 --> 00:09:47.015
depending on his clients' needs.

00:09:47.737 --> 00:09:50.975
Fast Company magazine
identified adaptability

00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:54.354
as the single most important skill
to develop in order to thrive

00:09:54.378 --> 00:09:56.030
in the 21st century.

00:09:56.808 --> 00:10:00.023
The economic world is changing
so quickly and unpredictably

00:10:00.047 --> 00:10:03.818
that it is the individuals
and organizations that can pivot

00:10:03.842 --> 00:10:07.774
in order to meet the needs of the market
that are really going to thrive.

00:10:09.615 --> 00:10:13.906
Idea synthesis, rapid learning
and adaptability:

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.853
three skills that multipotentialites
are very adept at,

00:10:17.877 --> 00:10:22.403
and three skills that they might lose
if pressured to narrow their focus.

00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:29.637
As a society, we have a vested interest
in encouraging multipotentialites

00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:31.335
to be themselves.

00:10:32.073 --> 00:10:36.000
We have a lot of complex, multidimensional
problems in the world right now,

00:10:36.024 --> 00:10:39.801
and we need creative,
out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:46.474
Now, let's say that you are,
in your heart, a specialist.

00:10:46.498 --> 00:10:50.919
You came out of the womb knowing
you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon.

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:54.694
Don't worry -- there's nothing
wrong with you, either.

00:10:54.718 --> 00:10:55.758
(Laughter)

00:10:55.782 --> 00:10:58.825
In fact, some of the best teams
are comprised of a specialist

00:10:58.849 --> 00:11:01.456
and multipotentialite paired together.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.514
The specialist can dive in deep
and implement ideas,

00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:08.140
while the multipotentialite brings
a breadth of knowledge to the project.

00:11:08.164 --> 00:11:10.066
It's a beautiful partnership.

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:13.535
But we should all be designing
lives and careers

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:16.068
that are aligned with how we're wired.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:20.510
And sadly, multipotentialites
are largely being encouraged

00:11:20.534 --> 00:11:23.542
simply to be more
like their specialist peers.

00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:27.100
So with that said,

00:11:27.124 --> 00:11:30.195
if there is one thing
you take away from this talk,

00:11:30.219 --> 00:11:33.317
I hope that it is this:

00:11:33.341 --> 00:11:36.703
embrace your inner wiring,
whatever that may be.

00:11:37.687 --> 00:11:39.855
If you're a specialist at heart,

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:41.878
then by all means, specialize.

00:11:41.902 --> 00:11:44.099
That is where you'll do your best work.

00:11:44.624 --> 00:11:47.604
But to the multipotentialites in the room,

00:11:47.628 --> 00:11:49.945
including those of you
who may have just realized

00:11:49.969 --> 00:11:51.985
in the last 12 minutes that you are one --

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:53.614
(Laughter)

00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:55.790
to you I say:

00:11:55.814 --> 00:11:57.916
embrace your many passions.

00:11:58.614 --> 00:12:01.897
Follow your curiosity
down those rabbit holes.

00:12:02.643 --> 00:12:04.667
Explore your intersections.

00:12:06.264 --> 00:12:11.026
Embracing our inner wiring leads
to a happier, more authentic life.

00:12:12.028 --> 00:12:14.745
And perhaps more importantly --

00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:18.568
multipotentialites, the world needs us.

00:12:19.852 --> 00:12:21.013
Thank you.

00:12:21.037 --> 00:12:23.730
(Applause)
