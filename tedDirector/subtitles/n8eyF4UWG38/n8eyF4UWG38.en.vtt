00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I'm standing in front of you today

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
in all humility,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
wanting to share with you

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
my journey of the last six years

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
in the field of service

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
and education.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And I'm not a trained academic.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Neither am I a veteran social worker.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I was 26 years in the corporate world,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
trying to make organizations profitable.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And then in 2003

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
from my kitchen table.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.260
The first thing that we did was walk through the slums.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
You know, by the way, there are two million people

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.260
in Bangalore, who live in 800 slums.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
We couldn't go to all the slums,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
but we tried to cover as much as we could.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
We walked through these slums,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.260
identified houses where children would never go to school.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
We talked to the parents,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
tried to convince them about sending their children to school.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
We played with the children,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and came back home really tired,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
exhausted, but with images

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
of bright faces, twinkling eyes,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and went to sleep.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
We were all excited to start,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
but the numbers hit us then:

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
200 million children

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
between four to 14 that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
should be going to school, but do not;

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
100 million children

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
who go to school but cannot read;

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.260
125 million who cannot do basic maths.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.260
We also heard that 250 billion Indian rupees

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
was dedicated for government schooling.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and administrators' salary.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And yet, India has nearly

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
the highest teacher absenteeism

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
in the world,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
with one out of four teachers

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.260
not going to school at all the entire academic year.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Those numbers were absolutely mind-boggling,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
overwhelming, and we were constantly asked,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
"When will you start? How many schools will you start?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
How many children will you get?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
How are you going to scale?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
How are you going to replicate?"

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.260
It was very difficult not to get scared, not to get daunted.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
But we dug our heels

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
and said, "We're not in the number game.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.260
We want to take one child at a time

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and take the child right through school,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
sent to college,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and get them prepared for better living,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
a high value job."

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
So, we started Parikrma.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
The first Parikrma school

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
started in a slum

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
where there were 70,000 people

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
living below the poverty line.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Our first school was

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.260
on a rooftop of a building inside the slums,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
a second story building, the only second story building

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
inside the slums.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And that rooftop did not have

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.260
any ceiling, only half a tin sheet.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.260
That was our first school. One hundred sixty-five children.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Indian academic year begins in June.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
So, June it rains, so many a times

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
all of us would be huddled under the tin roof,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
waiting for the rain to stop.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.260
My God! What a bonding exercise that was.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And all of us

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.260
that were under that roof are still here together today.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Then came the second school,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
the third school, the fourth school

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and a junior college.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
In six years now,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
we have four schools, one junior college,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
1,100 children

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
coming from 28 slums

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and four orphanages.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
(Applause)

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Our dream is very simple:

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
to send each of these kids, get them prepared

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
to be educated

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
but also to live peacefully,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
contented in this conflict-ridden

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.260
chaotic globalized world.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Now, when you talk global

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
you have to talk English.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And so all our schools

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
are English medium schools.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
But they know there is this myth

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
that children from the slums

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
cannot speak English well.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
No one in their family has spoken English.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.260
No one in their generation has spoken English.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
But how wrong it is.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Girl: I like adventurous books, and some of my favorites

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.260
are Alfred Hitchcock and [unclear]

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and Hardy Boys.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Although they are like

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
in different contexts,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
one is magical, the other two are like investigation,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
I like those books because

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
they have something special in them.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
The vocabulary used in those books

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and the style of writing.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
I mean like once I pick up one book

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
Even if it takes me four and a half hours,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
or three and half hours to finish my book, I do it.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Boy: I did good research and I got the information

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
[on the] world's fastest cars.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:53.260
I like Ducati ZZ143,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
because it is the fastest,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
the world's fastest bike,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and I like Pulsar 220 DTSI

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
because it is India's fastest bike. (Laughter)

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Shukla Bose: Well, that girl that you saw,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
her father sells flowers on the roadside.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And this little boy has been coming to school for five years.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.260
But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
love fast bikes? (Laughter)

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
He hasn't seen one, he hasn't ridden one, of course,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.260
but he has done a lot of research through Google search.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
You know, when we started with our English medium schools

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
we also decided to adopt

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
the best curriculum possible,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
the ICSE curriculum.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
And again, there were people who laughed at me

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and said, "Don't be crazy

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
choosing such a tough curriculum for these students.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
They'll never be able to cope."

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Not only do our children cope very well,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
but they excel in it.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
You should just come across to see

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
how well our children do.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
There is also this myth that

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
parents from the slums

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
are not interested in their children going to school;

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
they'd much rather put them to work.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
That's absolute hogwash.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
All parents all over the world

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.260
want their children to lead a better life than themselves,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.260
but they need to believe that change is possible.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
Video: (Hindi)

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
SB: We have 80 percent attendance

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
for all our parents-teachers meeting.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Sometimes it's even 100 percent,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
much more than many privileged schools.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
Fathers have started to attend.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
It's very interesting. When we started our school

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.260
the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.260
Now they have started writing their signature.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
The children have taught them.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.260
It's amazing how much children can teach.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
We have, a few months ago,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
actually late last year,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
we had a few mothers who came to us and said,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.260
"You know, we want to learn how to read and write.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Can you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
for our parents, for our mothers.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
We had 25 mothers who came regularly

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
after school to study.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
We want to continue with this program

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.260
and extend it to all our other schools.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Ninety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
So, you can imagine how traumatized

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.260
and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.260
We have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
and when they come back,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.260
most times sober, we have to find a job for them

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
so that they don't regress.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.260
We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:26.260
We have taught them nutrition, hygiene.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
We have helped them set up the kitchen

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
and now they are supplying food to all our children.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
They do a very good job because

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
their children are eating their food,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
but most importantly this is the first time

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
they have got respect,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
More than 90 percent of our non-teaching staff

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.260
are all parents and extended families.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
We've started many programs

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.260
just to make sure that the child comes to school.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Vocational skill program for the older siblings

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.260
so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
There is also this myth that children from the slums

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.260
cannot integrate with mainstream.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Take a look at this little girl

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
who was one of the 28 children

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
from all privileged schools,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
best schools in the country

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
that was selected for the Duke University

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
talent identification program

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
Video: Girl: Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
it was such a pride for us to go to that camp.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Everybody was very friendly,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
especially I got a lot of friends.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
And I felt that my English has improved a lot

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
going there and chatting with friends.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.260
There they met children who are

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.260
with a different standard and

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
a different mindset, a totally different society.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
I mingled with almost everyone.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
They were very friendly.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
I had very good friends there,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.260
who are from Delhi, who are from Mumbai.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.260
Even now we are in touch through Facebook.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.260
After this Ahmedabad trip

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
I've been like a totally different

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
mingling with people and all of those.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Before that I feel like I wasn't like this.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.260
I don't even mingle, or start speaking with someone so quickly.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.260
My accent with English improved a lot.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And I learned football, volleyball,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
Frisbee, lots of games.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Such beautiful food,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
I enjoyed eating food like

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:52.260
[unclear] would come and ask me,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
"Yes ma'am, what you want?" It was so good to hear!

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
(Laughter)

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.260
(Applause)

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
SB: This girl was working as a maid

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
before she came to school.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.260
And today she wants to be a neurologist.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.260
Our children are doing brilliantly in sports.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
They are really excelling.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
There is an inter-school athletic competition

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
that is held every year

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.260
in Bangalore, where 5,000 children participate

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
from 140 best schools in the city.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:34.260
We've got the best school award for three years successively.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
And our children are coming back home

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.260
with bags full of medals, with lots of admirers and friends.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.260
Last year there were a couple of kids

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
from elite schools that came

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
to ask for admissions in our school.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:53.260
We also have our very own dream team.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Why is this happening? Why this confidence?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Is it the exposure? We have professors

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
from MIT, Berkeley, Stanford,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Indian Institute of Science

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.260
who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
experiments, much beyond the classroom.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
Art, music are considered

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.260
therapy and mediums of expression.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
We also believe that

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.260
it's the content that is more important.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.260
It is not the infrastructure,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
not the toilets, not the libraries,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
but it is what actually happens in this school

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
that is more important.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
Creating an environment of learning,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
of inquiry, of exploration

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
is what is true education.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
When we started Parikrma

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
we had no idea which direction we were taking.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
But we know for sure that

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.260
what we want to do today is

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
take one child at a time,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
not get bogged with numbers,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.260
and actually see the child complete

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
the circle of life,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.260
and unleash his total potential.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.260
We do not believe in scale

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
because we believe in quality,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.260
and scale and numbers will automatically happen.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
We have corporates that have stood behind us,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
and we are able to, now, open more schools.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
But we began with the idea

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
of one child at a time.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
This is five-year-old Parusharam.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
He was begging

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
by a bus stop a few years ago,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
got picked up and is now in an orphanage,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.260
has been coming to school for the last four and a half months.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
He's in kindergarten.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
He has learned how to speak English.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
We have a model by which kids can speak English

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
and understand English

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
in three month's time.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
He can tell you stories in English

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
of the thirsty crow, of the crocodile

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
and of the giraffe.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
And if you ask him what he likes to do

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
he will say, "I like sleeping.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
I like eating. I like playing."

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
And if you ask him what he wants to do,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
he will say, "I want to horsing."

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
Now, "horsing" is going for a horse ride.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
So, Parusharam comes to my office every day.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
He comes for a tummy rub,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
because he believes that will give me luck. (Laughter)

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
When I started Parikrma

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.260
I began with a great deal of arrogance

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
of transforming the world.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
But today I have been transformed.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
I have been changed with my children.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
I've learned so much from them:

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
love, compassion, imagination

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
and such creativity.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.260
Parusharam is Parikrma

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
with a simple beginning but a long way to go.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
I promise you, Parusharam

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.260
will speak in the TED conference a few years from now.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Thank you.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:17.260
(Applause)
