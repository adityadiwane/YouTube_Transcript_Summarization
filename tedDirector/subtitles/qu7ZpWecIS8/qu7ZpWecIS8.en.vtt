00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The story starts in Kenya

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
in December of 2007,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
when there was a disputed presidential election,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and in the immediate aftermath of that election,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
there was an outbreak of ethnic violence.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And there was a lawyer in Nairobi, Ory Okolloh --

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
who some of you may know from her TEDTalk --

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
who began blogging about it on her site,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Kenyan Pundit.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
the government suddenly imposed

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
a significant media blackout.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And so weblogs went from being

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
commentary as part of the media landscape

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
to being a critical part of the media landscape

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
in trying to understand where the violence was.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And Okolloh solicited

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
from her commenters

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
more information about what was going on.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
The comments began pouring in,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and Okolloh would collate them. She would post them.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And she quickly said, "It's too much.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
I could do this all day every day

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and I can't keep up.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
There is more information

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
about what's going on in Kenya right now

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
than any one person can manage.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
If only there was a way to automate this."

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And two programmers who read her blog

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
held their hands up and said, "We could do that,"

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and in 72 hours, they launched Ushahidi.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Ushahidi -- the name means "witness"

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
or "testimony" in Swahili --

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
is a very simple way of taking reports from the field,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
whether it's from the web or, critically,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
via mobile phones and SMS,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
aggregating it and putting it on a map.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
That's all it is, but that's all that's needed

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
because what it does is it takes the tacit information

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
available to the whole population --

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
everybody knows where the violence is,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
but no one person knows what everyone knows --

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and it takes that tacit information

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and it aggregates it,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and it maps it and it makes it public.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And that, that maneuver

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
called "crisis mapping,"

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
was kicked off in Kenya

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
in January of 2008.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
that the programmers who created Ushahidi

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
decided they were going to make it open source

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and turn it into a platform.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
It's since been deployed in Mexico

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
to track electoral fraud.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And it's been used most famously in Haiti

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
in the aftermath of the earthquake.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And when you look at the map

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
now posted on the Ushahidi front page,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
has gone worldwide, all right?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
This went from a single idea

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and a single implementation

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
in East Africa in the beginning of 2008

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
to a global deployment

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
in less than three years.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Now what Okolloh did

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
would not have been possible

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
without digital technology.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
What Okolloh did would not have been possible

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
without human generosity.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And the interesting moment now,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
the number of environments

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
where the social design challenge

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
relies on both of those things being true.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
That is the resource that I'm talking about.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
I call it cognitive surplus.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And it represents the ability

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
of the world's population

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
on large, sometimes global, projects.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Cognitive surplus is made up of two things.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
The first, obviously, is the world's free time and talents.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
The world has over

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
a trillion hours a year

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
of free time

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
to commit to shared projects.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Now, that free time existed in the 20th century,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
but we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
That's the second half of cognitive surplus.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
The media landscape in the 20th century

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
was very good at helping people consume,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and we got, as a result,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
very good at consuming.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
But now that we've been given media tools --

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
the Internet, mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
because we liked to be.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
We were couch potatoes because that was

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
the only opportunity given to us.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
We still like to consume, of course.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
But it turns out we also like to create,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and we like to share.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
And it's those two things together --

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
ancient human motivation

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and the modern tools to allow that motivation

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
to be joined up in large-scale efforts --

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
that are the new design resource.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
And using cognitive surplus,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
we're starting to see truly incredible experiments

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
in scientific, literary,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
artistic, political efforts.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Designing.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
We're also getting, of course, a lot of LOLcats.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
LOLcats are cute pictures of cats

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
made cuter with the addition of cute captions.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And they are also

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
This is one of the participatory --

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
one of the participatory models

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
we see coming out of that, along with Ushahidi.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Now I want to stipulate, as the lawyers say,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
that LOLcats are the stupidest possible

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
creative act.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
There are other candidates of course,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
but LOLcats will do as a general case.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
But here's the thing:

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
The stupidest possible creative act

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
is still a creative act.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Someone who has done something like this,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
however mediocre and throwaway,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
has tried something, has put something forward in public.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
And once they've done it, they can do it again,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and they could work on getting it better.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
it's a spectrum you're constantly

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
struggling to get on top of.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
The gap is between

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
doing anything and doing nothing.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And someone who makes a LOLcat

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
has already crossed over that gap.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
without the LOLcats, right,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
But media abundance never works that way.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Even with the sacred printing press,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
we got erotic novels 150 years

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
before we got scientific journals.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
So before I talk about

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
what is, I think, the critical difference

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
between LOLcats and Ushahidi,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
I want to talk about

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
their shared source.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
And that source is design for generosity.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
It is one of the curiosities of our historical era

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
that even as cognitive surplus

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
is becoming a resource we can design around,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
social sciences are also starting to explain

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
how important

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
our intrinsic motivations are to us,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
how much we do things because we like to do them

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
rather than because our boss told us to do them,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
or because we're being paid to do them.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
This is a graph from a paper

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
who set out to test, at the beginning of this decade,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
what they called "deterrence theory."

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior:

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
If you want somebody to do less of something,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
add a punishment and they'll do less of it.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Simple, straightforward, commonsensical --

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
also, largely untested.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
And so they went and studied

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
10 daycare centers in Haifa, Israel.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
They studied those daycare centers

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
at the time of highest tension,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
which is pick-up time.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
At pick-up time the teachers,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
who have been with your children all day,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
Meanwhile, the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work, running late, running errands --

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
want a little slack to pick the kids up late.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
So Gneezy and Rustichini said,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
"How many instances of late pick-ups

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
are there at these 10 daycare centers?"

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Now they saw -- and this is what the graph is,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals --

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
that there were between six and 10

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
instances of late pick-ups

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
on average in these 10 daycare centers.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
So they divided the daycare centers into two groups.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
The white group there

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
is the control group; they change nothing.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
they said, "We are changing this bargain

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
as of right now.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
If you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
we're going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Boom. No ifs, ands or buts."

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
And the minute they did that,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
the behavior in those daycare centers changed.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
Late pick-ups went up

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
every week for the next four weeks

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and then they fluctuated

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
at between double and triple the pre-fine average

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
for the life of the fine.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
And you can see immediately what happened, right?

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
The fine broke the culture

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
of the daycare center.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
By adding a fine,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
what they did was communicate to the parents

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
that their entire debt to the teachers

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
had been discharged

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
with the payment of 10 shekels,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
that the parents owed the teachers.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
And so the parents, quite sensibly, said,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
"10 shekels to pick my kid up late?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
What could be bad?"

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
(Laughter)

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
The explanation of human behavior

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
that we inherited in the 20th century

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
was that we are all rational, self-maximizing actors,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and in that explanation --

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
the daycare center had no contract --

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
should have been operating without any constraints.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
But that's not right.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
They were operating with social constraints

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
rather than contractual ones.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
And critically, the social constraints

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
created a culture that was more generous

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
than the contractual constraints did.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks --

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
run the fine for a dozen weeks --

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
and then they say, "Okay, that's it. All done; fine."

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
And then a really interesting thing happens:

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
Nothing changes.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
The culture that got broken by the fine

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
stayed broken when the fine was removed.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
Not only are economic motivations

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
and intrinsic motivations

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
incompatible,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
that incompatibility

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
can persist over long periods.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
So the trick

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
in designing these kinds of situations

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
is to understand where you're relying on

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers --

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
when you're really designing for generosity.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
This brings me back to the LOLcats

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
and to Ushahidi.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
This is, I think, the range that matters.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Both of these rely on cognitive surplus.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
Both of these design for the assumption

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
that people like to create and we want to share.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Here is the critical difference between these:

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
LOLcats is communal value.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
It's value created by the participants

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
for each other.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
Communal value on the networks we have

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
is everywhere --

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
every time you see a large aggregate

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
of shared, publicly available data,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
whether it's photos on Flickr

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
or videos on Youtube or whatever.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
This is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
maybe a little more even,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
but this is also

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
a largely solved problem.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
I have a hard time envisioning a future

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
in which someone is saying,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
"Where, oh where, can I find a picture

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
of a cute cat?"

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
Ushahidi, by contrast,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
is civic value.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
It's value created by the participants

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
but enjoyed by society as a whole.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
The goals set out by Ushahidi

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
are not just to make life better

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
for the participants,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
but to make life better for everyone in the society

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
in which Ushahidi is operating.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
And that kind of civic value

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
is not just a side effect

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
of opening up to human motivation.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
It really is going to be a side effect

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
of what we, collectively,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
make of these kinds of efforts.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
There are a trillion

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
hours a year

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
of participatory value

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
up for grabs.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
That will be true year-in and year-out.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
The number of people who are going to be able

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
to participate in these kinds of projects

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
is going to grow,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
and we can see that organizations

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
designed around a culture of generosity

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
can achieve incredible effects

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
without an enormous amount of contractual overhead --

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
a very different model

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
What's going to make the difference here

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
is what Dean Kamen said,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
the inventor and entrepreneur.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
Kamen said, "Free cultures get what they celebrate."

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
We've got a choice before us.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
We've got this trillion hours a year.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
We can use it to crack each other up, and we're going to do that.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
That, we get for free.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
But we can also celebrate

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
and support and reward the people

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
trying to use cognitive surplus

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
to create civic value.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
And to the degree we're going to do that, to the degree we're able to do that,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
we'll be able to change society.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
Thank you very much.
