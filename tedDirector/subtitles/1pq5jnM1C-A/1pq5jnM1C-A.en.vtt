00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Do you know how many choices you make

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
in a typical day?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Do you know how many choices you make

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
in typical week?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I recently did a survey

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
with over 2,000 Americans,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
and the average number of choices

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
that the typical American reports making

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
is about 70 in a typical day.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
There was also recently a study done with CEOs

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
that these CEOs engaged in

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and how much time they spent engaging

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
in making decisions related to these tasks.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And they found that the average CEO

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
50 percent of their decisions

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
were made in nine minutes or less.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Only about 12 percent of the decisions

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.260
did they make an hour or more of their time.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Think about your own choices.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Do you know how many choices

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
make it into your nine minute category

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
versus your one hour category?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
How well do you think you're doing

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
at managing those choices?

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Today I want to talk

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
which is the choice overload problem.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
I want to talk about the problem

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and some potential solutions.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Now as I talk about this problem,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
I'm going to have some questions for you

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
and I'm going to want to know your answers.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So when I ask you a question,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
since I'm blind,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
(Laughter)

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Otherwise, when I ask you a question,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and if your answer is yes,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
I'd like you to clap your hands.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
So for my first question for you today:

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
(Applause)

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Thank you.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
at least at that time it was truly upscale.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
It was a store called Draeger's.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and over 500 different kinds

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
of fruits and vegetables

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
I used to love going to this store,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
but on one occasion I asked myself,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
well how come you never buy anything?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Here's their olive oil aisle.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
including those that were in a locked case

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.260
that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and I asked the manager,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
"Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And he pointed to the busloads of tourists

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
that would show up everyday,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
with cameras ready usually.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
We decided to do a little experiment,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and we picked jam for our experiment.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Here's their jam aisle.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
They had 348 different kinds of jam.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
We set up a little tasting booth

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
right near the entrance of the store.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
We there put out six different flavors of jam

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
or 24 different flavors of jam,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and we looked at two things:

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
First, in which case

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
than when there were six,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
about 40 percent.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
The next thing we looked at

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
is in which case were people more likely

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
to buy a jar of jam.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Now we see the opposite effect.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Of the people who stopped when there were 24,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Of the people who stopped when there were six,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
well now we saw that 30 percent of them

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
actually bought a jar of jam.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Now if you do the math,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
if they encountered six

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
than if they encountered 24.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
is probably good for us --

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
at least it's good for our waistlines --

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
even in very consequential decisions.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
We choose not to choose,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
even when it goes against our best self-interests.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
So now for the topic of today: financial savings.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
where we looked at the retirement savings decisions

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
of nearly a million Americans

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
from about 650 plans

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
all in the U.S.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And what we looked at

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
was whether the number of fund offerings

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
available in a retirement savings plan,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
the 401(k) plan,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
does that affect people's likelihood

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
to save more for tomorrow.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And what we found

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
was that indeed there was a correlation.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
So in these plans, we had about 657 plans

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
that ranged from offering people

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And what we found was that,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
the more funds offered,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
indeed, there was less participation rate.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
So if you look at the extremes,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
those plans that offered you two funds,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
participation rates were around in the mid-70s --

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
still not as high as we want it to be.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
participation rates have now dropped

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
to about the 60th percentile.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Now it turns out

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
that even if you do choose to participate

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
when there are more choices present,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
even then, it has negative consequences.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
So for those people who did choose to participate,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
the more choices available,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
the more likely people were

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
The more choices available,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
the more likely they were

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
to put all their money in pure money market accounts.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Now neither of these extreme decisions

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
are the kinds of decisions

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
that any of us would recommend for people

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
when you're considering their future financial well-being.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Well, over the past decade,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
we have observed three main negative consequences

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
to offering people more and more choices.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
They're more likely to delay choosing --

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
They're more likely to make worse choices --

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
worse financial choices, medical choices.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
even when they do objectively better.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
The main reason for this

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.260
is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.260
and actually picking from that stunning display.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
So what I want to propose to you today

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
are four simple techniques --

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
techniques that we have tested in one way or another

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
in different research venues --

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
that you can easily apply

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
in your businesses.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
The first: Cut.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
You've heard it said before,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
but it's never been more true than today,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
that less is more.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
People are always upset when I say, "Cut."

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
But in fact, what we're seeing more and more

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
is that if you are willing to cut,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
get rid of those extraneous redundant options,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
well there's an increase in sales,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
there's a lowering of costs,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.260
there is an improvement of the choosing experience.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
When Proctor &amp; Gamble

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
When the Golden Cat Corporation

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
they saw an increase in profits

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
by 87 percent --

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
a function of both increase in sales

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and lowering of costs.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
You know, the average grocery store today

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
offers you 45,000 products.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.260
But the ninth largest retailer,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
the ninth biggest retailer in the world today

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
is Aldi,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
and it offers you only 1,400 products --

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
one kind of canned tomato sauce.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Now in the financial savings world,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
I think one of the best examples that has recently come out

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
on how to best manage the choice offerings

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
which was the program that they have at Harvard.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Every single Harvard employee

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
is now automatically enrolled

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
in a lifecycle fund.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
For those people who actually want to choose,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
they're given 20 funds,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
not 300 or more funds.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
You know, often, people say,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
"I don't know how to cut.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
They're all important choices."

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
"Tell me how these choices are different from one another.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
And if your employees can't tell them apart,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
neither can your consumers."

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
Now before we started our session this afternoon,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
I had a chat with Gary.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And Gary said that he would be willing

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
to offer people in this audience

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
an all-expenses-paid free vacation

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.260
to the most beautiful road in the world.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Here's a description of the road.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
And I'd like you to read it.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
and then I want you to clap your hands

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
(Light clapping)

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
Is that all?

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
All right, let me show you some more about this.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
(Laughter)

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
(Honk)

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
Now who's ready to go on this trip.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
(Applause)

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
(Laughter)

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
I think I might have actually heard more hands.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
All right.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Now in fact,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
you had objectively more information

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
the first time around than the second time around,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
but I would venture to guess

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.260
that you felt that it was more real the second time around.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Because the pictures made it feel

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
more real to you.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
Which brings me to the second technique

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
for handling the choice overload problem,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
which is concretization.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
That in order for people to understand

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
the differences between the choices,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
they have to be able to understand

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
the consequences associated with each choice,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and that the consequences need to be felt

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.260
in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
when they use an ATM card or a credit card

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
as opposed to cash?

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
Because it doesn't feel like real money.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
And it turns out

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
that making it feel more concrete

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
can actually be a very positive tool

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
to use in getting people to save more.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
and Alessandro Previtero,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.260
we did a study with people at ING --

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
employees that are all working at ING --

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
and now these people were all in a session

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
where they're doing enrollment for their 401(k) plan.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And during that session,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
but we added one little thing.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
The one little thing we added

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
was we asked people

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
if you saved more.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
By doing that simple thing,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
by four percent.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
The third technique: Categorization.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
We can handle more categories

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
than we can handle choices.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
So for example,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
up and down the northeast corridor,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
the magazine aisles range anywhere

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
from 331 different kinds of magazines

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
all the way up to 664.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
But you know what?

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
If I show you 600 magazines

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
and I divide them up into 10 categories,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
versus I show you 400 magazines

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
and divide them up into 20 categories,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
you believe that I have given you

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
more choice and a better choosing experience

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
if I gave you the 400

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
than if I gave you the 600.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Here are two different jewelry displays.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing."

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
If you think the display on the left is Swing

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
and the display on the right is Jazz,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
clap your hands.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
(Light Clapping)

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
Okay, there's some.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
clap your hands.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Okay, a bit more.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
Now it turns out you're right.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
but you know what?

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
This is a highly useless categorization scheme.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
(Laughter)

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
The categories need to say something

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
to the chooser, not the choice-maker.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And you often see that problem

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.260
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
It turns out we can actually

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
handle a lot more information than we think we can,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
we've just got to take it a little easier.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
We have to gradually increase the complexity.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Let's take a very, very complicated decision:

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
buying a car.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Here's a German car manufacturer

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
You've got to make 60 different decisions,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
completely make up your car.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
Now these decisions vary

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
in the number of choices that they offer per decision.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
Car colors, exterior car colors --

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
I've got 56 choices.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Engines, gearshift -- four choices.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
So now what I'm going to do

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
So half of the customers

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
to low choice, four gearshifts.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
The other half of the customers

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
to 56 car colors, high choice.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
What am I going to look at?

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
How engaged you are.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
If you keep hitting the default button per decision,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
that means you're getting overwhelmed,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
that means I'm losing you.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
What you find

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
is the people who go from high choice to low choice,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
We're losing them.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
They go from low choice to high choice,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
they're hanging in there.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
The only thing that I have done

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
is I have varied the order

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
in which that information is presented.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
If I start you off easy,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
I learn how to choose.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
Even though choosing gearshift

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
it still prepares me for how to choose.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
so I'm more willing to be motivated

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
to be engaged.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
So let me recap.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
I have talked about four techniques

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
for mitigating the problem of choice overload --

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives;

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
concretize -- make it real;

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.260
categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices;

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
condition for complexity.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
are designed to help you manage your choices --

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
better for you, you can use them on yourself,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
better for the people that you are serving.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
Because I believe that the key

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
to getting the most from choice

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
is to be choosy about choosing.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
the better we will be able

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
to practice the art of choosing.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
Thank you very much.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
(Applause)
