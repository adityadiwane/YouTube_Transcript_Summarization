00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
Just to put everything in context,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.330
and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
so that a lot of the things I'm going to say,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
and the things I'm going to do --

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
or things I'm going to tell you I've done --

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.330
you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.330
I graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.330
And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.330
Finished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.330
And by the time I was an intern house officer,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.330
I could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car --

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.330
and I was a paid doctor.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.330
This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.330
are now, as they say, in diaspora.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
Now, are we going to make that a permanent thing,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.330
where we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
Perhaps not, I should certainly hope not --

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.330
because that is not my vision.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.330
All right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.330
and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.330
People getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.330
the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
But, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.330
not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.330
between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
Very interesting.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.330
How many people do you think are on that taxi?

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
And believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
that's a taxi, and you have police on them.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:28.330
So, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.330
So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.330
that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
and I didn't have a helmet, either.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.330
And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.330
on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.330
Believe it or not, some of us do survive.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.330
Some of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.330
And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.330
"You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country."

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
And she's right. Every time you go there,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.330
you know that if you actually need critical care --

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident --

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.330
of which there are many, there are accidents everywhere --

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
where do they go?

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.330
Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
I'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.330
AIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid -- the list goes on.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.330
I'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
When I go back home -- and I do all kinds of things,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.330
I teach, I train -- but I catch one of these things,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.330
or I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.330
What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled?

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.330
I think it's quite significant. This is where they go.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.330
These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden --

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.330
this is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.330
Now that is less than a year old, in an operating room.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
You remember all that oil?

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.330
Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.330
I think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
You can say some of this is education.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.330
You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.330
I'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
malaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
In fact, when I start running around saying,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
"Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S.,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
can you come home with me and do a mission?"

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
I want them to think, "Well there's some hope."

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
Now, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
And that's my specialty, right?

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.330
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.330
It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
And believe me, these are current pictures.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.330
Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K.,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.330
that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.330
All right, this is a slide from a talk I gave

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.330
about intensive care units in Nigeria,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.330
and jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare."

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:54.330
Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
So, these are the problems.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.330
There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
I think we all know. And several speakers before

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.330
and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.330
These are a few of them. So, what did I do?

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
There we go -- we're going on a mission.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.330
We're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.330
on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
cardiac nurse, intensive care nurse.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.330
We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.330
Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
and I do believe in charity. They have their place,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.330
but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier?

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.330
Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.330
Health is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:57.330
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.330
So, here we are, mission. Big trouble.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
That's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
Does he look like he's happy?

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.330
It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.330
you know, we worked on it. Does he look happy?

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
"Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
you can't do this, I just know it."

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.330
Look, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.330
(Laughter)

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.330
I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.330
Yes, let's just go work this thing out.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.330
See, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
We get a lot of donated equipment.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.330
or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
so long as we use it and we move on.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.330
He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
So what we going to do now?

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
It looks like all these Americans are here and

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.330
yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything --

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian,

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
I just thought about that.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
We eventually got it working, is the truth,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.330
but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:26.330
it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
Do you figure where that is? It was on a window.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.330
I mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.330
You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them,

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
you email them. But we were still using X-rays,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
but we didn't even have a viewing box!

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
And we were doing open-heart surgery.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
OK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.330
but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo --

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.330
this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.330
VSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
You still get people who believe in it and they came.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:12.330
At 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.330
Her condition, open-heart surgery that as she required,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
would have been treated when she was a child.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.330
We had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
We've done three. We're planning another one in July

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.330
in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.330
but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in --

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.330
we ship everything, instruments. We had explosions

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:45.330
because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.330
But how many did we do the first one? 12.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.330
We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.330
Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.330
and just watch that chair, all right?

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.330
This is what I mean about appropriate technology.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:12.330
That's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
Have you seen one of those before?

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
No? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before:

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.330
"We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long --

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.330
(Applause)

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.330
-- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing."

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
(Applause)

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:37.330
Thank you. Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:42.330
This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.330
So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.330
Let's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
gives them the tools they need to keep going."

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
And that's a perfect example of one.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
you buy a different one for children,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.330
you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
because we make it our duty to find out

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:16.330
what's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.330
does the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine:

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.330
multi-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.330
This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car,

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.330
that charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone?

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
That's exactly how the outlets are designed.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.330
Yes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:43.330
But if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.330
And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
And guess what, if it all fails,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
if you can find a car that's still got a live battery

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:57.330
and you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.330
Is it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want?

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:06.330
Decide which instruments, stock it up with consumables.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:15.330
And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:24.330
The technology for oxygen delivery is not new.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:29.330
Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
and what we will have in a few months, I hope,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
is that ability to use this same renewable energy system

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:41.330
to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite -- it's not new --

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:48.330
zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:53.330
If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.330
These are the basic features of my device, or our device.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
This is what makes it so special.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
Apart from the awards it's won,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.330
it's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA --

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330
and the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.330
of the FDA in the U.S.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.330
If you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.330
size-wise, ease of use, complexity ...

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.330
This picture was taken last year.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.330
These are members of my graduating class, 1986.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.330
for those of you who are familiar with Maryland.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.330
There are too many of us outside and everybody,

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:47.330
just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy --

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.330
if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:57.330
it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.330
that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.330
looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:09.330
African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.330
And lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.330
You have to do it. Africans have to do it,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.330
in conjunction with everyone else.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
Thank you.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.330
(Applause)
