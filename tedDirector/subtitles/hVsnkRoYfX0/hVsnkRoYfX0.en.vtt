00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
The future of life, where the unraveling of our biology --

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
and bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
I'm just going to talk --

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
about where that's likely to carry us.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.160
And you know, I saw all the visions

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
of the first couple of sessions.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
It almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
about the future.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
It felt wrong to do that in some way.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
And yet, I don't really think it is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
because when it comes down to it,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.160
it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain --

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160
what people in the future are going to remember about this period.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
I want to talk to you a little bit about

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.160
why the visions of Jeremy Rivkins,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
who would like to ban these sorts of technologies,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.160
or of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.160
are actually -- to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
I'm focusing on biology,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
the biological sciences.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
The reason I'm doing that is because those are going to be

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.160
the areas that are the most significant to us.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
The reason for that is really very simple.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
It's because we're flesh and blood.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
We're biological creatures.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.160
And what we can do with our biology

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
is going to shape our future

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
and that of our children and that of their children --

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
whether we gain control over aging,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
whether we learn to protect ourselves from Alzheimer's,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
and heart disease, and cancer.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
I think that Shakespeare really put it very nicely.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
And I'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
(Laughter)

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
He said, "And so from hour to hour

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
we ripe and ripe.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
And thereby hangs a tale."

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
Life is short, you know.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And we need to think about planning a little bit.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.160
We're all going to eventually, even in the developed world,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
going to have to lose everything that we love.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
When you're beginning to rot a little bit,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
all of the videos crammed into your head,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.160
all of the extensions that extend your various powers,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.160
are going to being to seem a little secondary.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.160
And you know, I'm getting a little bit gray -- so is Ray Kurzweil,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
so is Eric Drexler.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
This is where it's really central to our lives.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
Now I know there's been a whole lot of hype

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
about our power to control biology.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
You just have to look at the Human Genome Project.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
It wasn't two years ago

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
that everybody was talking about --

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
we've found the Holy Grail of biology.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
We're deciphering the code of codes.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
We're reading the book of life.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
It's a little bit reminiscent of 1969 when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.160
and everybody was about to race out toward the stars.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
And we've all seen "2001: A Space Odyssey."

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.160
You know it's 2003, and there is no HAL.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.160
And there is no odyssey to our own moon, much less the moons of Jupiter.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
And we're still picking up pieces of the Challenger.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.160
So it's not surprising that some people would wonder

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
we'll look back at this instant in time,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
and all of the sort of talk about

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
the Human Genome Project,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
and what all this is going to mean to us --

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.160
well, it will really mean precious little.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.160
And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
and modifying and altering and adjusting these things,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
we're talking about changing ourselves.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
And this is very critical stuff.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.160
If you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
you just have to go to any major city.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
This is not the stomping ground

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
of our Pleistocene ancestors.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
What's happening is we're taking this technology --

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
it's becoming more precise, more potent --

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
and we're turning it back upon ourselves.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
Before it's all done

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
we are going to alter ourselves

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
every bit as much as we have changed the world around us.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
It's going to happen a lot sooner

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
than people imagine.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
On the way there it's going to

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
completely revolutionize medicine and health care; that's obvious.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
It's going to change the way we have children.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
It's going to change the way we manage

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
and alter our emotions.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
It's going to probably change the human lifespan.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
It will really make us question

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.160
what it is to be a human being.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
The larger context of this is that are

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.160
two unprecedented revolutions that are going on today.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
The first of them is the obvious one,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
the silicon revolution,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
which you all are very, very familiar with.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
It's changing our lives in so many ways,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
and it will continue to do that.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
What the essence of that is, is that we're taking

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
the sand at our feet, the inert silicon at our feet,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
and we're breathing a level of complexity into it

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
that rivals that of life itself,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
and may even surpass it.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
As an outgrowth of that, as a child of that revolution,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
is the revolution in biology.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
The genomics revolution,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
proteomics, metabolomics, all of these "omics"

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
that sound so terrific on grants and on business plans.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.160
What we're doing is we are

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
seizing control of our evolutionary future.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
I mean we're essentially using technology

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
to just jam evolution into fast-forward.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
It's not at all clear where it's going to take us.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
But in five to ten years we're going to start see

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
some very profound changes.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
The most immediate changes that we'll see

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
are things like in medicine.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
There is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
as we start to be able to identify

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
all of the risk factors that we have as individuals.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
But who is going to pay for all this?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.160
And how are we going to understand all this complex information?

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
That is going to be the IT challenge

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.160
of the next generation, is communicating all this information.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
There's pharmacogenomics, the combination of pharmacology

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
and genetics:

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.160
that Juan talked about a little bit earlier.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
That's going to have amazing impacts.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
And it's going to be used for diet as well,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
and nutritional supplements and such.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
But it's going to have a big impact because

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
we're going to have niche drugs.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
And we aren't going to be able to support

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.160
The approval process is going to fall apart, actually.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
It's too slow.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
It's too risk-averse.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And it is really not suited for the future

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
that we're moving into.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
Another thing is that we're just going to have to deal with this knowledge.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
It's really wonderful when we hear,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.160
"Oh, 99.9 percent of the letters in the code are the same.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.160
We're all identical to each other. Isn't it wonderful?"

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
And look around you and know

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
that what we really care about is

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
that little bit of difference.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
We look the same to a visitor from another planet, maybe,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
but not to each other

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
because we compete with each other all time.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.160
And we're going to have to come to grips with the fact

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.160
that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.160
and between subpopulations of humans as well.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.160
To deny that that's the case is not a very good start on that.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
A generation or so away

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.160
That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
Now I don't mean extra gills or something --

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
something we care about, like aging.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.160
What if we could unravel aging and understand it --

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
begin to retard the process or even reverse it?

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
It would change absolutely everything.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
And it's obvious to anyone,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
that if we can do this, we absolutely will do this,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
whatever the consequences are.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.160
The second is modifying our emotions.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.160
I mean Ritalin, Viagra,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
things of that sort, Prozac.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
You know, this is just clumsy little baby steps.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
What if you could take a little

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
concoction of pharmaceuticals

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
that would make you feel really contented,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
just happy to be you.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
Are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn't have any overt side effects?

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
Probably not.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
And if you don't, who are you going to be?

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
Why do you do what you do?

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
We're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
It's going to be very challenging to deal with.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.160
The third area is reproduction.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160
The idea that we're going to chose our children's genes,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.160
as we begin to understand what genes say about who we are.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
That's the focus of my book "Redesigning Humans,"

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
where I talk about the kinds of choices we'll make,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
and the challenges it's going to present to society.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
There are three obvious ways of doing this.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
The first is cloning.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
It didn't happen.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
It's a total media circus.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
It will happen in five to 10 years.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
And when it does it's not going to be that big a deal.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
The birth of a delayed identical twin

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.160
is not going to shake western civilization.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160
But there are more important things that are already occurring:

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160
embryo screening.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
You take a six to eight cell embryo,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
you tease out one of the cells, you run a genetic test on that cell,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
and depending on the results of that test

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
you either implant that embryo or you discard it.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
It's already done to avoid rare diseases today.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160
And pretty soon it's going to be possible

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.160
to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
As that becomes possible

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
this is going to move from something that is used by those who

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.160
have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.160
to the wealthy who want to protect their children,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
to just about everybody else.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
And in that process that's going to morph

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
from being just for diseases,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
to being for lesser vulnerabilities,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
like risk of manic depression or something,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
to picking personalities,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
temperaments, traits, these sorts of things.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160
Of course there is going to be genetic engineering.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.160
Directly going in -- it's a little bit further away, but not that far away --

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.160
going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
The way I suspect it will happen

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
is using artificial chromosomes

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
and extra chromosomes, so we go from 46

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
to 47 or 48.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
And one that is not heritable

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
because who would want to pass on to their children

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
the archaic enhancement modules

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
that they got 25 years earlier from their parents?

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
It's a joke; of course they wouldn't want to do that.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
They'll want the new release.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
Those kinds of loose analogies with

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160
(Laughter)

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
computers, and with programming,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
are actually much deeper than that.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
They are really going to come to operate in this realm.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
Now not everything that can be done should be done.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
And it won't be done.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
But when something is feasible in thousands of

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
laboratories all over the world,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
which is going to be the case with these technologies,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160
which is already the case,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
and when they're almost impossible to police,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
it's not a question of if this is going to happen,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
it's when and where and how it's going to happen.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.160
Humanity is going to go down this path.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
And it's going to do so for two reasons.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
The first is that all these technologies

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
are just a spin-off of mainstream medical research

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
that everybody wants to see happen.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
It is being funded very very --

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
in a big way.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
The second is, we're human.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160
That's what we do.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
We try and use our technology to

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
improve our lives in one way or another.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
To imagine that we're not going to use these technologies

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
when they become available,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
is as much a denial of who we are

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
as to imagine

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
that we'll use these technologies and not fret

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160
and worry about it a great deal.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
The lines are going to blur. And they already are

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
between therapy and enhancement,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
between treatment and prevention,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
between need and desire.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
That's really the central one, I believe.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
People can try and ban these things.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
They undoubtedly will. They have.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
But ultimately all this is going to do

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
is just shift development elsewhere.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
It's going to drive these things from view.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
It's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
because they are in the best position

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
to circumvent any of these sorts of laws.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
And it's going to deny us

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160
the information that we need to make wise decisions

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
about how to use these technologies.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
So, sure, we need to debate these things.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.160
And I think it's wonderful that we do.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.160
But we shouldn't kid ourselves

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
and think that we're going to reach a consensus about these things.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.160
That is simply not going to happen.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
They touch us too deeply.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
And they depend too much upon history, upon philosophy,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
upon religion, upon culture, upon politics.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.160
Some people are going to see this

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
as an abomination,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
as the worst thing, as just awful.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
Other people are going to say, "This is great.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.160
This is the flowering of human endeavor."

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
The one thing though that is really dangerous

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.160
about these sorts of technologies,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.160
is that it's easy to become seduced by them.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
And to focus too much on all

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
the high-technology possibilities that exist.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
And to lose touch

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.160
with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160
There are too many people that think that high-technology medicine

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
is going to keep them, save them,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
from overeating,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
from eating a lot of fast foods,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.160
from not getting any exercise.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160
It's not going to happen.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.160
In the midst of all this amazing technology,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
and all these things that are occurring, it's really interesting

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.160
because there is sort of a counter-revolution that is going on:

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.160
a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
in nutraceuticals, in all of these sorts of things

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
that some people, in the pharmaceutical industry particularly,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
like to brand as non-science.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.160
But this whole effort is generated,

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.160
is driven, by IT as well

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.160
because that is how we're gathering all this information,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
and linking it, and integrating it together.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.160
There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
And that's where about half of our drugs come.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160
So we shouldn't dismiss this

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160
because it's an enormous opportunity to use

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.160
these sorts of results,

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
or these random loose trials from the last thousand years

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
about what has impacts on our health.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
And to use our advanced technologies

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
to pull out what is beneficial from this

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
sea of noise, basically.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
In fact this isn't just abstract.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
I just formed a biotechnology company

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
that is using

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
this sort of an approach to develop

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.160
therapeutics for Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
and we're making some real progress.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
So here we are.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.160
It's the beginning of a new millennium.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
If you look forward,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
I mean future humans,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.160
far before the end of this millennium,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
in a few hundred years, they are going to look back at this moment.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.160
And from the beginning of today's sessions

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.160
you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.160
difficult, painful period

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
that we struggled through.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.160
And I don't think that's what's going to happen.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.160
They're going to do like everybody does. They are going to forget about all that stuff.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
They are going to think about it

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
as this glorious instant

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
when we laid down

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
the very foundations of their lives,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
of their society, of their future.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.160
You know it's a little bit like a birth.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160
Where there is this bloody, awful mess happens.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.160
And then what comes out of it? New life.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
Actually as was pointed out earlier,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.160
So to me,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160
it's clear that one of the foundations of that future

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.160
is going to be the reworking of our biology.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
It's going to come gradually at first. It's going to pick up speed.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
We're going to make lots of errors.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
That's the way these things work.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.160
To me it's an incredible privilege

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.160
to be alive now

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.160
and to be able to witness this thing.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.160
It is something that is a unique instant

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.160
in the history of all of life.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.160
It will always be remembered.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
And what's extraordinary is that

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.160
we're not just observing this,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160
we are the architects of this.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160
I think that we should be proud of it.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.160
What is so difficult and challenging

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
is that we are also the objects of these changes.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
It's our health, it's our lives, it's our future, it's our children.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.160
And that is why they are so very troubling to so many people

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
who would pull back in fear.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.160
I think that our choice

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160
in the choice of life,

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.160
is not whether we're going to go down this path.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.160
We are, definitely.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.160
It's how we hold it in our hearts.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
It's how we look at it.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.160
I think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.160
in 430 B.C. He put it nicely.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160
Again, I'll use the words in the same order he did.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.160
"The bravest are surely those

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.160
who have the clearest vision of what is before them,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.160
both glory and danger alike.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.160
And yet notwithstanding, they go out and they meet it."

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.160
Thank you.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.160
(Applause)
