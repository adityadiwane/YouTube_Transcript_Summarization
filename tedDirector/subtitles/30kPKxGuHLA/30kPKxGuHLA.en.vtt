00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
In 2007,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I decided that we needed to reconceptualize

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
how we thought about economic development.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Our new goal should be

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
they should be able to choose between

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
at least a handful

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
of different cities

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
that were all competing to attract new residents.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
There are billions of people in developing countries

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
But the amazing thing about cities

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
is they're worth so much more

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
than it costs to build them.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
So we could easily supply the world

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
with dozens, maybe hundreds,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
of new cities.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Now this might sound preposterous to you

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
if you've never thought about new cities.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
But just substitute apartment building for cities.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
the other half aren't there yet.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
You could try and expand the capacity

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
by doing additions on all the existing apartments.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
But you know what you'd run into

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
is those apartments and the surrounding areas

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
have rules to avoid discomfort

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and the distractions of construction.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
But you could go out someplace brand new,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
build a brand new apartment building,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
as long as the rules there

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
were ones that facilitated construction

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
rather than getting in the way.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
So I proposed

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
that governments create new reform zones

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
big enough to hold cities

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and gave them a name: charter cities.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Later I learned that at about this same time,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Javier and Octavio

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
were thinking about the challenge of reform

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
in Honduras.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
would leave to go to the United States,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and they wanted to ask, what could they do

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
to make sure that those people could stay

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and do the same things in Honduras.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
At one point, Javier said to Octavio,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
"What if we took some of our empty land --

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
what if we just gave it to an embassy --

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy --

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
and then if people want to go work

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
they can go get jobs,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
do everything they do on those embassy grounds

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.260
that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?"

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
In the summer of 2009,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
At the next regularly scheduled election,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Pepe Lobo won in a landslide

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
on a platform that promised reform,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
but reconciliation as well.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Meanwhile, I was getting ready

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
to give a talk at TEDGlobal.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Through a process of refinement,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
trial and error, a lot of user testing,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
down to the bare essentials.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
The first point was the importance of rules,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
like those rules that say

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
but it takes technologies and rules to get progress,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and it's usually the rules that hold us back.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
He showed it to Javier.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
They called me.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country."

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
So in December we met in Miami,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
in a hotel conference room.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
I tried to explain this point

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
about how valuable cities are,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
how much more valuable they are than they cost.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And I used this slide

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
showing how valuable the raw land is

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
in a place like New York City:

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
per square meter.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
But it was a fairly abstract discussion,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and at some point when there was a pause,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Octavio said,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
"Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk."

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
(Laughing)

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
a charter city is a place

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
where you start with uninhabited land,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
and then a chance for people to opt in,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
to go live under those rules or not.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
So I was asked by the president of Honduras

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
who said that we need to do this project,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
this is important,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
this could be the way forward for our country.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and talk again on January fourth and fifth.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So I presented

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
another fact-filled lecture

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
that included a slide like this,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
it has to be very big.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
This is a picture of Denver,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
This airport alone

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
covers more than 100 square kilometers.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
if you build a new city,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.260
That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Everybody applauded politely.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
The faces in the audience

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
were very serious and attentive.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
"Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
I've got it here on my laptop."

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
And it got to the essence,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
which could be in Honduras,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And it also involved new choices for leaders.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
would need help from partner countries,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
who could benefit from partner countries

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
so everybody can trust

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
that the charter really will be enforced.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
And the insight of President Lobo

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
was that that assurance of enforcement

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
that I was thinking about

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
who had suffered for so many years

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
from fear and distrust.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
We went and looked at a site.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
This picture's from there.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And shortly thereafter, on January 19th,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
they voted in the congress to amend their constitution

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
to have a constitutional provision

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
that allows for special development regions.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
was 124 to one.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
All parties, all factions in society, backed this.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
On February 17th they passed it again

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
with another vote of 114 to one.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Immediately after that vote,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
on February 21st to the 24th,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
a delegation of about 30 Hondurans

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
went to the two places in the world

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
that are most interested in getting into the city building business.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
One is South Korea.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
This is a picture of a big, new city center

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
that's being built in South Korea --

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
bigger than downtown Boston.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
Everything you see there was built in four years,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
after they spent four years getting the permits.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
They've actually built two cities already in China

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
and are preparing the third.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
So if you think about this practically,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
here's where we are.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
They're putting in place a legal system

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
that could allow for managers to come in,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
and also an external legal system.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
There's designers and builders of cities

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
who are very interested.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
They even can bring with them some financing.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
But the one thing you know they've already solved

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
is that there's lots of tenants.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
especially in a place with a free trade zone,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Around the world, there's 700 million people

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
There's a million a year

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
who leave Latin America to go to the United States.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
Many of these are a father

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
who has to leave his family behind to go get a job --

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
sometimes a single mother

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Sadly, sometimes there are even children

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
who are trying to get reunited with their parents

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.260
that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
So what kind of an idea is it

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
to think about building a brand new city in Honduras?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
Or to build a dozen of these,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
or a hundred of these, around the world?

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
What kind of an idea is it

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
to think about insisting

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
that every family have a choice of several cities

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
that are competing to attract new residents?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
This is an idea worth spreading.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
And my friends from Honduras

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
asked me to say thank you, TED.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:07.260
(Applause)
