Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:20.259
I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are,

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.767
how globalized we aren't,

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:26.311
and why it's important to actually be accurate

00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:29.092
in making those kinds of assessments.

00:00:29.092 --> 00:00:32.832
And the leading point of view on this, whether measured

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:37.023
by number of books sold, mentions in media,

00:00:37.023 --> 00:00:40.239
or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.316
my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization,

00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:47.430
is this view that national borders

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.983
really don't matter very much anymore,

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:55.039
cross-border integration is close to complete,

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.334
and we live in one world.

00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:59.566
And what's interesting about this view

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:03.160
is, again, it's a view that's held by pro-globalizers

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.934
like Tom Friedman, from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted,

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:11.860
but it's also held by anti-globalizers, who see this giant

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.751
globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives

00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:19.635
if it hasn't already done so.

00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:23.659
The other thing I would add is that this is not a new view.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.370
I'm a little bit of an amateur historian, so I've spent

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.351
some time going back, trying to see the first mention

00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:35.070
of this kind of thing. And the best, earliest quote

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.914
that I could find was one from David Livingstone,

00:01:38.914 --> 00:01:44.959
writing in the 1850s about how the railroad, the steam ship,

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.426
and the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly

00:01:49.426 --> 00:01:52.797
with the rest of the world.

00:01:52.797 --> 00:01:54.977
Now clearly, David Livingstone

00:01:54.977 --> 00:01:57.997
was a little bit ahead of his time,

00:01:57.997 --> 00:02:01.540
but it does seem useful to ask ourselves,

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.636
"Just how global are we?"

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:06.339
before we think about where we go from here.

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:10.877
So the best way I've found of trying to get people

00:02:10.877 --> 00:02:15.526
to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat,

00:02:15.526 --> 00:02:19.541
may not even be close to flat, is with some data.

00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:22.920
So one of the things I've been doing over the last few years

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.887
is really compiling data on things that could either happen

00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:31.042
within national borders or across national borders,

00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:34.545
and I've looked at the cross-border component

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:36.958
as a percentage of the total.

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.923
I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today,

00:02:40.923 --> 00:02:44.529
but let me just give you a few data points.

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:48.863
I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow,

00:02:48.863 --> 00:02:53.731
one kind of flow of people, one kind of flow of capital,

00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:57.212
and, of course, trade in products and services.

00:02:57.212 --> 00:03:01.791
So let's start off with plain old telephone service.

00:03:01.791 --> 00:03:06.884
Of all the voice-calling minutes in the world last year,

00:03:06.884 --> 00:03:11.532
what percentage do you think were accounted for

00:03:11.532 --> 00:03:13.857
by cross-border phone calls?

00:03:13.857 --> 00:03:17.933
Pick a percentage in your own mind.

00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:21.028
The answer turns out to be two percent.

00:03:21.028 --> 00:03:25.166
If you include Internet telephony, you might be able

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:28.593
to push this number up to six or seven percent,

00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:33.250
but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.995
Or let's turn to people moving across borders.

00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:40.212
One particular thing we might look at, in terms of

00:03:40.212 --> 00:03:43.939
long-term flows of people, is what percentage

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:47.451
of the world's population is accounted for

00:03:47.451 --> 00:03:50.459
by first-generation immigrants?

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.754
Again, please pick a percentage.

00:03:54.754 --> 00:03:57.179
Turns out to be a little bit higher.

00:03:57.179 --> 00:04:00.246
It's actually about three percent.

00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:05.117
Or think of investment. Take all the real investment

00:04:05.117 --> 00:04:08.285
that went on in the world in 2010.

00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:11.141
What percentage of that was accounted for

00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:15.078
by foreign direct investment?

00:04:15.078 --> 00:04:18.445
Not quite ten percent.

00:04:18.445 --> 00:04:21.084
And then finally, the one statistic

00:04:21.084 --> 00:04:24.261
that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen:

00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:26.989
the export-to-GDP ratio.

00:04:26.989 --> 00:04:30.758
If you look at the official statistics, they typically indicate

00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:33.317
a little bit above 30 percent.

00:04:33.317 --> 00:04:38.406
However, there's a big problem with the official statistics,

00:04:38.406 --> 00:04:43.337
in that if, for instance, a Japanese component supplier

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:46.949
ships something to China to be put into an iPod,

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.750
and then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S.,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.587
that component ends up getting counted multiple times.

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:56.356
So nobody knows how bad this bias

00:04:56.356 --> 00:05:00.143
with the official statistics actually is, so I thought I would

00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:02.727
ask the person who's spearheading the effort

00:05:02.727 --> 00:05:05.992
to generate data on this, Pascal Lamy,

00:05:05.992 --> 00:05:08.504
the Director of the World Trade Organization,

00:05:08.504 --> 00:05:10.831
what his best guess would be

00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:14.006
of exports as a percentage of GDP,

00:05:14.006 --> 00:05:16.429
without the double- and triple-counting,

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:20.963
and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent, rather than

00:05:20.963 --> 00:05:24.732
the 30 percent-plus numbers that we're talking about.

00:05:24.732 --> 00:05:28.915
So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers

00:05:28.915 --> 00:05:32.483
or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book,

00:05:32.483 --> 00:05:36.870
"World 3.0," that we're very, very far from

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.924
the no-border effect benchmark, which would imply

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:47.827
internationalization levels of the order of 85, 90, 95 percent.

00:05:47.827 --> 00:05:51.435
So clearly, apocalyptically-minded authors

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:54.395
have overstated the case.

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:58.587
But it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them,

00:05:58.587 --> 00:06:01.812
who are prone to this kind of overstatement.

00:06:01.812 --> 00:06:05.209
I've also spent some time surveying audiences

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:07.207
in different parts of the world

00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:11.267
on what they actually guess these numbers to be.

00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:14.336
Let me share with you the results of a survey

00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:17.675
that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run

00:06:17.675 --> 00:06:21.195
of its readership as to what people's guesses

00:06:21.195 --> 00:06:25.610
along these dimensions actually were.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.545
So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide.

00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:36.460
First of all, there is a suggestion of some error.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.263
Okay. (Laughter)

00:06:39.263 --> 00:06:44.736
Second, these are pretty large errors. For four quantities

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:47.715
whose average value is less than 10 percent,

00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:51.817
you have people guessing three, four times that level.

00:06:51.817 --> 00:06:54.905
Even though I'm an economist, I find that

00:06:54.905 --> 00:06:57.309
a pretty large error.

00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:01.171
And third, this is not just confined to the readers

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:03.131
of the Harvard Business Review.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:06.529
I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:09.879
of the world, and in all cases except one,

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:12.751
where a group actually underestimated

00:07:12.751 --> 00:07:17.063
the trade-to-GDP ratio, people have this tendency

00:07:17.063 --> 00:07:20.222
towards overestimation, and so I thought it important

00:07:20.222 --> 00:07:23.527
to give a name to this, and that's what I refer to

00:07:23.527 --> 00:07:28.104
as globaloney, the difference between the dark blue bars

00:07:28.104 --> 00:07:31.111
and the light gray bars.

00:07:31.111 --> 00:07:35.247
Especially because, I suspect, some of you may still be

00:07:35.247 --> 00:07:39.439
a little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:42.703
to just spend a little bit of time thinking about

00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:46.462
why we might be prone to globaloney.

00:07:46.462 --> 00:07:49.305
A couple of different reasons come to mind.

00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:53.607
First of all, there's a real dearth of data in the debate.

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:56.788
Let me give you an example. When I first published

00:07:56.788 --> 00:07:59.384
some of these data a few years ago

00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:01.921
in a magazine called Foreign Policy,

00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:05.491
one of the people who wrote in, not entirely in agreement,

00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:09.446
was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled

00:08:09.446 --> 00:08:14.356
"Why the World Isn't Flat," that wasn't too surprising. (Laughter)

00:08:14.356 --> 00:08:18.637
What was very surprising to me was Tom's critique,

00:08:18.637 --> 00:08:23.575
which was, "Ghemawat's data are narrow."

00:08:23.575 --> 00:08:26.594
And this caused me to scratch my head, because

00:08:26.594 --> 00:08:29.731
as I went back through his several-hundred-page book,

00:08:29.731 --> 00:08:34.364
I couldn't find a single figure, chart, table,

00:08:34.364 --> 00:08:37.092
reference or footnote.

00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:41.699
So my point is, I haven't presented a lot of data here

00:08:41.699 --> 00:08:45.091
to convince you that I'm right, but I would urge you

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:48.076
to go away and look for your own data

00:08:48.076 --> 00:08:51.564
to try and actually assess whether some of these

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:55.925
hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with

00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:57.837
actually are correct.

00:08:57.837 --> 00:09:01.369
So dearth of data in the debate is one reason.

00:09:01.369 --> 00:09:05.284
A second reason has to do with peer pressure.

00:09:05.284 --> 00:09:08.465
I remember, I decided to write my

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:11.090
"Why the World Isn't Flat" article, because

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.279
I was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai,

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:17.954
and the interviewer's first question to me was,

00:09:17.954 --> 00:09:21.905
"Professor Ghemawat, why do you still believe

00:09:21.905 --> 00:09:26.085
that the world is round?" And I started laughing,

00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:29.858
because I hadn't come across that formulation before. (Laughter)

00:09:29.858 --> 00:09:32.197
And as I was laughing, I was thinking,

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:35.084
I really need a more coherent response, especially

00:09:35.084 --> 00:09:39.194
on national TV. I'd better write something about this. (Laughter)

00:09:39.194 --> 00:09:42.163
But what I can't quite capture for you

00:09:42.163 --> 00:09:44.763
was the pity and disbelief

00:09:44.763 --> 00:09:48.241
with which the interviewer asked her question.

00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:52.581
The perspective was, here is this poor professor.

00:09:52.581 --> 00:09:57.267
He's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years.

00:09:57.267 --> 00:09:59.915
He really has no idea

00:09:59.915 --> 00:10:02.873
as to what's actually going on in the world.

00:10:02.873 --> 00:10:06.346
So try this out with your friends and acquaintances,

00:10:06.346 --> 00:10:09.787
if you like. You'll find that it's very cool

00:10:09.787 --> 00:10:13.075
to talk about the world being one, etc.

00:10:13.075 --> 00:10:16.378
If you raise questions about that formulation,

00:10:16.378 --> 00:10:20.275
you really are considered a bit of an antique.

00:10:20.275 --> 00:10:23.729
And then the final reason, which I mention,

00:10:23.729 --> 00:10:27.442
especially to a TED audience, with some trepidation,

00:10:27.442 --> 00:10:30.787
has to do with what I call "techno-trances."

00:10:30.787 --> 00:10:34.314
If you listen to techno music for long periods of time,

00:10:34.314 --> 00:10:37.666
it does things to your brainwave activity. (Laughter)

00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:41.124
Something similar seems to happen

00:10:41.124 --> 00:10:46.434
with exaggerated conceptions of how technology

00:10:46.434 --> 00:10:50.603
is going to overpower in the very immediate run

00:10:50.603 --> 00:10:53.936
all cultural barriers, all political barriers,

00:10:53.936 --> 00:10:57.529
all geographic barriers, because at this point

00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:00.113
I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions,

00:11:00.113 --> 00:11:03.086
but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students,

00:11:03.086 --> 00:11:05.850
hands go up, and people ask me,

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.329
"Yeah, but what about Facebook?"

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:11.942
And I got this question often enough that I thought

00:11:11.942 --> 00:11:14.690
I'd better do some research on Facebook.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.410
Because, in some sense, it's the ideal kind of technology

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.079
to think about. Theoretically, it makes it

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:25.457
as easy to form friendships halfway around the world

00:11:25.457 --> 00:11:28.459
as opposed to right next door.

00:11:28.459 --> 00:11:34.545
What percentage of people's friends on Facebook

00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:37.665
are actually located in countries other than where

00:11:37.665 --> 00:11:40.938
people we're analyzing are based?

00:11:40.938 --> 00:11:44.288
The answer is probably somewhere between

00:11:44.288 --> 00:11:47.161
10 to 15 percent.

00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:50.972
Non-negligible, so we don't live in an entirely local

00:11:50.972 --> 00:11:55.979
or national world, but very, very far from the 95 percent level

00:11:55.979 --> 00:11:59.385
that you would expect, and the reason's very simple.

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:03.377
We don't, or I hope we don't, form friendships at random

00:12:03.377 --> 00:12:08.199
on Facebook. The technology is overlaid

00:12:08.199 --> 00:12:12.934
on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have,

00:12:12.934 --> 00:12:16.002
and those relationships are what the technology

00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:19.233
doesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why

00:12:19.233 --> 00:12:23.277
we get far fewer than 95 percent of our friends

00:12:23.277 --> 00:12:27.085
being located in countries other than where we are.

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:32.566
So does all this matter? Or is globaloney

00:12:32.566 --> 00:12:37.978
just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention

00:12:37.978 --> 00:12:40.690
to globalization-related issues?

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.897
I want to suggest that actually,

00:12:42.897 --> 00:12:47.467
globaloney can be very harmful to your health.

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:50.619
First of all, recognizing that the glass

00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:55.075
is only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing

00:12:55.075 --> 00:12:58.459
that there might be potential for additional gains

00:12:58.459 --> 00:13:00.490
from additional integration,

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.334
whereas if we thought we were already there,

00:13:03.334 --> 00:13:06.758
there would be no particular point to pushing harder.

00:13:06.758 --> 00:13:09.970
It's a little bit like, we wouldn't be having a conference

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.151
on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open

00:13:14.151 --> 00:13:17.483
to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about

00:13:17.483 --> 00:13:18.898
at this conference.

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:23.688
So being accurate about how limited globalization levels are

00:13:23.688 --> 00:13:26.747
is critical to even being able to notice

00:13:26.747 --> 00:13:30.426
that there might be room for something more,

00:13:30.426 --> 00:13:34.394
something that would contribute further to global welfare.

00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:37.226
Which brings me to my second point.

00:13:37.226 --> 00:13:41.449
Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful

00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:46.244
because it reduces and in some cases even reverses

00:13:46.244 --> 00:13:51.049
some of the fears that people have about globalization.

00:13:51.049 --> 00:13:54.434
So I actually spend most of my "World 3.0" book

00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:58.978
working through a litany of market failures and fears

00:13:58.978 --> 00:14:04.118
that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate.

00:14:04.118 --> 00:14:07.786
I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today,

00:14:07.786 --> 00:14:11.054
so let me just present to you two headlines

00:14:11.054 --> 00:14:14.335
as an illustration of what I have in mind.

00:14:14.335 --> 00:14:18.651
Think of France and the current debate about immigration.

00:14:18.651 --> 00:14:21.883
When you ask people in France what percentage

00:14:21.883 --> 00:14:24.096
of the French population is immigrants,

00:14:24.096 --> 00:14:28.596
the answer is about 24 percent. That's their guess.

00:14:28.596 --> 00:14:33.226
Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent

00:14:33.226 --> 00:14:37.640
might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.978
that we see around the immigration issue.

00:14:40.978 --> 00:14:45.122
Or to take an even more striking example,

00:14:45.122 --> 00:14:47.299
when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations

00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:50.646
did a survey of Americans, asking them to guess

00:14:50.646 --> 00:14:54.873
what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid,

00:14:54.873 --> 00:14:58.554
the guess was 30 percent, which is

00:14:58.554 --> 00:15:03.914
slightly in excess of the actual level — ("actually about ... 1%") (Laughter) —

00:15:03.914 --> 00:15:07.288
of U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid.

00:15:07.288 --> 00:15:10.695
The reassuring thing about this particular survey was,

00:15:10.695 --> 00:15:13.376
when it was pointed out to people how far

00:15:13.376 --> 00:15:16.585
their estimates were from the actual data,

00:15:16.585 --> 00:15:19.680
some of them — not all of them — seemed to become

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.667
more willing to consider increases in foreign aid.

00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:26.791
So foreign aid is actually a great way

00:15:26.791 --> 00:15:29.985
of sort of wrapping up here, because

00:15:29.985 --> 00:15:33.073
if you think about it, what I've been talking about today

00:15:33.073 --> 00:15:37.162
is this notion -- very uncontroversial amongst economists --

00:15:37.162 --> 00:15:40.144
that most things are very home-biased.

00:15:40.144 --> 00:15:43.369
"Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people,"

00:15:43.369 --> 00:15:47.092
is about the most home-biased thing you can find.

00:15:47.092 --> 00:15:50.130
If you look at the OECD countries and how much

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.272
they spend per domestic poor person,

00:15:53.272 --> 00:15:55.524
and compare it with how much they spend

00:15:55.524 --> 00:15:59.696
per poor person in poor countries,

00:15:59.696 --> 00:16:03.968
the ratio — Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations —

00:16:03.968 --> 00:16:08.644
turns out to be about 30,000 to one.

00:16:08.644 --> 00:16:14.840
Now of course, some of us, if we truly are cosmopolitan,

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.009
would like to see that ratio being brought down

00:16:18.009 --> 00:16:20.241
to one-is-to-one.

00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:23.632
I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim

00:16:23.632 --> 00:16:27.793
for that to make substantial progress from where we are.

00:16:27.793 --> 00:16:32.860
If we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one,

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.230
we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.747
at the Rio Summit 20 years ago that the summit

00:16:39.747 --> 00:16:43.609
that ended last week made no further progress on.

00:16:43.609 --> 00:16:47.414
So in summary, while radical openness is great,

00:16:47.414 --> 00:16:49.427
given how closed we are,

00:16:49.427 --> 00:16:52.401
even incremental openness could make things

00:16:52.401 --> 00:16:56.032
dramatically better. Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:16:56.032 --> 00:16:58.803
