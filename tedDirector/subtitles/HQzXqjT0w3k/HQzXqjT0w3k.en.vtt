00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:18.966
On June 12, 2014, precisely at 3:33

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:23.106
in a balmy winter afternoon
in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil,

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.632
a typical South American winter afternoon,

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:29.612
this kid, this young man 
that you see celebrating here

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.131
like he had scored a goal,

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:37.062
Juliano Pinto, 29 years old,
accomplished a magnificent deed.

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:40.182
Despite being paralyzed

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:45.163
and not having any sensation
from mid-chest to the tip of his toes

00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:49.693
as the result of a car crash six years ago
that killed his brother

00:00:49.693 --> 00:00:57.187
and produced a complete spinal cord lesion
that left Juliano in a wheelchair,

00:00:57.187 --> 00:01:02.217
Juliano rose to the occasion,
and on this day did something

00:01:02.217 --> 00:01:08.222
that pretty much everybody that saw him 
in the six years deemed impossible.

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:14.394
Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick

00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:20.410
of the 2014 Brazilian 
World Soccer Cup here

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.880
just by thinking.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.697
He could not move his body,

00:01:24.697 --> 00:01:29.584
but he could imagine the movements
needed to kick a ball.

00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:32.838
He was an athlete before the lesion.
He's a para-athlete right now.

00:01:32.838 --> 00:01:36.300
He's going to be in the Paralympic Games,
I hope, in a couple years.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.882
But what the spinal cord lesion 
did not rob from Juliano

00:01:40.882 --> 00:01:43.883
was his ability to dream.

00:01:43.883 --> 00:01:49.933
And dream he did that afternoon,
for a stadium of about 75,000 people

00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:54.424
and an audience of close to a billion
watching on TV.

00:01:54.424 --> 00:02:00.725
And that kick crowned, basically,
30 years of basic research

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:02.972
studying how the brain,

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:06.699
how this amazing universe
that we have between our ears

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:10.795
that is only comparable to universe
that we have above our head

00:02:10.795 --> 00:02:13.561
because it has about 100 billion elements

00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:16.263
talking to each other
through electrical brainstorms,

00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:21.504
what Juliano accomplished
took 30 years to imagine in laboratories

00:02:21.504 --> 00:02:24.107
and about 15 years to plan.

00:02:24.107 --> 00:02:28.606
When John Chapin and I,
15 years ago, proposed in a paper

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:33.788
that we would build something
that we called a brain-machine interface,

00:02:33.788 --> 00:02:36.745
meaning connecting a brain to devices

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:40.289
so that animals and humans
could just move these devices,

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:42.140
no matter how far they are
from their own bodies,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.726
just by imagining what they want to do,

00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:49.313
our colleagues told us that
we actually needed professional help,

00:02:49.313 --> 00:02:52.010
of the psychiatry variety.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.452
And despite that,
a Scot and a Brazilian persevered,

00:02:57.456 --> 00:03:02.471
because that's how we were raised
in our respective countries,

00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.607
and for 12, 15 years,

00:03:04.607 --> 00:03:08.996
we made demonstration after demonstration
suggesting that this was possible.

00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:11.445
And a brain-machine interface
is not rocket science,

00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:13.171
it's just brain research.

00:03:13.171 --> 00:03:16.418
It's nothing but using sensors

00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:19.965
to read the electrical brainstorms
that a brain is producing

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:21.971
to generate the motor commands

00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:24.184
that have to be downloaded
to the spinal cord,

00:03:24.184 --> 00:03:26.847
so we projected sensors that can read

00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:30.362
hundreds and now thousands
of these brain cells simultaneously,

00:03:30.362 --> 00:03:33.408
and extract from these electrical signals

00:03:33.408 --> 00:03:36.293
the motor planning
that the brain is generating

00:03:36.293 --> 00:03:39.256
to actually make us move into space.

00:03:39.256 --> 00:03:42.942
And by doing that, we converted
these signals into digital commands

00:03:42.942 --> 00:03:47.934
that any mechanical, electronic,
or even a virtual device can understand

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:54.490
so that the subject can imagine
what he, she or it wants to make move,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.941
and the device obeys that brain command.

00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:01.845
By sensorizing these devices
with lots of different types of sensors,

00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:03.630
as you are going to see in a moment,

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.099
we actually sent messages
back to the brain to confirm

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.054
that that voluntary motor will
was being enacted, no matter where --

00:04:11.054 --> 00:04:16.429
next to the subject, next door,
or across the planet.

00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:19.670
And as this message gave feedback
back to the brain,

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.888
the brain realized its goal:
to make us move.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:27.346
So this is just one experiment
that we published a few years ago,

00:04:27.346 --> 00:04:29.673
where a monkey, without moving its body,

00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:33.777
learned to control the movements
of an avatar arm,

00:04:33.777 --> 00:04:35.823
a virtual arm that doesn't exist.

00:04:35.823 --> 00:04:39.025
What you're listening to
is the sound of the brain of this monkey

00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:43.429
as it explores three different
visually identical spheres

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:45.088
in virtual space.

00:04:45.088 --> 00:04:49.130
And to get a reward,
a drop of orange juice that monkeys love,

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.942
this animal has to detect,
select one of these objects

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:54.703
by touching,

00:04:54.703 --> 00:04:56.355
not by seeing it, by touching it,

00:04:56.355 --> 00:04:59.400
because every time this virtual hand
touches one of the objects,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.483
an electrical pulse goes back
to the brain of the animal

00:05:02.483 --> 00:05:06.876
describing the fine texture
of the surface of this object,

00:05:06.876 --> 00:05:10.774
so the animal can judge what is 
the correct object that he has to grab,

00:05:10.774 --> 00:05:16.018
and if he does that, he gets a reward
without moving a muscle.

00:05:16.018 --> 00:05:18.498
The perfect Brazilian lunch:

00:05:18.498 --> 00:05:22.213
not moving a muscle
and getting your orange juice.

00:05:22.213 --> 00:05:25.017
So as we saw this happening,

00:05:25.017 --> 00:05:29.962
we actually came and proposed the idea
that we had published 15 years ago.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.991
We reenacted this paper.

00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.960
We got it out of the drawers,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.887
and we proposed that perhaps we could get
a human being that is paralyzed

00:05:37.887 --> 00:05:42.190
to actually use the brain-machine
interface to regain mobility.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.368
The idea was that if you suffered --

00:05:44.368 --> 00:05:46.641
and that can happen to any one of us.

00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:48.653
Let me tell you, it's very sudden.

00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:50.378
It's a millisecond of a collision,

00:05:50.378 --> 00:05:53.840
a car accident that
transforms your life completely.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.697
If you have a complete lesion
of the spinal cord,

00:05:56.697 --> 00:06:00.080
you cannot move because your brainstorms
cannot reach your muscles.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.330
However, your brainstorms
continue to be generated in your head.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.245
Paraplegic, quadriplegic patients
dream about moving every night.

00:06:08.245 --> 00:06:10.397
They have that inside their head.

00:06:10.397 --> 00:06:13.738
The problem is how
to get that code out of it

00:06:13.738 --> 00:06:16.662
and make the movement be created again.

00:06:16.662 --> 00:06:19.883
So what we proposed was,
let's create a new body.

00:06:19.883 --> 00:06:21.619
Let's create a robotic vest.

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:26.462
And that's exactly why Juliano could
kick that ball just by thinking,

00:06:26.462 --> 00:06:30.781
because he was wearing
the first brain-controlled robotic vest

00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:34.060
that can be used by paraplegic,
quadriplegic patients to move

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.871
and to regain feedback.

00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:38.768
That was the original idea, 15 years ago.

00:06:38.768 --> 00:06:44.242
What I'm going to show you is how
156 people from 25 countries

00:06:44.242 --> 00:06:47.011
all over the five continents
of this beautiful Earth,

00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:50.029
dropped their lives,
dropped their patents,

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:54.139
dropped their dogs, wives,
kids, school, jobs,

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:59.656
and congregated to come to Brazil
for 18 months to actually get this done.

00:06:59.656 --> 00:07:03.531
Because a couple years after Brazil
was awarded the World Cup,

00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:07.183
we heard that the Brazilian government
wanted to do something meaningful

00:07:07.183 --> 00:07:08.881
in the opening ceremony

00:07:08.881 --> 00:07:12.621
in the country that reinvented
and perfected soccer

00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:14.827
until we met the Germans, of course.

00:07:14.827 --> 00:07:16.220
(Laughter)

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.055
But that's a different talk,

00:07:18.055 --> 00:07:22.095
and a different neuroscientist
needs to talk about that.

00:07:22.095 --> 00:07:24.169
But what Brazil wanted to do
is to showcase

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:25.894
a completely different country,

00:07:25.894 --> 00:07:28.782
a country that values science
and technology,

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:32.665
and can give a gift to millions,
25 million people around the world

00:07:32.665 --> 00:07:35.500
that cannot move any longer
because of a spinal cord injury.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.104
Well, we went to the Brazilian government
and to FIFA and proposed,

00:07:39.104 --> 00:07:42.472
well, let's have the kickoff
of the 2014 World Cup

00:07:42.472 --> 00:07:44.844
be given by a Brazilian paraplegic

00:07:44.844 --> 00:07:49.734
using a brain-controlled exoskeleton
that allows him to kick the ball

00:07:49.734 --> 00:07:52.010
and to feel the contact of the ball.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.624
They looked at us,
thought that we were completely nuts,

00:07:54.624 --> 00:07:57.480
and said, "Okay, let's try."

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.720
We had 18 months to do everything
from zero, from scratch.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.956
We had no exoskeleton, we had no patients,

00:08:04.956 --> 00:08:06.173
we had nothing done.

00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:08.509
These people came all together

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:12.757
and in 18 months, we got eight patients
in a routine of training

00:08:12.757 --> 00:08:16.855
and basically built from nothing this guy,

00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:20.435
that we call Bra-Santos Dumont 1.

00:08:21.315 --> 00:08:24.740
The first brain-controlled
exoskeleton to be built

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.896
was named after the most famous
Brazilian scientist ever,

00:08:28.896 --> 00:08:30.869
Alberto Santos Dumont,

00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:36.672
who, on October 19, 1901,
created and flew himself

00:08:36.672 --> 00:08:43.899
the first controlled airship on air
in Paris for a million people to see.

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:45.918
Sorry, my American friends,

00:08:45.918 --> 00:08:47.228
I live in North Carolina,

00:08:47.228 --> 00:08:52.110
but it was two years
before the Wright Brothers flew

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.274
on the coast of North Carolina.

00:08:54.274 --> 00:08:56.849
(Applause)

00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:02.117
Flight control is Brazilian.
(Laughter)

00:09:02.117 --> 00:09:05.117
So we went together with these guys

00:09:05.117 --> 00:09:08.018
and we basically put
this exoskeleton together,

00:09:08.018 --> 00:09:11.990
15 degrees of freedom,
hydraulic machine

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.707
that can be commanded by brain signals

00:09:14.707 --> 00:09:18.925
recorded by a non-invasive technology
called electroencephalography

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:22.114
that can basically allow the patient
to imagine the movements

00:09:22.114 --> 00:09:26.065
and send his commands
to the controls, the motors,

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.867
and get it done.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:30.730
This exoskeleton was covered
with an artificial skin

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.814
invented by Gordon Cheng,
one of my greatest friends, in Munich,

00:09:34.814 --> 00:09:39.400
to allow sensation from the joints moving
and the foot touching the ground

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.940
to be delivered back to the patient
through a vest, a shirt.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.910
It is a smart shirt
with micro-vibrating elements

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.733
that basically delivers the feedback
and fools the patient's brain

00:09:51.733 --> 00:09:55.204
by creating a sensation that it is not
a machine that is carrying him,

00:09:55.204 --> 00:09:58.454
but it is he who is walking again.

00:09:58.454 --> 00:10:01.313
So we got this going,
and what you'll see here

00:10:01.313 --> 00:10:06.003
is the first time one of our patients,
Bruno, actually walked.

00:10:06.003 --> 00:10:08.881
And he takes a few seconds
because we are setting everything,

00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:12.178
and you are going to see a blue light
cutting in front of the helmet

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:16.098
because Bruno is going to imagine
the movement that needs to be performed,

00:10:16.098 --> 00:10:19.306
the computer is going to analyze it,
Bruno is going to certify it,

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:21.115
and when it is certified,

00:10:21.115 --> 00:10:24.642
the device starts moving
under the command of Bruno's brain.

00:10:24.642 --> 00:10:29.217
And he just got it right,
and now he starts walking.

00:10:29.217 --> 00:10:32.003
After nine years without
being able to move,

00:10:32.003 --> 00:10:34.673
he is walking by himself.

00:10:34.673 --> 00:10:36.275
And more than that --

00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:39.503
(Applause) --

00:10:39.503 --> 00:10:41.290
more than just walking,

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.608
he is feeling the ground,

00:10:43.608 --> 00:10:45.651
and if the speed of the exo goes up,

00:10:45.651 --> 00:10:50.102
he tells us that he is walking again
on the sand of Santos,

00:10:50.102 --> 00:10:54.293
the beach resort where he used to go
before he had the accident.

00:10:54.293 --> 00:10:57.757
That's why the brain is creating
a new sensation in Bruno's head.

00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:01.456
So he walks, and at the end of the walk --
I am running out of time already --

00:11:01.456 --> 00:11:04.180
he says, "You know, guys,

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.811
I need to borrow this thing from you
when I get married,

00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:09.316
because I wanted to walk to the priest

00:11:09.316 --> 00:11:13.090
and see my bride and actually
be there by myself.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.482
Of course, he will have it
whenever he wants.

00:11:16.482 --> 00:11:20.564
And this is what we wanted to show
during the World Cup, and couldn't,

00:11:20.564 --> 00:11:24.738
because for some mysterious reason,
FIFA cut its broadcast in half.

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:33.291
What you are going to see very quickly
is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick

00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:35.588
a few minutes before we went to the pitch

00:11:35.588 --> 00:11:38.499
and did the real thing
in front of the entire crowd,

00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:41.880
and the lights you are going to see
just describe the operation.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.768
Basically, the blue lights pulsating
indicate that the exo is ready to go.

00:11:46.768 --> 00:11:49.843
It can receive thoughts
and it can deliver feedback,

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:52.861
and when Juliano
makes the decision to kick the ball,

00:11:52.861 --> 00:11:55.964
you are going to see
two streams of green and yellow light

00:11:55.964 --> 00:11:58.641
coming from the helmet
and going to the legs,

00:11:58.641 --> 00:12:02.742
representing the mental commands
that were taken by the exo

00:12:02.742 --> 00:12:04.641
to actually make that happen.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:07.336
And in basically 13 seconds,

00:12:07.336 --> 00:12:09.419
Juliano actually did.

00:12:09.419 --> 00:12:11.135
You can see the commands.

00:12:11.135 --> 00:12:15.475
He gets ready, 
the ball is set, and he kicks.

00:12:15.475 --> 00:12:17.353
And the most amazing thing is,

00:12:17.353 --> 00:12:20.585
10 seconds after he did that,
and looked at us on the pitch,

00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:22.862
he told us, celebrating as you saw,

00:12:22.862 --> 00:12:24.692
"I felt the ball."

00:12:25.562 --> 00:12:27.759
And that's priceless.

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:29.631
(Applause)

00:12:29.631 --> 00:12:31.131
So where is this going to go?

00:12:31.131 --> 00:12:33.066
I have two minutes to tell you

00:12:33.066 --> 00:12:36.316
that it's going to the limits
of your imagination.

00:12:36.316 --> 00:12:38.495
Brain-actuating technology is here.

00:12:38.495 --> 00:12:41.049
This is the latest: We just
published this a year ago,

00:12:41.049 --> 00:12:43.282
the first brain-to-brain interface

00:12:43.282 --> 00:12:46.909
that allows two animals
to exchange mental messages

00:12:46.909 --> 00:12:50.485
so that one animal that sees something
coming from the environment

00:12:50.485 --> 00:12:56.037
can send a mental SMS,
a torpedo, a neurophysiological torpedo,

00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:57.648
to the second animal,

00:12:57.648 --> 00:13:01.525
and the second animal performs
the act that he needed to perform

00:13:01.525 --> 00:13:05.983
without ever knowing what
the environment was sending as a message,

00:13:05.983 --> 00:13:09.279
because the message came
from the first animal's brain.

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:11.649
So this is the first demo.

00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:15.603
I'm going to be very quick
because I want to show you the latest.

00:13:15.603 --> 00:13:21.173
But what you see here
is the first rat getting informed

00:13:21.192 --> 00:13:24.125
by a light that is going to show up
on the left of the cage

00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:27.865
that he has to press the left cage
to basically get a reward.

00:13:27.865 --> 00:13:29.658
He goes there and does it.

00:13:29.658 --> 00:13:31.984
And the same time,
he is sending a mental message

00:13:31.984 --> 00:13:35.007
to the second rat
that didn't see any light,

00:13:35.007 --> 00:13:37.368
and the second rat,
in 70 percent of the times

00:13:37.368 --> 00:13:41.581
is going to press the left lever
and get a reward

00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:45.716
without ever experiencing
the light in the retina.

00:13:45.716 --> 00:13:49.850
Well, we took this
to a little higher limit

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:54.582
by getting monkeys to collaborate 
mentally in a brain net,

00:13:54.582 --> 00:13:56.772
basically to donate their brain activity

00:13:56.772 --> 00:14:00.290
and combine them to move
the virtual arm that I showed you before,

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:05.058
and what you see here is the first time
the two monkeys combine their brains,

00:14:05.058 --> 00:14:09.316
synchronize their brains perfectly
to get this virtual arm to move.

00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:12.116
One monkey is controlling the x dimension,

00:14:12.116 --> 00:14:14.996
the other monkey
is controlling the y dimension.

00:14:14.996 --> 00:14:19.176
But it gets a little more interesting
when you get three monkeys in there

00:14:19.176 --> 00:14:22.983
and you ask one monkey to control x and y,

00:14:22.983 --> 00:14:25.654
the other monkey to control y and z,

00:14:25.654 --> 00:14:28.532
and the third one to control x and z,

00:14:28.532 --> 00:14:30.648
and you make them all
play the game together,

00:14:30.648 --> 00:14:36.602
moving the arm in 3D into a target
to get the famous Brazilian orange juice.

00:14:36.602 --> 00:14:38.987
And they actually do.

00:14:38.987 --> 00:14:43.161
The black dot is the average
of all these brains working

00:14:43.161 --> 00:14:46.019
in parallel, in real time.

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:49.105
That is the definition
of a biological computer,

00:14:49.105 --> 00:14:53.647
interacting by brain activity
and achieving a motor goal.

00:14:53.647 --> 00:14:55.536
Where is this going?

00:14:55.536 --> 00:14:58.121
We have no idea.

00:14:58.121 --> 00:14:59.921
We're just scientists.

00:14:59.921 --> 00:15:01.218
(Laughter)

00:15:01.218 --> 00:15:03.774
We are paid to be children,

00:15:03.774 --> 00:15:07.764
to basically go to the edge
and discover what is out there.

00:15:07.764 --> 00:15:09.450
But one thing I know:

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.635
One day, in a few decades,

00:15:11.635 --> 00:15:15.157
when our grandchildren
surf the Net just by thinking,

00:15:15.157 --> 00:15:19.475
or a mother donates her eyesight
to an autistic kid who cannot see,

00:15:19.475 --> 00:15:22.403
or somebody speaks because
of a brain-to-brain bypass,

00:15:22.403 --> 00:15:28.730
some of you will remember
that it all started on a winter afternoon

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.502
in a Brazilian soccer field
with an impossible kick.

00:15:32.502 --> 00:15:34.498
Thank you.

00:15:34.498 --> 00:15:40.163
(Applause)

00:15:43.962 --> 00:15:47.222
Thank you.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.004
Bruno Giussani: Miguel,
thank you for sticking to your time.

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:05.529
I actually would have given you
a couple more minutes,

00:16:05.529 --> 00:16:08.913
because there are a couple of points
we want to develop, and, of course,

00:16:08.913 --> 00:16:12.810
clearly it seems that we need connected 
brains to figure out where this is going.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.712
So let's connect all this together.

00:16:14.712 --> 00:16:16.381
So if I'm understanding correctly,

00:16:16.381 --> 00:16:18.880
one of the monkeys
is actually getting a signal

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.146
and the other monkey
is reacting to that signal

00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:25.631
just because the first one is receiving it
and transmitting the neurological impulse.

00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:27.855
Miguel Nicolelis: 
No, it's a little different.

00:16:27.855 --> 00:16:30.746
No monkey knows of the existence
of the other two monkeys.

00:16:30.746 --> 00:16:33.682
They are getting a visual feedback in 2D,

00:16:33.682 --> 00:16:36.355
but the task they have
to accomplish is 3D.

00:16:36.355 --> 00:16:38.954
They have to move an arm
in three dimensions.

00:16:38.954 --> 00:16:42.356
But each monkey is only getting
the two dimensions on the video screen

00:16:42.356 --> 00:16:44.132
that the monkey controls.

00:16:44.132 --> 00:16:47.150
And to get that thing done,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.964
you need at least two monkeys
to synchronize their brains,

00:16:49.964 --> 00:16:51.735
but the ideal is three.

00:16:51.735 --> 00:16:55.351
So what we found out is that
when one monkey starts slacking down,

00:16:55.351 --> 00:16:57.962
the other two monkeys
enhance their performance

00:16:57.962 --> 00:16:59.944
to get the guy to come back,

00:16:59.944 --> 00:17:02.050
so this adjusts dynamically,

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.399
but the global synchrony remains the same.

00:17:06.399 --> 00:17:09.023
Now, if you flip
without telling the monkey

00:17:09.023 --> 00:17:11.321
the dimensions that each brain
has to control,

00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:13.620
like this guy is controlling x and y,

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.035
but he should be controlling now y and z,

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:20.818
instantaneously, that animal's brain
forgets about the old dimensions

00:17:20.818 --> 00:17:23.336
and it starts concentrating
on the new dimensions.

00:17:23.336 --> 00:17:26.623
So what I need to say is
that no Turing machine,

00:17:26.623 --> 00:17:30.825
no computer can predict
what a brain net will do.

00:17:30.825 --> 00:17:33.206
So we will absorb technology
as part of us.

00:17:33.206 --> 00:17:35.815
Technology will never absorb us.

00:17:35.815 --> 00:17:38.456
It's simply impossible.

00:17:38.456 --> 00:17:41.506
BG: How many times have you tested this?

00:17:41.506 --> 00:17:44.051
And how many times
have you succeeded versus failed?

00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:46.327
MN: Oh, tens of times.

00:17:46.327 --> 00:17:48.565
With the three monkeys?
Oh, several times.

00:17:48.565 --> 00:17:53.185
I wouldn't be able to talk about this here
unless I had done it a few times.

00:17:53.185 --> 00:17:55.786
And I forgot to mention, because of time,

00:17:55.786 --> 00:17:59.547
that just three weeks ago,
a European group

00:17:59.547 --> 00:18:04.637
just demonstrated the first
man-to-man brain-to-brain connection.

00:18:04.637 --> 00:18:06.157
BG: And how does that play?

00:18:06.157 --> 00:18:10.739
MN: There was one bit of information --
big ideas start in a humble way --

00:18:10.739 --> 00:18:17.102
but basically the brain activity
of one subject

00:18:17.102 --> 00:18:21.308
was transmitted to a second object,
all non-invasive technology.

00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:25.552
So the first subject got a message,
like our rats, a visual message,

00:18:25.552 --> 00:18:28.106
and transmitted it to the second subject.

00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:32.588
The second subject received
a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex,

00:18:32.588 --> 00:18:36.094
or a different pulse,
two different pulses.

00:18:36.094 --> 00:18:38.799
In one pulse, the subject saw something.

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:40.935
On the other pulse,
he saw something different.

00:18:40.935 --> 00:18:42.918
And he was able to verbally indicate

00:18:42.918 --> 00:18:45.958
what was the message
the first subject was sending

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.853
through the Internet across continents.

00:18:48.853 --> 00:18:51.372
Moderator: Wow.
Okay, that's where we are going.

00:18:51.372 --> 00:18:53.689
That's the next TED Talk
at the next conference.

00:18:53.689 --> 00:18:56.596
Miguel Nicolelis, thank you.
MN: Thank you, Bruno. Thank you.
