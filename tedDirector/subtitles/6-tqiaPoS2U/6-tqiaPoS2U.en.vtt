00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:19.125
(Music)

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:30.822
These bees are in my backyard
in Berkeley, California.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:33.221
Until last year,
I'd never kept bees before,

00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:37.270
but National Geographic asked me
to photograph a story about them,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.769
and I decided, to be able
to take compelling images,

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.253
I should start keeping bees myself.

00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:43.948
And as you may know,

00:00:43.948 --> 00:00:46.572
bees pollinate one third
of our food crops,

00:00:46.572 --> 00:00:49.730
and lately they've been having
a really hard time.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.281
So as a photographer, I wanted to explore
what this problem really looks like.

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.466
So I'm going to show you
what I found over the last year.

00:00:58.276 --> 00:00:59.900
This furry little creature

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.243
is a fresh young bee halfway emerged
from its brood cell,

00:01:04.243 --> 00:01:07.283
and bees right now are dealing
with several different problems,

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:11.535
including pesticides, diseases,
and habitat loss,

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:16.146
but the single greatest threat
is a parasitic mite from Asia,

00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:18.475
Varroa destructor.

00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:21.354
And this pinhead-sized mite
crawls onto young bees

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:23.699
and sucks their blood.

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:25.696
This eventually destroys a hive

00:01:25.696 --> 00:01:28.940
because it weakens
the immune system of the bees,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.476
and it makes them more vulnerable
to stress and disease.

00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:35.773
Now, bees are the most sensitive

00:01:35.773 --> 00:01:38.513
when they're developing
inside their brood cells,

00:01:38.513 --> 00:01:41.624
and I wanted to know
what that process really looks like,

00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:44.248
so I teamed up
with a bee lab at U.C. Davis

00:01:44.248 --> 00:01:47.343
and figured out how to raise bees
in front of a camera.

00:01:47.993 --> 00:01:50.981
I'm going to show you
the first 21 days of a bee's life

00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:53.770
condensed into 60 seconds.

00:01:55.763 --> 00:02:00.567
This is a bee egg
as it hatches into a larva,

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:05.012
and those newly hatched larvae
swim around their cells

00:02:05.012 --> 00:02:09.335
feeding on this white goo
that nurse bees secrete for them.

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:16.159
Then, their head and their legs
slowly differentiate

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.509
as they transform into pupae.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.853
Here's that same pupation process,

00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:27.243
and you can actually see the mites
running around in the cells.

00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:31.510
Then the tissue in their body reorganizes

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.115
and the pigment slowly
develops in their eyes.

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:44.757
The last step of the process
is their skin shrivels up

00:02:44.757 --> 00:02:47.245
and they sprout hair.

00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:51.237
(Music)

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:03.659
So -- (Applause)

00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:09.907
As you can see halfway
through that video,

00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:12.461
the mites were running around
on the baby bees,

00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.390
and the way that beekeepers
typically manage these mites

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.404
is they treat their hives with chemicals.

00:03:19.404 --> 00:03:21.670
In the long run, that's bad news,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.223
so researchers are working
on finding alternatives

00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:27.387
to control these mites.

00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:30.963
This is one of those alternatives.

00:03:30.963 --> 00:03:35.328
It's an experimental breeding program
at the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge,

00:03:35.328 --> 00:03:39.045
and this queen and her attendant bees
are part of that program.

00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:43.430
Now, the researchers figured out

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.152
that some of the bees have
a natural ability to fight mites,

00:03:47.152 --> 00:03:51.322
so they set out to breed
a line of mite-resistant bees.

00:03:52.782 --> 00:03:55.418
This is what it takes
to breed bees in a lab.

00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:58.158
The virgin queen is sedated

00:03:58.158 --> 00:04:03.200
and then artificially inseminated
using this precision instrument.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.478
Now, this procedure allows the researchers

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:10.500
to control exactly
which bees are being crossed,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.627
but there's a tradeoff
in having this much control.

00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:16.832
They succeeded in breeding
mite-resistant bees,

00:04:16.832 --> 00:04:19.920
but in that process, those bees
started to lose traits

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.685
like their gentleness
and their ability to store honey,

00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:26.194
so to overcome that problem,

00:04:26.194 --> 00:04:29.742
these researchers are now collaborating
with commercial beekeepers.

00:04:30.252 --> 00:04:35.120
This is Bret Adee opening
one of his 72,000 beehives.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.750
He and his brother run the largest
beekeeping operation in the world,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.409
and the USDA is integrating their
mite-resistant bees into his operation

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:47.052
with the hope that over time,

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:50.723
they'll be able to select the bees
that are not only mite-resistant

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:55.707
but also retain all of these qualities
that make them useful to us.

00:04:56.165 --> 00:04:57.860
And to say it like that

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.157
makes it sound like we're manipulating
and exploiting bees,

00:05:01.157 --> 00:05:04.593
and the truth is, we've been doing that
for thousands of years.

00:05:04.593 --> 00:05:09.747
We took this wild creature
and put it inside of a box,

00:05:09.747 --> 00:05:11.861
practically domesticating it,

00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:15.970
and originally that was
so that we could harvest their honey,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.725
but over time we started losing
our native pollinators,

00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:20.420
our wild pollinators,

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.485
and there are many places now
where those wild pollinators

00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:27.284
can no longer meet the pollination
demands of our agriculture,

00:05:27.284 --> 00:05:32.508
so these managed bees have become
an integral part of our food system.

00:05:32.508 --> 00:05:35.227
So when people talk about saving bees,

00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:37.360
my interpretation of that

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.588
is we need to save
our relationship to bees,

00:05:40.588 --> 00:05:45.592
and in order to design new solutions,

00:05:45.592 --> 00:05:50.693
we have to understand
the basic biology of bees

00:05:50.693 --> 00:05:56.936
and understand the effects
of stressors that we sometimes cannot see.

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.114
In other words, we have
to understand bees up close.

00:06:01.114 --> 00:06:03.384
Thank you.

00:06:03.384 --> 00:06:05.198
(Applause)
