00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:15.335
You know, it's a big privilege for me

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:19.227
to be working in one of the
biodiversity hotspots in the world:

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.928
the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:25.673
These islands — Mauritius,
Rodrigues, and Réunion —

00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:28.811
along with the island of Madagascar,

00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:30.727
they are blessed with unique plants

00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:32.840
found nowhere else in the world.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.529
And today I will tell you 
about five of them

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:37.524
and their particular features

00:00:37.524 --> 00:00:40.408
and why these plants are so unique.

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:41.968
Take a look at this plant.

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:45.372
I call it benjoin in the local vernacular,

00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:49.298
and the botanical name 
is Terminalia bentzoe,

00:00:49.298 --> 00:00:51.199
subspecies bentzoe.

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.507
This subspecies is endemic to Mauritius,

00:00:54.507 --> 00:00:56.318
and its particular feature

00:00:56.318 --> 00:00:58.792
is its heterophylly.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.918
What do I mean by heterophylly?

00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:02.481
It's that the same plant

00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:05.564
has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:07.149
Now, these plants have evolved

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.503
very far away from the mainland,

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:12.901
and within specific ecosystems.

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:15.725
Often, these particular features

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:18.536
have evolved as a response to the threat

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.973
presented by the local fauna,

00:01:20.973 --> 00:01:24.593
in this case, grazing tortoises.

00:01:24.593 --> 00:01:27.749
Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight,

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:30.235
and as such, they tend to avoid the plants

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:32.294
they don't recognize.

00:01:32.294 --> 00:01:35.668
So this evolutionary 
foil safeguards the plant

00:01:35.668 --> 00:01:38.593
against these rather cute animals,

00:01:38.593 --> 00:01:43.651
and protects it and of course 
ensures its survival.

00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:46.661
Now the question you're 
probably asking yourself is,

00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:49.562
why is she telling us all these stories?

00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:53.248
The reason for that is that we tend to overlook

00:01:53.248 --> 00:01:57.632
the diversity and the variety of the natural world.

00:01:57.632 --> 00:02:00.525
These particular habitats are unique

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:04.753
and they are host to a whole lot of plants.

00:02:04.753 --> 00:02:06.924
We don't realize how valuable

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:09.534
and how precious these resources are,

00:02:09.534 --> 00:02:11.729
and yet, through our insouciance,

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.898
we keep on destroying them.

00:02:13.898 --> 00:02:15.630
We're all familiar

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.825
with the macro impact of urbanization,

00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:22.267
climate change, resource exploitation,

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.440
but when that one last plant —

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.649
or animal for that matter —

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:28.848
when that very last specimen

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:30.959
has disappeared from the face of this Earth,

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.355
we would have lost

00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:36.261
an entire subset of the Earth's biology,

00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:39.939
and with it, important plants 
with medicinal potential

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.874
or which could have ingredients

00:02:41.874 --> 00:02:43.395
that would speak to the cosmetic,

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:45.316
nutrition, pharma,

00:02:45.316 --> 00:02:47.735
and even the ethno-veterinary sectors,

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:49.478
be gone forever.

00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:51.413
And here we have a very prime example

00:02:51.413 --> 00:02:54.158
of the iconic dodo, which comes from Mauritius,

00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:58.545
and, of course, we know is 
now a symbol of extinction.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:01.165
We know plants have a 
fundamental role to play.

00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:03.000
Well, first of all, they feed us

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.890
and they also give us 
the oxygen we breathe,

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.207
but plants are also the source

00:03:08.207 --> 00:03:11.762
of important, biologically active ingredients

00:03:11.762 --> 00:03:14.964
that we should be studying very carefully,

00:03:14.964 --> 00:03:19.254
because human societies over the millennia,

00:03:19.254 --> 00:03:22.302
they have developed important knowledge,

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.120
cultural traditions,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.416
and important plant-based medicinal resources.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.401
Here's a data point:

00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:34.563
1.4 percent of the entire land surface

00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:38.467
is home to 40 percent of
the species of higher plants,

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:41.155
35 percent of the species of vertebrates,

00:03:41.155 --> 00:03:43.698
and this 1.4 percent

00:03:43.698 --> 00:03:48.366
represents the 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world,

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:51.524
and this 1.4 percent of the entire land surface

00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:54.406
already provides for 35 percent

00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:56.240
of the ecosystem services

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.918
that vulnerable people depend on.

00:03:58.918 --> 00:04:00.266
And as you can see,

00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:01.679
the island of Mauritius

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:03.762
where I work and where I live,

00:04:03.762 --> 00:04:06.467
belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot,

00:04:06.467 --> 00:04:08.681
and I study the unique plants

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:12.343
on the island for their 
biomedical applications.

00:04:12.343 --> 00:04:13.680
Now, let's go back again

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.520
to that first plant I showed you,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.547
the one, of course, with 
different-shaped leaves

00:04:18.547 --> 00:04:21.403
and different sizes, Terminalia bentzoe,

00:04:21.403 --> 00:04:23.070
subspecies bentzoe,

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.665
a plant only found in Mauritius.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.110
Now, the local people,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.336
they used a decoction of the leaves

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:31.867
against infectious diseases.

00:04:31.867 --> 00:04:34.319
Now our work, that is,

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.728
the scientific validation of 
this traditional information,

00:04:37.728 --> 00:04:39.800
has shown that precisely

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.129
that leaf extract shows activity, potent activity,

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.351
against a wide range of bacteria

00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:49.427
that could be pathogenic to humans.

00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:51.868
Now, could this plant be the answer

00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:54.489
to antibiotic resistance?

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:56.840
You know, antibiotic resistance is proving to be

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.560
a big challenge globally.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.363
While we may not be sure, one thing is certain:

00:05:02.363 --> 00:05:04.972
we will not want this plant to disappear.

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:07.616
But the harsh reality is that

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:09.600
this particular plant is in fact

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.470
considered to be vulnerable

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.630
in its natural habitat.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.778
This brings me to another example.

00:05:15.778 --> 00:05:19.568
This bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate

00:05:19.568 --> 00:05:21.290
in the local vernacular.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.945
The botanical name is Psiadia arguta.

00:05:23.945 --> 00:05:25.836
It's a plant which is rare,

00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:28.548
which is endemic to Mauritius.

00:05:28.548 --> 00:05:29.770
It used to grow on the mainland,

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.213
but through the sheer 
pressures of urbanization

00:05:32.213 --> 00:05:34.492
has been pushed out of the mainland,

00:05:34.492 --> 00:05:36.193
and we've managed to bring it back

00:05:36.193 --> 00:05:37.669
from the brink of extinction

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.736
by developing in vitro plants

00:05:39.736 --> 00:05:41.584
which are now growing in the wild.

00:05:41.584 --> 00:05:43.780
Now, one thing I must 
point out straightaway

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.657
is that not all plants

00:05:46.657 --> 00:05:49.573
can be developed in vitro.

00:05:49.573 --> 00:05:53.396
While we humans, we are 
happy in our comfort zone,

00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:55.632
these plants also need

00:05:55.632 --> 00:05:58.366
their ecosystem to be preserved,

00:05:58.366 --> 00:06:00.199
and they don't react — endemic plants

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.518
don't react to very harsh 
changes in their ecosystem,

00:06:03.518 --> 00:06:05.779
and yet we know what are the challenges

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:06.867
that climate change, for example,

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:08.910
is posing to these plants.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.438
Now, the local people again use the leaves

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:13.192
in traditional medicine

00:06:13.192 --> 00:06:15.872
against respiratory problems.

00:06:15.872 --> 00:06:17.961
Now, our preliminary labwork

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.693
on the leaf extract has shown

00:06:19.693 --> 00:06:23.822
that precisely these 
leaves contain ingredients

00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:26.917
that are very close, 
in terms of structures,

00:06:26.917 --> 00:06:29.283
chemical structures, to those medicines

00:06:29.283 --> 00:06:30.802
which are sold in the chemist's shop

00:06:30.802 --> 00:06:32.777
against asthma.

00:06:32.777 --> 00:06:34.687
So who knows

00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:36.773
what humanity will benefit from

00:06:36.773 --> 00:06:42.191
should this plant decide 
to reveal all its secrets.

00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:44.682
Now, I come from the developing world

00:06:44.682 --> 00:06:47.485
where we are forever being 
challenged with this issue

00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:49.879
of population explosion.

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:52.693
Africa is the continent 
which is getting younger,

00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:56.396
and whenever one talks 
about population explosion,

00:06:56.396 --> 00:06:58.901
one talks about the issue of food security

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:01.581
as being the other side of the same coin.

00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:03.899
Now this plant here, the baobab,

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:05.421
could be part of the answer.

00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:08.566
It's an underutilized, neglected food plant.

00:07:08.566 --> 00:07:11.059
It defines the landscape of West Africa,

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:13.605
where it is known as the tree of life,

00:07:13.605 --> 00:07:16.103
and later on I will tell you why

00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:19.214
the Africans consider it to be the tree of life.

00:07:19.214 --> 00:07:21.132
Now interestingly, there are many legends

00:07:21.132 --> 00:07:23.240
which are associated with this plant.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.012
Because of its sheer size,

00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:27.914
it was meant to be lording over lesser plants,

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:29.872
so God didn't like this arrogance,

00:07:29.872 --> 00:07:32.660
uprooted it, and planted it upside down,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.182
hence its particular shape.

00:07:35.182 --> 00:07:37.690
And if you look at this tree again

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.852
within the African context,

00:07:39.852 --> 00:07:43.517
in West Africa, it's known 
as the palaver tree,

00:07:43.517 --> 00:07:46.587
because it performs great social functions.

00:07:46.587 --> 00:07:48.806
Now if you have a problem in the community,

00:07:48.806 --> 00:07:50.544
meeting under the palaver tree

00:07:50.544 --> 00:07:52.523
with the chiefs or the tribesmen

00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:54.685
would be synonymous to trying to find a solution

00:07:54.685 --> 00:07:56.130
to that particular problem,

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.070
and also to reinforce trust and respect

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.591
among members of the community.

00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:03.987
From the scientific point of view,

00:08:03.987 --> 00:08:06.682
there are eight species of baobab in the world.

00:08:06.682 --> 00:08:08.664
There's one from Africa,

00:08:08.664 --> 00:08:10.333
one from Australia,

00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:13.080
and six are endemic

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.727
to the island of Madagascar.

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:16.359
The one I have showed you

00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:17.949
is the one from Africa,

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:19.870
Adansonia digitata.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.190
Now, the flower, this 
beautiful white flower,

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.314
it opens at night, is pollinated by bats,

00:08:24.314 --> 00:08:26.913
and it gives rise to the fruit

00:08:26.913 --> 00:08:28.465
which is curiously known

00:08:28.465 --> 00:08:30.200
as the monkey apple.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.693
The monkeys are not stupid animals.

00:08:31.693 --> 00:08:33.426
They know what's good for them.

00:08:33.426 --> 00:08:36.227
Now, if you open the fruit of the baobab,

00:08:36.227 --> 00:08:38.820
you'll see a white, floury pulp,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.917
which is very rich in nutrients

00:08:40.917 --> 00:08:43.291
and has got protein,

00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:47.409
more protein than in human milk.

00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:49.197
Yes, you heard right:

00:08:49.197 --> 00:08:52.605
more protein than in human milk.

00:08:52.605 --> 00:08:54.495
And this is one of the reasons why

00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:56.317
the nutrition companies of this world,

00:08:56.317 --> 00:08:58.702
they are looking for this fruit to provide

00:08:58.702 --> 00:09:01.289
what we know as reinforced food.

00:09:01.289 --> 00:09:05.170
The seeds give an oil, a very stable oil

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.240
which is sought after 
by the cosmetic industry

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.502
to give to produce body lotions, for example.

00:09:11.502 --> 00:09:13.131
And if you look at the trunk,

00:09:13.131 --> 00:09:16.734
the trunk, of course, safeguards water,

00:09:16.734 --> 00:09:19.535
which is often harvested by a thirsty traveler,

00:09:19.535 --> 00:09:21.213
and the leaves are used in traditional medicine

00:09:21.213 --> 00:09:23.168
against infectious disease.

00:09:23.168 --> 00:09:25.744
Now, you can see now why the Africans consider it

00:09:25.744 --> 00:09:27.544
to be the tree of life.

00:09:27.544 --> 00:09:29.209
It's a complete plant,

00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:31.751
and in fact, the sheer size of these trees

00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:33.854
is hiding a massive potential,

00:09:33.854 --> 00:09:37.296
not only for the pharma, nutrition,
and the cosmetic industry.

00:09:37.296 --> 00:09:39.302
What I have showed you here

00:09:39.302 --> 00:09:41.532
is only the species from Africa,

00:09:41.532 --> 00:09:43.416
Adansonia digitata.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:46.080
We have six species yet in Madagascar,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.564
and we don't know what 
is the potential of this plant,

00:09:49.564 --> 00:09:52.030
but one thing we know is that the flora

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.592
is considered to be 
threatened with extinction.

00:09:54.592 --> 00:09:57.796
Let me take you to Africa again,

00:09:57.796 --> 00:10:00.300
and introduce you to one of my very favorite,

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.130
the resurrection plant.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.477
Now here you'll find

00:10:03.477 --> 00:10:05.395
that even Jesus has competition.

00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:06.998
(Laughter)

00:10:06.998 --> 00:10:09.991
Now, this plant here has developed

00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:12.970
remarkable tolerance to drought,

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.068
which enables it to withstand

00:10:15.068 --> 00:10:19.313
up to 98 percent dehydration 
over the period of a year

00:10:19.313 --> 00:10:21.417
without damage,

00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:25.567
and yet it can regenerate 
itself almost completely

00:10:25.567 --> 00:10:29.647
overnight, over 24 hours, and flower.

00:10:29.647 --> 00:10:31.880
Now, us human beings,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.106
we're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth.

00:10:35.106 --> 00:10:36.940
We don't want to get old, and rightly so.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.179
Why should we, especially if you can afford it?

00:10:40.179 --> 00:10:42.362
And this gives you an indication

00:10:42.362 --> 00:10:45.164
of what the plant looks like before.

00:10:45.164 --> 00:10:48.020
Now, if you are an inexperienced gardener,

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.052
the first thing you'll do 
when you visit the garden

00:10:50.052 --> 00:10:52.776
is to uproot this plant because it's dead.

00:10:52.776 --> 00:10:57.578
But if you water it, this is what you get.

00:10:57.578 --> 00:10:59.754
Absolutely amazing.

00:10:59.754 --> 00:11:02.250
Now, if you look at our aging process,

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.700
the aging process is in fact the loss of water

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.874
from the upper epidermis, resulting in wrinkling

00:11:07.874 --> 00:11:09.441
as we know it, especially women,

00:11:09.441 --> 00:11:11.282
we are so conscious of this.

00:11:11.282 --> 00:11:15.963
And this plant, in fact, is giving 
the cosmetic chemists

00:11:15.963 --> 00:11:17.953
very important ingredients

00:11:17.953 --> 00:11:20.720
that are actually finding ways

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.110
to slow down the aging process

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.490
and at the same time reinforce the cells

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.777
against the onslaught of environmental toxins.

00:11:29.777 --> 00:11:32.414
Now, these four examples

00:11:32.414 --> 00:11:35.321
I have just given you

00:11:35.321 --> 00:11:38.755
are just a very tiny reminder

00:11:38.755 --> 00:11:42.492
as to how our health

00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:45.996
and our survival are closely linked

00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:48.808
to the health and the resilience

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:50.653
of our ecosystem,

00:11:50.653 --> 00:11:52.587
and why we should be very careful

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:55.288
about preserving biodiversity.

00:11:55.288 --> 00:11:58.490
Every time a forest is cut down,

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:02.110
every time a marsh is filled in,

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.860
it is a potential lab that goes with it,

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.168
and which we will never, ever recover.

00:12:08.168 --> 00:12:09.735
And I know what I'm talking about,

00:12:09.735 --> 00:12:13.067
coming from Mauritius and missing the dodo.

00:12:13.067 --> 00:12:17.425
Let me finish with just one last example.

00:12:17.425 --> 00:12:21.240
Conservation issues are normally guided

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.208
towards rare, endemic plants,

00:12:24.208 --> 00:12:26.750
but what we call exotic plants,

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.227
that is, the ones which grow in many
different habitats across the world,

00:12:30.227 --> 00:12:32.633
they also need to be considered.

00:12:32.633 --> 00:12:35.772
You know why? Because the environment plays

00:12:35.772 --> 00:12:37.527
a very important role

00:12:37.527 --> 00:12:40.186
in modifying the composition of that plant.

00:12:40.186 --> 00:12:42.817
So let's take a look at this plant here,

00:12:42.817 --> 00:12:45.300
Centella asiatica. It's a weed.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.448
We call it a weed.

00:12:47.448 --> 00:12:50.324
Now, Centella asiatica 
grows across the world

00:12:50.324 --> 00:12:53.106
in many different habitats — 
in Africa, in Asia —

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.125
and this plant has been instrumental

00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:57.892
in providing a solution 
to that dreadful disease

00:12:57.892 --> 00:13:02.338
called leprosy in Madagascar in the 1940s.

00:13:02.338 --> 00:13:05.868
Now, while Centella 
grows across the world —

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:09.159
in Africa, in Asia — 
the best quality Centella

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:11.503
comes from Madagascar,

00:13:11.503 --> 00:13:15.688
because that Centella contains
the three vital ingredients

00:13:15.688 --> 00:13:17.914
which are sought after by the pharma

00:13:17.914 --> 00:13:20.548
and the cosmetic companies.

00:13:20.548 --> 00:13:22.797
And the cosmetic companies 
are already using it

00:13:22.797 --> 00:13:25.879
to make regenerating cream.

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:28.668
Now, there is an ancient saying

00:13:28.668 --> 00:13:32.212
that for every disease known to mankind,

00:13:32.212 --> 00:13:34.394
there is a plant to cure it.

00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:36.622
Now, you may not 
believe in ancient sayings.

00:13:36.622 --> 00:13:38.185
You may think they're obsolete

00:13:38.185 --> 00:13:41.133
now that our science and 
technology are so powerful.

00:13:41.133 --> 00:13:43.169
So you may look on Centella as being

00:13:43.169 --> 00:13:46.374
an insignificant, humble weed,

00:13:46.374 --> 00:13:49.700
which, if destroyed, won't be missed.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.135
But you know, there is no such thing as a weed.

00:13:52.135 --> 00:13:53.889
It's a plant.

00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:56.768
It's a living biological lab

00:13:56.768 --> 00:13:58.669
that may well have answers

00:13:58.669 --> 00:14:00.627
to the question that we may have,

00:14:00.627 --> 00:14:02.517
but we have to ensure

00:14:02.517 --> 00:14:05.250
that it has the right to live.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.128
Thank you.

00:14:07.128 --> 00:14:11.128
(Applause)
