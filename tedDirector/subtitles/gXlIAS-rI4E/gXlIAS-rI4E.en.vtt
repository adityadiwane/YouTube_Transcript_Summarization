00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.561
This is my niece, Stella.

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:18.057
She's just turned one and started to walk.

00:00:18.057 --> 00:00:21.057
And she's walking in that really cool way that
one-year-olds do,

00:00:21.057 --> 00:00:26.273
a kind of teetering, my-body's-moving-
too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way.

00:00:26.273 --> 00:00:28.762
It is absolutely gorgeous.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.380
And one of her favorite 
things to do at the moment

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.844
is to stare at herself in the mirror.

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:36.999
She absolutely loves her reflection.

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:43.371
She giggles and squeals, and gives
herself these big, wet kisses.

00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:45.384
It is beautiful.

00:00:45.384 --> 00:00:50.676
Apparently, all of her friends do this and my mom
tells me that I used to do this,

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:52.191
and it got me thinking:

00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:55.648
When did I stop doing this?

00:00:55.648 --> 00:01:00.951
When is it suddenly not okay to love 
the way that we look?

00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:03.636
Because apparently we don't.

00:01:03.636 --> 00:01:07.065
Ten thousand people every month google,

00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:09.211
"Am I ugly?"

00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:13.734
This is Faye. Faye is 13 and she 
lives in Denver.

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:17.708
And like any teenager, she just wants to 
be liked and to fit in.

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:19.517
It's Sunday night.

00:01:19.517 --> 00:01:22.211
She's getting ready for the week ahead at school.

00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:24.497
And she's slightly dreading it, and 
she's a bit confused because

00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:27.106
despite her mom telling her all the time

00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:29.452
that she's beautiful,

00:01:29.452 --> 00:01:35.364
every day at school, someone tells her 
that she's ugly.

00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:38.629
Because of the difference between what her mom 
tells her and what her friends

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:41.653
at school, or her peers at school are telling her,

00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:44.018
she doesn't know who to believe.

00:01:44.018 --> 00:01:47.967
So, she takes a video of herself. 
She posts it to YouTube

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:50.293
and she asks people to please leave 
a comment:

00:01:50.293 --> 00:01:52.410
"Am I pretty or am I ugly?"

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.415
Well, so far, Faye has received 
over 13,000 comments.

00:01:57.415 --> 00:02:01.019
Some of them are so nasty, they don't 
bear thinking about.

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:06.950
This is an average, healthy-looking 
teenage girl receiving this feedback

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.184
at one of the most emotionally vulnerable
times in her life.

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:15.081
Thousands of people are posting videos like this,

00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:18.918
mostly teenage girls, reaching out in this way.

00:02:18.918 --> 00:02:20.867
But what's leading them to do this?

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:24.774
Well, today's teenagers are rarely alone.

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:29.604
They're under pressure to be online
and available at all times,

00:02:29.604 --> 00:02:34.145
talking, messaging, liking, commenting, 
sharing, posting —

00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:36.062
it never ends.

00:02:36.062 --> 00:02:39.012
Never before have we been so connected,

00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:43.772
so continuously, so instantaneously, so young.

00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:48.632
And as one mom told me, it's like there's a party
in their bedroom every night.

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:52.071
There's simply no privacy.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:56.424
And the social pressures that go along 
with that are relentless.

00:02:56.424 --> 00:03:01.302
This always-on environment is training
our kids to value themselves

00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:03.013
based on the number of likes they get

00:03:03.013 --> 00:03:06.012
and the types of comments that they receive.

00:03:06.012 --> 00:03:10.591
There's no separation between online and offline life.

00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:16.164
What's real or what isn't is really
hard to tell the difference between.

00:03:16.164 --> 00:03:19.955
And it's also really hard to tell the difference 
between what's authentic

00:03:19.955 --> 00:03:22.241
and what's digitally manipulated.

00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:27.886
What's a highlight in someone's life versus
what's normal in the context of everyday.

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:31.017
And where are they looking to for inspiration?

00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:34.829
Well, you can see the kinds of images
that are covering the newsfeeds

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.441
of girls today.

00:03:36.441 --> 00:03:39.655
Size zero models still dominate our catwalks.

00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:42.312
Airbrushing is now routine.

00:03:42.312 --> 00:03:44.923
And trends like #thinspiration, #thighgap,

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:47.042
#bikinibridge and #proana.

00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:50.586
For those who don't know, #proana means pro-anorexia.

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:55.427
These trends are teamed with the 
stereotyping and flagrant objectification

00:03:55.427 --> 00:03:57.631
of women in today's popular culture.

00:03:57.631 --> 00:04:03.608
It is not hard to see what girls are
benchmarking themselves against.

00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:06.057
But boys are not immune to this either.

00:04:06.057 --> 00:04:11.189
Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs
of superhero-like sports stars

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.707
and playboy music artists.

00:04:13.707 --> 00:04:16.079
But, what's the problem with all of this?

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.132
Well, surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy, 
well balanced individuals.

00:04:23.132 --> 00:04:27.008
But in an image-obsessed culture, we are
training our kids

00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:31.816
to spend more time and mental effort on 
their appearance

00:04:31.816 --> 00:04:36.111
at the expense of all of the other aspects
of their identities.

00:04:36.111 --> 00:04:40.221
So, things like their relationships, the development
of their physical abilities,

00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:44.256
and their studies and so on begin to suffer.

00:04:44.256 --> 00:04:49.858
Six out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do 
something because they don't

00:04:49.858 --> 00:04:51.722
think they look good enough.

00:04:51.722 --> 00:04:54.104
These are not trivial activities.

00:04:54.104 --> 00:04:58.008
These are fundamental activities to their
development as humans

00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:03.358
and as contributors to society and to 
the workforce.

00:05:03.358 --> 00:05:09.279
Thirty-one percent, nearly one in 
three teenagers, are withdrawing

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.851
from classroom debate. They're failing

00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:12.982
to engage in classroom debate because

00:05:12.982 --> 00:05:16.232
they don't want to draw attention to the 
way that they look.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:19.089
One in five are not showing up to class at all

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.456
on days when they don't feel good about it.

00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:22.876
And when it comes to exams,

00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:25.225
if you don't think you look good enough,

00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:28.561
specifically if you don't think you are thin enough,

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:31.667
you will score a lower grade point average

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:34.464
than your peers who are not concerned with this.

00:05:34.464 --> 00:05:37.607
And this is consistent across Finland, the U.S.

00:05:37.607 --> 00:05:43.664
and China, and is true regardless of how much
you actually weigh.

00:05:43.664 --> 00:05:46.546
So to be super clear, we're talking about the

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:51.789
way you think you look, not how
you actually look.

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.544
Low body confidence is undermining 
academic achievement.

00:05:56.544 --> 00:05:58.952
But it's also damaging health.

00:05:58.952 --> 00:06:02.534
Teenagers with low body confidence
do less physical activity,

00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:04.657
eat less fruits and vegetables,

00:06:04.657 --> 00:06:07.692
partake in more unhealthy weight control
practices

00:06:07.692 --> 00:06:10.101
that can lead to eating disorders.

00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:12.654
They have lower self-esteem.

00:06:12.654 --> 00:06:14.740
They're more easily influenced by people around them

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.488
and they're at greater risk of depression.

00:06:17.488 --> 00:06:21.416
And we think it's for all of these reasons
that they take more risks

00:06:21.416 --> 00:06:25.141
with things like alcohol and drug use;

00:06:25.141 --> 00:06:30.552
crash dieting; cosmetic surgery; 
unprotected, earlier sex;

00:06:30.552 --> 00:06:32.682
and self-harm.

00:06:32.682 --> 00:06:36.816
The pursuit of the perfect body is putting
pressure on our healthcare systems

00:06:36.816 --> 00:06:41.263
and costing our governments billions of 
dollars every year.

00:06:41.263 --> 00:06:43.916
And we don't grow out of it.

00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:46.815
Women who think they're overweight — again,

00:06:46.815 --> 00:06:49.567
regardless of whether they are or are not —

00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:52.877
have higher rates of absenteeism.

00:06:52.877 --> 00:06:54.934
Seventeen percent of women would

00:06:54.934 --> 00:06:57.651
not show up to a job interview on

00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:02.961
a day when they weren't feeling confident
about the way that they look.

00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:04.866
Have a think about what this is doing

00:07:04.866 --> 00:07:06.582
to our economy.

00:07:06.582 --> 00:07:08.444
If we could overcome this, what that

00:07:08.444 --> 00:07:10.754
opportunity looks like.

00:07:10.754 --> 00:07:13.349
Unlocking this potential is in the interest

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.609
of every single one of us.

00:07:16.609 --> 00:07:18.181
But how do we do that?

00:07:18.181 --> 00:07:22.153
Well, talking, on its own, only gets you so far.

00:07:22.153 --> 00:07:24.037
It's not enough by itself.

00:07:24.037 --> 00:07:25.462
If you actually want to make a difference,

00:07:25.462 --> 00:07:27.598
you have to do something.

00:07:27.598 --> 00:07:30.672
And we've learned there are three key ways:

00:07:30.672 --> 00:07:33.314
The first is we have to educate for body confidence.

00:07:33.314 --> 00:07:35.236
We have to help our teenagers develop

00:07:35.236 --> 00:07:38.581
strategies to overcome image-related pressures

00:07:38.581 --> 00:07:40.131
and build their self-esteem.

00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:42.117
Now, the good news is that there are

00:07:42.117 --> 00:07:46.070
many programs out there available
to do this.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.820
The bad news is that most of them don't work.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.527
I was shocked to learn that many well-meaning

00:07:54.527 --> 00:07:57.755
programs are inadvertently actually

00:07:57.755 --> 00:08:01.150
making the situation worse.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.856
So we need to make damn sure that

00:08:02.856 --> 00:08:05.459
the programs that our kids are receiving

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:07.419
are not only having a positive impact,

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:10.387
but having a lasting impact as well.

00:08:10.387 --> 00:08:13.779
And the research shows 
that the best programs

00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:15.854
address six key areas:

00:08:15.854 --> 00:08:19.917
The first is the influence of family, 
friends and relationships.

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:23.381
The second is media and celebrity culture,

00:08:23.381 --> 00:08:25.433
then how to handle teasing and bullying,

00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:27.425
the way we compete and compare with
one another

00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:28.962
based on looks,

00:08:28.962 --> 00:08:30.712
talking about appearance — some people

00:08:30.712 --> 00:08:33.218
call this "body talk" or "fat talk" —

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:35.693
and finally, the foundations of respecting

00:08:35.693 --> 00:08:37.467
and looking after yourself.

00:08:37.467 --> 00:08:39.940
These six things are crucial starting points

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.831
for anyone serious about delivering

00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:45.768
body-confidence education that works.

00:08:45.768 --> 00:08:48.074
An education is critical,

00:08:48.074 --> 00:08:49.895
but tackling this problem is going

00:08:49.895 --> 00:08:52.665
to require each and everyone of us

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:55.255
to step up and be better role models

00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:58.233
for the women and girls in our own lives.

00:08:58.233 --> 00:09:00.166
Challenging the status quo of how

00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:03.170
women are seen and talked about in
our own circles.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.212
It is not okay that we judge the contribution

00:09:07.212 --> 00:09:10.370
of our politicians by their haircuts

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.099
or the size of their breasts,

00:09:12.099 --> 00:09:15.464
or to infer that the determination or the success

00:09:15.464 --> 00:09:18.697
of an Olympian is down 
to her not being a looker.

00:09:18.697 --> 00:09:21.803
We need to start judging people by what they do,

00:09:21.803 --> 00:09:24.354
not what they look like.

00:09:24.354 --> 00:09:28.718
We can all start by taking responsibility 
for the types of pictures

00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:30.361
and comments that we post

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:32.548
on our own social networks.

00:09:32.548 --> 00:09:36.777
We can compliment people based on 
their effort

00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:38.180
and their actions

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.861
and not on their appearance.

00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:42.375
And let me ask you,

00:09:42.375 --> 00:09:43.663
when was the last time that you

00:09:43.663 --> 00:09:45.519
kissed a mirror?

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.812
Ultimately, we need to work together

00:09:47.812 --> 00:09:50.236
as communities, as governments

00:09:50.236 --> 00:09:54.701
and as businesses to really change
this culture of ours

00:09:54.701 --> 00:09:59.306
so that our kids grow up valuing their 
whole selves,

00:09:59.306 --> 00:10:03.969
valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.

00:10:03.969 --> 00:10:06.765
We need to put the people that are
making a real difference

00:10:06.765 --> 00:10:10.173
on our pedestals, making a difference

00:10:10.173 --> 00:10:12.153
in the real world.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.863
Giving them the airtime, because only then

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:16.728
will we create a different world.

00:10:16.728 --> 00:10:20.057
A world where our kids are free to become

00:10:20.057 --> 00:10:23.302
the best versions of themselves,

00:10:23.302 --> 00:10:25.248
where the way they think they look

00:10:25.248 --> 00:10:27.889
never holds them back from being
who they are

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:30.835
or achieving what they want in life.

00:10:30.835 --> 00:10:35.053
Think about what this might mean 
for someone in your life.

00:10:35.053 --> 00:10:36.551
Who have you got in mind?

00:10:36.551 --> 00:10:37.956
Is it your wife?

00:10:37.956 --> 00:10:39.344
Your sister?

00:10:39.344 --> 00:10:40.993
Your daughter?

00:10:40.993 --> 00:10:42.266
Your niece?

00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:45.329
Your friend? It could just be the woman 
a couple of seats away

00:10:45.329 --> 00:10:46.624
from you today.

00:10:46.624 --> 00:10:49.314
What would it mean for her

00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:53.072
if she were freed from that voice

00:10:53.072 --> 00:10:56.106
of her inner critic, nagging her to have

00:10:56.106 --> 00:10:58.897
longer legs, thinner thighs, smaller stomach,

00:10:58.897 --> 00:11:00.332
shorter feet?

00:11:00.332 --> 00:11:03.700
What could it mean for her if we overcame this

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.213
and unlocked her potential in that way?

00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:12.035
Right now, our culture's obsession

00:11:12.035 --> 00:11:15.390
with image is holding us all back.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.917
But let's show our kids the truth.

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:19.932
Let's show them that the way you look

00:11:19.932 --> 00:11:23.647
is just one part of your identity

00:11:23.647 --> 00:11:26.360
and that the truth is we love them

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.931
for who they are

00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:29.898
and what they do

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:32.598
and how they make us feel.

00:11:32.598 --> 00:11:36.683
Let's build self-esteem into our school curriculums.

00:11:36.683 --> 00:11:39.343
Let's each and every one of us change the way

00:11:39.343 --> 00:11:42.778
we talk and compare ourselves to other people.

00:11:42.778 --> 00:11:45.508
And let's work together as communities,

00:11:45.508 --> 00:11:48.302
from grassroots to governments,

00:11:48.302 --> 00:11:50.477
so that the happy little one-year-olds

00:11:50.477 --> 00:11:53.354
of today become the confident

00:11:53.354 --> 00:11:55.969
changemakers of tomorrow.

00:11:55.969 --> 00:11:57.986
Let's do this.

00:11:57.986 --> 00:11:59.877
(Applause)
