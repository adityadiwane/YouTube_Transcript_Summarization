00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:14.776
The 2011 Arab Spring

00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:16.579
captured the attention of the world.

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.228
It also captured the attention

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:20.605
of authoritarian governments in other countries,

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:23.568
who were worried that revolution would spread.

00:00:23.568 --> 00:00:25.645
To respond, they ramped up surveillance

00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:28.741
of activists, journalists and dissidents

00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:30.695
who they feared would inspire revolution

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:32.530
in their own countries.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.575
One prominent Bahraini activist,

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:36.685
who was arrested and tortured by his government,

00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:38.410
has said that the interrogators showed him

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.280
transcripts of his telephone calls

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.088
and text messages.

00:00:42.088 --> 00:00:43.744
Of course, it's no secret

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:46.940
that governments are able to intercept
telephone calls and text messages.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.312
It's for that reason that many activists

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:51.238
specifically avoid using the telephone.

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:53.586
Instead, they use tools like Skype,

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.106
which they think are immune to interception.

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:57.878
They're wrong.

00:00:57.878 --> 00:01:00.604
There have now been over the last few years

00:01:00.604 --> 00:01:02.250
an industry of companies

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.504
who provide surveillance technology to governments,

00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:07.865
specifically technology that
allows those governments

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:09.518
to hack into the computers

00:01:09.518 --> 00:01:11.113
of surveillance targets.

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.953
Rather than intercepting the communications 
as they go over the wire,

00:01:13.953 --> 00:01:16.220
instead they now hack into your computer,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.222
enable your webcam, enable your microphone,

00:01:18.222 --> 00:01:20.679
and steal documents from your computer.

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.512
When the government of Egypt fell in 2011,

00:01:23.512 --> 00:01:26.913
activists raided the office of the secret police,

00:01:26.913 --> 00:01:28.901
and among the many documents they found

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:31.218
was this document by the Gamma Corporation,

00:01:31.218 --> 00:01:33.019
by Gamma International.

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:34.676
Gamma is a German company

00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:36.160
that manufactures surveillance software

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.317
and sells it only to governments.

00:01:38.317 --> 00:01:40.324
It's important to note that most governments

00:01:40.324 --> 00:01:42.390
don't really have the in-house capabilities

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.855
to develop this software.

00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:45.474
Smaller ones don't have the resources

00:01:45.474 --> 00:01:47.250
or the expertise,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.557
and so there's this market of Western companies

00:01:50.557 --> 00:01:52.524
who are happy to supply them with the tools

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:54.242
and techniques for a price.

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:56.848
Gamma is just one of these companies.

00:01:56.848 --> 00:01:59.756
I should note also that Gamma never actually sold

00:01:59.756 --> 00:02:01.653
their software to the Egyptian government.

00:02:01.653 --> 00:02:04.250
They'd sent them an invoice for a sale,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.892
but the Egyptians never bought it.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.616
Instead, apparently, the Egyptian government

00:02:07.616 --> 00:02:10.249
used a free demo version of Gamma's software.

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.024
(Laughter)

00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:16.522
So this screenshot is from a sales video

00:02:16.522 --> 00:02:18.087
that Gamma produced.

00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:20.070
Really, they're just emphasizing

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.721
in a relatively slick presentation

00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:23.914
the fact that the police can sort of sit

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:25.364
in an air-conditioned office

00:02:25.364 --> 00:02:26.775
and remotely monitor someone

00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:28.950
without them having any idea that it's going on.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.985
You know, your webcam light won't turn on.

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:34.339
There's nothing to indicate that
the microphone is enabled.

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.674
This is the managing director
of Gamma International.

00:02:37.674 --> 00:02:39.535
His name is Martin Muench.

00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:42.466
There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist.

00:02:42.466 --> 00:02:44.318
This is perhaps my favorite.

00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:46.462
I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam.

00:02:46.462 --> 00:02:48.130
You can see there's a little sticker

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.023
that's placed over his camera.

00:02:50.023 --> 00:02:52.556
He knows what kind of surveillance is possible,

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:54.362
and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used

00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:55.964
against him.

00:02:55.964 --> 00:02:57.888
Muench has said that he intends

00:02:57.888 --> 00:02:59.552
for his software to be used

00:02:59.552 --> 00:03:02.535
to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles.

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:04.331
Of course, he's also acknowledged that once

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.486
the software has been sold to governments,

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:10.311
he has no way of knowing how it can be used.

00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:12.161
Gamma's software has been located on servers

00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:13.817
in countries around the world,

00:03:13.817 --> 00:03:16.208
many with really atrocious track records

00:03:16.208 --> 00:03:17.769
and human rights violations.

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.164
They really are selling their
software around the world.

00:03:21.164 --> 00:03:23.465
Gamma is not the only company in the business.

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.216
As I said, it's a $5 billion industry.

00:03:26.216 --> 00:03:29.055
One of the other big guys in the industry

00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:31.450
is an Italian company called Hacking Team.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.175
Now, Hacking Team has what is probably

00:03:33.175 --> 00:03:35.145
the slickest presentation.

00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:38.173
The video they've produced is very sexy,

00:03:38.173 --> 00:03:39.821
and so I'm going to play you a clip

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:41.135
just so you can get a feel

00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:42.966
both for the capabilities of the software

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:44.872
but also how it's marketed

00:03:44.872 --> 00:03:46.640
to their government clients.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.156
(Video) Narrator: You want to look 
through your target's eyes.

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:52.063
(Music)

00:03:52.063 --> 00:03:55.065
You have to hack your target.

00:03:55.065 --> 00:04:01.381
["While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders"]

00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:04.304
You have to hit many different platforms.

00:04:04.304 --> 00:04:08.184
["Windows, OS X, iOS, Android,
Blackberry, Symbian, Linux"]

00:04:08.184 --> 00:04:10.652
You have to overcome encryption

00:04:10.652 --> 00:04:13.549
and capture relevant data.

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.108
[Skype &amp; encrypted calls, target location, 
messaging, relationships,

00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:21.280
web browsing, audio &amp; video"]

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.440
Being stealth and untraceable.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.714
["Immune to any protection system
Hidden collection infrastructure"]

00:04:28.714 --> 00:04:32.819
Deployed all over your country.

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:37.353
["Up to hundreds of thousands of targets
Managed from a single spot"]

00:04:37.353 --> 00:04:40.675
Exactly what we do.

00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:42.938
Christopher Soghoian: So, it
would be funny if it wasn't true,

00:04:42.938 --> 00:04:44.726
but, in fact, Hacking Team's software

00:04:44.726 --> 00:04:47.674
is being sold to governments around the world.

00:04:47.674 --> 00:04:49.426
Last year we learned, for example,

00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:53.474
that it's been used to target Moroccan 
journalists by the Moroccan government.

00:04:53.474 --> 00:04:56.018
Many, many countries it's been found in.

00:04:56.018 --> 00:04:59.142
So, Hacking Team has also been actively courting

00:04:59.142 --> 00:05:01.485
the U.S. law enforcement market.

00:05:01.485 --> 00:05:03.768
In the last year or so, the company

00:05:03.768 --> 00:05:08.544
has opened a sales office in Maryland.

00:05:08.544 --> 00:05:10.658
The company has also hired a spokesperson.

00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:12.195
They've been attending

00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:13.792
surveillance industry conferences

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.807
where law enforcement officials show up.

00:05:15.807 --> 00:05:17.641
They've spoken at the conferences.

00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:19.229
What I thought was most fascinating was

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.330
they've actually paid for the coffee break

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.270
at one of the law enforcement conferences

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.763
earlier this year.

00:05:24.763 --> 00:05:26.862
I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team

00:05:26.862 --> 00:05:29.587
has sold their technology in the United States,

00:05:29.587 --> 00:05:31.558
but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it,

00:05:31.558 --> 00:05:34.733
it isn't because they haven't been trying hard.

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:36.775
So as I said before,

00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:38.695
governments that don't really have the resources

00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:40.291
to build their own tools will buy

00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:41.701
off-the-shelf surveillance software,

00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:43.089
and so for that reason,

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.805
you see that the government of, say, Tunisia,

00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:47.993
might use the same software
as the government of Germany.

00:05:47.993 --> 00:05:50.265
They're all buying off-the-shelf stuff.

00:05:50.265 --> 00:05:52.464
The Federal Bureau of
Investigation in the United States

00:05:52.464 --> 00:05:55.226
does have the budget to build
their own surveillance technology,

00:05:55.226 --> 00:05:57.007
and so for several years, I've been trying

00:05:57.007 --> 00:05:59.398
to figure out if and how the FBI

00:05:59.398 --> 00:06:02.296
is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets.

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:05.449
My friends at an organization called
the Electronic Frontier Foundation --

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.761
they're a civil society group —

00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:10.253
obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI

00:06:10.253 --> 00:06:13.101
detailing their next generation
of surveillance technologies.

00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:15.735
Most of these documents were heavily redacted,

00:06:15.735 --> 00:06:18.551
but what you can see from the slides,

00:06:18.551 --> 00:06:20.513
if I zoom in, is this term:

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:22.333
Remote Operations Unit.

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:24.567
Now, when I first looked into this,

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:26.637
I'd never heard of this unit before.

00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:28.939
I've been studying surveillance
for more than six years.

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:30.224
I'd never heard of it.

00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:32.187
And so I went online and I did some research,

00:06:32.187 --> 00:06:34.312
and ultimately I hit the mother lode

00:06:34.312 --> 00:06:35.946
when I went to LinkedIn,

00:06:35.946 --> 00:06:38.515
the social networking site for job seekers.

00:06:38.515 --> 00:06:41.428
There were lots of former
U.S. government contractors

00:06:41.428 --> 00:06:42.815
who had at one point worked

00:06:42.815 --> 00:06:44.124
for the Remote Operating Unit,

00:06:44.124 --> 00:06:47.538
and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs

00:06:47.538 --> 00:06:49.569
what they had done in their former job.

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:51.791
(Laughter)

00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:53.778
So I took this information

00:06:53.778 --> 00:06:57.522
and I gave it to a journalist that I know
and trust at the Wall Street Journal,

00:06:57.522 --> 00:06:59.323
and she was able to contact several other

00:06:59.323 --> 00:07:01.077
former law enforcement officials

00:07:01.077 --> 00:07:02.883
who spoke on background and confirmed

00:07:02.883 --> 00:07:06.242
that yes, in fact, the FBI has a dedicated team

00:07:06.242 --> 00:07:08.378
that does nothing but hack into the computers

00:07:08.378 --> 00:07:09.904
of surveillance targets.

00:07:09.904 --> 00:07:11.792
Like Gamma and Hacking Team,

00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:13.909
the FBI also has the capability

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:17.303
to remotely activate webcams, microphones,

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.505
steal documents, get web browsing information,

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.189
the works.

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:23.011
There's sort of a big problem

00:07:23.011 --> 00:07:24.611
with governments going into hacking,

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:27.130
and that's that terrorists, pedophiles,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.041
drug dealers, journalists and human rights activists

00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:32.312
all use the same kinds of computers.

00:07:32.312 --> 00:07:34.359
There's no drug dealer phone

00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:36.325
and there's no journalist laptop.

00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:38.559
We all use the same technology,

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:40.453
and what that means then is that for governments

00:07:40.453 --> 00:07:42.570
to have the capability to hack into the computers

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.269
of the real bad guys,

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:46.245
they also have to have the capability

00:07:46.245 --> 00:07:48.430
to hack into our devices too.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.182
So governments around the world

00:07:50.182 --> 00:07:51.643
have been embracing this technology.

00:07:51.643 --> 00:07:53.248
They've been embracing hacking

00:07:53.248 --> 00:07:55.068
as a law enforcement technique,

00:07:55.068 --> 00:07:57.018
but without any real debate.

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.837
In the United States, where I live,

00:07:58.837 --> 00:08:00.662
there have been no congressional hearings.

00:08:00.662 --> 00:08:02.623
There's no law that's been passed

00:08:02.623 --> 00:08:04.696
specifically authorizing this technique,

00:08:04.696 --> 00:08:07.365
and because of its power and potential for abuse,

00:08:07.365 --> 00:08:10.312
