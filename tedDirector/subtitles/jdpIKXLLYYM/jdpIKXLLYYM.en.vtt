00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
What I thought I would do

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
is I would start with a simple request.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I'd like all of you

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
to pause for a moment,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
you wretched weaklings,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and take stock of your miserable existence.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
(Laughter)

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Now that was the advice

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
in the fifth century.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
when I turned 40.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior --

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
I was eating too much, I was drinking too much,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
I was working too hard

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and I was neglecting the family.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And I decided that I would try

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and turn my life around.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
In particular, I decided

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I would try to address the thorny issue

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
of work-life balance.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
So I stepped back from the workforce,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
and I spent a year at home

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
with my wife and four young children.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
But all I learned about work-life balance

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
from that year

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
was that I found it quite easy

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
to balance work and life

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
when I didn't have any work.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.260
(Laughter)

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Not a very useful skill,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
especially when the money runs out.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
So I went back to work,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and I've spent these seven years since

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
struggling with, studying

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
and writing about work-life balance.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And I have four observations

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
I'd like to share with you today.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
The first is:

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
if society's to make any progress on this issue,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
we need an honest debate.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
But the trouble is

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
so many people talk so much rubbish

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
about work-life balance.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
All the discussions about flexi-time

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
or dress-down Fridays

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
or paternity leave

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
only serve to mask the core issue,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
which is

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
that certain job and career choices

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
are fundamentally incompatible

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
with being meaningfully engaged

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
on a day-to-day basis

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
with a young family.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Now the first step in solving any problem

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And the reality of the society that we're in

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
is there are thousands and thousands

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
of people out there

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.260
leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
where they work long, hard hours

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
at jobs they hate

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
to enable them to buy things they don't need

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
to impress people they don't like.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
(Laughter)

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
(Applause)

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.260
It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
(Laughter)

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
The second observation I'd like to make

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
is we need to face the truth

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
that governments and corporations

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
aren't going to solve this issue for us.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
We should stop looking outside.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
It's up to us as individuals

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
to take control and responsibility

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
for the type of lives that we want to lead.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
If you don't design your life,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
someone else will design it for you,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and you may just not like

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
their idea of balance.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
It's particularly important --

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired --

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
it's particularly important

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
that you never put the quality of your life

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
in the hands of a commercial corporation.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies --

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
(Laughter)

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
I'm talking about all companies.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Because commercial companies

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
are inherently designed

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
to get as much out of you [as]

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
they can get away with.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
It's in their nature; it's in their DNA;

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
it's what they do --

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
even the good, well-intentioned companies.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
On the one hand,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
putting childcare facilities in the workplace

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
is wonderful and enlightened.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
On the other hand, it's a nightmare --

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
it just means you spend more time at the bloody office.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
We have to be responsible

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
for setting and enforcing

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
the boundaries that we want in our life.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
The third observation is

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
we have to be careful

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
with the time frame that we choose

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
upon which to judge our balance.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Before I went back to work

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
after my year at home,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
I sat down

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
and I wrote out

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
a detailed, step-by-step description

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
of the ideal balanced day

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
that I aspired to.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
And it went like this:

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
wake up well rested

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
after a good night's sleep.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Have sex.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Walk the dog.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Have breakfast with my wife and children.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Have sex again.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
(Laughter)

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Do three hours' work.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Do another three hours' work.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Drive home for dinner

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
with my wife and kids.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Meditate for half an hour.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Have sex.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Walk the dog. Have sex again.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
Go to bed.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.260
(Applause)

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
How often do you think I have that day?

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
(Laughter)

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
We need to be realistic.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
You can't do it all in one day.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
We need to elongate the time frame

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
upon which we judge the balance in our life,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
but we need to elongate it

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
without falling into the trap

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
of the "I'll have a life when I retire,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
when my kids have left home,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
I've got no mates or interests left."

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
(Laughter)

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
There's got to be a middle way.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
A fourth observation:

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
We need to approach balance

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
in a balanced way.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
A friend came to see me last year --

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
and said, "Nigel, I've read your book.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
It's totally dominated by work.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
All of my relationships have failed.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
There's nothing in my life

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
apart from my work.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
So I joined a gym."

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
(Laughter)

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Now I don't mean to mock,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.260
but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
isn't more balanced; it's more fit.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
(Laughter)

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Lovely though physical exercise may be,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
there are other parts to life --

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side;

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
there's the spiritual side.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And to be balanced,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
I believe we have to attend

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
to all of those areas --

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
not just do 50 stomach crunches.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
Now that can be daunting.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
You want me to go to church and call my mother."

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And I understand.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
I truly understand how that can be daunting.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
gave me a new perspective.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
called me up at the office

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" --

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Harry -- "up from school."

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
So I left work an hour early that afternoon

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
and picked Harry up at the school gates.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
We walked down to the local park,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
messed around on the swings, played some silly games.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
and we shared a pizza for two,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
then walked down the hill to our home,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and I gave him his bath

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
and put him in his Batman pajamas.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
I then read him a chapter

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach."

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
I then put him to bed, tucked him in,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate,"

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
and walked out of his bedroom.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
As I was walking out of his bedroom,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?"

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
He went, "Dad, this has been the best day

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
of my life, ever."

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
I hadn't done anything,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
Now my point is

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
the small things matter.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
Being more balanced

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
With the smallest investment

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
in the right places,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
you can radically transform the quality of your relationships

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and the quality of your life.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
Moreover, I think,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
it can transform society.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Because if enough people do it,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
we can change society's definition of success

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
away from the moronically simplistic notion

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.260
that the person with the most money when he dies wins,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
to a more thoughtful and balanced definition

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.260
of what a life well lived looks like.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And that, I think,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
is an idea worth spreading.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
