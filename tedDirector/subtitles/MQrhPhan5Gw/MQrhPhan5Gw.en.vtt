00:00:13.116 --> 00:00:17.227
What stands between Africa's current
prostrate condition

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:22.088
and a future of prosperity and abundance
for its long-suffering populations?

00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:24.156
One word:

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:25.902
knowledge.

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:31.316
If Africa is to become a continent
that offers the best life for humans,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.298
it must become a knowledge society

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:35.590
immediately.

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:40.697
This is what I have called
"Africa's knowledge imperative."

00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:45.754
Our universities must reduce emphasis
on producing manpower

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:48.309
for running our civil society,

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.099
our economy

00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:52.614
and our political institutions.

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:57.067
They should be dedicated mainly
to knowledge production.

00:00:58.114 --> 00:01:02.044
What sense is there
in producing civil engineers

00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:05.695
who are not supported
by soil scientists and geologists,

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.007
who make it their business
to create knowledge about our soil

00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:11.451
and our rocks?

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:15.636
What use is there in producing lawyers

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.019
without juries who produce knowledge

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:24.134
of the underlying philosophical
foundations of the legal system?

00:01:25.642 --> 00:01:27.706
We must seek knowledge.

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:31.532
We must approach the matter of knowledge

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:34.421
with a maniacal commitment,

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:36.599
without let or hindrance.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.159
Though we must seek knowledge
to solve problems we know of,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.116
we must also seek knowledge

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.116
when there is no problem in view --

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:50.376
especially when there
is no problem in view.

00:01:51.263 --> 00:01:56.415
We must seek to know as much
of what there is to know of all things,

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.718
limited only by the insufficiency
of our human nature,

00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:03.286
and not only when the need arises.

00:02:04.534 --> 00:02:08.649
Those who do not seek knowledge
when it is not needed

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:13.139
will not have it when they must have it.

00:02:14.777 --> 00:02:18.872
The biggest crisis in Africa today
is the crisis of knowledge:

00:02:18.896 --> 00:02:20.916
how to produce it,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.571
how to manage it,

00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:25.303
and how to deploy it effectively.

00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:30.474
For instance, Africa does not
have a water crisis.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.218
It has a knowledge crisis
regarding its water,

00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:37.738
where and what types it is,

00:02:37.762 --> 00:02:43.766
how it can be tapped and made available
where and when needed to all and sundry.

00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:47.803
How does a continent that is home

00:02:47.827 --> 00:02:50.891
to some of the largest
bodies of water in the world --

00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:53.026
the Nile,

00:02:53.587 --> 00:02:54.828
the Niger,

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:56.676
the Congo,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.250
the Zambezi

00:02:58.274 --> 00:02:59.898
and the Orange Rivers --

00:03:00.553 --> 00:03:02.996
be said to have a water crisis,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.067
including in countries

00:03:05.091 --> 00:03:06.733
where those rivers are?

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:10.308
And that is only surface water.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:15.006
While we wrongly dissipate our energies
fighting the wrong crises,

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.712
all those who invest in knowledge about us

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:22.760
are busy figuring out
how to pipe water from Libya's aquifers

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:25.729
to quench Europe's thirst.

00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:29.184
Such is our knowledge
of our water resources

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.340
that many of our countries have given up

00:03:31.364 --> 00:03:34.101
on making potable water a routine presence

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:35.884
in the lives of Africans,

00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:37.563
rich or poor,

00:03:37.587 --> 00:03:39.042
high and low,

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:40.496
rural and urban.

00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:44.722
We eagerly accept
what the merchants of misery

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:48.269
and the global African Studies
safari professoriat

00:03:48.293 --> 00:03:50.249
and their aid-addled,

00:03:50.273 --> 00:03:53.122
autonomy-fearing African minions

00:03:53.146 --> 00:03:56.384
in government, universities
and civil society

00:03:56.408 --> 00:04:00.544
tell us regarding how nature
has been to stinting towards Africa

00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:04.344
when it comes to the distribution
of water resources in the world.

00:04:04.947 --> 00:04:08.703
We are content to run our cities
and rural dwellings alike

00:04:08.727 --> 00:04:10.101
on boreholes.

00:04:12.213 --> 00:04:16.618
How does one run metropolises
on boreholes and wells?

00:04:19.055 --> 00:04:21.099
Does Africa have a food crisis?

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.314
Again, the answer is no.

00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:30.656
It is yet another knowledge crisis
regarding Africa's agricultural resources,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.700
what and where they are,

00:04:32.724 --> 00:04:37.237
and how they can be best managed
to make Africans live more lives

00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:38.610
that are worth living.

00:04:39.907 --> 00:04:42.255
Otherwise, how does one explain the fact

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:45.545
that geography puts the source
of the River Nile in Ethiopia,

00:04:46.572 --> 00:04:49.964
and its people cannot
have water for their lives?

00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:54.617
And the same geography
puts California in the desert,

00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:56.312
but it is a breadbasket.

00:04:57.578 --> 00:05:00.408
The difference, obviously,
is not geography.

00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:02.742
It is knowledge.

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:05.678
Colorado's aquifers

00:05:05.702 --> 00:05:07.842
grow California's pistachios.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.078
Why can't Libya's aquifers

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:13.729
grow sorghum in northern Nigeria?

00:05:14.882 --> 00:05:17.715
Why does Nigeria not aspire

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:19.143
to feed the world,

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:21.095
not just itself?

00:05:21.797 --> 00:05:25.628
If Africa's land is so poor,
as we are often told,

00:05:25.652 --> 00:05:27.860
why are outsiders,

00:05:27.884 --> 00:05:32.049
from the United Arab Emirates
all the way to South Korea,

00:05:32.073 --> 00:05:35.325
buying up vast acreages of our land,

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.517
to grow food, no less,

00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:39.238
to feed their people

00:05:39.262 --> 00:05:42.884
in lands that are truly more
geographically stinting?

00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.296
The new landowners are not planning
to import new topsoil

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.222
to make their African
acquisitions more arable.

00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:55.220
Again, a singular instance
of knowledge deficiency.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.604
In the 19th century,

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.890
our predecessors,

00:06:00.914 --> 00:06:04.258
just years removed from the ravages
of slavery and the slave trade,

00:06:05.837 --> 00:06:09.028
were exploring the Niger and Congo Rivers

00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:13.101
with a view to turning Africa's resources
to the advantage of its people

00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:15.019
and to the rest of humanity,

00:06:15.513 --> 00:06:19.616
and their 20th-century successors
were dreaming of harnessing

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.848
the powers of the River Congo

00:06:21.872 --> 00:06:23.820
to light up the whole continent.

00:06:24.642 --> 00:06:28.078
Now only buccaneer capitalists from Europe

00:06:28.102 --> 00:06:30.478
are scheming of doing the same,

00:06:30.502 --> 00:06:34.014
but for exports to Europe
and South Africa.

00:06:34.736 --> 00:06:36.380
And they are even suggesting

00:06:36.404 --> 00:06:38.990
that Congolese may not
benefit from this scheme,

00:06:39.014 --> 00:06:43.005
because, according to them,
Congolese communities are too small

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:45.568
to make providing them with electricity

00:06:46.123 --> 00:06:48.336
a viable concern.

00:06:50.174 --> 00:06:51.953
The solution?

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:54.921
Africa must become a knowledge society,

00:06:54.945 --> 00:06:58.110
a defining characteristic
of the modern age.

00:06:58.866 --> 00:07:04.175
We neither are, nor are we
on the path to becoming,

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:05.661
a knowledge society.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.022
Things have not always been this way

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:13.631
when it comes to knowledge
production and Africa.

00:07:13.655 --> 00:07:18.731
In antiquity, the world went to Africa
for intellectual enrichment.

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:22.458
There were celebrated centers of learning,

00:07:22.482 --> 00:07:26.562
attracting questers from all parts
of the then-known world,

00:07:26.586 --> 00:07:28.981
seeking knowledge about that world.

00:07:29.804 --> 00:07:33.439
What happened then
has implications for our present.

00:07:33.968 --> 00:07:35.786
For example,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:42.476
how Roman Africa managed the relationship
between settlers and natives

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.092
between the second and fourth
centuries of our era

00:07:46.116 --> 00:07:49.108
might have something to teach us
when it comes to confronting

00:07:49.132 --> 00:07:52.540
not-too-dissimilar problems
at the present time.

00:07:53.345 --> 00:07:57.115
But how many classics departments
do we have in our universities?

00:07:58.423 --> 00:08:00.946
Because we do not invest in knowledge,

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.027
people come to Africa now

00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.577
not as a place of intellectual enrichment,

00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:10.507
but as a place where they sate
their thirst for exotica.

00:08:12.538 --> 00:08:14.982
Yet for the last half-millennium,

00:08:15.544 --> 00:08:19.033
Africa has been hemorrhaging
and exporting knowledge

00:08:19.057 --> 00:08:20.464
to the rest of the world.

00:08:21.273 --> 00:08:25.962
Regardless of the popular description
of it as a trade in bodies,

00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:29.763
the European trans-Atlantic
slave trade and slavery

00:08:29.787 --> 00:08:33.208
was one of the most radical
and longest programs

00:08:33.232 --> 00:08:35.772
of African brains export in history.

00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:41.247
American slave owners may have pretended
that Africans were mere brutes,

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.573
beasts of burden,

00:08:43.597 --> 00:08:47.542
almost as inert and dumb
as other farm implements

00:08:47.566 --> 00:08:50.422
they classified them with
in their ledgers.

00:08:51.052 --> 00:08:52.361
And that's what they did.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.539
The enslaved Africans, on the other hand,

00:08:55.563 --> 00:08:58.635
knew their were embodiments of knowledge.

00:08:58.659 --> 00:09:01.199
They were smiths, they were poets,

00:09:01.223 --> 00:09:04.546
they were political counselors,
they were princes and princesses,

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.261
they were mythologists,
they were herbologists,

00:09:09.689 --> 00:09:11.182
they were chefs.

00:09:11.206 --> 00:09:12.659
The list is endless.

00:09:13.367 --> 00:09:15.861
They, to take a single example,

00:09:15.885 --> 00:09:18.881
brought the knowledge of rice cultivation

00:09:18.905 --> 00:09:20.395
to the American South.

00:09:22.101 --> 00:09:26.576
They created some of the most
original civilizational elements

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.442
for which the United States
is now celebrated.

00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:33.337
They deployed their knowledge,
for the most part,

00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:34.881
without compensation.

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:39.375
For the last half-millennium,
beginning with the slave trade,

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:42.045
Africa has been exporting brains

00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:46.791
while simultaneously breaking
the chains of knowledge transmission

00:09:46.815 --> 00:09:48.545
on the continent itself,

00:09:48.569 --> 00:09:52.716
with dire consequences for the systems
of knowledge production in Africa.

00:09:53.664 --> 00:09:58.234
Successive generations are cut off
from the intellectual production

00:09:58.258 --> 00:09:59.475
of their predecessors.

00:10:00.363 --> 00:10:03.406
We keep producing for external markets

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.466
while beggaring our own internal needs.

00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.739
At present,

00:10:08.763 --> 00:10:11.366
much of the best knowledge about Africa

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.698
is neither produced nor housed there,

00:10:14.722 --> 00:10:17.795
even when it is produced by Africans.

00:10:18.634 --> 00:10:21.095
Because we are dominated
by immediate needs

00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:24.626
and relevant solutions when it comes
to what we should know,

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.175
we are happy to hand over to others

00:10:27.199 --> 00:10:29.659
the responsibility to produce knowledge,

00:10:29.683 --> 00:10:33.961
including knowledge about, of and for us,

00:10:33.985 --> 00:10:36.250
and to do so far away from us.

00:10:36.853 --> 00:10:39.996
We are ever eager to consume knowledge

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.419
and have but a mere portion of it

00:10:42.443 --> 00:10:46.620
without any anxiety about
ownership and location.

00:10:47.707 --> 00:10:51.310
African universities
are now all too content

00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:54.860
to have e-connections
with libraries elsewhere,

00:10:54.884 --> 00:10:57.758
having given up ambitions
on building libraries

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:01.473
to which the world would come
for intellectual edification.

00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:06.609
Control over who decides
what should be stocked on our shelves

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:10.273
and how access to collections
should be determined

00:11:10.297 --> 00:11:14.128
are made to rest on our trust
in our partners' good faith

00:11:14.152 --> 00:11:16.884
that they will not abandon us
down the road.

00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:20.170
This must change.

00:11:21.093 --> 00:11:24.614
Africa must become
a place of knowledge again.

00:11:25.433 --> 00:11:30.318
Knowledge production
actually expands the economy.

00:11:31.262 --> 00:11:34.337
Take archaeological digs, for instance,

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.516
and their impact on tourism.

00:11:37.527 --> 00:11:40.907
Our desires to unearth our antiquity,

00:11:40.931 --> 00:11:45.704
especially those remote times
of which we have no written records,

00:11:45.728 --> 00:11:50.742
requires investment in archaeology
and related disciplines,

00:11:50.766 --> 00:11:52.954
e.g., paleoanthropology.

00:11:53.715 --> 00:11:57.533
Yet, although it is our past
we seek to know,

00:11:57.557 --> 00:11:59.279
by sheer serendipity,

00:11:59.935 --> 00:12:03.800
archaeology may shed light
on the global human experience

00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:05.987
and yield economic payoffs

00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:09.247
that were no part
of the original reasons for digging.

00:12:10.969 --> 00:12:16.916
We must find a way to make knowledge
and its production sexy and rewarding;

00:12:17.985 --> 00:12:20.933
rewarding, not in the crass
sense of moneymaking

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.526
but in terms of making it worthwhile
to indulge in the pursuit of knowledge,

00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:28.495
support the existence

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:31.696
of knowledge-producing
groups and intellectuals,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.895
ensuring that the continent

00:12:35.499 --> 00:12:38.705
becomes the immediate locus
of knowledge production,

00:12:38.729 --> 00:12:40.662
distribution and consumption,

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:43.880
and that instead of having
its depositories

00:12:43.904 --> 00:12:45.897
beyond Africa's boundaries,

00:12:45.921 --> 00:12:49.184
people once more come
from the rest of the world,

00:12:49.706 --> 00:12:53.175
even if in virtual space,
to learn from us.

00:12:54.037 --> 00:12:59.911
All this we do as custodians
on behalf of common humanity.

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:04.731
Creating a knowledge society in Africa,

00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:11.430
for me, would be one way to celebrate
and simultaneously enhance diversity

00:13:11.454 --> 00:13:16.308
by infinitely enriching it with material
and additional artifacts --

00:13:16.887 --> 00:13:18.996
artifacts that we furnish

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.995
by our strivings

00:13:21.019 --> 00:13:22.432
in the knowledge field.

00:13:23.047 --> 00:13:24.453
Thank you very much.

00:13:24.477 --> 00:13:28.269
