00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:22.147
How many of you have seen
the Alfred Hitchcock film "The Birds"?

00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:24.187
Any of you get really freaked out by that?

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:26.251
You might want to leave now.

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:27.306
(Laughter)

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.333
So this is a vending machine for crows.

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:31.850
Over the past few days,
many of you have been asking,

00:00:31.874 --> 00:00:34.864
"How did you come to this?
How did you get started doing this?"

00:00:34.888 --> 00:00:36.657
It started, as with many great ideas,

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:38.717
or many ideas you can't
get rid of, anyway,

00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:39.896
at a cocktail party.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.130
About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail
party with a friend of mine.

00:00:43.154 --> 00:00:46.043
We were sitting there,
and he was complaining about the crows

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.438
that were all over his yard
and making a big mess.

00:00:48.462 --> 00:00:51.164
And he was telling me
we ought to eradicate these things,

00:00:51.188 --> 00:00:53.160
kill them, because they're making a mess.

00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:54.335
I said that was stupid,

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.932
maybe we should just train them
to do something useful.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.487
And he said that was impossible.

00:00:58.511 --> 00:01:01.883
And I'm sure I'm in good company
in finding that tremendously annoying,

00:01:01.907 --> 00:01:03.787
when someone tells you it's impossible.

00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:06.941
So I spent the next 10 years reading
about crows in my spare time.

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:09.741
(Laughter)

00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:11.962
And after 10 years of this, my wife said,

00:01:11.986 --> 00:01:14.606
"You've got to do this thing
you've been talking about,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.125
and build the vending machine."

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.300
So I did.

00:01:17.324 --> 00:01:19.769
But part of the reason
I found this interesting is,

00:01:19.793 --> 00:01:22.625
I started noticing that we're very
aware of all the species

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.444
that are going extinct on the planet

00:01:24.468 --> 00:01:26.537
as a result of human habitation expansion,

00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:29.506
and no one seems to be paying
attention to all the species

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.598
that are actually living;
they're surviving.

00:01:31.622 --> 00:01:34.347
And I'm talking specifically
about synanthropic species,

00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:37.049
which have adapted
specifically for human ecologies,

00:01:37.073 --> 00:01:40.436
species like rats
and cockroaches and crows.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.074
And as I started looking at them,
I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.

00:01:44.098 --> 00:01:46.490
They'd become extremely
adept at living with us.

00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:49.187
And in return, we just tried
to kill them all the time.

00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:50.306
(Laughter)

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.903
And in doing so, we were
breeding them for parasitism.

00:01:52.927 --> 00:01:56.888
We were giving them all sorts
of reasons to adapt new ways.

00:01:56.912 --> 00:01:59.670
So, for example, rats
are incredibly responsive breeders.

00:01:59.694 --> 00:02:02.713
And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried
to get rid of them knows,

00:02:02.737 --> 00:02:05.739
have become really immune
to the poisons that we're using.

00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:09.397
So I thought, let's build something
that's mutually beneficial;

00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.401
something that we can both benefit from,

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:14.444
and find some way to make
a new relationship with these species.

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.110
So I built the vending machine.

00:02:16.134 --> 00:02:19.204
But the story of the vending machine
is a little more interesting

00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:20.615
if you know more about crows.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.481
It turns out, crows aren't just
surviving with human beings;

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:24.746
they're actually thriving.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.607
They're found everywhere
on the planet except for the Arctic

00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:29.443
and the southern tip of South America.

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:32.158
And in all that area,
they're only rarely found breeding

00:02:32.182 --> 00:02:34.501
more than five kilometers
away from human beings.

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:37.275
So we may not think about them,
but they're always around.

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.943
And not surprisingly,
given the human population growth,

00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:42.943
more than half of the human population
is living in cities now.

00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:45.782
And out of those, nine-tenths
of the human growth population

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:46.964
is occurring in cities.

00:02:46.988 --> 00:02:49.161
We're seeing a population boom with crows.

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:51.230
So bird counts are indicating

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:54.402
that we might be seeing up to exponential
growth in their numbers.

00:02:54.426 --> 00:02:56.073
So that's no great surprise.

00:02:56.097 --> 00:02:58.590
But what was really interesting
to me was to find out

00:02:58.614 --> 00:03:01.437
that the birds were adapting
in a pretty unusual way.

00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:04.598
And I'll give you an example of that.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.440
This is Betty.
She's a New Caledonian crow.

00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:09.870
And these crows use sticks in the wild

00:03:09.894 --> 00:03:12.528
to get insects and whatnot
out of pieces of wood.

00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:15.218
Here, she's trying to get
a piece of meat out of a tube.

00:03:15.242 --> 00:03:16.885
But the researchers had a problem.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.457
They messed up and left
just a stick of wire in there.

00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:22.004
And she hadn't had the opportunity
to do this before.

00:03:22.028 --> 00:03:23.918
You see, it wasn't working very well.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.973
So she adapted.

00:03:27.117 --> 00:03:30.520
Now, this is completely unprompted;
she had never seen this done before.

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.556
No one taught her to bend this into a hook

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.361
or had shown her how it could happen.

00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:35.838
But she did it all on her own.

00:03:35.862 --> 00:03:38.323
So keep in mind --
she's never seen this done.

00:03:38.347 --> 00:03:39.938
(Laughter)

00:03:39.962 --> 00:03:41.145
Right.

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:47.697
(Laughter)

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:49.252
Yeah. All right.

00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:53.921
(Applause)

00:03:53.945 --> 00:03:56.426
So that's the part where
the researchers freak out.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.219
(Laughter)

00:03:58.243 --> 00:03:59.410
It turns out,

00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:02.674
we've been finding more and more
that crows are really intelligent.

00:04:02.698 --> 00:04:06.280
Their brains are in the same proportion
as chimpanzee brains are.

00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:08.396
There's all kinds of anecdotes

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.782
for the different kinds
of intelligence they have.

00:04:10.806 --> 00:04:13.306
For example, in Sweden,
crows will wait for fishermen

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.223
to drop lines through holes in the ice.

00:04:15.247 --> 00:04:16.787
And when the fishermen move off,

00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:20.052
the crows fly down, reel up the lines,
and eat the fish or the bait.

00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:22.014
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.

00:04:22.038 --> 00:04:23.477
On an entirely different tack,

00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:26.091
at University of Washington
a few years ago,

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:29.475
they were doing an experiment where
they captured some crows on campus.

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.317
Some students went out,
netted some crows, brought them in,

00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:34.925
weighed and measured them,
and let them back out again.

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.161
And they were entertained to discover
that for the rest of the week,

00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:40.817
whenever these particular students
walked around campus,

00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:42.952
these crows would caw at them
and run around,

00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:44.788
and make their life kind of miserable.

00:04:44.812 --> 00:04:45.814
(Laughter)

00:04:45.838 --> 00:04:47.783
They were significantly less entertained

00:04:47.807 --> 00:04:49.536
when this went on for the next week.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.833
And the next month.

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.585
And after summer break.

00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:54.908
Until they finally graduated
and left campus,

00:04:54.932 --> 00:04:56.672
and -- glad to get away, I'm sure --

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:59.935
came back sometime later, and found
the crows still remembered them.

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:00.965
(Laughter)

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:03.064
So, the moral being: don't piss off crows.

00:05:03.088 --> 00:05:06.307
So now, students
at the University of Washington

00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:09.703
that are studying these crows,
do so with a giant wig and a big mask.

00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:11.942
(Laughter)

00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:13.276
It's fairly interesting.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.871
(Laughter)

00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:16.819
So we know these crows are really smart,

00:05:16.843 --> 00:05:19.023
but the more I dug into this,
the more I found

00:05:19.047 --> 00:05:22.212
that they actually have
an even more significant adaptation.

00:05:23.276 --> 00:05:26.690
Video: Crows have become
highly skilled at making a living

00:05:26.714 --> 00:05:29.061
in these new urban environments.

00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:32.996
In this Japanese city, they have devised
a way of eating a food

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.307
that normally they can't manage:

00:05:37.623 --> 00:05:39.433
drop it among the traffic.

00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:48.774
The problem now is collecting the bits,
without getting run over.

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:51.099
Wait for the light to stop the traffic.

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:06.405
Then, collect your cracked nut in safety.

00:06:10.032 --> 00:06:11.306
(Laughter)

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.409
(Applause)

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:14.426
Joshua Klein: Yeah, pretty interesting.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.387
What's significant about this
isn't that crows are using cars

00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:18.562
to crack nuts.

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.227
In fact, that's old hat for crows.

00:06:20.251 --> 00:06:21.786
This happened about 10 years ago

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.337
in a place called Sendai City,
at a driving school

00:06:24.361 --> 00:06:25.522
in the suburbs of Tokyo.

00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:27.222
And since that time,

00:06:27.246 --> 00:06:30.308
all the crows in the neighborhood
are picking up this behavior.

00:06:30.332 --> 00:06:33.359
Now every crow within five kilometers
is standing by a sidewalk,

00:06:33.383 --> 00:06:34.796
waiting to collect its lunch.

00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:38.391
So they're learning from each other.
And research bears this out.

00:06:38.415 --> 00:06:40.929
Parents seem to be teaching their young.

00:06:40.953 --> 00:06:43.803
They learn from their peers,
they learn from their enemies.

00:06:43.827 --> 00:06:45.282
If I have a little extra time,

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:47.453
I'll tell you about a case
of crow infidelity

00:06:47.477 --> 00:06:48.915
that illustrates that nicely.

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:52.010
The point being, they've developed
cultural adaptation.

00:06:52.034 --> 00:06:53.279
And as we heard yesterday,

00:06:53.303 --> 00:06:56.345
that's the Pandora's box
that's getting human beings in trouble,

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:58.242
and we're starting to see it with them.

00:06:58.266 --> 00:07:00.802
They're able to very quickly
and very flexibly adapt

00:07:00.826 --> 00:07:03.554
to new challenges and new resources
in their environment,

00:07:03.578 --> 00:07:05.823
which is really useful
if you live in a city.

00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:09.093
So we know that there's lots of crows.

00:07:09.117 --> 00:07:12.178
We found out they're really smart
and they can teach each other.

00:07:12.202 --> 00:07:13.503
When all this became clear,

00:07:13.527 --> 00:07:16.690
I realized the only obvious thing to do
is build a vending machine.

00:07:16.714 --> 00:07:17.867
So that's what we did.

00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:19.628
This is a vending machine for crows.

00:07:19.652 --> 00:07:23.319
And it uses Skinnerian training
to shape their behavior over four stages.

00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:24.700
It's pretty simple.

00:07:24.724 --> 00:07:27.728
Basically, what happens
is that we put this out in a field

00:07:27.752 --> 00:07:29.722
or someplace where there's lots of crows.

00:07:29.746 --> 00:07:32.583
We put coins and peanuts
all around the base of the machine.

00:07:32.607 --> 00:07:34.648
Crows eventually come by, eat the peanuts,

00:07:34.672 --> 00:07:36.606
and get used to the machine being there.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.411
Eventually, they eat all the peanuts.

00:07:38.435 --> 00:07:40.754
Then they see peanuts
here on the feeder tray,

00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:42.500
and hop up and help themselves.

00:07:42.524 --> 00:07:45.397
Then they leave, the machine
spits up more coins and peanuts,

00:07:45.421 --> 00:07:47.191
and life is dandy if you're a crow --

00:07:47.215 --> 00:07:49.661
you can come back anytime
and get yourself a peanut.

00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:53.170
So when they get really used to that,
we move on to the crows coming back.

00:07:53.194 --> 00:07:55.297
Now they're used to the sound
of the machine;

00:07:55.321 --> 00:07:57.433
they keep coming back
and digging out peanuts

00:07:57.457 --> 00:07:59.180
from the pile of coins that's there.

00:07:59.204 --> 00:08:01.740
When they get really happy
about this, we stymie them.

00:08:01.764 --> 00:08:04.558
We move to the third stage,
where we only give them a coin.

00:08:04.582 --> 00:08:07.320
Now, like most of us who have gotten
used to a good thing,

00:08:07.344 --> 00:08:08.683
this really pisses them off.

00:08:08.707 --> 00:08:11.987
So they do what they do in nature
when they're looking for something:

00:08:12.011 --> 00:08:14.084
sweep things out of the way
with their beak.

00:08:14.108 --> 00:08:16.950
They do that here, and that knocks
the coins down the slot.

00:08:16.974 --> 00:08:18.760
When that happens, they get a peanut.

00:08:18.784 --> 00:08:20.079
This goes on for some time.

00:08:20.103 --> 00:08:22.539
The crows learn that
all they have to do is show up,

00:08:22.563 --> 00:08:24.913
wait for the coin to come out,
put it in the slot,

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.088
then get their peanut.

00:08:26.112 --> 00:08:28.191
When they're good
and comfortable with that,

00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:31.386
we move to the final stage,
where they show up and nothing happens.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.617
This is where we see the difference
between crows and other animals.

00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:38.353
Squirrels, for example, would show up,
look for the peanut, go away.

00:08:38.377 --> 00:08:40.931
Come back, look for the peanut, go away.

00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:43.793
They do this maybe half a dozen times
before they get bored,

00:08:43.817 --> 00:08:45.794
and then they go off and play in traffic.

00:08:45.818 --> 00:08:49.466
Crows, on the other hand,
show up and they try and figure it out.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.795
They know this machine
has been messing with them

00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:53.841
through three different
stages of behavior.

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:54.867
(Laughter)

00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:56.670
They figure there must be more to it.

00:08:56.694 --> 00:08:58.503
So they poke at it and peck at it.

00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:00.681
And eventually some crow
gets a bright idea:

00:09:00.705 --> 00:09:04.626
"Hey, there's lots of coins
lying around from the first stage,

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.815
hops down, picks it up, drops it
in the slot, and we're off to the races.

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:11.259
That crow enjoys a temporary
monopoly on peanuts,

00:09:11.283 --> 00:09:14.926
until his friends figure out
how to do it, and then there we go.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.306
So, what's significant about this to me

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.664
isn't that we can train crows
to pick up peanuts.

00:09:19.688 --> 00:09:23.518
Mind you, there's 216 million
dollars' worth of change lost every year,

00:09:23.542 --> 00:09:26.197
but I'm not sure I can depend
on that ROI from crows.

00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:27.268
(Laughter)

00:09:27.292 --> 00:09:30.476
Instead, I think we should look
a little bit larger.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.766
I think crows can be trained
to do other things.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.266
For example, why not train them
to pick up garbage after stadium events?

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.194
Or find expensive components
from discarded electronics?

00:09:39.218 --> 00:09:41.103
Or maybe do search and rescue?

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:44.306
The main point of all this for me is,

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.059
we can find mutually beneficial
systems for these species.

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:49.587
We can find ways to interact
with these other species

00:09:49.611 --> 00:09:51.545
that doesn't involve exterminating them,

00:09:51.569 --> 00:09:54.871
but involves finding an equilibrium
with them that's a useful balance.

00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:56.150
Thanks very much.

00:09:56.174 --> 00:10:01.774
(Applause)
