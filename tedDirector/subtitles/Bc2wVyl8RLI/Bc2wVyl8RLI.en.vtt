00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:18.470
Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.999
who make the things we use every day:

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.759
our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones.

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.205
Now, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt.

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:32.796
Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than

00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:35.652
a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes,

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:38.350
or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.390
after working overtime assembling your iPad.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.998
We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit

00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:48.701
these victims with every purchase we make,

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:50.334
and the injustice

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:53.423
feels embedded in the products themselves.

00:00:53.423 --> 00:00:55.983
After all, what's wrong with a world in which a worker

00:00:55.983 --> 00:00:59.759
on an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one?

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.409
It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive,

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.140
and that it's our desire for cheap goods

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.501
that makes them so.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:11.316
So, this simple narrative equating Western demand

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:14.128
and Chinese suffering is appealing,

00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:16.763
especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty

00:01:16.763 --> 00:01:19.341
about our impact on the world,

00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:23.124
but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful.

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:26.108
We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we

00:01:26.108 --> 00:01:29.276
have the power to drive tens of millions of people

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:31.988
on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer

00:01:31.988 --> 00:01:34.783
in such terrible ways.

00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:37.601
In fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world,

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:41.189
including its own, thanks to a combination of factors:

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.595
its low costs, its large and educated workforce,

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:47.061
and a flexible manufacturing system

00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:50.212
that responds quickly to market demands.

00:01:50.212 --> 00:01:53.261
By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets,

00:01:53.261 --> 00:01:55.724
we have rendered the individuals on the other end

00:01:55.724 --> 00:01:59.084
into invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:02.139
as the parts of a mobile phone.

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.804
Chinese workers are not forced into factories

00:02:04.804 --> 00:02:07.283
because of our insatiable desire for iPods.

00:02:07.283 --> 00:02:10.355
They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money,

00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:14.308
to learn new skills, and to see the world.

00:02:14.308 --> 00:02:16.701
In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's

00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:20.132
been missing is the voices of the workers themselves.

00:02:20.132 --> 00:02:22.437
Here are a few.

00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:26.186
Bao Yongxiu: "My mother tells me to come home

00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:29.910
and get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.995
developed myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker,

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:36.498
so I'm not in a rush."

00:02:36.498 --> 00:02:39.540
Chen Ying: "When I went home for the new year,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.796
everyone said I had changed. They asked me,

00:02:42.796 --> 00:02:45.893
what did you do that you have changed so much?

00:02:45.893 --> 00:02:49.171
I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them

00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:52.539
more, they won't understand anyway."

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.924
Wu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money,

00:02:55.924 --> 00:02:58.075
it won't satisfy me.

00:02:58.075 --> 00:03:02.444
Just to make money is not enough meaning in life."

00:03:02.444 --> 00:03:07.156
Xiao Jin: "Now, after I get off work, I study English,

00:03:07.156 --> 00:03:08.945
because in the future, our customers won't

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:12.807
be only Chinese, so we must learn more languages."

00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:15.578
All of these speakers, by the way, are young women,

00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:18.660
18 or 19 years old.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.602
So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:25.531
like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan.

00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:28.051
Certain subjects came up over and over:

00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:29.955
how much money they made,

00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:32.334
what kind of husband they hoped to marry,

00:03:32.334 --> 00:03:34.459
whether they should jump to another factory

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.659
or stay where they were.

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.852
Other subjects came up almost never, including

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:42.299
living conditions that to me looked close to prison life:

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.582
10 or 15 workers in one room,

00:03:44.582 --> 00:03:47.941
50 people sharing a single bathroom,

00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:51.275
days and nights ruled by the factory clock.

00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:54.763
Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances,

00:03:54.763 --> 00:03:57.524
and it was still better than the dormitories and homes

00:03:57.524 --> 00:04:00.092
of rural China.

00:04:00.092 --> 00:04:02.818
The workers rarely spoke about the products they made,

00:04:02.818 --> 00:04:05.162
and they often had great difficulty explaining

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.604
what exactly they did.

00:04:07.604 --> 00:04:09.315
When I asked Lu Qingmin,

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:11.417
the young woman I got to know best,

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.884
what exactly she did on the factory floor,

00:04:13.884 --> 00:04:16.289
she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.066
"qiu xi."

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:21.035
Only much later did I realize that she had been saying

00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:24.259
"QC," or quality control.

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.122
She couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor.

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:30.579
All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:34.573
in a language she didn't even understand.

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:38.195
Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism,

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:42.238
the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor.

00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:45.862
Unlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets,

00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:49.109
the worker in an industrial factory has no control,

00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:52.366
no pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding

00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:54.557
in her own work.

00:04:54.557 --> 00:04:56.973
But like so many theories that Marx arrived at

00:04:56.973 --> 00:04:59.792
sitting in the reading room of the British Museum,

00:04:59.792 --> 00:05:02.618
he got this one wrong.

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:04.917
Just because a person spends her time

00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:07.685
making a piece of something does not mean

00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:10.237
that she becomes that, a piece of something.

00:05:10.237 --> 00:05:13.340
What she does with the money she earns,

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.845
what she learns in that place, and how it changes her,

00:05:16.845 --> 00:05:19.606
these are the things that matter.

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:21.906
What a factory makes is never the point, and

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:25.990
the workers could not care less who buys their products.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.478
Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories,

00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:30.590
on the other hand, plays up this relationship

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.419
between the workers and the products they make.

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.508
Many articles calculate: How long would it take

00:05:36.508 --> 00:05:39.352
for this worker to work in order to earn enough money

00:05:39.352 --> 00:05:41.812
to buy what he's making?

00:05:41.812 --> 00:05:44.300
For example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.572
in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out

00:05:47.572 --> 00:05:51.117
two and a half months' wages for an iPhone.

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:54.454
But how meaningful is this calculation, really?

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.444
For example, I recently wrote an article

00:05:56.444 --> 00:05:57.422
in The New Yorker magazine,

00:05:57.422 --> 00:06:00.661
but I can't afford to buy an ad in it.

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:02.717
But, who cares? I don't want an ad in The New Yorker,

00:06:02.717 --> 00:06:05.582
and most of these workers don't really want iPhones.

00:06:05.582 --> 00:06:08.342
Their calculations are different.

00:06:08.342 --> 00:06:10.156
How long should I stay in this factory?

00:06:10.156 --> 00:06:12.619
How much money can I save?

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:15.189
How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car,

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:19.779
to get married, or to put my child through school?

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.470
The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.228
relationship with the product of their labor.

00:06:26.228 --> 00:06:29.370
About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.404
she invited me home to her family village

00:06:31.404 --> 00:06:33.627
for the Chinese New Year.

00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:36.013
On the train home, she gave me a present:

00:06:36.013 --> 00:06:40.404
a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.

00:06:40.404 --> 00:06:42.077
I thanked her, assuming it was fake,

00:06:42.077 --> 00:06:45.554
like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.

00:06:45.554 --> 00:06:49.363
After we got home, Min gave her mother another present:

00:06:49.363 --> 00:06:51.548
a pink Dooney &amp; Bourke handbag,

00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:53.971
and a few nights later, her sister was showing off

00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:57.475
a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag.

00:06:57.475 --> 00:07:01.275
Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:03.292
were made by their factory,

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:06.458
and every single one of them was authentic.

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:08.923
Min's sister said to her parents,

00:07:08.923 --> 00:07:12.285
"In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars."

00:07:12.285 --> 00:07:15.324
Her parents, who are both farmers, looked on, speechless.

00:07:15.324 --> 00:07:17.883
"And that's not all -- Coach is coming out with a new line,

00:07:17.883 --> 00:07:22.684
2191," she said. "One bag will sell for 6,000."

00:07:22.684 --> 00:07:26.931
She paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or

00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:32.578
6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000." (Laughter)

00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:35.173
Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her

00:07:35.173 --> 00:07:37.290
for the new year, said,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.123
"It doesn't look like it's worth that much."

00:07:40.123 --> 00:07:42.948
Min's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually

00:07:42.948 --> 00:07:46.492
understand these things. You don't understand shit."

00:07:46.492 --> 00:07:51.147
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:51.147 --> 00:07:55.187
In Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency.

00:07:55.187 --> 00:07:57.507
They weren't exactly worthless, but they were nothing

00:07:57.507 --> 00:08:00.217
close to the actual value, because almost no one they knew

00:08:00.217 --> 00:08:04.147
wanted to buy one, or knew how much it was worth.

00:08:04.147 --> 00:08:07.502
Once, when Min's older sister's friend got married,

00:08:07.502 --> 00:08:10.330
she brought a handbag along as a wedding present.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.498
Another time, after Min had already left

00:08:12.498 --> 00:08:15.640
the handbag factory, her younger sister came to visit,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.751
bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts.

00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:21.826
I looked in the zippered pocket of one,

00:08:21.826 --> 00:08:26.065
and I found a printed card in English, which read,

00:08:26.065 --> 00:08:29.323
"An American classic.

00:08:29.323 --> 00:08:31.833
In 1941, the burnished patina

00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:34.195
of an all-American baseball glove

00:08:34.195 --> 00:08:36.395
inspired the founder of Coach to create

00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:38.804
a new collection of handbags from the same

00:08:38.804 --> 00:08:42.013
luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather.

00:08:42.013 --> 00:08:46.188
Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags

00:08:46.188 --> 00:08:50.324
with perfect proportions and a timeless flair.

00:08:50.324 --> 00:08:52.604
They were fresh, functional, and women everywhere

00:08:52.604 --> 00:08:57.940
adored them. A new American classic was born."

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.266
I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min

00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:02.174
and her sisters.

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:04.781
Their relationship with the product of their labor

00:09:04.781 --> 00:09:07.076
was more complicated, surprising and funny

00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:09.334
than he could have imagined.

00:09:09.334 --> 00:09:12.157
And yet, his view of the world persists, and our tendency

00:09:12.157 --> 00:09:14.766
to see the workers as faceless masses,

00:09:14.766 --> 00:09:18.640
to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.041
The first time I met Min, she had just turned 18

00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:24.696
and quit her first job on the assembly line

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:27.011
of an electronics factory.

00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:29.657
Over the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs

00:09:29.657 --> 00:09:32.733
five times, eventually landing a lucrative post

00:09:32.733 --> 00:09:36.307
in the purchasing department of a hardware factory.

00:09:36.307 --> 00:09:38.832
Later, she married a fellow migrant worker,

00:09:38.832 --> 00:09:40.974
moved with him to his village,

00:09:40.974 --> 00:09:43.177
gave birth to two daughters,

00:09:43.177 --> 00:09:45.365
and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick

00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:49.771
for herself and an apartment for her parents.

00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:52.904
She recently returned to Dongguan on her own

00:09:52.904 --> 00:09:56.520
to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.720
temporarily leaving her husband and children

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.703
back in the village.

00:10:00.703 --> 00:10:03.284
In a recent email to me, she explained,

00:10:03.284 --> 00:10:07.330
"A person should have some ambition while she is young

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.992
so that in old age she can look back on her life

00:10:09.992 --> 00:10:14.775
and feel that it was not lived to no purpose."

00:10:14.775 --> 00:10:19.171
Across China, there are 150 million workers like her,

00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:21.924
one third of them women, who have left their villages

00:10:21.924 --> 00:10:25.467
to work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants

00:10:25.467 --> 00:10:28.072
and the construction sites of the big cities.

00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:31.816
Together, they make up the largest migration in history,

00:10:31.816 --> 00:10:34.816
and it is globalization, this chain that begins

00:10:34.816 --> 00:10:37.335
in a Chinese farming village

00:10:37.335 --> 00:10:41.112
and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet

00:10:41.112 --> 00:10:43.536
and Coach handbags on our arms

00:10:43.536 --> 00:10:45.825
that has changed the way these millions of people

00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:50.738
work and marry and live and think.

00:10:50.738 --> 00:10:52.687
Very few of them would want to go back

00:10:52.687 --> 00:10:55.244
to the way things used to be.

00:10:55.244 --> 00:10:58.424
When I first went to Dongguan, I worried that

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:02.799
it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers.

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:05.570
I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.199
or that they would have nothing to say to me.

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:10.849
Instead, I found young women who were smart and funny

00:11:10.849 --> 00:11:13.696
and brave and generous.

00:11:13.696 --> 00:11:16.027
By opening up their lives to me,

00:11:16.027 --> 00:11:18.233
they taught me so much about factories

00:11:18.233 --> 00:11:22.439
and about China and about how to live in the world.

00:11:24.746 --> 00:11:27.458
This is the Coach purse that Min gave me

00:11:27.458 --> 00:11:29.868
on the train home to visit her family.

00:11:29.868 --> 00:11:32.511
I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me

00:11:32.511 --> 00:11:35.235
to the young women I wrote about,

00:11:35.235 --> 00:11:39.505
ties that are not economic but personal in nature,

00:11:39.505 --> 00:11:43.072
measured not in money but in memories.

00:11:43.072 --> 00:11:46.491
This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine,

00:11:46.491 --> 00:11:50.033
sitting in your office or in the library,

00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:52.436
are not how you find them when you actually go out

00:11:52.436 --> 00:11:53.943
into the world.

00:11:53.943 --> 00:11:55.931
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:55.931 --> 00:12:02.603
(Applause)

00:12:02.603 --> 00:12:04.672
Chris Anderson: Thank you, Leslie, that was an insight

00:12:04.672 --> 00:12:07.269
that a lot of us haven't had before.

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:10.756
But I'm curious. If you had a minute, say,

00:12:10.756 --> 00:12:14.477
with Apple's head of manufacturing,

00:12:14.477 --> 00:12:16.837
what would you say?

00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:17.965
Leslie Chang: One minute?

00:12:17.965 --> 00:12:19.478
CA: One minute. (Laughter)

00:12:19.478 --> 00:12:21.404
LC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers

00:12:21.404 --> 00:12:24.630
is how much they're self-motivated, self-driven,

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.247
resourceful, and the thing that struck me,

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:30.212
what they want most is education, to learn,

00:12:30.212 --> 00:12:31.759
because most of them come from very poor backgrounds.

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:34.703
They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.

00:12:34.703 --> 00:12:36.942
Their parents are often illiterate,

00:12:36.942 --> 00:12:39.582
and then they come to the city, and they, on their own,

00:12:39.582 --> 00:12:41.707
at night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class,

00:12:41.707 --> 00:12:43.975
they'll take an English class, and learn

00:12:43.975 --> 00:12:46.099
really, really rudimentary things, you know,

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.838
like how to type a document in Word,

00:12:47.838 --> 00:12:50.502
or how to say really simple things in English.

00:12:50.502 --> 00:12:52.630
So, if you really want to help these workers,

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.853
start these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes

00:12:55.853 --> 00:12:58.982
in these schools, and what's going to happen is,

00:12:58.982 --> 00:13:00.401
all your workers are going to move on,

00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:03.808
but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple,

00:13:03.808 --> 00:13:06.749
and you can help their social mobility

00:13:06.749 --> 00:13:07.746
and their self-improvement.

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:09.524
When you talk to workers, that's what they want.

00:13:09.524 --> 00:13:12.198
They do not say, "I want better hot water in the showers.

00:13:12.198 --> 00:13:14.183
I want a nicer room. I want a TV set."

00:13:14.183 --> 00:13:15.806
I mean, it would be nice to have those things,

00:13:15.806 --> 00:13:16.964
but that's not why they're in the city,

00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:19.053
and that's not what they care about.

00:13:19.053 --> 00:13:22.603
CA: Was there a sense from them of a narrative that

00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:26.015
things were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative

00:13:26.015 --> 00:13:29.028
of some kind of level of growth, that things over time

00:13:29.028 --> 00:13:30.651
were getting better?

00:13:30.651 --> 00:13:32.558
LC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know,

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:34.924
it was interesting, because I spent basically two years

00:13:34.924 --> 00:13:36.918
hanging out in this city, Dongguan,

00:13:36.918 --> 00:13:39.029
and over that time, you could see immense change

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:41.824
in every person's life: upward, downward, sideways,

00:13:41.824 --> 00:13:43.645
but generally upward.

00:13:43.645 --> 00:13:45.432
If you spend enough time, it's upward, and I met people

00:13:45.432 --> 00:13:47.727
who had moved to the city 10 years ago, and who are now

00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:49.834
basically urban middle class people,

00:13:49.834 --> 00:13:51.855
so the trajectory is definitely upward.

00:13:51.855 --> 00:13:53.790
It's just hard to see when you're suddenly

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.911
sucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and

00:13:55.911 --> 00:13:57.649
desperate, but that's not really how it is.

00:13:57.649 --> 00:13:59.803
Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough,

00:13:59.803 --> 00:14:02.120
and it's nothing you or I would want to do,

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.265
but from their perspective, where they're coming from

00:14:05.265 --> 00:14:07.262
is much worse, and where they're going

00:14:07.262 --> 00:14:09.270
is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.631
that context of what's going on in their minds,

00:14:11.631 --> 00:14:13.994
not what necessarily is going on in yours.

00:14:13.994 --> 00:14:15.490
CA: Thanks so much for your talk.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:19.859
Thank you very much. (Applause)
