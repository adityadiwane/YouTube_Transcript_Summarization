00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.580
We live in a time of fear,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.996
and our response to fear
can either be to contract

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.820
and attempt to guard ourselves

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.956
or to extend ourselves,
hold on to each other,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.740
and face our fears together.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.420
What is your instinct?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.420
What do you see more of in the world?

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.036
The problem with the first approach

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.396
is that in our mounting isolation,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.036
we divide ourselves from others.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.476
Our sense of isolation grows,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.636
because our imagination
goes into overdrive

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.196
about the people and the spaces
that we no longer engage with.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.660
Our sense of otherness grows,
and we lose empathy.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.796
Today I'm going to tell you
about a group of people

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.956
that took the global
challenge of terrorism

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.660
and began creating spaces
where strangers connect in solidarity.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.580
My own obsession with what I see
as irrational divisions began as a child.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.836
As a fourth-generation
Kenyan Muslim of Indian origin,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.796
it bothered me that in four generations,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.876
there wasn't a single
marriage in my family

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.020
outside of my small religious community.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.380
And I wondered what that was about.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.196
Was it fear?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.540
Was it racism?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.620
Was it cultural preservation?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.676
Did it have something
to do with colonialism?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.940
Certainly, we didn't share a lot
of the same public spaces with others.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.060
These divisions bothered me deeply,
and they drove my career choices.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.260
When I was 20, the US embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.156
A year later, I was on my way
to the Middle East

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.660
to study conflict resolution.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.076
And then from that point on,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.636
it wasn't very hard for me
to find insecure environments to work in,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.516
because the world was quickly shifting

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.860
in what we now know
as the time of terrorism.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.996
I was in Washington, DC
when 9/11 happened,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.476
and then I moved back home
to Kenya to work with refugees

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.636
and then later worked in Pakistan

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.140
and in Afghanistan.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.596
In all of these places, what I noticed

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.156
was how important physical spaces are

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.556
to making us feel safe

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.876
and well

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.100
and like we belong.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.100
In 2013, I came back home
to Nairobi from Afghanistan.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.596
Al-Shabaab operatives
had besieged Westgate shopping center,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.620
killing 67 people
in a day of utter horror.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.756
Soon after that,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.236
I could see how Nairobi
was beginning to change,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.196
and it was beginning to feel
more like the fear and terror-weary

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.740
and war-torn cities that I had worked in.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.380
And Nairobi continues to grow
in fear-driven ways.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.676
We see more walls, more barriers,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.940
more security.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.476
And like other parts of the world,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.660
we are experiencing
an erosion of human connection.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.236
Divisions along
religious lines are deepening,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.780
and we're doubting more and more
how much we have in common.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.716
We are at a pivotal time

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.276
when we need to restore
our confidence in humanity

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.180
and stand boldly and visibly together.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.476
So in 2014, I brought together
a group of people in Nairobi

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.740
to figure out what to do:

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.460
public intellectuals, diplomats,
artists, development workers.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.620
And the group articulated
our challenge as threefold:

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.756
one, to reclaim the city
from the narrative of terrorism

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.996
and back into the hands
of the people that live there;

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.076
two, introduce a language
beyond race, tribe or religion

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.476
that would help us
transcend our differences;

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.036
and three, provide a gesture
that would help restore empathy

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.420
and conversation and trust.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.316
One of the people in this group
was an artist and architect,

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.020
Yazmany Arboleda.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.636
He and I have collaborated
in other parts of the world

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.236
over many years.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.796
He has a history

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.356
of disrupting urban environments

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.036
and making strangers connect

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.220
in incredible, beautiful
and spectacular ways.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.436
He had an idea.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.596
The idea was to unite people
of different faiths

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.796
by getting them to paint
each other's houses of worship,

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.516
mosques, temples, synagogues, churches,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.476
paint them yellow

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.860
in the name of love.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.316
By focusing on icons of faith,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.396
we would get people to reexamine
the true essence of their faith,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.300
the common belief that we share
in kindness, generosity and friendship.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.636
By creating pathways
between houses of worship

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.276
within one neighborhood,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.196
we would create islands of stability

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.636
and networks of people

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.180
that could withstand threats.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.500
And neighbors, by picking up
a paintbrush with other neighbors,

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.556
would engage not just with their heads

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.900
but with their hands
and with their hearts.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.276
And the painted buildings would become
sculptures in the landscape

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.956
that speak of people
from very different backgrounds

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.180
that stand together.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.340
We'd call the project "Colour in Faith."

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.276
We loved the idea and we immediately
began approaching houses of worship:

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.076
churches, temples, mosques, synagogues.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.756
Door to door, we went
to more than 60 rabbis,

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.300
imams, pastors and priests.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.436
As you can imagine,

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.156
bringing these communities together

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.396
when prejudices are reinforced
by a global pandemic of fear

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.676
is not easy.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.900
It was complicated.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.036
We were confronted
with the hierarchy of decision-making

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.740
within religious establishments.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.836
For example, with Catholic churches,

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.156
we were told that the archbishop
would have to make the decision.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.276
And so we wrote a letter
to the archbishop.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.100
We wrote a letter to the Vatican.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.236
We're still waiting to hear back.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.116
(Laughter)

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.196
And with other houses of worship,

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.396
we were told that the patrons,
the people that pay for the building

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.956
and the construction
and the painting of the buildings

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.420
would have to make a decision.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.276
And then we came head-to-head

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.996
with the long legacy
of missionary and donor dependence

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.316
that so impedes
unconditional civic action,

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.236
and we learned this the hard way.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.836
There was one community

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.196
that in our repeated conversations
would keep asking us

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.820
to appreciate them.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.596
And so we would keep going back

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.796
and telling them that we appreciate them,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.636
and of course,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.700
if we didn't appreciate them,
we wouldn't be here.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.396
And then we learned
painfully late in the game

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.980
that the word "appreciation"
is code for getting paid to participate.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.260
And so we challenged them

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.236
and we asked the question,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.500
"So what will it cost?

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.060
How much could we pay you?

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.300
And if we pay for your faith,
is it really faith?"

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.276
We started the project
asking the question,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.476
"Where does your faith live?"

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.756
And here we found ourselves
asking the question,

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.500
"How much does your faith cost?"

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.980
But the most difficult issue
was the perceived risk of standing apart.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.396
We had one synagogue
that flat-out refused to participate

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.636
because it feared
drawing attention to itself

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.860
and becoming a target.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.060
Similarly, we had a mosque
that also feared becoming a target.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.300
And these fears are justified.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.460
And yet, there were 25 houses of worship
that pledged to participate.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:58.556
(Applause)

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.076
These bold leaders took the gesture
and reinforced it with their own meaning.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.060
For some, it was to tell the world
that they're not terrorists.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.820
For others, it was to welcome people
through their doors to ask questions.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.316
And for some, it was to bridge the gap

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.476
between the older
and the younger generation,

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.996
which by the way is something that
many faiths are grappling with right now.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.836
And for some it was simply
to build neighborhood solidarity

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.060
in advance of feared election violence.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.236
When asked why yellow,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.516
one imam beautifully said,

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.460
"Yellow is the color of the sun.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.756
The sun shines on us all equally.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.300
It does not discriminate."

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.996
He and others spread the word
through their congregations

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.236
and over the radio.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.955
Municipal government officials
stepped forward and helped

00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:50.156
with permits and with convening
civil society organizations.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.796
A paint company donated
a thousand liters of yellow paint

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.436
mixed especially for us
in what they now call "optimistic yellow."

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.756
(Laughter)

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.836
(Applause)

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.116
And a poetry collective
joined forces with a university

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.396
and hosted a series of tweet chats

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.596
that challenged the nation
on issues of faith,

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.276
our faith not just
in the context of religion,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.996
but our faith in politicians
and tribe and nation,

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.700
our faith in the older generation
and in the younger generation.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.036
And then Colour in Faith
was launched at a gallery event

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.556
that invited an incredible mix
of gallerygoers

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.380
and religious leaders
and artists and businesspeople.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.036
Already, even before
picking up a paintbrush,

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.276
we had accomplished so much
of the conversation and connection

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.540
that we had hoped for.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.100
And then we began to paint.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.876
Muslims stood by Christians

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.116
and atheists and agnostics and Hindus

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.180
and painted a mosque yellow.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.620
And then they all came together again
and painted a church yellow,

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.036
and then another mosque,

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.300
and then another church.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.260
Poets and musicians
performed while we painted.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.116
We painted in Nairobi,

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.940
and then we painted in Mombasa.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.516
The local and international press
did features on Colour in Faith

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.556
in English and French and Swahili

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.540
and Spanish and Somali.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:35.260
CNN highlighted Colour in Faith
as a way of bringing communities together.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.196
And our social media platforms lit up,

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.756
connecting more and more people.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.860
And these neighbors
continued to stay in touch.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.276
There are some that are pursuing
politics with a platform of peace,

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.356
and we have communities
as far as Argentina and the US

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.636
and as close as Mali and Rwanda

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.476
that are asking for our help.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.060
And we would love to help.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.956
It's our dream that this project,
this idea, spreads across the world,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.620
with or without our support.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.860
Colour in Faith is literally highlighting
those who mean well in yellow.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.356
Colour in Faith is binding
neighborhoods together,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.876
and it's our hope
that when threats come knocking,

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.276
they will collectively
sift fact from rumor

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.980
and stand in solidarity.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.796
We've proven that the human family
can come together and send a message

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.196
far brighter and more powerful

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.060
than the voices of those
that wish to do us harm.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.836
Though fear is infectious,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.060
we are showing that so is hope.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.916
Thank you.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:46.060
(Applause)
