00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
As a particle physicist, I study the elementary particles

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
and how they interact on the most fundamental level.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
to study things on the smallest scale.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
But more recently, I've been turning my attention

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
to the universe on the largest scale.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
Because, as I'll explain to you,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.330
the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.330
So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are --

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
at least some of the big questions.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
So, recently, we have realized

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
that the ordinary matter in the universe --

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
and by ordinary matter, I mean you, me,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
the planets, the stars, the galaxies --

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
of the content of the universe.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
Almost a quarter, or approximately a quarter

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
of the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.330
By invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
which is what we use to detect things.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there?

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
We know it's there by its gravitational effects.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
In fact, this dark matter dominates

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
What about the rest of the pie?

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.330
The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
More about that later, OK.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
So for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
In these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.330
most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.330
This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
So we have these stars going around in circles like this.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.330
As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK --

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.330
that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
than those that are further out here, OK.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.330
So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.330
that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance --

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK --

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.330
we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
from the center of the galaxy.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.330
When those measurements are made,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
as a function of distance.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
If it's constant, that means that the stars out here

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.330
are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.330
appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.330
and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.330
So we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.330
that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space;

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
they tend to cluster.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
And this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
They're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
So these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
we take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.330
But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.330
They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
So all of these galaxies are moving.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.330
We can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
and figure out how much mass is in this cluster.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.330
And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.330
than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
But that cannot account for the mass either.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.330
In fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
in the form of this invisible or dark matter

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.330
as there is in the ordinary matter, OK.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.330
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
to try to remind you that it's there.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
Can we see it more visually? Yes, we can.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
And so let me lead you through how we can do this.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
So here's an observer:

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
it could be an eye; it could be a telescope.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
How do we see that galaxy?

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
for perhaps billions of years

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
before it enters the telescope or your eye.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
as it enters our eye, right?

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
We say, the ray of light came this way;

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.330
the galaxy must be there, OK.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.330
Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies --

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
and don't forget the dark matter, OK.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.330
Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
we now need to take into account

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.330
And that was that the gravitational field, due to mass,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
will deflect not only the trajectory of particles,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
but will deflect light itself.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
So this light ray will not continue in a straight line,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.330
but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
Where will this observer see the galaxy?

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.330
You can respond. Up, right?

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.330
Is there any other ray of light

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
Yes, great. I see people going down like this.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
So a ray of light could go down, be bent

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
up into the observer's eye,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
and the observer sees a ray of light here.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
Now, take into account the fact that we live in

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
a three-dimensional universe, OK,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
a three-dimensional space.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.330
Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye?

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.330
Yes! The rays would lie on a -- I'd like to see -- yeah, on a cone.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone --

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
that will all be bent by that cluster

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
and make it into the observer's eye.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.330
If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.330
A circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.330
Now, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.330
and the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.330
Now, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
to figure out what that image will look like.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.330
Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
We call this gravitational lensing.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
And so, this is your instrument, OK.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.330
(Laughter).

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
But ignore the top part.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.330
We shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.330
is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I'm a physicist. (Laughter)

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.330
So, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
And now put the lens over the galaxy,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
Now, move the base off to the side,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.330
and the ring will split up into arcs, OK.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
And you can put it on top of any image.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.330
On the graph paper, you can see

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
And again, this is a kind of an accurate model

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
of what happens with the gravitational lensing.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.330
OK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky?

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.330
Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies?

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
And the answer is yes.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
And so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
Many of the images you are seeing

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
Well, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies --

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
those are the galaxies in the cluster.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.330
They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
that are causing the bending of the light

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
to cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
of the background galaxies.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.330
So the streaks that you see, all these streaks,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.330
are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
So what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.330
we see in those images, we can calculate how much mass

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
there must be in this cluster.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
And it's an enormous amount of mass.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
And also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.330
that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.330
They are centered on some more spread out structure,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.330
and that is the dark matter

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
in which the cluster is embedded, OK.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.330
OK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
So the evidence that we have

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
that a quarter of the universe is dark matter --

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
this gravitationally attracting stuff --

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.330
is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.330
is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large;

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
it must be embedded in dark matter.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.330
And we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
that say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.330
OK. So now, let's turn to dark energy.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.330
that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.330
And that is the fact that space itself is expanding.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.330
So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe --

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK --

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.330
and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.330
horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
If you could do this, what you would find

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
that with each passing day, each passing year,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
each passing billions of years, OK,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.330
the distance between galaxies is getting greater.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.330
And it's not because galaxies are moving

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.330
away from each other through space.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.330
They're not necessarily moving through space.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
They're moving away from each other

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
because space itself is getting bigger, OK.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.330
That's what the expansion of the universe or space means.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
So they're moving further apart.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.330
Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:40.330
is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.330
But because gravitationally attracting matter

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
is embedded in this space,

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
So the expansion slows down with time.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.330
So, in the last century, OK, people debated

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:01.330
about whether this expansion of space would continue forever;

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.330
whether it would slow down, you know,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
will be slowing down, but continue forever;

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.330
slow down and stop, asymptotically stop;

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:15.330
or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
So a little over a decade ago,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:22.330
two groups of physicists and astronomers

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
set out to measure the rate at which

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.330
the expansion of space was slowing down, OK.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
By how much less is it expanding today,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.330
compared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.330
The startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.330
was that space is expanding at a faster rate today

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
than it was a few billion years ago, OK.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.330
So the expansion of space is actually speeding up.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.330
This was a completely surprising result.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:57.330
There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.330
No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
It was the opposite of what was expected.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
So we need something to be able to explain that.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
Now it turns out, in the mathematics,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.330
you can put it in as a term that's an energy,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.330
but it's a completely different type of energy

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
from anything we've ever seen before.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
We call it dark energy,

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
and it has this effect of causing space to expand.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
But we don't have a good motivation

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.330
for putting it in there at this point, OK.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.330
So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.330
Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
are completely different things, OK.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.330
There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
and they have very different effects.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
Dark matter, because it gravitationally attracts,

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.330
it tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
So clusters of galaxies will tend to form,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
because of all this gravitational attraction.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
Dark energy, on the other hand,

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.330
is putting more and more space between the galaxies,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
makes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.330
and so it impedes the growth of structure.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.330
So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.330
and how they -- their number density,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
how many there are as a function of time --

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.330
we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
compete against each other in structure forming.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.330
In terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.330
you know, really persuasive argument for dark energy.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
Do we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
Now, what do I mean by well motivated?

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:42.330
I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
that were actually introduced

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
to explain a completely different phenomenon, OK,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
things that I haven't even talked about,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.330
that each predict the existence

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.330
of a very weakly interacting, new particle.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
So, this is exactly what you want in physics:

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.330
where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
that was actually developed for something else.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
But we don't know if either of those

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.330
are actually the dark matter candidate, OK.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
One or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
Now, we look for these dark matter particles

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
because, after all, they are here in the room, OK,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.330
and they didn't come in the door.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
They just pass through anything.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.330
They can come through the building, through the Earth --

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
they're so non-interacting.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
So one way to look for them is to build detectors

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.330
that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
So a crystal that will ring if that happens.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
have built such a detector.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota,

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
OK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.330
announced the most sensitive results so far.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.330
They haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.330
There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.330
and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.330
and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.330
The Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.330
that we'll be turning on later this year.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.330
at the Large Hadron Collider.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.330
Now, because they are so non-interactive,

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.330
they will actually escape the detector,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
so their signature will be missing energy, OK.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.330
Now, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
whose signature could be missing energy,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
so it will be hard to tell the difference.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:36.330
And finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:40.330
specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy --

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.330
ground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.330
that are in competition right now

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.330
to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
So in terms of the big questions:

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
what is dark matter? What is dark energy?

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
The big questions facing physics.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.330
And I'm sure you have lots of questions,

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.330
which I very much look forward to addressing

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.330
over the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.330
(Applause)
