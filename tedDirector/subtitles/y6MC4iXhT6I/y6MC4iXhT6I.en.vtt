00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
In my industry,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
we believe that images can change the world.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Okay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
The truth is that we know that the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
images themselves don't change the world,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
but we're also aware that, since the beginning of photography,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
images have provoked reactions in people,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
and those reactions have caused change to happen.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
So let's begin with a group of images.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
I'd be extremely surprised

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
if you didn't recognize many or most of them.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
They're best described as iconic:

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
so iconic, perhaps, they're cliches.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
In fact, they're so well-known

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
that you might even recognize them

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
in a slightly or somewhat different form.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
(Laughter)

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
But I think we're looking for something more.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
We're looking for something more.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
We're looking for images that shine

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
an uncompromising light on crucial issues,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
images that transcend borders, that transcend religions,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
images that provoke us

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
to step up and do something --

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
in other words, to act.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Well, this image you've all seen.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
It changed our view of the physical world.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Many people credit

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
a lot of the birth of the environmental movement

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
to our seeing the planet like this

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
for the first time --

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
its smallness, its fragility.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Forty years later, this group, more than most,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
are well aware of the destructive power

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
that our species can wield over our environment.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And at last, we appear to be doing something about it.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
This destructive power takes many different forms.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
For example, these images taken by Brent Stirton

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
in the Congo.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
These gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and unsurprisingly,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
they sparked international outrage.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Most recently,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
with the recent earthquake in Haiti.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Well, I think what is far worse

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
is man's destructive power over man.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
and I'll quote him,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
"The Holocaust teaches us that nature,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
even in its cruelest moments,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
is benign in comparison with man,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
when he loses his moral compass and his reason."

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
There's another kind of crucifixion.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
as well as the images from Guantanamo

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
had a profound impact.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
The publication of those images,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
as opposed to the images themselves,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
caused a government to change its policies.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Some would argue that it is those images

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
than virtually any other single act.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Furthermore, those images forever removed

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Let's go back a little.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
In the 1960s and 1970s,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
the Vietnam War was basically shown

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
in America's living rooms day in, day out.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
News photos brought people face to face

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
with the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
a student killed by the National Guard

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
In fact, these images became

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
the voices of protest themselves.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Now, images have power

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
to shed light of understanding

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
on suspicion, ignorance,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
but I'll just show one image --

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
the issue of HIV/AIDS.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
was an enormous barrier

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
to even discussing or addressing it.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
A simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
the Princess of Wales, touching

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
an HIV/AIDS infected baby

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
did a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
She, better than most, knew the power of an image.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
So when we are confronted by a powerful image,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
we all have a choice:

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
We can look away, or we can address the image.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Thankfully, when these photos appeared in

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
The Guardian in 1998,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
they put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Did the images change the world?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
No, but they had a major impact.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Images often push us to question our core beliefs

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
and our responsibilities to each other.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
We all saw those images after Katrina,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and I think for millions of people

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
they had a very strong impact.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
And I think it's very unlikely

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
that they were far from the minds of Americans

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
when they went to vote in November 2008.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Unfortunately, some very important images

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
I'll show you one photo here,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
from an extraordinary piece of work,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
which has never been published, called War Is Personal.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
But images don't need to be graphic

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
in order to remind us of the tragedy of war.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
After all the tense moments of conflict

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
in all the conflict zones of the world,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
there's one photograph from a much quieter place

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that haunts me still, much more than the others.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Ansel Adams said, and I'm going to disagree with him,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
"You don't take a photograph, you make it."

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
In my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
it's you.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
We bring to each image

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
our own values, our own belief systems,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and as a result of that, the image resonates with us.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
My company has 70 million images.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
I have one image in my office.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Here it is.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
I hope that the next time you see

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
an image that sparks something in you,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
you'll better understand why,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
and I know that speaking to this audience,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
you'll definitely do something about it.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And thank you to all the photographers.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
(Applause)
