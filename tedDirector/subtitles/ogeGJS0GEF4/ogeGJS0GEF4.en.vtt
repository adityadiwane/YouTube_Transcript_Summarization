00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:15.630
Back in 2003,

00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:18.163
the UK government carried out a survey.

00:00:19.314 --> 00:00:22.463
And it was a survey that measured
levels of numeracy

00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:23.724
in the population.

00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:25.391
And they were shocked to find out

00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:28.779
that for every 100 working age
adults in the country,

00:00:28.803 --> 00:00:32.304
47 of them lacked Level 1 numeracy skills.

00:00:32.712 --> 00:00:36.824
Now, Level 1 numeracy skills --
that's low-end GCSE score.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.478
It's the ability to deal with fractions,
percentages and decimals.

00:00:40.502 --> 00:00:45.130
So this figure prompted
a lot of hand-wringing in Whitehall.

00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:46.782
Policies were changed,

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:48.528
investments were made,

00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:51.590
and then they ran
the survey again in 2011.

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:53.819
So can you guess
what happened to this number?

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:57.285
It went up to 49.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.758
(Laughter)

00:00:58.782 --> 00:01:01.231
And in fact, when I reported
this figure in the FT,

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:02.926
one of our readers joked and said,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.711
"This figure is only shocking
to 51 percent of the population."

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:09.021
(Laughter)

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.202
But I preferred, actually,
the reaction of a schoolchild

00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:15.321
when I presented
at a school this information,

00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:16.876
who raised their hand and said,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.416
"How do we know that the person
who made that number

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.255
isn't one of the 49 percent either?"

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:22.533
(Laughter)

00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:26.607
So clearly, there's a numeracy issue,

00:01:26.631 --> 00:01:28.741
because these are
important skills for life,

00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:32.632
and a lot of the changes
that we want to introduce in this century

00:01:32.656 --> 00:01:35.097
involve us becoming
more comfortable with numbers.

00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:36.969
Now, it's not just an English problem.

00:01:36.993 --> 00:01:41.923
OECD this year released some figures
looking at numeracy in young people,

00:01:41.947 --> 00:01:44.727
and leading the way, the USA --

00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:49.421
nearly 40 percent of young people
in the US have low numeracy.

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:50.742
Now, England is there too,

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:56.299
but there are seven OECD countries
with figures above 20 percent.

00:01:56.323 --> 00:01:59.082
That is a problem,
because it doesn't have to be that way.

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:01.114
If you look at the far end of this graph,

00:02:01.138 --> 00:02:04.098
you can see the Netherlands and Korea
are in single figures.

00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:08.538
So there's definitely a numeracy
problem that we want to address.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.260
Now, as useful as studies like these are,

00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:17.684
I think we risk herding people
inadvertently into one of two categories;

00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:19.484
that there are two kinds of people:

00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:23.857
those people that are comfortable
with numbers, that can do numbers,

00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:26.117
and the people who can't.

00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:28.242
And what I'm trying
to talk about here today

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:31.308
is to say that I believe
that is a false dichotomy.

00:02:31.332 --> 00:02:33.200
It's not an immutable pairing.

00:02:33.224 --> 00:02:36.872
I think you don't have to have
tremendously high levels of numeracy

00:02:36.896 --> 00:02:38.624
to be inspired by numbers,

00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:41.757
and that should be the starting point
to the journey ahead.

00:02:42.207 --> 00:02:46.518
And one of the ways in which
we can begin that journey, for me,

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:48.268
is looking at statistics.

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:51.787
Now, I am the first to acknowledge
that statistics has got somewhat

00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:53.129
of an image problem.

00:02:53.153 --> 00:02:54.200
(Laughter)

00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:55.756
It's the part of mathematics

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.839
that even mathematicians
don't particularly like,

00:02:58.863 --> 00:03:02.875
because whereas the rest of maths
is all about precision and certainty,

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.183
statistics is almost the reverse of that.

00:03:05.613 --> 00:03:10.268
But actually, I was a late convert
to the world of statistics myself.

00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:12.374
If you'd asked my undergraduate professors

00:03:12.398 --> 00:03:17.157
what two subjects would I be least likely
to excel in after university,

00:03:17.181 --> 00:03:19.948
they'd have told you statistics
and computer programming,

00:03:19.972 --> 00:03:22.911
and yet here I am, about to show you
some statistical graphics

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:24.137
that I programmed.

00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:26.320
So what inspired that change in me?

00:03:26.344 --> 00:03:29.992
What made me think that statistics
was actually an interesting thing?

00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:32.282
It's really because
statistics are about us.

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.271
If you look at the etymology
of the word statistics,

00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:37.904
it's the science of dealing with data

00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:40.358
about the state or the community
that we live in.

00:03:40.382 --> 00:03:43.736
So statistics are about us as a group,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.435
not us as individuals.

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.929
And I think as social animals,

00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:50.897
we share this fascination about how
we as individuals relate to our groups,

00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:52.309
to our peers.

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:55.443
And statistics in this way
are at their most powerful

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:56.768
when they surprise us.

00:03:57.297 --> 00:04:00.504
And there's been some really wonderful
surveys carried out recently

00:04:00.528 --> 00:04:02.242
by Ipsos MORI in the last few years.

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:04.974
They did a survey of over
1,000 adults in the UK,

00:04:04.998 --> 00:04:08.778
and said, for every 100 people
in England and Wales,

00:04:08.802 --> 00:04:10.672
how many of them are Muslim?

00:04:10.696 --> 00:04:13.342
Now the average answer from this survey,

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:16.778
which was supposed to be representative
of the total population, was 24.

00:04:16.802 --> 00:04:20.478
That's what people thought.

00:04:20.502 --> 00:04:24.141
British people think 24 out of every 100
people in the country are Muslim.

00:04:24.165 --> 00:04:28.575
Now, official figures reveal
that figure to be about five.

00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:33.539
So there's this big variation
between what we think, our perception,

00:04:33.563 --> 00:04:35.601
and the reality as given by statistics.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:37.169
And I think that's interesting.

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:40.483
What could possibly be causing
that misperception?

00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:42.886
And I was so thrilled with this study,

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.390
I started to take questions out
in presentations. I was referring to it.

00:04:46.414 --> 00:04:47.632
Now, I did a presentation

00:04:47.656 --> 00:04:49.966
at St. Paul's School for Girls
in Hammersmith,

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.130
and I had an audience rather like this,

00:04:52.154 --> 00:04:56.022
except it was comprised entirely
of sixth-form girls.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.442
And I said, "Girls,

00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:03.961
how many teenage girls do you think
the British public think

00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:05.733
get pregnant every year?"

00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:08.433
And the girls were apoplectic when I said

00:05:09.273 --> 00:05:13.186
the British public think that 15
out of every 100 teenage girls

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.503
get pregnant in the year.

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.480
And they had every right to be angry,

00:05:17.504 --> 00:05:20.262
because in fact, I'd have to have
closer to 200 dots

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:21.856
before I could color one in,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.395
in terms of what
the official figures tell us.

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.219
And rather like numeracy,
this is not just an English problem.

00:05:28.243 --> 00:05:32.747
Ipsos MORI expanded the survey
in recent years to go across the world.

00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:35.721
And so, they asked Saudi Arabians,

00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:38.266
for every 100 adults in your country,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.163
how many of them are overweight or obese?

00:05:42.346 --> 00:05:47.679
And the average answer from the Saudis
was just over a quarter.

00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:49.424
That's what they thought.

00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:52.016
Just over a quarter of adults
are overweight or obese.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.821
The official figures show, actually,
it's nearer to three-quarters.

00:05:56.845 --> 00:05:58.301
(Laughter)

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:00.617
So again, a big variation.

00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:05.087
And I love this one: they asked in Japan,
they asked the Japanese,

00:06:05.111 --> 00:06:07.071
for every 100 Japanese people,

00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:09.696
how many of them live in rural areas?

00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:15.242
The average was about a 50-50 split,
just over halfway.

00:06:15.266 --> 00:06:19.413
They thought 56 out of every 100
Japanese people lived in rural areas.

00:06:19.437 --> 00:06:21.124
The official figure is seven.

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:26.529
So extraordinary variations,
and surprising to some,

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.942
but not surprising to people
who have read the work

00:06:28.966 --> 00:06:33.358
of Daniel Kahneman, for example,
the Nobel-winning economist.

00:06:33.382 --> 00:06:38.474
He and his colleague, Amos Tversky,
spent years researching this disjoint

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:41.643
between what people perceive
and the reality,

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:45.418
the fact that people are actually
pretty poor intuitive statisticians.

00:06:45.442 --> 00:06:47.202
And there are many reasons for this.

00:06:47.226 --> 00:06:50.341
Individual experiences, certainly,
can influence our perceptions,

00:06:50.365 --> 00:06:54.323
but so, too, can things like the media
reporting things by exception,

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:56.043
rather than what's normal.

00:06:56.675 --> 00:06:58.801
Kahneman had a nice way
of referring to that.

00:06:58.825 --> 00:07:00.910
He said, "We can be blind
to the obvious" --

00:07:00.934 --> 00:07:02.572
so we've got the numbers wrong --

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:04.918
"but we can be blind
to our blindness about it."

00:07:04.942 --> 00:07:08.208
And that has enormous
repercussions for decision making.

00:07:08.232 --> 00:07:11.084
So at the statistics office
while this was all going on,

00:07:11.108 --> 00:07:13.020
I thought this was really interesting.

00:07:13.044 --> 00:07:15.054
I said, this is clearly a global problem,

00:07:15.078 --> 00:07:17.513
but maybe geography is the issue here.

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:21.446
These were questions that were all about,
how well do you know your country?

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.463
So in this case, it's how well
do you know 64 million people?

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:28.219
Not very well, it turns out.
I can't do that.

00:07:28.243 --> 00:07:29.567
So I had an idea,

00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:32.714
which was to think about
this same sort of approach

00:07:32.738 --> 00:07:34.843
but to think about it
in a very local sense.

00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:36.058
Is this a local?

00:07:36.082 --> 00:07:38.023
If we reframe the questions and say,

00:07:38.047 --> 00:07:40.169
how well do you know your local area,

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:42.296
would your answers be any more accurate?

00:07:43.637 --> 00:07:45.399
So I devised a quiz:

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.282
How well do you know your area?

00:07:48.274 --> 00:07:50.163
It's a simple Web app.

00:07:50.187 --> 00:07:51.370
You put in a post code

00:07:51.394 --> 00:07:54.101
and then it will ask you questions
based on census data

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:55.664
for your local area.

00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:58.248
And I was very conscious
in designing this.

00:07:58.272 --> 00:08:02.381
I wanted to make it open
to the widest possible range of people,

00:08:02.405 --> 00:08:05.233
not just the 49 percent
who can get the numbers.

00:08:05.257 --> 00:08:07.012
I wanted everyone to engage with it.

00:08:07.036 --> 00:08:08.561
So for the design of the quiz,

00:08:08.585 --> 00:08:12.200
I was inspired by the isotypes

00:08:12.224 --> 00:08:14.826
of Otto Neurath from the 1920s and '30s.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.198
Now, these are methods
for representing numbers

00:08:19.222 --> 00:08:20.995
using repeating icons.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.625
And the numbers are there,
but they sit in the background.

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:27.372
So it's a great way
of representing quantity

00:08:27.396 --> 00:08:30.380
without resorting to using terms
like "percentage,"

00:08:30.404 --> 00:08:31.634
"fractions" and "ratios."

00:08:31.658 --> 00:08:33.360
So here's the quiz.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.777
The layout of the quiz is,

00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:38.620
you have your repeating icons
on the left-hand side there,

00:08:38.644 --> 00:08:41.767
and a map showing you the area
we're asking you questions about

00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:42.958
on the right-hand side.

00:08:42.982 --> 00:08:44.263
There are seven questions.

00:08:44.287 --> 00:08:48.180
Each question, there's a possible answer
between zero and a hundred,

00:08:48.204 --> 00:08:49.553
and at the end of the quiz,

00:08:49.577 --> 00:08:52.795
you get an overall score
between zero and a hundred.

00:08:52.819 --> 00:08:54.903
And so because this is TEDxExeter,

00:08:54.927 --> 00:08:57.252
I thought we would have
a quick look at the quiz

00:08:57.276 --> 00:08:59.585
for the first few questions of Exeter.

00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:01.014
And so the first question is:

00:09:01.038 --> 00:09:04.030
For every 100 people,
how many are aged under 16?

00:09:04.604 --> 00:09:08.204
Now, I don't know Exeter very well
at all, so I had a guess at this,

00:09:08.228 --> 00:09:10.789
but it gives you an idea
of how this quiz works.

00:09:10.813 --> 00:09:14.519
You drag the slider
to highlight your icons,

00:09:14.543 --> 00:09:16.778
and then just click "Submit" to answer,

00:09:16.802 --> 00:09:20.465
and we animate away the difference
between your answer and reality.

00:09:20.489 --> 00:09:24.564
And it turns out, I was a pretty
terrible guess: five.

00:09:24.969 --> 00:09:26.393
How about the next question?

00:09:26.417 --> 00:09:28.573
This is asking about
what the average age is,

00:09:28.597 --> 00:09:31.042
so the age at which half
the population are younger

00:09:31.066 --> 00:09:32.740
and half the population are older.

00:09:32.764 --> 00:09:36.114
And I thought 35 -- that sounds
middle-aged to me.

00:09:36.138 --> 00:09:37.581
(Laughter)

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.132
Actually, in Exeter,
it's incredibly young,

00:09:42.156 --> 00:09:46.694
and I had underestimated the impact
of the university in this area.

00:09:46.718 --> 00:09:48.749
The questions get harder
as you go through.

00:09:48.773 --> 00:09:51.156
So this one's now asking
about homeownership:

00:09:51.775 --> 00:09:55.474
For every 100 households, how many
are owned with a mortgage or loan?

00:09:55.498 --> 00:09:56.778
And I hedged my bets here,

00:09:56.802 --> 00:09:59.900
because I didn't want to be
more than 50 out on the answer.

00:09:59.924 --> 00:10:01.944
(Laughter)

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:04.434
And actually, these get harder,
these questions,

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:07.317
because when you're in an area,
when you're in a community,

00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:12.591
things like age -- there are clues
to whether a population is old or young.

00:10:12.615 --> 00:10:14.960
Just by looking around
the area, you can see it.

00:10:14.984 --> 00:10:18.375
Something like homeownership
is much more difficult to see,

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:21.007
so we revert to our own heuristics,

00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:25.482
our own biases about how many people
we think own their own homes.

00:10:25.506 --> 00:10:29.156
Now the truth is,
when we published this quiz,

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.716
the census data that it's based on
was already a few years old.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.309
We've had online applications
that allow you to put in a post code

00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:38.427
and get statistics back for years.

00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:39.640
So in some senses,

00:10:39.664 --> 00:10:43.213
this was all a little bit old
and not necessarily new.

00:10:43.237 --> 00:10:46.876
But I was interested to see
what reaction we might get

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.617
by gamifying the data
in the way that we have,

00:10:49.641 --> 00:10:51.048
by using animation

00:10:51.072 --> 00:10:54.820
and playing on the fact
that people have their own preconceptions.

00:10:55.328 --> 00:10:58.911
It turns out, the reaction was, um ...

00:11:00.148 --> 00:11:02.076
was more than I could have hoped for.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.481
It was a long-held ambition of mine
to bring down a statistics website

00:11:05.505 --> 00:11:06.913
due to public demand.

00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:08.737
(Laughter)

00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:12.225
This URL contains the words
"statistics," "gov" and "UK,"

00:11:12.249 --> 00:11:15.491
which are three of people's least
favorite words in a URL.

00:11:15.515 --> 00:11:19.500
And the amazing thing about this
was that the website came down

00:11:19.524 --> 00:11:21.617
at quarter to 10 at night,

00:11:21.641 --> 00:11:24.852
because people were actually
engaging with this data

00:11:24.876 --> 00:11:26.415
of their own free will,

00:11:26.439 --> 00:11:28.474
using their own personal time.

00:11:28.498 --> 00:11:30.985
I was very interested to see

00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:34.722
that we got something like
a quarter of a million people

00:11:34.746 --> 00:11:38.018
playing the quiz within the space
of 48 hours of launching it.

00:11:38.042 --> 00:11:41.969
And it sparked an enormous discussion
online, on social media,

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:44.030
which was largely dominated

00:11:44.054 --> 00:11:48.047
by people having fun
with their misconceptions,

00:11:48.071 --> 00:11:51.130
which is something that
I couldn't have hoped for any better,

00:11:51.154 --> 00:11:52.314
in some respects.

00:11:52.338 --> 00:11:55.564
I also liked the fact that people started
sending it to politicians.

00:11:55.588 --> 00:11:58.177
How well do you know the area
you claim to represent?

00:11:58.201 --> 00:11:59.363
(Laughter)

00:11:59.387 --> 00:12:00.947
And then just to finish,

00:12:01.812 --> 00:12:04.142
going back to the two kinds of people,

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:06.423
I thought it would be
really interesting to see

00:12:06.447 --> 00:12:09.262
how people who are good with numbers
would do on this quiz.

00:12:09.286 --> 00:12:12.302
The national statistician
of England and Wales, John Pullinger,

00:12:12.326 --> 00:12:14.399
you would expect he would be pretty good.

00:12:15.344 --> 00:12:17.793
He got 44 for his own area.

00:12:17.817 --> 00:12:20.285
(Laughter)

00:12:20.309 --> 00:12:25.258
Jeremy Paxman -- admittedly,
after a glass of wine -- 36.

00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.332
Even worse.

00:12:27.356 --> 00:12:30.557
It just shows you that the numbers
can inspire us all.

00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:31.841
They can surprise us all.

00:12:31.865 --> 00:12:33.904
So very often, we talk about statistics

00:12:33.928 --> 00:12:35.890
as being the science of uncertainty.

00:12:35.914 --> 00:12:37.696
My parting thought for today is:

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.755
actually, statistics is the science of us.

00:12:40.779 --> 00:12:43.567
And that's why we should
be fascinated by numbers.

00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:44.781
Thank you very much.

00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:48.582
(Applause)
