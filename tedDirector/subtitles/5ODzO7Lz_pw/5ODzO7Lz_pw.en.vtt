00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
If we look around us,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
much of what surrounds us

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
started life as various rocks and sludge

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
buried in the ground in various places in the world.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
They look like TV cameras, monitors,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
annoying radio mics.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
And so this magical transformation

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
is what I was trying to get at with my project,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
which became known as the Toaster Project.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And it was also inspired by this quote

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
from Douglas Adams,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and the situation is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And the situation it describes

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
is the hero of the book -- he's a 20th-century man --

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
finds himself alone on a strange planet

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
populated only by a technologically primitive people.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And he kind of assumes that, yes,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
he'll become -- these villagers --

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
he'll become their emperor

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and transform their society

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
with his wonderful command of technology

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and science and the elements,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
but, of course, realizes

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
that without the rest of human society,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
he can barely make a sandwich,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
let alone a toaster.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
But he didn't have Wikipedia.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
So I thought, okay,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
And, working on the idea

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
that the cheapest electric toaster

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
took it home

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and was kind of dismayed to discover

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
that, inside this object,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
there were 400 different bits

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.260
made out of a hundred-plus different materials.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
I had maybe nine months.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
So I thought, okay, I'll start with five.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And these were steel, mica,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
plastic, copper and nickel.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So, starting with steel: how do you make steel?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
I went and knocked on the door

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
of the Rio Tinto Chair

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
and said, "How do you make steel?"

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And Professor Cilliers was very kind

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and talked me through it.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And my vague rememberings from GCSE science --

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
well, steel comes from iron,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
so I phoned up an iron mine.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And said, "Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Can I come up and get some iron?"

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Unfortunately, when I got there -- emerges Ray.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
He had misheard me

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
But after some nagging, I got him to do that.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
(Video) Ray: It was Crease Limestone,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and that was produced

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
by sea creatures

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
350 million years ago

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
in a nice, warm,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
sunny atmosphere.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
When you study geology,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
you can see what's happened in the past,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and there were terrific changes in the earth.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
because, though Ray was a miner there,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
the mine had closed

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
because, of course, it can't compete

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
on the scale of operations which are happening

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
in South America, Australia, wherever.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and dragged it back to London on the train,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
and then was faced with the problem:

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Okay, how do you make this rock

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
into components for a toaster?

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
So I went back to Professor Cilliers,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and he said, "Go to the library."

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
So I did

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy --

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
completely useless for what I was trying to do.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Because, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do it

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
So I ended up going to the History of Science Library

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and looking at this book.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
This is the first textbook on metallurgy

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
written in the West, at least.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And there you can see that woodcut

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
is basically what I ended up doing.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
(Laughter)

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
was, the smaller the scale you want to work on,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
the further back in time you have to go.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
And so this is after

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
a day and about half a night

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
smelting this iron.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
I dragged out this stuff,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and it wasn't iron.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
But luckily,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
I found a patent online

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
for industrial furnaces that use microwaves,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and at 30 minutes at full power,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and I was able to finish off the process.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
So, my next --

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
(Applause)

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
The next thing I was trying to get was copper.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Again, this mine

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
was once the largest copper mine in the world.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
It's not anymore,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
but I found a retired geology professor

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
to take me down,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine."

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
And the reason I was interested in getting water

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
is because water which goes through mines

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
becomes kind of acidic

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and will start picking up,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
dissolving the minerals from the mine.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
which is in Portugal.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
As you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
So many such

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
that it's now just a home for bacteria

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
who really like acidic, toxic conditions.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
But anyway, the water I dragged back

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was --

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
there was enough copper in it

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
such that I could cast the pins

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
of my metal electric plug.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
So my next thing: I was off to Scotland

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
to get mica.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
And mica is a mineral

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
which is a very good insulator

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
and very good at insulating electricity.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
That's me getting mica.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and, of course,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
my toaster had to have a plastic case.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Plastic is the defining feature

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
of cheap electrical goods.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and spent a good half an hour

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
trying to convince the PR office at BP

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
that it would be fantastic for them

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
if they flew me to an oil rig

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
and let me have a jug of oil.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
But even then

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
they weren't convinced

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
and said, "Okay, we'll phone you back" -- never did.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
So I looked at other ways of making plastic.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
And you can actually make plastic

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
from obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
So this is attempting to make

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
potato starch plastic.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And for a while that was looking really good.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
I poured it into the mold, which you can see there,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
which I've made from a tree trunk.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
And it was looking good for a while,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
but I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and unfortunately I came back

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
So kind of out of desperation,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
I decided that I could think laterally.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
And geologists have actually christened --

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
well, they're debating whether to christen --

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
the age that we're living in --

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
called the Anthropocene, the age of Man.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And that's because geologists of the future

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
would kind of see a sharp shift

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
in the strata of rock that is being laid down now.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
that have been set off since 1945.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
And there'd also be an extinction event --

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
like fossils would suddenly disappear.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And also, I thought

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
that there would be

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
synthetic polymers,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
plastics, embedded in the rock.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
So I looked up a plastic --

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
so I decided that I could mine

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
some of this modern-day rock.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And I went up to Manchester

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
to visit a place called Axion Recycling.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.260
which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
And that was brought into force

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
to try and deal with the mountain of stuff

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
that is just being made

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
and then living for a while in our homes

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and then going to landfill.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
But this is it.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.260
(Music)

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
(Laughter)

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
So there's a picture

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
of my toaster.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.260
(Applause)

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
That's it without the case on.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And there it is on the shelves.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Thanks.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.260
(Applause)

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Bruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
TT: Yeah, I did plug it in.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
I don't know if you could see,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
but I was never able to make insulation for the wires.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
Kew Gardens were insistent

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
So the wires were uninsulated.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
So there was 240 volts

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
going through these homemade copper wires,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
homemade plug.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
And for about five seconds,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
the toaster toasted,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
but then, unfortunately,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
the element kind of melted itself.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
But I considered it a partial success, to be honest.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
BG: Thomas Thwaites. TT: Thanks.
