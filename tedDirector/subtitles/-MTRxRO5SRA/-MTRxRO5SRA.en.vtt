00:00:12.954 --> 00:00:15.880
I'm here today to talk about
the two ideas that,

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:18.262
at least based on
my observations at Khan Academy,

00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:22.164
are kind of the core,
or the key leverage points for learning.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.204
And it's the idea of mastery

00:00:24.228 --> 00:00:26.013
and the idea of mindset.

00:00:26.037 --> 00:00:28.871
I saw this in the early days
working with my cousins.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:31.375
A lot of them were having trouble
with math at first,

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.453
because they had all of these gaps
accumulated in their learning.

00:00:34.477 --> 00:00:37.466
And because of that, at some point
they got to an algebra class

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.892
and they might have been a little bit
shaky on some of the pre-algebra,

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:44.361
and because of that, they thought
they didn't have the math gene.

00:00:44.385 --> 00:00:46.048
Or they'd get to a calculus class,

00:00:46.072 --> 00:00:48.834
and they'd be a little bit
shaky on the algebra.

00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:50.428
I saw it in the early days

00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:53.980
when I was uploading
some of those videos on YouTube,

00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:57.281
and I realized that people
who were not my cousins were watching.

00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:59.170
(Laughter)

00:00:59.194 --> 00:01:03.060
And at first, those comments
were just simple thank-yous.

00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:05.053
I thought that was a pretty big deal.

00:01:05.077 --> 00:01:07.529
I don't know how much time
you all spend on YouTube.

00:01:07.553 --> 00:01:09.640
Most of the comments are not "Thank you."

00:01:09.664 --> 00:01:11.121
(Laughter)

00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:12.783
They're a little edgier than that.

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:15.238
But then the comments
got a little more intense,

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:19.718
student after student saying
that they had grown up not liking math.

00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:22.941
It was getting difficult as they got
into more advanced math topics.

00:01:22.965 --> 00:01:24.493
By the time they got to algebra,

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:27.845
they had so many gaps in their knowledge
they couldn't engage with it.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.942
They thought they didn't
have the math gene.

00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.446
But when they were a bit older,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.713
they took a little agency
and decided to engage.

00:01:33.737 --> 00:01:35.589
They found resources like Khan Academy

00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:38.763
and they were able to fill in those gaps
and master those concepts,

00:01:38.787 --> 00:01:41.377
and that reinforced their mindset
that it wasn't fixed;

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.966
that they actually were capable
of learning mathematics.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.043
And in a lot of ways, this is how
you would master a lot of things in life.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.366
It's the way you would
learn a martial art.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.556
In a martial art, you would
practice the white belt skills

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.993
as long as necessary,

00:01:56.017 --> 00:01:57.568
and only when you've mastered it

00:01:57.592 --> 00:01:59.727
you would move on to become a yellow belt.

00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:01.822
It's the way you learn
a musical instrument:

00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:04.140
you practice the basic piece
over and over again,

00:02:04.164 --> 00:02:05.752
and only when you've mastered it,

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:07.447
you go on to the more advanced one.

00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:08.811
But what we point out --

00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:13.320
this is not the way a traditional
academic model is structured,

00:02:13.344 --> 00:02:16.679
the type of academic model
that most of us grew up in.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.245
In a traditional academic model,

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.688
we group students together,
usually by age,

00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:21.991
and around middle school,

00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:23.861
by age and perceived ability,

00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:26.443
and we shepherd them all
together at the same pace.

00:02:27.038 --> 00:02:28.335
And what typically happens,

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.860
let's say we're in a middle school
pre-algebra class,

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:32.678
and the current unit is on exponents,

00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:34.892
the teacher will give
a lecture on exponents,

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.201
then we'll go home, do some homework.

00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:39.279
The next morning,
we'll review the homework,

00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:41.651
then another lecture, homework,
lecture, homework.

00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:43.936
That will continue for about
two or three weeks,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.135
and then we get a test.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.477
On that test, maybe I get a 75 percent,

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.918
maybe you get a 90 percent,

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:51.926
maybe you get a 95 percent.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.697
And even though the test identified
gaps in our knowledge,

00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:56.680
I didn't know 25 percent of the material.

00:02:56.704 --> 00:02:59.676
Even the A student, what was
the five percent they didn't know?

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.513
Even though we've identified the gaps,

00:03:01.537 --> 00:03:04.075
the whole class will then
move on to the next subject,

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.501
probably a more advanced subject
that's going to build on those gaps.

00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:10.898
It might be logarithms
or negative exponents.

00:03:10.922 --> 00:03:13.953
And that process continues,
and you immediately start to realize

00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:15.152
how strange this is.

00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:17.947
I didn't know 25 percent
of the more foundational thing,

00:03:17.971 --> 00:03:20.416
and now I'm being pushed
to the more advanced thing.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.152
And this will continue for months, years,
all the way until at some point,

00:03:24.176 --> 00:03:26.616
I might be in an algebra class
or trigonometry class

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.897
and I hit a wall.

00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:30.575
And it's not because algebra
is fundamentally difficult

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.591
or because the student isn't bright.

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:37.926
It's because I'm seeing an equation
and they're dealing with exponents

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.679
and that 30 percent
that I didn't know is showing up.

00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:43.532
And then I start to disengage.

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.895
To appreciate how absurd that is,

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.664
imagine if we did other things
in our life that way.

00:03:51.124 --> 00:03:52.578
Say, home-building.

00:03:52.602 --> 00:03:55.275
(Laughter)

00:03:56.878 --> 00:04:00.272
So we bring in the contractor and say,

00:04:00.296 --> 00:04:02.844
"We were told we have
two weeks to build a foundation.

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:04.204
Do what you can."

00:04:04.228 --> 00:04:06.531
(Laughter)

00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:08.777
So they do what they can.

00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:09.957
Maybe it rains.

00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:11.950
Maybe some of the supplies don't show up.

00:04:11.974 --> 00:04:15.284
And two weeks later,
the inspector comes, looks around,

00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:17.973
says, "OK, the concrete
is still wet right over there,

00:04:17.997 --> 00:04:19.849
that part's not quite up to code ...

00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:22.196
I'll give it an 80 percent."

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.284
(Laughter)

00:04:23.308 --> 00:04:26.043
You say, "Great! That's a C.
Let's build the first floor."

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:27.085
(Laughter)

00:04:27.109 --> 00:04:28.263
Same thing.

00:04:28.287 --> 00:04:32.126
We have two weeks, do what you can,
inspector shows up, it's a 75 percent.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.309
Great, that's a D-plus.

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:34.579
Second floor, third floor,

00:04:34.603 --> 00:04:37.381
and all of a sudden,
while you're building the third floor,

00:04:37.405 --> 00:04:38.841
the whole structure collapses.

00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:42.109
And if your reaction is the reaction
you typically have in education,

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:43.474
or that a lot of folks have,

00:04:43.498 --> 00:04:45.604
you might say, maybe
we had a bad contractor,

00:04:45.628 --> 00:04:48.721
or maybe we needed better inspection
or more frequent inspection.

00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:50.994
But what was really broken
was the process.

00:04:51.018 --> 00:04:54.047
We were artificially constraining
how long we had to something,

00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:56.444
pretty much ensuring a variable outcome,

00:04:56.468 --> 00:04:59.992
and we took the trouble of inspecting
and identifying those gaps,

00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:01.949
but then we built right on top of it.

00:05:01.973 --> 00:05:04.910
So the idea of mastery learning
is to do the exact opposite.

00:05:04.934 --> 00:05:07.402
Instead of artificially
constraining, fixing

00:05:07.426 --> 00:05:09.414
when and how long you work on something,

00:05:09.438 --> 00:05:11.656
pretty much ensuring
that variable outcome,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.353
the A, B, C, D, F --

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.464
do it the other way around.

00:05:15.844 --> 00:05:17.636
What's variable is when and how long

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.754
a student actually has
to work on something,

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:23.025
and what's fixed is that
they actually master the material.

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:25.096
And it's important to realize

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.485
that not only will this make the student
learn their exponents better,

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.467
but it'll reinforce
the right mindset muscles.

00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:34.919
It makes them realize that if you got
20 percent wrong on something,

00:05:34.943 --> 00:05:38.332
it doesn't mean that you have
a C branded in your DNA somehow.

00:05:38.356 --> 00:05:40.790
It means that you should just
keep working on it.

00:05:40.814 --> 00:05:43.306
You should have grit;
you should have perseverance;

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.471
you should take agency over your learning.

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:48.898
Now, a lot of skeptics might say,
well, hey, this is all great,

00:05:48.922 --> 00:05:51.643
philosophically, this whole idea
of mastery-based learning

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:53.103
and its connection to mindset,

00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:55.226
students taking agency
over their learning.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.385
It makes a lot of sense,
but it seems impractical.

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.806
To actually do it, every student
would be on their own track.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.454
It would have to be personalized,

00:06:03.478 --> 00:06:06.660
you'd have to have private tutors
and worksheets for every student.

00:06:06.684 --> 00:06:08.183
And these aren't new ideas --

00:06:08.207 --> 00:06:11.033
there were experiments
in Winnetka, Illinois, 100 years ago,

00:06:11.057 --> 00:06:13.875
where they did mastery-based learning
and saw great results,

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:17.196
but they said it wouldn't scale
because it was logistically difficult.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.127
The teacher had to give different
worksheets to every student,

00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:21.439
give on-demand assessments.

00:06:21.463 --> 00:06:23.724
But now today, it's no longer impractical.

00:06:23.748 --> 00:06:25.114
We have the tools to do it.

00:06:25.138 --> 00:06:27.733
Students see an explanation
at their own time and pace?

00:06:27.757 --> 00:06:29.352
There's on-demand video for that.

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:31.448
They need practice? They need feedback?

00:06:31.472 --> 00:06:35.912
There's adaptive exercises
readily available for students.

00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:38.905
And when that happens,
all sorts of neat things happen.

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:41.702
One, the students can actually
master the concepts,

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:43.921
but they're also building
their growth mindset,

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.742
they're building grit, perseverance,

00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:47.789
they're taking agency over their learning.

00:06:47.813 --> 00:06:50.370
And all sorts of beautiful things
can start to happen

00:06:50.394 --> 00:06:52.030
in the actual classroom.

00:06:52.054 --> 00:06:54.112
Instead of it being focused
on the lecture,

00:06:54.136 --> 00:06:55.954
students can interact with each other.

00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:58.136
They can get deeper mastery
over the material.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.513
They can go into simulations,
Socratic dialogue.

00:07:00.537 --> 00:07:03.216
To appreciate what we're talking about

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.287
and the tragedy of lost potential here,

00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:10.454
I'd like to give a little bit
of a thought experiment.

00:07:10.985 --> 00:07:16.051
If we were to go 400 years
into the past to Western Europe,

00:07:16.075 --> 00:07:19.239
which even then, was one of the more
literate parts of the planet,

00:07:19.263 --> 00:07:22.990
you would see that about 15 percent
of the population knew how to read.

00:07:23.556 --> 00:07:27.194
And I suspect that if you asked someone
who did know how to read,

00:07:27.218 --> 00:07:29.114
say a member of the clergy,

00:07:29.138 --> 00:07:32.750
"What percentage of the population
do you think is even capable of reading?"

00:07:32.774 --> 00:07:36.335
They might say, "Well,
with a great education system,

00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:38.603
maybe 20 or 30 percent."

00:07:39.424 --> 00:07:41.011
But if you fast forward to today,

00:07:41.035 --> 00:07:44.050
we know that that prediction
would have been wildly pessimistic,

00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:48.199
that pretty close to 100 percent
of the population is capable of reading.

00:07:48.223 --> 00:07:50.774
But if I were to ask you
a similar question:

00:07:51.494 --> 00:07:55.033
"What percentage of the population
do you think is capable

00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:57.930
of truly mastering calculus,

00:07:57.954 --> 00:08:00.967
or understanding organic chemistry,

00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:04.277
or being able to contribute
to cancer research?"

00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:07.198
A lot of you might say, "Well,
with a great education system,

00:08:07.222 --> 00:08:09.244
maybe 20, 30 percent."

00:08:09.778 --> 00:08:11.091
But what if that estimate

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:14.502
is just based on your own experience
in a non-mastery framework,

00:08:14.526 --> 00:08:17.358
your own experience with yourself
or observing your peers,

00:08:17.382 --> 00:08:20.171
where you're being pushed
at this set pace through classes,

00:08:20.195 --> 00:08:21.534
accumulating all these gaps?

00:08:21.558 --> 00:08:23.199
Even when you got that 95 percent,

00:08:23.223 --> 00:08:25.035
what was that five percent you missed?

00:08:25.059 --> 00:08:27.786
And it keeps accumulating --
you get to an advanced class,

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.682
all of a sudden you hit a wall and say,

00:08:29.706 --> 00:08:31.709
"I'm not meant to be a cancer researcher;

00:08:31.733 --> 00:08:34.661
not meant to be a physicist;
not meant to be a mathematician."

00:08:34.685 --> 00:08:36.662
I suspect that that actually is the case,

00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:40.512
but if you were allowed to be operating
in a mastery framework,

00:08:40.536 --> 00:08:43.953
if you were allowed to really
take agency over your learning,

00:08:43.977 --> 00:08:45.573
and when you get something wrong,

00:08:45.597 --> 00:08:48.389
embrace it -- view that failure
as a moment of learning --

00:08:48.413 --> 00:08:52.370
that number, the percent
that could really master calculus

00:08:52.394 --> 00:08:54.154
or understand organic chemistry,

00:08:54.178 --> 00:08:56.680
is actually a lot closer to 100 percent.

00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:00.458
And this isn't even just a "nice to have."

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:03.082
I think it's a social imperative.

00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:07.362
We're exiting what you could call
the industrial age

00:09:07.386 --> 00:09:11.190
and we're going into
this information revolution.

00:09:11.646 --> 00:09:13.820
And it's clear that some
things are happening.

00:09:13.844 --> 00:09:15.957
In the industrial age,
society was a pyramid.

00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:20.633
At the base of the pyramid,
you needed human labor.

00:09:21.085 --> 00:09:24.418
In the middle of the pyramid,
you had an information processing,

00:09:24.442 --> 00:09:26.040
a bureaucracy class,

00:09:26.064 --> 00:09:29.738
and at the top of the pyramid,
you had your owners of capital

00:09:29.762 --> 00:09:31.761
and your entrepreneurs

00:09:31.785 --> 00:09:33.237
and your creative class.

00:09:33.904 --> 00:09:35.700
But we know what's happening already,

00:09:35.724 --> 00:09:37.739
as we go into this information revolution.

00:09:37.763 --> 00:09:40.716
The bottom of that pyramid,
automation, is going to take over.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.065
Even that middle tier,
information processing,

00:09:43.089 --> 00:09:44.715
that's what computers are good at.

00:09:44.739 --> 00:09:46.486
So as a society, we have a question:

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.628
All this new productivity is happening
because of this technology,

00:09:49.652 --> 00:09:50.982
but who participates in it?

00:09:51.006 --> 00:09:54.201
Is it just going to be that very top
of the pyramid, in which case,

00:09:54.225 --> 00:09:55.566
what does everyone else do?

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.756
How do they operate?

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.200
Or do we do something
that's more aspirational?

00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:02.691
Do we actually attempt
to invert the pyramid,

00:10:02.715 --> 00:10:04.716
where you have a large creative class,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.421
where almost everyone
can participate as an entrepreneur,

00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:10.390
an artist, as a researcher?

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.780
And I don't think that this is utopian.

00:10:12.804 --> 00:10:15.168
I really think that this
is all based on the idea

00:10:15.192 --> 00:10:17.376
that if we let people
tap into their potential

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.364
by mastering concepts,

00:10:19.388 --> 00:10:22.965
by being able to exercise agency
over their learning,

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:24.331
that they can get there.

00:10:24.672 --> 00:10:28.672
And when you think of it
as just a citizen of the world,

00:10:28.696 --> 00:10:29.959
it's pretty exciting.

00:10:29.983 --> 00:10:32.611
I mean, think about
the type of equity we can we have,

00:10:32.635 --> 00:10:35.839
and the rate at which civilization
could even progress.

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:38.552
And so, I'm pretty optimistic about it.

00:10:38.576 --> 00:10:42.139
I think it's going to be
a pretty exciting time to be alive.

00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:43.329
Thank you.

00:10:43.353 --> 00:10:48.830
(Applause)
