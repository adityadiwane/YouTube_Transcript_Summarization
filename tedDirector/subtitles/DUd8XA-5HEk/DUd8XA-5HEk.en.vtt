00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I want to start my talk today with two observations

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
about the human species.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and that's that our species, Homo sapiens,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
is actually really, really smart --

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
like, ridiculously smart --

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
like you're all doing things

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
that no other species on the planet does right now.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And this is, of course,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
not the first time you've probably recognized this.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
to point out things like the fact that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
when it comes to all things cerebral.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
But of course, there's a second observation about the human species

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
that I want to focus on a little bit more,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and that's the fact that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
even though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumb

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
when it comes to some aspects of our decision making.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
on any aspects of your own mistakes.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
But of course, just in the last two years

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
to pull the resources out of our environment

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
kind of just blow up in our face.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create --

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
these markets that were supposed to be foolproof --

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
But both of these two embarrassing examples, I think,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
about the mistakes that humans make,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
are really just the result of a couple bad apples

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
is that most of us, when put in certain contexts,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
will actually make very specific mistakes.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
The errors we make are actually predictable.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
We make them again and again.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And they're actually immune to lots of evidence.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
When we get negative feedback,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
we still, the next time we're face with a certain context,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
tend to make the same errors.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And so this has been a real puzzle to me

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
as a sort of scholar of human nature.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
What I'm most curious about is,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
how is a species that's as smart as we are

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
capable of such bad

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and such consistent errors all the time?

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Because we're a smart species,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
we can actually create all kinds of environments

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
that are super, super complicated,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
even though we've actually created them.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
We create financial markets that are super complex.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
in some sense makes sense that we actually

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
might mess certain things up.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
to the problem of human error.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
the kinds of technologies we can't deal with,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
the kinds of environments that are bad --

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
get rid of those, design things better,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
and we should be the noble species

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
that we expect ourselves to be.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
which is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
This is a hint that I've gotten

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
exactly the same way, over and over again.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
It feels like we might almost just be built

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
to make errors in certain ways.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
because, if it's us that's messed up,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and try to design things around it.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
What we need is a population

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
that's basically smart, can make lots of decisions,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
any of the things that might mess us up --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
no human technology, human culture,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
maybe even not human language.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
And so this is why we turned to these guys here.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
These guys are New World primates,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
which means they broke off from the human branch

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
about 35 million years ago.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
This means that your great, great, great great, great, great --

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
with about five million "greats" in there --

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
grandmother was probably the same great, great, great, great

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
grandmother with five million "greats" in there

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
as Holly up here.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
but albeit evolutionary, relative.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
The good news about Holly though is that

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
You know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
So she's the perfect test case.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans?

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Does she make the same mistakes as us?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Does she not learn from them? And so on.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
see if she messes these things up.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
First problem is just, well, where should we start?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
You know, where are we actually going to start with this?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
we said, hhmm, maybe we should

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
actually start in the financial domain.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Of course, that's when we hit a sort second problem --

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
a little bit more methodological --

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
which is that, maybe you guys don't know,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
if they don't actually use it?

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
and teach monkeys how to use money.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
So that's just what we did.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
of non-human currency.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
so we just called it a token.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
to actually use with humans,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
to actually buy different pieces of food.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
once you get home, it's actually pretty useless.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
It was useless to the monkeys at first

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
before they realized what they could do with it.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
They were these kind of weird things.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
But very quickly, the monkeys realized

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
that they could actually hand these tokens over

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
to different humans in the lab for some food.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
curious about these things -- doesn't know.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Hands it over, and then gets some food.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
at trading tokens with human salesman.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
So here's just a quick video of what this looks like.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
and waiting happily and getting her food.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
So the monkeys get really good at this.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
They're surprisingly good at this with very little training.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
The question is: is this anything like human money?

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Is this a market at all,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
by getting monkeys to do something,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
looking smart, but not really being smart.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
if this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
Well, you might actually imagine them

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
to do all the kinds of smart things

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
You might have them start paying attention to price,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
paying attention to how much they buy --

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Do the monkeys do anything like this?

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And so our monkey marketplace was born.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
The way this works is that

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
When they get a hankering for some treats,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
we actually allowed them a way out

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
Upon entering the market --

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
because, as the monkeys entered the door of the market,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
so they could actually trade the tokens

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
with one of these two guys here --

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
two different possible human salesmen

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
that they could actually buy stuff from.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
The salesmen were students from my lab.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
They dressed differently; they were different people.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
And over time, they did basically the same thing

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
so the monkeys could learn, you know,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
And you can see that each of the experimenters

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
is actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and that's what the monkey can for a single token.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
So everything costs one token,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
sometimes more grapes than others.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
But here's Honey.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
You can see Honey, very good market economist,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
goes with the guy who gives more.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
So not just Honey,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
They really cared about their monkey token dollar.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
they basically matched, not just qualitatively,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
but quantitatively with what we saw

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
humans doing in a real market.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
So much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And what we'd really thought we'd done

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
is like we'd actually introduced something

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
that, at least for the monkeys and us,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
works like a real financial currency.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
was any evidence of saving --

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
you know, just like our own species.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
and then went back to everyone else.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
The other thing we also spontaneously saw,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
embarrassingly enough,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
is spontaneous evidence of larceny.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity --

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
from each other, often from us --

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
but things we spontaneously saw.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
So we said, this looks bad.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
Can we actually see if the monkeys

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
One possibility is just kind of let

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
the monkey financial system play out,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
We were a little impatient so we wanted

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
to sort of speed things up a bit.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
So we said, let's actually give the monkeys

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
the same kinds of problems

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
that humans tend to get wrong

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
in certain kinds of economic challenges,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
or certain kinds of economic experiments.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
And so, since the best way to see how people go wrong

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
is to actually do it yourself,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
So imagine that right now

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
I handed each and every one of you

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Take these, put it in your wallet

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
Donate it, take it, and so on.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
And here's your choice: you can either be risky,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
If it comes up tails, you get nothing.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
I'm just going to give you 500 bucks.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
So see what your intuition is here.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
You might say, eh, that's not really irrational.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
People are a little risk-averse. So what?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinking

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
about the same problem

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
set up just a little bit differently.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And now imagine that I have you make another choice

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
But this time, it's a little bit worse.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
but you're going to get the same choice.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
You can either take a risky loss --

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing --

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your wallet

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
and give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
So maybe you're having the same intuitions

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
as the subjects that were actually tested in this,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
which is when presented with these options,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
people don't choose to play it safe.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
They actually tend to go a little risky.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
the same choice.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
But people's intuitions about how much risk to take

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
varies depending on where they started with.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
So what's going on?

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Well, it turns out that this seems to be the result

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
You really have to do work to figure out,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
well, one option's a thousand, 2,000;

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
one is 1,500.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
as options change from one time to another.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
This is all well and good, except that

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
changes in different directions

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
actually effect whether or not we think

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
options are good or not.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
And this leads to the second bias,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
which economists have called loss aversion.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
And this means that sometimes we'll actually

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
switch our preferences to avoid this.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
What you saw in that last scenario is that

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
subjects get risky

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
That means when we're in a risk mindset --

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
we actually become more risky,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
which can actually be really worrying.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer --

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
because they're evaluating them in relative terms.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house --

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
because they don't want to sell at a loss.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
The question we were interested in

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
is whether the monkeys show the same biases.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
would they do the same thing as people?

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choices

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time --

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
or guys who were risky --

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
they did things differently half the time.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And then we gave them options that were bonuses --

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
like you guys did in the first scenario --

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
so they actually have a chance more,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
or pieces where they were experiencing losses --

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
And so this is what this looks like.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
so it looks pretty good.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
The guy on the left is a safe bonus.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
Sometimes the monkeys get two extra.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
For a big bonus, now they get three.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
But this is the same choice you guys just faced.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
or do they want to be risky

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
and try to get a risky, but big, bonus,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
People here played it safe.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
Qualitatively and quantitatively,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
they choose exactly the same way as people,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
when tested in the same thing.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
Maybe we should see how they do with losses.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
And so we ran a second version of this.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
Now, the monkeys meet two guys

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
who aren't giving them bonuses;

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
they're actually giving them less than they expect.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
So they look like they're starting out with a big amount.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
They guy on the left is a safe loss.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
Every single time, he's going to take one of these away

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
and give the monkeys just two.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
the guy on the right is the risky loss.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
but sometimes he actually gives a big loss,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
taking away two to give the monkeys only one.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
And so what do the monkeys do?

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Again, same choice; they can play it safe

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
for always getting two grapes every single time,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
they do the same irrational thing that people do.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
They actually become more risky

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
depending on how the experimenters started.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
are evaluating things in relative terms

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
So what does all of this mean?

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
Well, what we've shown is that, first of all,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
and they do very similar things with it.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
They do some of the smart things we do,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
some of the kind of not so nice things we do,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
like steal it and so on.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
But they also do some of the irrational things we do.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
They systematically get things wrong

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
and in the same ways that we do.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
This is the first take-home message of the Talk,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
oh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
They're way cuter than the one at ... you know --

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
Don't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumb

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
as the human one you already have.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
A little bad for monkey investors.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
Because we've answered the question we started out with.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
And we started with the hope that maybe we can

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
sort of tweak our financial institutions,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
In fact, they might be due to the very nature

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
of our evolutionary history.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
You know, maybe it's not just humans

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
at the right side of this chain that's duncey.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260
And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results,

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
means that these duncey strategies

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
might be 35 million years old.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
That's a long time for a strategy

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
to potentially get changed around -- really, really old.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
What do we know about other old strategies like this?

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.260
Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
You know, think of our evolutionary predilection

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
You can't just shut that off.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.260
You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
We're just built differently.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
when humans are perceiving

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
different financial decisions.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red,

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
when you're watching your house price go down,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
you're not going to be able to see that

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
in anything but old evolutionary terms.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
This means that the biases

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.260
that lead investors to do badly,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
that lead to the foreclosure crisis

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
are going to be really hard to overcome.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
Well, the good news, I think,

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
which is that humans are not only smart;

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.260
we're really inspirationally smart

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.260
to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.260
We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations --

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
you know, I flew over here in an airplane.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
I didn't have to try to flap my wings.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
We actually have all of these cases

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.260
where we overcome our biological limitations

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.260
through technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.260
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
And here's the rub.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.260
It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.260
who refuses to be what he really is."

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
But the irony is that

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
it might only be in recognizing our limitations

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
that we can really actually overcome them.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.260
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations,

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.260
not necessarily as unovercomable,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.260
but to recognize them, accept them

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.260
and then use the world of design to actually figure them out.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.260
That might be the only way that we will really be able

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
to achieve our own human potential

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.260
and really be the noble species we hope to all be.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260
Thank you.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:39.260
(Applause)
