00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.463
I grew up in a very small country town

00:00:14.463 --> 00:00:15.763
in Victoria.

00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:20.180
I had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.580
I went to school, I hung out with my friends,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.966
I fought with my younger sisters.

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.755
It was all very normal.

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:31.927
And when I was 15, a member of my local community

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:33.347
approached my parents

00:00:33.347 --> 00:00:34.740
and wanted to nominate me

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.860
for a community achievement award.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.103
And my parents said, "Hm, that's really nice,

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:44.320
but there's kind of one glaring problem with that.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.254
She hasn't actually achieved anything." (Laughter)

00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:50.849
And they were right, you know.

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:53.835
I went to school, I got good marks,

00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:56.283
I had a very low-key after school job

00:00:56.283 --> 00:00:58.065
in my mum's hairdressing salon,

00:00:58.065 --> 00:00:59.863
and I spent a lot of time watching

00:00:59.863 --> 00:01:02.994
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Dawson's Creek."

00:01:02.994 --> 00:01:07.037
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.

00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:08.377
But they were right, you know.

00:01:08.377 --> 00:01:10.930
I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.611
at all.

00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:15.554
I wasn't doing anything that could
be considered an achievement

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:19.156
if you took disability out of the equation.

00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:23.022
Years later, I was on my second teaching round

00:01:23.022 --> 00:01:24.758
in a Melbourne high school,

00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:29.709
and I was about 20 minutes into
a year 11 legal studies class

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:31.488
when this boy put up his hand and said,

00:01:31.488 --> 00:01:35.732
"Hey miss, when are you going
to start doing your speech?"

00:01:35.732 --> 00:01:37.709
And I said, "What speech?"

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.013
You know, I'd been talking them

00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:41.909
about defamation law for a good 20 minutes.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.580
And he said, "You know, like,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.900
your motivational speaking.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.890
You know, when people in
wheelchairs come to school,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.813
they usually say, like, inspirational stuff?"

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:54.259
(Laughter)

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.557
"It's usually in the big hall."

00:01:58.557 --> 00:02:00.770
And that's when it dawned on me:

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.041
This kid had only ever experienced disabled people

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:07.699
as objects of inspiration.

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:09.560
We are not, to this kid --

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.861
and it's not his fault, I mean,

00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:12.672
that's true for many of us.

00:02:12.672 --> 00:02:16.418
For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers

00:02:16.418 --> 00:02:19.477
or our doctors or our manicurists.

00:02:19.477 --> 00:02:24.846
We're not real people. We are there to inspire.

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:28.352
And in fact, I am sitting on this stage

00:02:28.352 --> 00:02:31.434
looking like I do in this wheelchair,

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:34.367
and you are probably kind of expecting me

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:39.147
to inspire you. Right? (Laughter)

00:02:39.147 --> 00:02:41.990
Yeah.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.004
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.861
I'm going to disappoint you dramatically.

00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:49.030
I am not here to inspire you.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.607
I am here to tell you that we have been lied to

00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:53.574
about disability.

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.681
Yeah, we've been sold the lie

00:02:55.681 --> 00:03:00.886
that disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T.

00:03:00.886 --> 00:03:03.827
It's a bad thing, and to live with a disability

00:03:03.827 --> 00:03:05.973
makes you exceptional.

00:03:05.973 --> 00:03:08.888
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:11.517
make you exceptional.

00:03:11.517 --> 00:03:13.252
And in the past few years, we've been able

00:03:13.252 --> 00:03:15.875
to propagate this lie even further

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.149
via social media.

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.382
You may have seen images like this one:

00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:23.985
"The only disability in life is a bad attitude."

00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:29.326
Or this one: "Your excuse is invalid." Indeed.

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:35.686
Or this one: "Before you quit, try!"

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:37.342
These are just a couple of examples,

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.311
but there are a lot of these images out there.

00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.940
You know, you might have seen the one,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.689
the little girl with no hands

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.400
drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.120
You might have seen a child running

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.993
on carbon fiber prosthetic legs.

00:03:50.993 --> 00:03:52.344
And these images,

00:03:52.344 --> 00:03:53.970
there are lots of them out there,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.884
they are what we call inspiration porn.

00:03:57.884 --> 00:04:00.110
(Laughter)

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.328
And I use the term porn deliberately,

00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:05.477
because they objectify one group of people

00:04:05.477 --> 00:04:08.288
for the benefit of another group of people.

00:04:08.288 --> 00:04:11.167
So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.824
for the benefit of nondisabled people.

00:04:13.824 --> 00:04:15.952
The purpose of these images

00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:19.763
is to inspire you, to motivate you,

00:04:19.763 --> 00:04:21.838
so that we can look at them

00:04:21.838 --> 00:04:24.927
and think, "Well, however bad my life is,

00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:26.958
it could be worse.

00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.286
I could be that person."

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:33.662
But what if you are that person?

00:04:33.662 --> 00:04:35.750
I've lost count of the number of times that I've

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.218
been approached by strangers

00:04:38.218 --> 00:04:41.123
wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave

00:04:41.123 --> 00:04:42.880
or inspirational,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.539
and this was long before my work

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.593
had any kind of public profile.

00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:48.295
They were just kind of congratulating me

00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:50.001
for managing to get up in the morning

00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:54.009
and remember my own name. (Laughter)

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.547
And it is objectifying.

00:04:56.547 --> 00:04:58.640
These images, those images

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.571
objectify disabled people

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:03.496
for the benefit of nondisabled people.

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:06.110
They are there so that you can look at them

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.813
and think that things aren't so bad for you,

00:05:08.813 --> 00:05:12.960
to put your worries into perspective.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.881
And life as a disabled person

00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:17.965
is actually somewhat difficult.

00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:20.071
We do overcome some things.

00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:22.283
But the things that we're overcoming

00:05:22.283 --> 00:05:24.900
are not the things that you think they are.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.507
They are not things to do with our bodies.

00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:29.885
I use the term "disabled people" quite deliberately,

00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:34.083
because I subscribe to what's called
the social model of disability,

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:36.381
which tells us that we are more disabled

00:05:36.381 --> 00:05:40.295
by the society that we live in

00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:43.178
than by our bodies and our diagnoses.

00:05:43.178 --> 00:05:47.086
So I have lived in this body a long time.

00:05:47.086 --> 00:05:49.349
I'm quite fond of it.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.402
It does the things that I need it to do,

00:05:52.402 --> 00:05:55.695
and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity

00:05:55.695 --> 00:05:56.829
just as you have,

00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:59.853
and that's the thing about those
kids in those pictures as well.

00:05:59.853 --> 00:06:03.132
They're not doing anything out of the ordinary.

00:06:03.132 --> 00:06:05.481
They are just using their bodies

00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.790
to the best of their capacity.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.293
So is it really fair to objectify them

00:06:11.293 --> 00:06:13.016
in the way that we do,

00:06:13.016 --> 00:06:15.118
to share those images?

00:06:15.118 --> 00:06:19.641
People, when they say, "You're an inspiration,"

00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:22.926
they mean it as a compliment.

00:06:22.926 --> 00:06:24.292
And I know why it happens.

00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:26.564
It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold

00:06:26.564 --> 00:06:30.778
this lie that disability makes you exceptional.

00:06:30.778 --> 00:06:32.612
And it honestly doesn't.

00:06:32.612 --> 00:06:33.971
And I know what you're thinking.

00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:36.720
You know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.639
and you're thinking, "Jeez, Stella,

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.756
aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"

00:06:42.756 --> 00:06:44.850
And the thing is, I am.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.888
I learn from other disabled people all the time.

00:06:47.888 --> 00:06:52.827
I'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.

00:06:52.827 --> 00:06:55.982
I am learning that it's a genius idea

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.403
to use a pair of barbecue tongs

00:06:57.403 --> 00:07:03.160
to pick up things that you dropped. (Laughter)

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.681
I'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge

00:07:05.681 --> 00:07:10.266
your mobile phone battery from your chair battery.

00:07:10.266 --> 00:07:11.480
Genius.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.061
We are learning from each
others' strength and endurance,

00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.702
not against our bodies and our diagnoses,

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.506
but against a world that exceptionalizes

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:21.963
and objectifies us.

00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:24.598
I really think that this lie that we've been sold

00:07:24.598 --> 00:07:28.821
about disability is the greatest injustice.

00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:32.956
It makes life hard for us.

00:07:32.956 --> 00:07:36.829
And that quote, "The only disability in life

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:38.827
is a bad attitude,"

00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:41.954
the reason that that's bullshit

00:07:41.954 --> 00:07:43.575
is because it's just not true,

00:07:43.575 --> 00:07:46.237
because of the social model of disability.

00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:50.402
No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs

00:07:50.402 --> 00:07:55.348
has ever made it turn into a ramp.

00:07:55.348 --> 00:08:01.930
Never. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.810
Smiling at a television screen

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.641
isn't going to make closed captions appear

00:08:05.641 --> 00:08:07.374
for people who are deaf.

00:08:07.374 --> 00:08:09.836
No amount of standing
in the middle of a bookshop

00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:11.606
and radiating a positive attitude

00:08:11.606 --> 00:08:14.305
is going to turn all those books into braille.

00:08:14.305 --> 00:08:18.509
It's just not going to happen.

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:21.236
I really want to live in a world

00:08:21.236 --> 00:08:24.900
where disability is not the exception, but the norm.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.096
I want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl

00:08:27.096 --> 00:08:28.830
sitting in her bedroom

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.007
watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"

00:08:31.007 --> 00:08:33.545
isn't referred to as achieving anything

00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:35.811
because she's doing it sitting down.

00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:37.236
I want to live in a world

00:08:37.236 --> 00:08:40.361
where we don't have such low expectations

00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:41.910
of disabled people

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.236
that we are congratulated for getting out of bed

00:08:44.236 --> 00:08:47.033
and remembering our own names in the morning.

00:08:47.033 --> 00:08:50.454
I want to live in a world where
we value genuine achievement

00:08:50.454 --> 00:08:52.217
for disabled people,

00:08:52.217 --> 00:08:53.824
and I want to live in a world

00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:57.236
where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:59.589
is not one bit surprised

00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:02.747
that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.

00:09:02.747 --> 00:09:05.790
Disability doesn't make you exceptional,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.243
but questioning what you
think you know about it does.

00:09:09.243 --> 00:09:10.510
Thank you.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.469
(Applause)
