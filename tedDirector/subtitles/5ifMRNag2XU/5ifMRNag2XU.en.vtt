00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.539
Hi, kids.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.099
(Laughter)

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.683
I'm 71.

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:20.778
(Applause)

00:00:20.778 --> 00:00:23.580
My husband is 76.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.040
My parents are in their late 90s,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.730
and Olivia, the dog, is 16.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.130
So let's talk about aging.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.548
Let me tell you how I feel

00:00:33.548 --> 00:00:35.875
when I see my wrinkles in the mirror

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:39.200
and I realize that some parts of me have dropped

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.832
and I can't find them down there.

00:00:41.832 --> 00:00:42.970
(Laughter)

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.169
Mary Oliver says in one of her poems,

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:49.848
"Tell me, what is it that you plan to do

00:00:49.848 --> 00:00:53.531
with your one wild and precious life?"

00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:57.834
Me, I intend to live passionately.

00:00:57.834 --> 00:00:59.846
When do we start aging?

00:00:59.846 --> 00:01:02.233
Society decides when we are old,

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:06.464
usually around 65, when we get Medicare,

00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:09.230
but we really start aging at birth.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.190
We are aging right now,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.383
and we all experience it differently.

00:01:14.383 --> 00:01:17.825
We all feel younger than our real age,

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:19.996
because the spirit never ages.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.291
I am still 17.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.820
Sophia Loren. Look at her.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.693
She says that everything you see

00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:31.976
she owes to spaghetti.

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:34.464
I tried it and gained 10 pounds

00:01:34.464 --> 00:01:36.566
in the wrong places.

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:41.718
But attitude, aging is also attitude and health.

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:45.418
But my real mentor in this journey of aging

00:01:45.418 --> 00:01:46.959
is Olga Murray.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.749
This California girl at 60

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:53.450
started working in Nepal to save young girls

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.509
from domestic bondage.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.900
At 88, she has saved 12,000 girls,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.393
and she has changed the culture in the country.

00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:03.383
(Applause)

00:02:03.383 --> 00:02:06.830
Now it is illegal for fathers

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.986
to sell their daughters into servitude.

00:02:09.986 --> 00:02:12.513
She has also founded orphanages

00:02:12.513 --> 00:02:14.543
and nutritional clinics.

00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:16.196
She is always happy

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:19.697
and eternally young.

00:02:19.697 --> 00:02:23.725
What have I lost in the last decades?

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:25.896
People, of course,

00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:29.743
places, and the boundless energy of my youth,

00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:31.588
and I'm beginning to lose independence,

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:33.973
and that scares me.

00:02:33.973 --> 00:02:38.146
Ram Dass says that dependency hurts,

00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:41.039
but if you accept it, there is less suffering.

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:43.175
After a very bad stroke,

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:46.527
his ageless soul watches the changes

00:02:46.527 --> 00:02:48.788
in the body with tenderness,

00:02:48.788 --> 00:02:53.300
and he is grateful to the people who help him.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.370
What have I gained?

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.431
Freedom: I don't have to prove anything anymore.

00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.996
I'm not stuck in the idea of who I was,

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:04.126
who I want to be,

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:07.990
or what other people expect me to be.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.040
I don't have to please men anymore,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.888
only animals.

00:03:14.888 --> 00:03:18.430
I keep telling my superego to back off

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.612
and let me enjoy what I still have.

00:03:20.612 --> 00:03:22.671
My body may be falling apart,

00:03:22.671 --> 00:03:26.125
but my brain is not, yet.

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:28.172
I love my brain.

00:03:28.172 --> 00:03:31.130
I feel lighter.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.407
I don't carry grudges, ambition, vanity,

00:03:36.407 --> 00:03:38.262
none of the deadly sins that are not even

00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:40.456
worth the trouble.

00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:42.200
It's great to let go.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.290
I should have started sooner.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.036
And I also feel softer

00:03:47.036 --> 00:03:51.060
because I'm not scared of being vulnerable.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.750
I don't see it as weakness anymore.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.274
And I've gained spirituality.

00:03:57.274 --> 00:03:59.197
I'm aware that before,

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:01.493
death was in the neighborhood.

00:04:01.493 --> 00:04:06.794
Now, it's next door, or in my house.

00:04:06.794 --> 00:04:09.263
I try to live mindfully

00:04:09.263 --> 00:04:11.389
and be present in the moment.

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.150
By the way, the Dalai Lama

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.270
is someone who has aged beautifully,

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.677
but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate?

00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:21.261
(Laughter)

00:04:24.676 --> 00:04:27.206
Meditation helps.

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:31.173
(Video) Child: Ommm. Ommm. Ommm.

00:04:31.173 --> 00:04:33.110
Isabel Allende: Ommm. Ommm. There it is.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.165
And it's good to start early.

00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:38.836
You know, for a vain female like myself,

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:42.233
it's very hard to age in this culture.

00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:46.958
Inside, I feel good, I feel charming, seductive, sexy.

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.890
Nobody else sees that. (Laughter)

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.110
I'm invisible.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.754
I want to be the center of attention.

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:56.812
I hate to be invisible.

00:04:56.812 --> 00:04:58.893
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:58.893 --> 00:05:00.992
This is Grace Dammann.

00:05:00.992 --> 00:05:03.415
She has been in a wheelchair for six years

00:05:03.415 --> 00:05:05.780
after a terrible car accident.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.637
She says that there is nothing more sensual

00:05:09.637 --> 00:05:11.137
than a hot shower,

00:05:11.137 --> 00:05:12.934
that every drop of water

00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:16.144
is a blessing to the senses.

00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:18.512
She doesn't see herself as disabled.

00:05:18.512 --> 00:05:22.518
In her mind, she's still surfing in the ocean.

00:05:22.518 --> 00:05:27.152
Ethel Seiderman, a feisty, beloved activist

00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:29.886
in the place where I live in California.

00:05:29.886 --> 00:05:33.778
She wears red patent shoes,

00:05:33.778 --> 00:05:36.030
and her mantra is that one scarf is nice

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.815
but two is better.

00:05:37.815 --> 00:05:40.618
She has been a widow for nine years,

00:05:40.618 --> 00:05:42.650
but she's not looking for another mate.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.735
She says that there is only a limited number

00:05:45.735 --> 00:05:47.985
of ways you can screw —

00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:49.999
well, she says it in another way —

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:51.967
and she has tried them all.

00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:55.006
(Laughter)

00:05:55.006 --> 00:05:56.291
I, on the other hand,

00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:59.909
I still have erotic fantasies with Antonio Banderas —

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.187
(Laughter) —

00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:05.537
and my poor husband has to put up with it.

00:06:05.537 --> 00:06:07.795
So how can I stay passionate?

00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:11.747
I cannot will myself to be passionate at 71.

00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:13.986
I have been training for some time,

00:06:13.986 --> 00:06:17.743
and when I feel flat and bored, I fake it.

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:20.409
Attitude, attitude.

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.143
How do I train? I train by saying yes

00:06:23.143 --> 00:06:24.954
to whatever comes my way:

00:06:24.954 --> 00:06:27.732
drama, comedy, tragedy,

00:06:27.732 --> 00:06:30.724
love, death, losses.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.806
Yes to life.

00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:36.237
And I train by trying to stay in love.

00:06:36.237 --> 00:06:37.690
It doesn't always work,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.544
but you cannot blame me for trying.

00:06:40.544 --> 00:06:43.043
And, on a final note,

00:06:43.043 --> 00:06:47.030
retirement in Spanish is jubilación.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.777
Jubilation. Celebration.

00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:51.263
We have paid our dues.

00:06:51.263 --> 00:06:53.340
We have contributed to society.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.673
Now it's our time, and it's a great time.

00:06:56.673 --> 00:06:59.710
Unless you are ill or very poor,

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.231
you have choices.

00:07:01.231 --> 00:07:03.884
I have chosen to stay passionate,

00:07:03.884 --> 00:07:06.483
engaged with an open heart.

00:07:06.483 --> 00:07:09.250
I am working on it every day.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.682
Want to join me?

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.345
Thank you.

00:07:14.345 --> 00:07:19.644
(Applause)

00:07:19.644 --> 00:07:23.100
June Cohen: So Isabel —
IA: Thank you.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.461
JC: First of all,

00:07:26.461 --> 00:07:29.210
I never like to presume to
speak for the TED community,

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.388
but I would like to tell you that I have a feeling

00:07:31.388 --> 00:07:33.222
we can all agree that you are still charming,

00:07:33.222 --> 00:07:35.191
seductive and sexy. Yes?

00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:37.686
IA: Aww, thank you.
(Applause)

00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:40.172
JC: Hands down.
IA: No, it's makeup.

00:07:40.172 --> 00:07:41.612
Moderator: Now, would it be awkward

00:07:41.612 --> 00:07:44.132
if I asked you a follow-up question
about your erotic fantasies?

00:07:44.132 --> 00:07:45.810
IA: Oh, of course. About what?

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.811
(Laughter)

00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:49.847
Moderator: About your erotic fantasies.
IA: With Antonio Banderas.

00:07:49.847 --> 00:07:52.626
Moderator: I was just wondering
if you have anything more to share.

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:57.800
IA: Well, one of them is that — (Laughter)

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.929
One of them is that I place a naked Antonio Banderas

00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:02.862
on a Mexican tortilla,

00:08:02.862 --> 00:08:06.552
I slather him with guacamole and salsa,

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:10.051
I roll him up, and I eat him. (Laughter)

00:08:10.051 --> 00:08:11.844
Thank you.

00:08:11.844 --> 00:08:15.210
(Applause)
