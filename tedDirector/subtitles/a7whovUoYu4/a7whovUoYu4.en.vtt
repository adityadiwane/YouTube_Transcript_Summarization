00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:15.271
The child's symptoms begin

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:18.932
with mild fever, headache, muscle pains,

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:21.043
followed by vomiting and diarrhea,

00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:25.167
then bleeding from the mouth,
nose and gums.

00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:31.100
Death follows in the form of organ failure
from low blood pressure.

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:33.084
Sounds familiar?

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:36.191
If you're thinking this is Ebola,

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:38.092
actually, in this case, it's not.

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:43.931
It's an extreme form of dengue fever,
a mosquito-born disease

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:48.016
which also does not have
an effective therapy or a vaccine,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.299
and kills 22,000 people each year.

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.894
That is actually twice
the number of people

00:00:54.918 --> 00:00:56.947
that have been killed by Ebola

00:00:56.971 --> 00:01:00.010
in the nearly four decades
that we've known about it.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.439
As for measles, so much
in the news recently,

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:08.285
the death toll is actually tenfold higher.

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:11.349
Yet for the last year,

00:01:11.373 --> 00:01:16.114
it has been Ebola that has stolen
all of the headlines and the fear.

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:19.856
Clearly, there is something
deeply rooted about it,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.759
something which scares us
and fascinates us

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:24.355
more than other diseases.

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:26.490
But what is it, exactly?

00:01:27.357 --> 00:01:29.586
Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.087
but if you do, the risk
of a horrible death is high.

00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:34.849
Why?

00:01:34.873 --> 00:01:39.689
Because right now, we don't have any
effective therapy or vaccine available.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.276
And so, that's the clue.

00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:44.652
We may have it someday.

00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:48.780
So we rightfully fear Ebola,

00:01:48.804 --> 00:01:53.222
because it doesn't kill
as many people as other diseases.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:59.246
In fact, it's much less transmissible
than viruses such as flu or measles.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.088
We fear Ebola because of the fact
that it kills us and we can't treat it.

00:02:05.112 --> 00:02:08.500
We fear the certain inevitability
that comes with Ebola.

00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:14.102
Ebola has this inevitability
that seems to defy modern medical science.

00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:16.261
But wait a second, why is that?

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:19.607
We've known about Ebola since 1976.

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:22.108
We've known what it's capable of.

00:02:22.132 --> 00:02:24.762
We've had ample opportunity to study it

00:02:24.786 --> 00:02:27.174
in the 24 outbreaks that have occurred.

00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:31.967
And in fact, we've actually had
vaccine candidates available now

00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:33.348
for more than a decade.

00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:38.295
Why is that those vaccines
are just going into clinical trials now?

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.764
This goes to the fundamental
problem we have

00:02:41.788 --> 00:02:44.792
with vaccine development
for infectious diseases.

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:46.956
It goes something like this:

00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:50.786
The people most at risk for these diseases

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.969
are also the ones least able
to pay for vaccines.

00:02:55.858 --> 00:02:59.257
This leaves little in the way
of market incentives

00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:02.245
for manufacturers to develop vaccines,

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.989
unless there are large numbers of people
who are at risk in wealthy countries.

00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:09.902
It's simply too commercially risky.

00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:15.408
As for Ebola, there is absolutely
no market at all,

00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:21.060
so the only reason we have two vaccines
in late-stage clinical trials now,

00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:23.748
is actually because
of a somewhat misguided fear.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.744
Ebola was relatively ignored

00:03:27.768 --> 00:03:32.309
until September 11
and the anthrax attacks,

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.867
when all of a sudden,
people perceived Ebola

00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:37.064
as, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon.

00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:41.607
Why is it that the Ebola vaccine
wasn't fully developed at this point?

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:44.763
Well, partially, because
it was really difficult --

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:47.436
or thought to be difficult --
to weaponize the virus,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.585
but mainly because
of the financial risk in developing it.

00:03:53.028 --> 00:03:54.822
And this is really the point.

00:03:55.718 --> 00:03:58.238
The sad reality is, we develop vaccines

00:03:58.262 --> 00:04:02.134
not based upon the risk
the pathogen poses to people,

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:06.268
but on how economically risky it is
to develop these vaccines.

00:04:06.887 --> 00:04:09.796
Vaccine development
is expensive and complicated.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.891
It can cost hundreds
of millions of dollars

00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:16.223
to take even a well-known antigen
and turn it into a viable vaccine.

00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:19.455
Fortunately for diseases like Ebola,

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.869
there are things we can do
to remove some of these barriers.

00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:26.933
The first is to recognize
when there's a complete market failure.

00:04:27.314 --> 00:04:30.348
In that case, if we want vaccines,

00:04:30.372 --> 00:04:35.381
we have to provide incentives
or some type of subsidy.

00:04:36.197 --> 00:04:40.537
We also need to do a better job
at being able to figure out

00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:42.919
which are the diseases
that most threaten us.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.175
By creating capabilities within countries,
we then create the ability

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.816
for those countries to create
epidemiological and laboratory networks

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.109
which are capable of collecting
and categorizing these pathogens.

00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:00.379
The data from that then can be used

00:05:00.403 --> 00:05:03.682
to understand the geographic
and genetic diversity,

00:05:03.706 --> 00:05:06.342
which then can be used
to help us understand

00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:10.009
how these are being changed
immunologically,

00:05:10.033 --> 00:05:12.357
and what type of reactions they promote.

00:05:13.198 --> 00:05:15.525
So these are the things that can be done,

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:19.233
but to do this, if we want to deal
with a complete market failure,

00:05:19.257 --> 00:05:24.681
we have to change the way
we view and prevent infectious diseases.

00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:28.892
We have to stop waiting
until we see evidence

00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:33.720
of a disease becoming a global threat
before we consider it as one.

00:05:34.617 --> 00:05:36.856
So, for Ebola,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.771
the paranoid fear
of an infectious disease,

00:05:40.795 --> 00:05:45.517
followed by a few cases
transported to wealthy countries,

00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:48.141
led the global community to come together,

00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:51.670
and with the work
of dedicated vaccine companies,

00:05:51.694 --> 00:05:53.360
we now have these:

00:05:54.465 --> 00:06:00.472
Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials
in the Ebola countries --

00:06:00.496 --> 00:06:06.001
(Applause)

00:06:06.025 --> 00:06:10.009
and a pipeline of vaccines
that are following behind.

00:06:10.763 --> 00:06:13.855
Every year, we spend billions of dollars,

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:18.952
keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines
permanently patrolling the oceans

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:22.967
to protect us from a threat
that almost certainly will never happen.

00:06:23.527 --> 00:06:26.463
And yet, we spend virtually nothing

00:06:26.487 --> 00:06:31.514
to prevent something as tangible
and evolutionarily certain

00:06:31.538 --> 00:06:33.716
as epidemic infectious diseases.

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.904
And make no mistake about it --
it's not a question of "if," but "when."

00:06:38.928 --> 00:06:41.840
These bugs are going to continue to evolve

00:06:41.864 --> 00:06:43.867
and they're going to threaten the world.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.624
And vaccines are our best defense.

00:06:47.108 --> 00:06:51.417
So if we want to be able to prevent
epidemics like Ebola,

00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:55.887
we need to take on the risk
of investing in vaccine development

00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:57.949
and in stockpile creation.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.385
And we need to view this, then,
as the ultimate deterrent --

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:05.529
something we make sure is available,

00:07:05.553 --> 00:07:09.192
but at the same time,
praying we never have to use it.

00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:10.772
Thank you.

00:07:10.796 --> 00:07:15.074
(Applause)
