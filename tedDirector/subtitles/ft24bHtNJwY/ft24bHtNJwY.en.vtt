00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.700
I thought in getting up to my TED wish

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.700
I would try to begin by putting in 
perspective what I try to do

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.700
and how it fits with what they try to do.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.700
We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.700
but insufficient in three major ways.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.700
It is, first of all, profoundly unequal:

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.700
half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day;

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.700
a billion people with no access to clean water;

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.700
two and a half billion no access to sanitation;

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.700
a billion going to bed hungry every night;

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.700
one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.700
and the variety of infections associated with dirty water --

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.700
80 percent of them under five years of age.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.700
Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.700
In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.700
five years of productivity growth in the workplace,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.700
but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.700
dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.700
The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.700
So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us --

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.700
which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.700
for a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.700
It is also unstable.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.700
Unstable because of the threats of terror,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.700
weapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.700
and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.700
And perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.700
because of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.700
When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.700
and the grandchildren I hope to have,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.700
it is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.700
interdependence to integrated communities -- locally, nationally and globally --

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.700
that share the characteristics of all successful communities:

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.700
a broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.700
a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.700
and a genuine sense of belonging.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.700
All easier said than done.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.700
When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.700
I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.700
I think the thing that troubled the British most

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.700
was that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.700
whose religious and political identities were more important to them

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.700
than the people they grew up with, went to school with,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.700
worked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.700
In other words, they thought their differences

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.700
were more important than their common humanity.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.700
It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.700
Into this mix, people like us, who are not in public office,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.700
have more power to do good than at any time in history,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.700
because more than half the world's people

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.700
live under governments they voted in and can vote out.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.700
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.700
Because primarily of the power of the Internet,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.700
people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.700
that can change the world for some public good if they all agree.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.700
When the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.700
30 percent of our households gave.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.700
Half of them gave over the Internet.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.700
The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.700
And thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.700
They, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous power

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.700
to affect the lives of our fellow human beings.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.700
When I became president in 1993,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.700
there were none of these organizations in Russia.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.700
There are now a couple of hundred thousand.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.700
None in India. There are now at least a half a million active.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.700
None in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.700
probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:21.700
When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.700
and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.700
and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.700
that I could still have an impact on.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.700
I wanted to focus on activities

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.700
that would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.700
bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world,

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.700
but to do it in a way that would either use

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.700
whatever particular skills we could put together in our group

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.700
to change the way some public good function was performed

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.700
so that it would sweep across the world more.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.700
You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.700
And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.700
and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight,

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.700
Ira Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.700
He's over there.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.700
(Applause)

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.700
When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean,

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.700
to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis,

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.700
generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.700
If you bought them in vast bulks,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.700
you could get them at a little under 400 dollars.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.700
The first country we went to work in, the Bahamas,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.700
was paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.700
The market was so terribly disorganized

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.700
that they were buying this medicine through two agents

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.700
who were gigging them sevenfold.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.700
So the very first week we were working,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.700
we got the price down to 500 dollars.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.700
And all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.700
for the same amount of money.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.700
Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines,

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.700
one of whom was cited in the film,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.700
and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.700
because even at 500 dollars, these drugs

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.700
were being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.700
So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.700
and the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume,

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.700
absolutely certain-payment business.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.700
I joked that the main contribution we made

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.700
to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.700
to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.700
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.700
And pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.700
Now we can get it for about 100 dollars.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.700
Children's medicine was 600 dollars,

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.700
because nobody could afford to buy any of it.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.700
We negotiated it down to 190.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.700
Then, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.700
to create a something called UNITAID,

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.700
got a bunch of other countries to help.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.700
That children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.700
The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.700
of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.700
are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.700
for people and deliver this medicine.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.700
We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.700
We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.700
with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.700
and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.700
We just reorganized the markets.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.700
And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.700
somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.700
And that is now what we're trying to do,

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.700
and working with this large cities group to fight climate change,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.700
to negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable cities

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.700
which generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases,

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.700
to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.700
in a way that is good economics.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.700
And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden,

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.700
is a mystery to me.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.700
I think it's a bird's nest on the ground.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.700
When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.700
for the "Inconvenient Truth" movie, I was thrilled,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.700
but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.700
For those of you who saw "An Inconvenient Truth,"

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.700
the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.700
which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.700
if we don't do anything, here's where they could go.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.700
And then there are six different categories

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.700
of things we can do to change the trajectory.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.700
We need a movie on those six categories.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.700
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.700
and to organize yourselves around it.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.700
So we're trying to do that.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.700
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.700
Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.700
It has been my experience in working in developing countries

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.700
that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.700
well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption --

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:35.700
I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.700
and feeds corruption.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.700
We now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.700
AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.700
Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.700
and in a total of 62 countries,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.700
and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.700
But the money is there to reach others.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.700
The systems are not there to reach the people.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:13.700
So what we have been trying to do,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:19.700
working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places --

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.700
but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight --

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:29.700
is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.700
that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases,

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.700
maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.700
poor people are grappling with in the developing world,

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.700
that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda,

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.700
and then will be a model that could literally

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.700
be implemented in any other poor country in the world.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.700
And the test is: one, will it do the job?

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.700
Will it provide high quality care?

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.700
And two, will it do it at a price

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.700
that will enable the country to sustain a health care system

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.700
without foreign donors after five to 10 years?

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.700
Because the longer I deal with these problems,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.700
the more convinced I am that we have to --

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.700
whether it's economics, health, education, whatever --

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.700
we have to build systems.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.700
And the absence of systems that function

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.700
break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.700
You think about whatever your life has been,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.700
however many obstacles you have faced in your life,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.700
at critical junctures you always knew

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.700
there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.700
and the result you achieved.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:39.700
In a world with no systems, with chaos,

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.700
everything becomes a guerilla struggle,

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.700
and this predictability is not there.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.700
And it becomes almost impossible to save lives,

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.700
educate kids, develop economies, whatever.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.700
The person, in my view,

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.700
who has done the best job of this in the health care area,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.700
of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.700
who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group,

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.700
Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started,

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.700
but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.700
and other places around the world.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.700
As poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active --

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.700
and they serve a catchment area far greater

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.700
than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve --

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:34.700
since 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.700
And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.700
So when we decided to work in Rwanda

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.700
on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.700
we wanted to build a healthcare network,

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.700
because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994,

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.700
and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.700
So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.700
Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.700
and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country,

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.700
number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.700
that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years,

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.700
and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.700
to any other poor country anywhere in the world.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.700
And so we have set about doing that.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.700
Now, we started working together 18 months ago.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.700
And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza,

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.700
which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda,

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:46.700
with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.700
We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti:

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.700
he develops and trains paid community health workers

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:00.700
who are able to identify health problems,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.700
ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.700
and take their medicine regularly,

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:13.700
who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation,

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.700
providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.700
if they have problems of the severity that require it.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.700
The procedures that make this work have been perfected,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.700
as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.700
in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:39.700
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.700
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.700
has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country,

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.700
and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.700
I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.700
We have about 500 people around the world

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.700
working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing --

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.700
just for transportation, room and board.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.700
And then we have others working in these other related programs.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.700
Our business plan in Rwanda

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.700
was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble,

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.700
who is an unusually gifted woman,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.700
but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.700
She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.700
She was CEO of a successful e-venture --

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.700
she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures --

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.700
and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.700
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.700
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.700
that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.700
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.700
she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:03.700
When we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.700
had stunted growth due to malnutrition.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:14.700
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.700
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.700
Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.700
because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation --

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.700
all entirely preventable and treatable.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.700
Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses --

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.700
again, all preventable and treatable.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.700
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.700
Within the first 18 months, the following things happened:

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.700
we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.700
That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.700
Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.700
stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.700
That's lower than the figure in the United States.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.700
Less than three-tenths of one percent

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.700
had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.700
400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:24.700
and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.700
That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.700
About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.700
About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it --

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.700
in just 18 months, up from zero when we started.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.700
43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.700
to prevent malnutrition and early death

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.700
are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.700
We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.700
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.700
that we have renovated along with four other clinics,

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.700
complete with solar power generators, good lab technology.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.700
We now are treating 325 people a month,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.700
despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.700
And the most important thing is

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.700
because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:33.700
we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.700
for between five and six percent of GDP,

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.700
and that the government could sustain that

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.700
without depending on foreign aid after five or six years.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.700
And for those of you who understand healthcare economics

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.700
you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.700
on health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 --

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.700
but that's a story for another day.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.700
(Laughter)

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.700
We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.700
and our Foundation folks to scale this system up.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:16.700
We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.700
And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique,

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.700
Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing:

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.700
to save as many lives as quickly as we can,

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.700
but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.700
and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.700
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses,

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.700
health administration and community health workers throughout the country,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.700
to set up the information technology, the solar energy,

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.700
the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.700
But over a five- to 10-year period,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.700
we will take down the need for outside assistance

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.700
and eventually it will be phased out.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:03.700
My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.700
a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda,

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.700
that can be a model for Africa,

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.700
and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:20.700
My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.700
with more partners and fewer terrorists,

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.700
with more productive citizens and fewer haters,

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.700
a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:38.700
It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.700
where we also have a major economic development project

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.700
in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist,

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.700
where last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs,

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:55.700
cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.700
and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.700
in crop yields with the farmers.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:07.700
These people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me,

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.700
helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:17.700
We're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.700
We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.700
I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.700
to the 35 percent of the people that have no access,

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.700
but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects,

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.700
the Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson,

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.700
in preserving their topsoil.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.700
There's a couple of guys from southern farming families --

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.700
the first thing I did when I went out to this place

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.700
was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.700
and see what they'd done with it.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.700
We have a chance here to prove that a country

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.700
that almost slaughtered itself out of existence

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:06.700
can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:13.700
and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:19.700
I am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.700
We could use some more help to do this,

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.700
but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.700
in Rwanda -- in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income,

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.700
one that could save hundreds of millions of lives

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:43.700
over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.700
It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.700
Thank you and God bless you.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:24:02.700
(Applause)
