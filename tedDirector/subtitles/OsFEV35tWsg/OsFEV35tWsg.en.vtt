00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.350
Philosophers, dramatists, theologians

00:00:16.374 --> 00:00:18.580
have grappled with
this question for centuries:

00:00:18.604 --> 00:00:20.136
what makes people go wrong?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.136
Interestingly, I asked this question
when I was a little kid.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.216
I grew up in the South Bronx,
inner-city ghetto in New York,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.723
and I was surrounded by evil,

00:00:27.747 --> 00:00:30.303
as all kids are who grew up
in an inner city.

00:00:30.327 --> 00:00:32.652
And I had friends
who were really good kids,

00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:36.968
who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde
scenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:00:36.992 --> 00:00:40.136
That is, they took drugs,
got in trouble, went to jail.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.019
Some got killed, and some did it
without drug assistance.

00:00:44.448 --> 00:00:47.242
So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson,
that wasn't fiction.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.490
The only question is,
what was in the juice?

00:00:49.514 --> 00:00:53.136
And more importantly, that line
between good and evil --

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.628
which privileged people like to think
is fixed and impermeable,

00:00:56.652 --> 00:00:59.325
with them on the good side,
the others on the bad side --

00:00:59.349 --> 00:01:02.412
I knew that line was movable,
and it was permeable.

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:04.779
Good people could be
seduced across that line,

00:01:04.803 --> 00:01:09.007
and under good and some rare
circumstances, bad kids could recover

00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:11.327
with help, with reform,
with rehabilitation.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.637
So I want to begin
with this wonderful illusion

00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:16.935
by [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.820
If you look at it and focus on the white,
what you see is a world full of angels.

00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:23.412
But let's look more deeply, and as we do,

00:01:23.436 --> 00:01:26.457
what appears is the demons,
the devils in the world.

00:01:26.992 --> 00:01:28.373
That tells us several things.

00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:31.505
One, the world is, was, will always
be filled with good and evil,

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:34.577
because good and evil is the yin and yang
of the human condition.

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:35.887
It tells me something else.

00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:38.939
If you remember,
God's favorite angel was Lucifer.

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:41.887
Apparently, Lucifer means "the light."

00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:44.637
It also means "the morning star,"
in some scripture.

00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:47.866
And apparently, he disobeyed God,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.382
and that's the ultimate
disobedience to authority.

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:55.904
And when he did, Michael, the archangel,
was sent to kick him out of heaven

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:57.931
along with the other fallen angels.

00:01:57.955 --> 00:02:01.136
And so Lucifer descends into hell,
becomes Satan,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
becomes the devil, and the force
of evil in the universe begins.

00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:08.653
Paradoxically, it was God
who created hell as a place to store evil.

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:11.517
He didn't do a good job
of keeping it there though.

00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:16.130
So, this arc of the cosmic transformation
of God's favorite angel into the Devil,

00:02:16.154 --> 00:02:19.798
for me, sets the context
for understanding human beings

00:02:19.822 --> 00:02:24.136
who are transformed from good,
ordinary people into perpetrators of evil.

00:02:24.737 --> 00:02:28.764
So the Lucifer effect,
although it focuses on the negatives --

00:02:28.788 --> 00:02:31.443
the negatives that people can become,

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:33.429
not the negatives that people are --

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.807
leads me to a psychological definition.

00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:38.804
Evil is the exercise of power.

00:02:38.828 --> 00:02:41.067
And that's the key: it's about power.

00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:43.656
To intentionally harm
people psychologically,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.410
to hurt people physically,
to destroy people mortally, or ideas,

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:49.628
and to commit crimes against humanity.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.446
If you Google "evil," a word that should
surely have withered by now,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.136
you come up with 136 million hits
in a third of a second.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.658
A few years ago -- I am sure
all of you were shocked, as I was,

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:08.136
with the revelation of American soldiers
abusing prisoners in a strange place

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.136
in a controversial war,
Abu Ghraib in Iraq.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.167
And these were men and women

00:03:13.191 --> 00:03:17.478
who were putting prisoners
through unbelievable humiliation.

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:19.946
I was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.136
because I had seen
those same visual parallels

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.562
when I was the prison superintendent
of the Stanford Prison Study.

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:28.301
Immediately the Bush
administration military said what?

00:03:28.681 --> 00:03:31.181
What all administrations say
when there's a scandal:

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:33.055
"Don't blame us. It's not the system.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.479
It's the few bad apples,
the few rogue soldiers."

00:03:35.503 --> 00:03:38.534
My hypothesis is,
American soldiers are good, usually.

00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:40.619
Maybe it was the barrel that was bad.

00:03:40.643 --> 00:03:43.136
But how am I going to deal
with that hypothesis?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.680
I became an expert witness
for one of the guards,

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:47.847
Sergeant Chip Frederick,
and in that position,

00:03:47.871 --> 00:03:50.784
I had access to the dozen
investigative reports.

00:03:50.808 --> 00:03:52.608
I had access to him.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:55.933
I could study him, have him come
to my home, get to know him,

00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:59.364
do psychological analysis to see,
was he a good apple or bad apple.

00:03:59.388 --> 00:04:03.299
And thirdly, I had access
to all of the 1,000 pictures

00:04:03.323 --> 00:04:04.536
that these soldiers took.

00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:07.535
These pictures are
of a violent or sexual nature.

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.518
All of them come from the cameras
of American soldiers.

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.828
Because everybody has
a digital camera or cell phone camera,

00:04:13.852 --> 00:04:16.186
they took pictures of everything,
more than 1,000.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.164
And what I've done is I organized them
into various categories.

00:04:19.188 --> 00:04:24.127
But these are by United States
military police, army reservists.

00:04:24.637 --> 00:04:28.119
They are not soldiers prepared
for this mission at all.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:31.816
And it all happened in a single place,
Tier 1-A, on the night shift.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.041
Why?

00:04:33.065 --> 00:04:35.667
Tier 1-A was the center
for military intelligence.

00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:37.667
It was the interrogation hold.

00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:38.892
The CIA was there.

00:04:38.916 --> 00:04:42.074
Interrogators from
Titan Corporation, all there,

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:44.884
and they're getting no information
about the insurgency.

00:04:44.908 --> 00:04:47.378
So they're going to put pressure
on these soldiers,

00:04:47.402 --> 00:04:49.122
military police, to cross the line,

00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:52.136
give them permission to break
the will of the enemy,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.637
to prepare them for interrogation,
to soften them up,

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:55.887
to take the gloves off.

00:04:55.911 --> 00:04:59.039
Those are the euphemisms,
and this is how it was interpreted.

00:04:59.794 --> 00:05:01.564
Let's go down to that dungeon.

00:05:03.445 --> 00:05:04.754
(Typewriting)

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:10.787
[Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses 2008

00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:17.605

and graphic depictions of violence]

00:05:18.338 --> 00:05:19.471

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:48.585
(Bells end)

00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:51.025
So, pretty horrific.

00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:55.308
That's one of the visual
illustrations of evil.

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.093
And it should not have escaped you

00:06:57.117 --> 00:07:00.354
that the reason I paired
the prisoner with his arms out

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:03.136
with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.742
is that that prisoner was mentally ill.

00:07:05.766 --> 00:07:08.119
That prisoner covered himself
with shit every day,

00:07:08.143 --> 00:07:10.561
they had to roll him in dirt
so he wouldn't stink.

00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:12.933
But the guards ended up
calling him "Shit Boy."

00:07:12.957 --> 00:07:17.136
What was he doing in that prison
rather than in some mental institution?

00:07:17.657 --> 00:07:20.372
In any event, here's former
Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.

00:07:20.396 --> 00:07:23.206
He comes down and says,
"I want to know, who is responsible?

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.609
Who are the bad apples?"

00:07:24.633 --> 00:07:26.041
Well, that's a bad question.

00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:28.686
You have to reframe it and ask,
"What is responsible?"

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.358
"What" could be the who of people,

00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:32.919
but it could also be
the what of the situation,

00:07:32.943 --> 00:07:34.629
and obviously that's wrongheaded.

00:07:34.653 --> 00:07:38.498
How do psychologists try to understand
such transformations of human character,

00:07:38.522 --> 00:07:40.522
if you believe
that they were good soldiers

00:07:40.546 --> 00:07:42.356
before they went down to that dungeon?

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.242
There are three ways.
The main way is called dispositional.

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:48.136
We look at what's inside
of the person, the bad apples.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.471
This is the foundation
of all of social science,

00:07:51.495 --> 00:07:54.155
the foundation of religion,
the foundation of war.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.399
Social psychologists like me
come along and say,

00:07:57.423 --> 00:07:59.542
"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage,

00:07:59.566 --> 00:08:01.916
but you'll have to be aware
of the situation.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.321
Who are the cast of characters?
What's the costume?

00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:05.804
Is there a stage director?"

00:08:05.828 --> 00:08:08.495
And so we're interested in
what are the external factors

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:10.495
around the individual -- the bad barrel?

00:08:11.064 --> 00:08:13.711
Social scientists stop there
and they miss the big point

00:08:13.735 --> 00:08:16.974
that I discovered when I became
an expert witness for Abu Ghraib.

00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:18.549
The power is in the system.

00:08:18.573 --> 00:08:21.814
The system creates the situation
that corrupts the individuals,

00:08:21.838 --> 00:08:26.622
and the system is the legal, political,
economic, cultural background.

00:08:26.646 --> 00:08:29.940
And this is where the power
is of the bad-barrel makers.

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:32.800
If you want to change a person,
change the situation.

00:08:32.824 --> 00:08:36.213
And to change it, you've got to know
where the power is, in the system.

00:08:36.237 --> 00:08:38.285
So the Lucifer effect
involves understanding

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:42.764
human character transformations
with these three factors.

00:08:43.284 --> 00:08:44.673
And it's a dynamic interplay.

00:08:44.697 --> 00:08:46.763
What do the people bring
into the situation?

00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:48.795
What does the situation bring out of them?

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:52.136
And what is the system
that creates and maintains that situation?

00:08:52.784 --> 00:08:55.068
My recent book,
"The Lucifer Effect," is about,

00:08:55.092 --> 00:08:57.331
how do you understand
how good people turn evil?

00:08:57.355 --> 00:09:00.618
And it has a lot of detail
about what I'm going to talk about today.

00:09:01.056 --> 00:09:04.136
So Dr. Z's "Lucifer Effect,"
although it focuses on evil,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.320
really is a celebration of the human
mind's infinite capacity

00:09:08.344 --> 00:09:10.902
to make any of us kind or cruel,

00:09:10.926 --> 00:09:13.448
caring or indifferent,
creative or destructive,

00:09:13.472 --> 00:09:15.750
and it makes some of us villains.

00:09:15.774 --> 00:09:18.871
And the good news that I'm going
to hopefully come to at the end

00:09:18.895 --> 00:09:20.662
is that it makes some of us heroes.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:25.360
This wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker
summarizes my whole talk:

00:09:25.384 --> 00:09:27.527
"I'm neither a good cop
nor a bad cop, Jerome.

00:09:27.551 --> 00:09:29.510
Like yourself, I'm a complex amalgam

00:09:29.534 --> 00:09:32.003
of positive and negative
personality traits

00:09:32.027 --> 00:09:35.517
that emerge or not, depending
on the circumstances."

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.526
(Laughter)

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.402
There's a study some of you
think you know about,

00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:42.613
but very few people
have ever read the story.

00:09:42.637 --> 00:09:44.562
You watched the movie.

00:09:44.586 --> 00:09:47.935
This is Stanley Milgram,
little Jewish kid from the Bronx,

00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:51.058
and he asked the question,
"Could the Holocaust happen here, now?"

00:09:51.082 --> 00:09:54.587
People say, "No, that's Nazi Germany,
Hitler, you know, that's 1939."

00:09:54.611 --> 00:09:57.004
He said, "Yeah, but suppose
Hitler asked you,

00:09:57.028 --> 00:10:00.198
'Would you electrocute a stranger?'
'No way, I'm a good person.'"

00:10:00.222 --> 00:10:02.318
He said, "Why don't
we put you in a situation

00:10:02.342 --> 00:10:04.581
and give you a chance
to see what you would do?"

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:07.690
And so what he did was he tested
1,000 ordinary people.

00:10:07.714 --> 00:10:11.781
500 New Haven, Connecticut,
500 Bridgeport.

00:10:11.805 --> 00:10:14.520
And the ad said, "Psychologists
want to understand memory.

00:10:14.544 --> 00:10:17.838
We want to improve people's memory,
because it is the key to success."

00:10:17.862 --> 00:10:19.062
OK?

00:10:20.064 --> 00:10:24.049
"We're going to give you five bucks --
four dollars for your time.

00:10:24.073 --> 00:10:27.527
We don't want college students.
We want men between 20 and 50."

00:10:27.551 --> 00:10:29.313
In the later studies, they ran women.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:32.410
Ordinary people: barbers,
clerks, white-collar people.

00:10:32.434 --> 00:10:34.014
So, you go down,

00:10:34.038 --> 00:10:36.549
one of you will be a learner,
one will be a teacher.

00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:38.478
The learner's a genial, middle-aged guy.

00:10:38.502 --> 00:10:41.611
He gets tied up to the shock
apparatus in another room.

00:10:41.635 --> 00:10:45.203
The learner could be middle-aged,
could be as young as 20.

00:10:45.227 --> 00:10:48.443
And one of you is told by the authority,
the guy in the lab coat,

00:10:48.467 --> 00:10:51.082
"Your job as teacher is to give him
material to learn.

00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:52.320
Gets it right, reward.

00:10:52.344 --> 00:10:54.735
Gets it wrong, you press
a button on the shock box.

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:57.613
The first button is 15 volts.
He doesn't even feel it."

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.323
That's the key.

00:10:59.347 --> 00:11:01.136
All evil starts with 15 volts.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.571
And then the next step
is another 15 volts.

00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:07.006
The problem is, at the end
of the line, it's 450 volts.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.136
And as you go along, the guy is screaming,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.351
"I've got a heart condition!
I'm out of here!"

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:13.081
You're a good person. You complain.

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:15.961
"Sir, who will be responsible
if something happens to him?"

00:11:15.985 --> 00:11:18.748
The experimenter says,
"Don't worry, I will be responsible.

00:11:18.772 --> 00:11:20.101
Continue, teacher."

00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:23.930
And the question is, who would go
all the way to 450 volts?

00:11:23.954 --> 00:11:26.530
You should notice here,
when it gets up to 375,

00:11:26.554 --> 00:11:28.079
it says, "Danger. Severe Shock."

00:11:28.103 --> 00:11:31.443
When it gets up to here, there's "XXX" --
the pornography of power.

00:11:31.897 --> 00:11:34.007
So Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists,

00:11:34.031 --> 00:11:37.136
"What percent of American citizens
would go to the end?"

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.661
They said only one percent.

00:11:38.685 --> 00:11:42.251
Because that's sadistic behavior,
and we know, psychiatry knows,

00:11:42.275 --> 00:11:44.367
only one percent
of Americans are sadistic.

00:11:44.391 --> 00:11:45.591
OK.

00:11:46.147 --> 00:11:48.753
Here's the data.
They could not be more wrong.

00:11:48.777 --> 00:11:51.598
Two thirds go all the way to 450 volts.

00:11:51.622 --> 00:11:53.136
This was just one study.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.444
Milgram did more than 16 studies.

00:11:55.468 --> 00:11:56.701
And look at this.

00:11:57.491 --> 00:12:00.328
In study 16, where you see
somebody like you go all the way,

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:01.820
90 percent go all the way.

00:12:02.447 --> 00:12:04.635
In study five, if you see people rebel,

00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:06.002
90 percent rebel.

00:12:06.772 --> 00:12:09.617
What about women?
Study 13 -- no different than men.

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:13.479
So Milgram is quantifying evil
as the willingness of people

00:12:13.503 --> 00:12:16.296
to blindly obey authority,
to go all the way to 450 volts.

00:12:16.606 --> 00:12:18.728
And it's like a dial on human nature.

00:12:18.752 --> 00:12:23.136
A dial in a sense that you can make
almost everybody totally obedient,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.850
down to the majority, down to none.

00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:29.767
What are the external parallels?
For all research is artificial.

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.601
What's the validity in the real world?

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:34.639
912 American citizens
committed suicide or were murdered

00:12:34.663 --> 00:12:37.648
by family and friends
in Guyana jungle in 1978,

00:12:37.672 --> 00:12:40.702
because they were blindly obedient
to this guy, their pastor --

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:43.433
not their priest -- their pastor,
Reverend Jim Jones.

00:12:43.457 --> 00:12:46.253
He persuaded them to commit mass suicide.

00:12:46.277 --> 00:12:48.142
And so, he's the modern Lucifer effect,

00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:51.018
a man of God who becomes
the Angel of Death.

00:12:52.662 --> 00:12:57.056
Milgram's study is all about individual
authority to control people.

00:12:57.793 --> 00:13:00.136
Most of the time, we are in institutions,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.697
so the Stanford Prison Study
is a study of the power of institutions

00:13:03.721 --> 00:13:05.661
to influence individual behavior.

00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:09.289
Interestingly, Stanley Milgram and I
were in the same high school class

00:13:09.313 --> 00:13:12.017
in James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954.

00:13:13.136 --> 00:13:15.223
I did this study
with my graduate students,

00:13:15.247 --> 00:13:18.073
especially Craig Haney --
and it also began work with an ad.

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.525
We had a cheap, little ad,

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.301
but we wanted college students
for a study of prison life.

00:13:23.249 --> 00:13:25.689
75 people volunteered,
took personality tests.

00:13:25.713 --> 00:13:26.963
We did interviews.

00:13:26.987 --> 00:13:29.433
Picked two dozen: the most normal,
the most healthy.

00:13:29.457 --> 00:13:31.724
Randomly assigned them
to be prisoner and guard.

00:13:31.748 --> 00:13:33.768
So on day one, we knew we had good apples.

00:13:33.792 --> 00:13:35.745
I'm going to put them in a bad situation.

00:13:35.769 --> 00:13:38.046
And secondly, we know
there's no difference

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.412
between the boys who will be guards
and those who will be prisoners.

00:13:41.436 --> 00:13:42.962
To the prisoners, we said,

00:13:42.986 --> 00:13:45.112
"Wait at home. The study
will begin Sunday."

00:13:45.136 --> 00:13:46.336
We didn't tell them

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.555
that the city police were going
to come and do realistic arrests.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.211
(Video) (Music)

00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:57.199
[Day 1]

00:14:23.473 --> 00:14:28.447
Student: A police car pulls up in front,
and a cop comes to the front door,

00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:30.466
and knocks, and says he's looking for me.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.411
So they, right there, you know,
they took me out the door,

00:14:33.435 --> 00:14:36.933
they put my hands against the car.

00:14:36.957 --> 00:14:39.158
It was a real cop car,
it was a real policeman,

00:14:39.182 --> 00:14:41.245
and there were real
neighbors in the street,

00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:44.295
who didn't know
that this was an experiment.

00:14:44.789 --> 00:14:47.543
And there was cameras
all around and neighbors all around.

00:14:47.567 --> 00:14:50.783
They put me in the car,
then they drove me around Palo Alto.

00:14:52.338 --> 00:14:57.331
They took me to the basement
of the police station.

00:15:04.373 --> 00:15:05.767
Then they put me in a cell.

00:15:05.791 --> 00:15:08.709
I was the first one to be picked up,
so they put me in a cell,

00:15:08.733 --> 00:15:11.526
which was just like a room
with a door with bars on it.

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:14.240
You could tell it wasn't a real jail.

00:15:14.264 --> 00:15:18.026
They locked me in there,
in this degrading little outfit.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.345
They were taking
this experiment too seriously.

00:15:21.369 --> 00:15:25.202
Here are the prisoners, who are going
to be dehumanized, they'll become numbers.

00:15:25.226 --> 00:15:28.118
Here are the guards
with the symbols of power and anonymity.

00:15:28.142 --> 00:15:31.591
Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet
bowls out with their bare hands,

00:15:31.615 --> 00:15:33.087
to do other humiliating tasks.

00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:35.353
They strip them naked.
They sexually taunt them.

00:15:35.377 --> 00:15:38.914
They begin to do degrading activities,
like having them simulate sodomy.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:42.169
You saw simulating fellatio
in soldiers in Abu Ghraib.

00:15:42.193 --> 00:15:44.075
My guards did it in five days.

00:15:44.495 --> 00:15:46.322
The stress reaction was so extreme

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:48.782
that normal kids we picked
because they were healthy

00:15:48.806 --> 00:15:50.389
had breakdowns within 36 hours.

00:15:50.413 --> 00:15:54.438
The study ended after six days,
because it was out of control.

00:15:54.462 --> 00:15:56.592
Five kids had emotional breakdowns.

00:15:58.466 --> 00:15:59.919
Does it make a difference

00:15:59.943 --> 00:16:02.668
if warriors go to battle
changing their appearance or not?

00:16:02.692 --> 00:16:05.445
If they're anonymous,
how do they treat their victims?

00:16:05.469 --> 00:16:08.628
In some cultures, they go to war
without changing their appearance.

00:16:08.652 --> 00:16:11.380
In others, they paint themselves
like "Lord of the Flies."

00:16:11.404 --> 00:16:12.596
In some, they wear masks.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.681
In many, soldiers
are anonymous in uniform.

00:16:14.705 --> 00:16:19.402
So this anthropologist, John Watson, found
23 cultures that had two bits of data.

00:16:19.426 --> 00:16:21.765
Do they change their appearance? 15.

00:16:21.789 --> 00:16:24.096
Do they kill, torture, mutilate? 13.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.223
If they don't change their appearance,

00:16:26.247 --> 00:16:28.460
only one of eight kills,
tortures or mutilates.

00:16:28.484 --> 00:16:29.788
The key is in the red zone.

00:16:29.812 --> 00:16:31.377
If they change their appearance,

00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:34.618
12 of 13 -- that's 90 percent --
kill, torture, mutilate.

00:16:35.136 --> 00:16:36.756
And that's the power of anonymity.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.685
So what are the seven social processes

00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:40.567
that grease the slippery slope of evil?

00:16:40.591 --> 00:16:42.717
Mindlessly taking the first small step.

00:16:42.741 --> 00:16:45.383
Dehumanization of others.
De-individuation of self.

00:16:45.407 --> 00:16:47.309
Diffusion of personal responsibility.

00:16:47.333 --> 00:16:48.980
Blind obedience to authority.

00:16:49.004 --> 00:16:50.898
Uncritical conformity to group norms.

00:16:50.922 --> 00:16:54.136
Passive tolerance of evil
through inaction, or indifference.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.018
And it happens when you're
in a new or unfamiliar situation.

00:16:57.042 --> 00:16:59.091
Your habitual response
patterns don't work.

00:16:59.115 --> 00:17:01.562
Your personality
and morality are disengaged.

00:17:02.803 --> 00:17:05.113
"Nothing is easier
than to denounce the evildoer;

00:17:05.137 --> 00:17:08.159
nothing more difficult
than understanding him," Dostoyevsky.

00:17:08.183 --> 00:17:11.755
Understanding is not excusing.
Psychology is not excuse-ology.

00:17:12.219 --> 00:17:14.346
So social and psychological
research reveals

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:17.642
how ordinary, good people can be
transformed without the drugs.

00:17:17.666 --> 00:17:20.967
You don't need it. You just need
the social-psychological processes.

00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:22.686
Real world parallels?

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.894
Compare this with this.

00:17:26.136 --> 00:17:28.824
James Schlesinger --
I'm going to end with this -- says,

00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:31.447
"Psychologists have attempted
to understand how and why

00:17:31.471 --> 00:17:33.900
individuals and groups
who usually act humanely

00:17:33.924 --> 00:17:37.112
can sometimes act otherwise
in certain circumstances."

00:17:37.136 --> 00:17:38.375
That's the Lucifer effect.

00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:40.828
And he goes on to say,
"The landmark Stanford study

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:44.772
provides a cautionary tale
for all military operations."

00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:47.136
If you give people power
without oversight,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.643
it's a prescription for abuse.

00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:51.078
They knew that, and let that happen.

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:54.917
So another report, an investigative
report by General Fay,

00:17:54.941 --> 00:17:56.891
says the system is guilty.

00:17:56.915 --> 00:18:00.378
In this report, he says it was
the environment that created Abu Ghraib,

00:18:00.402 --> 00:18:03.784
by leadership failures that contributed
to the occurrence of such abuse,

00:18:03.808 --> 00:18:05.718
and because it remained undiscovered

00:18:05.742 --> 00:18:07.982
by higher authorities
for a long period of time.

00:18:08.006 --> 00:18:09.831
Those abuses went on for three months.

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:11.463
Who was watching the store?

00:18:11.487 --> 00:18:13.734
The answer is nobody, I think on purpose.

00:18:13.758 --> 00:18:16.051
He gave the guards permission
to do those things,

00:18:16.075 --> 00:18:19.139
and they knew nobody was ever going
to come down to that dungeon.

00:18:19.163 --> 00:18:21.731
So you need a paradigm shift
in all of these areas.

00:18:21.755 --> 00:18:25.432
The shift is away from the medical model
that focuses only on the individual.

00:18:25.456 --> 00:18:28.136
The shift is toward a public health model

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.942
that recognizes situational
and systemic vectors of disease.

00:18:31.966 --> 00:18:34.303
Bullying is a disease.
Prejudice is a disease.

00:18:34.327 --> 00:18:35.495
Violence is a disease.

00:18:35.519 --> 00:18:39.287
Since the Inquisition, we've been dealing
with problems at the individual level.

00:18:39.311 --> 00:18:40.752
It doesn't work.

00:18:40.776 --> 00:18:43.592
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says,
"The line between good and evil

00:18:43.616 --> 00:18:45.736
cuts through the heart
of every human being."

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.572
That means that line is not out there.

00:18:47.596 --> 00:18:50.567
That's a decision that you have
to make, a personal thing.

00:18:50.591 --> 00:18:53.136
So I want to end very quickly
on a positive note.

00:18:53.652 --> 00:18:56.112
Heroism as the antidote to evil,

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.031
by promoting the heroic imagination,

00:18:58.055 --> 00:19:00.553
especially in our kids,
in our educational system.

00:19:00.577 --> 00:19:03.041
We want kids to think,
"I'm a hero in waiting,

00:19:03.065 --> 00:19:05.208
waiting for the right
situation to come along,

00:19:05.232 --> 00:19:06.775
and I will act heroically.

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:09.477
My whole life, I'm now going
to focus away from evil --

00:19:09.501 --> 00:19:12.454
that I've been in since I was a kid
-- to understanding heroes.

00:19:12.478 --> 00:19:13.643
Banality of heroism.

00:19:13.667 --> 00:19:15.671
It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds.

00:19:15.695 --> 00:19:18.641
It's the counterpoint
to Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil."

00:19:18.665 --> 00:19:22.626
Our traditional societal heroes are wrong,
because they are the exceptions.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.985
They organize their life around this.
That's why we know their names.

00:19:26.009 --> 00:19:28.287
Our kids' heroes
are also wrong models for them,

00:19:28.311 --> 00:19:30.255
because they have supernatural talents.

00:19:30.279 --> 00:19:33.240
We want our kids to realize
most heroes are everyday people,

00:19:33.264 --> 00:19:35.368
and the heroic act is unusual.

00:19:35.392 --> 00:19:36.683
This is Joe Darby.

00:19:36.707 --> 00:19:38.993
He was the one that stopped
those abuses you saw,

00:19:39.017 --> 00:19:40.610
because when he saw those images,

00:19:40.634 --> 00:19:43.205
he turned them over
to a senior investigating officer.

00:19:43.229 --> 00:19:45.957
He was a low-level private,
and that stopped it.

00:19:45.981 --> 00:19:47.159
Was he a hero? No.

00:19:47.183 --> 00:19:50.333
They had to put him in hiding,
because people wanted to kill him,

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:52.009
and then his mother and his wife.

00:19:52.033 --> 00:19:53.918
For three years, they were in hiding.

00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:56.628
This is the woman who stopped
the Stanford Prison Study.

00:19:56.652 --> 00:19:59.901
When I said it got out of control,
I was the prison superintendent.

00:19:59.925 --> 00:20:02.924
I didn't know it was out of control.
I was totally indifferent.

00:20:02.948 --> 00:20:04.539
She saw that madhouse and said,

00:20:04.563 --> 00:20:07.468
"You know what, it's terrible
what you're doing to those boys.

00:20:07.492 --> 00:20:11.136
They're not prisoners nor guards,
they're boys, and you are responsible."

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.136
And I ended the study the next day.

00:20:13.699 --> 00:20:15.809
The good news
is I married her the next year.

00:20:15.833 --> 00:20:18.136
(Laughter)

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:25.160
(Applause)

00:20:25.605 --> 00:20:27.616
I just came to my senses, obviously.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.309
So situations have the power
to do [three things].

00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:33.114
But the point is,
this is the same situation

00:20:33.138 --> 00:20:36.604
that can inflame the hostile
imagination in some of us,

00:20:36.628 --> 00:20:38.365
that makes us perpetrators of evil,

00:20:38.389 --> 00:20:40.582
can inspire the heroic
imagination in others.

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:43.720
It's the same situation
and you're on one side or the other.

00:20:43.744 --> 00:20:45.935
Most people are guilty
of the evil of inaction,

00:20:45.959 --> 00:20:49.307
because your mother said, "Don't get
involved. Mind your own business."

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.808
And you have to say,
"Mama, humanity is my business."

00:20:51.832 --> 00:20:55.023
So the psychology of heroism is --
we're going to end in a moment --

00:20:55.047 --> 00:20:57.474
how do we encourage children
in new hero courses,

00:20:57.498 --> 00:21:00.790
that I'm working on with Matt Langdon --
he has a hero workshop --

00:21:00.814 --> 00:21:03.857
to develop this heroic imagination,
this self-labeling,

00:21:03.881 --> 00:21:06.644
"I am a hero in waiting,"
and teach them skills.

00:21:06.668 --> 00:21:09.023
To be a hero, you have
to learn to be a deviant,

00:21:09.047 --> 00:21:12.047
because you're always going
against the conformity of the group.

00:21:12.697 --> 00:21:16.537
Heroes are ordinary people whose social
actions are extraordinary. Who act.

00:21:16.561 --> 00:21:18.312
The key to heroism is two things.

00:21:18.336 --> 00:21:20.717
You have to act
when other people are passive.

00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:23.508
B: You have to act socio-centrically,
not egocentrically.

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:27.315
And I want to end with a known story
about Wesley Autrey, New York subway hero.

00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:31.136
Fifty-year-old African-American
construction worker standing on a subway.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.688
A white guy falls on the tracks.

00:21:32.712 --> 00:21:35.172
The subway train is coming.
There's 75 people there.

00:21:35.196 --> 00:21:36.692
You know what? They freeze.

00:21:36.716 --> 00:21:38.582
He's got a reason not to get involved.

00:21:38.606 --> 00:21:41.023
He's black, the guy's white,
and he's got two kids.

00:21:41.047 --> 00:21:43.000
Instead, he gives his kids to a stranger,

00:21:43.024 --> 00:21:45.501
jumps on the tracks,
puts the guy between the tracks,

00:21:45.525 --> 00:21:47.695
lays on him, the subway goes over him.

00:21:47.719 --> 00:21:50.977
Wesley and the guy --
20 and a half inches height.

00:21:51.001 --> 00:21:53.291
The train clearance is 21 inches.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.943
A half an inch
would have taken his head off.

00:21:56.537 --> 00:22:00.606
And he said, "I did what anyone could do,"
no big deal to jump on the tracks.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.278
And the moral imperative
is "I did what everyone should do."

00:22:04.302 --> 00:22:06.689
And so one day,
you will be in a new situation.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.780
Take path one, you're going
to be a perpetrator of evil.

00:22:09.804 --> 00:22:12.136
Evil, meaning you're going to be
Arthur Andersen.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.875
You're going to cheat,
or you're going to allow bullying.

00:22:14.899 --> 00:22:17.713
Path two, you become guilty
of the evil of passive inaction.

00:22:17.737 --> 00:22:19.460
Path three, you become a hero.

00:22:19.484 --> 00:22:23.902
The point is, are we ready to take
the path to celebrating ordinary heroes,

00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:26.130
waiting for the right
situation to come along

00:22:26.154 --> 00:22:28.220
to put heroic imagination into action?

00:22:28.244 --> 00:22:31.038
Because it may only happen
once in your life,

00:22:31.062 --> 00:22:33.205
and when you pass it by,
you'll always know,

00:22:33.229 --> 00:22:35.664
I could have been a hero
and I let it pass me by.

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:37.861
So the point is thinking it
and then doing it.

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:40.507
So I want to thank you. Thank you.

00:22:40.531 --> 00:22:43.533
Let's oppose the power of evil systems
at home and abroad,

00:22:43.557 --> 00:22:45.136
and let's focus on the positive.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.681
Advocate for respect of personal dignity,
for justice and peace,

00:22:48.705 --> 00:22:51.043
which sadly our administration
has not been doing.

00:22:51.067 --> 00:22:52.317
Thanks so much.

00:22:52.341 --> 00:22:55.450
(Applause)
