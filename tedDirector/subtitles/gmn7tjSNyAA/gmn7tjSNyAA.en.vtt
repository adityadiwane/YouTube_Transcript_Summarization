00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
My doctors told me that my lung capacity

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
had gone down to 70 percent,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.160
and it was killing me.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
With the help of IIT,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
TERI, and learnings from NASA,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
we discovered that there are three

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
basic green plants,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
common green plants, with which

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.160
we can grow all the fresh air

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
we need indoors to keep us healthy.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
We've also found that you can

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
reduce the fresh air requirements

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
into the building, while maintaining

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
industry indoor air-quality standards.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
The three plants are Areca palm,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
Mother-in-Law's Tongue and money plant.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
The botanical names are in front of you.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
Areca palm is a plant which

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.160
We need four shoulder-high plants per person,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
and in terms of plant care,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.160
we need to wipe the leaves

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
every day in Delhi, and perhaps

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
once a week in cleaner-air cities.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
We had to grow them in vermi manure,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
which is sterile, or hydroponics,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.160
and take them outdoors every three to four months.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
The second plant is Mother-in-law's Tongue,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
which is again a very common plant,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
and we call it a bedroom plant,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.160
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
The third plant is money plant,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
and this is again a very common plant;

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
preferably grows in hydroponics.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.160
and other volatile chemicals.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
With these three plants,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
you can grow all the fresh air you need.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
In fact, you could be in a bottle

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160
with a cap on top, and you would not die at all,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
and you would not need any fresh air.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
We have tried these plants at our

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
own building in Delhi, which is a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
Our studies have found that there is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.160
a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
going up by one percent if one stays indoors

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
in this building for 10 hours.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
The government of India has discovered

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
or published a study to show

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
And the study showed that,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.160
compared to other buildings,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
there is a reduced incidence of

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
eye irritation by 52 percent,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.160
respiratory systems by 34 percent,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.160
headaches by 24 percent,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.160
lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
And this study has been published on September 8, 2008,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
and it's available on the government of India website.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
Our experience points to an

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
amazing increase in human productivity

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
by over 20 percent by using these plants.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.160
And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.160
by an outstanding 15 percent, because you need less fresh air.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.160
We are now replicating this in a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
1.75-million-square-feet building,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
which will have 60,000 indoor plants.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
Why is this important?

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
It is also important for the environment,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.160
because the world's energy

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
requirements are expected to grow

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
by 30 percent in the next decade.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.160
40 percent of the world's energy is taken

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
up by buildings currently,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
and 60 percent of the world's population

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
will be living in buildings in cities

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.160
with a population of over one million in the next 15 years.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
And there is a growing preference for living

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.160
and working in air-conditioned places.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
"Be the change you want to see in the world,"

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.160
said Mahatma Gandhi.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.160
And thank you for listening.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
(Applause)
