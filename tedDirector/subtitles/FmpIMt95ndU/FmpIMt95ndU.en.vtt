00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
since I became a paratrooper

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
27 years before.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
We went down to the airfield early

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
because this is the Army and you always go early.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
You do some routine refresher training,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
And you put on the T-10 parachute.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And you're very careful how you put the straps,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And then a jumpmaster comes,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
He checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and he tightens everything

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
so that your chest is crushed,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
your shoulders are crushed down,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Then you sit down, and you wait a little while,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
because this is the Army.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Then you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And you wait a little bit longer,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Then you take off.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
And it's painful enough now --

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
and I think it's designed this way --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
it's painful enough so you want to jump.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
You didn't really want to jump, but you want out.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
So you get in the aircraft, you're flying along,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
You sit there, OK.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Then they give you 10 minutes.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And of course, you're responding with all of these.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Then they give you, "Get ready."

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Then they go, "Outboard personnel, stand up."

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
If you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
If you're an inboard personnel, stand up.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
And then you hook up, and you hook up your static line.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And at that point, you think, "Hey, guess what?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
I'm probably going to jump.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
There's no way to get out of this at this point."

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
You go through some additional checks, and then they open the door.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And this was that Tuesday morning in September,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and it was pretty nice outside.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
So nice air comes flowing in.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
The jumpmasters start to check the door.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And then when it's time to go,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, "Go."

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
The first guy goes, and you're just in line,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
and you just kind of lumber to the door.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Jump is a misnomer; you fall.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
You fall outside the door,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
you're caught in the slipstream.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position --

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
head down in your chest, your arms extended,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
put over your reserve parachute.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
You do that because, 27 years before,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I have no idea whether it makes any difference,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
but he seemed to make sense,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And then you wait for the opening shock

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
for your parachute to open.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
If you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute --

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
you've got a whole new problem set.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
But typically you do; typically it opens.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And of course, if your leg straps aren't set right,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
at that point you get another little thrill.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Boom.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
So then you look around,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
you're under a canopy and you say, "This is good."

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Now you prepare for the inevitable.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
You are going to hit the ground.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
You can't delay that much.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And you really can't decide where you hit very much,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
because they pretend you can steer,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
but you're being delivered.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
So you look around, where you're going to land,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
you try to make yourself ready.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
so that it's not on you when you land,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Now the Army teaches you

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
to do five points of performance --

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
the toes of your feet,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
your calves, your thighs,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
your buttocks and your push-up muscles.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
It's this elegant little land, twist and roll.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And that's not going to hurt.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
In 30-some years of jumping, I never did one.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
(Laughter)

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
(Laughter)

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
And as soon as I hit,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
I'd shake my head,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and I'd ask myself the eternal question:

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
"Why didn't I go into banking?"

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
(Laughter)

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And I'd look around,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and then I'd see another paratrooper,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
a young guy or girl,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
and they'd be picking up their equipment.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
They'd be doing everything

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
that we had taught them.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And I realized

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
that, if they had to go into combat,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And I realized that, if they came out of combat,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
it would be because we led them well.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
but it's not any jump --

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.260
that was September 11th, 2001.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
When we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And what we thought

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
as being theoretical

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
was now very, very real --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and leadership seemed important.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
But things had changed;

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
I was a 46-year-old brigadier general.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
I'd been successful,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
but things changed so much

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
that I was going to have to make some significant changes,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and on that morning, I didn't know it.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
I was raised with traditional stories of leadership:

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Robert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
And I also was raised

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
with personal examples of leadership.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
This was my father in Vietnam.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And I was raised to believe

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
that soldiers were strong and wise

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
and brave and faithful;

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
they didn't lie, cheat, steal

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
or abandon their comrades.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
And I still believe real leaders are like that.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
But in my first 25 years of career,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
I had a bunch of different experiences.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
One of my first battalion commanders,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
I worked in his battalion for 18 months

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
And I'm not sure that was real interaction.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
But then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
I went out to the National Training Center.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And we did an operation,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
and my company did a dawn attack --

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
you know, the classic dawn attack:

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
you prepare all night, move to the line of departure.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And I had an armored organization at that point.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
We move forward, and we get wiped out --

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
I mean, wiped out immediately.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And after the battle,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an "after action review"

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
to teach you what you've done wrong.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Sort of leadership by humiliation.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
They put a big screen up, and they take you through everything:

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
"and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc."

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
I walked out feeling as low

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
as a snake's belly in a wagon rut.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And I went up to apologize to him,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and he said, "Stanley, I thought you did great."

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And in one sentence,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
he lifted me, put me back on my feet,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
and taught me that leaders can let you fail

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and yet not let you be a failure.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
When 9/11 came,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
First, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with:

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
the environment changed --

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
the speed, the scrutiny,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
the sensitivity of everything now is so fast,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
sometimes it evolves faster

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
than people have time to really reflect on it.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
But everything we do

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
is in a different context.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
More importantly, the force that I led

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
was spread over more than 20 countries.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
And instead of being able to get all the key leaders

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
for a decision together in a single room

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and look them in the eye and build their confidence

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and get trust from them,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
I'm now leading a force that's dispersed,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
and I've got to use other techniques.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
I've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
I've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls --

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
I've got to use everything I can,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
not just for communication,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
but for leadership.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
A 22-year-old individual

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
operating alone,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
thousands of miles from me,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
has got to communicate to me with confidence.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
I have to have trust in them and vice versa.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And I also have to build their faith.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And that's a new kind of leadership

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
for me.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
We had one operation

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
An emerging opportunity came --

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
didn't have time to get everybody together.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
So we had to get complex intelligence together,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
we had to line up the ability to act.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
It was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
convince them that this was the right thing to do

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and do all of this

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
on electronic medium.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
We failed.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
The mission didn't work.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
And so now what we had to do

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
is I had to reach out

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
to try to rebuild the trust of that force,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
rebuild their confidence --

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
me and them, and them and me,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and our seniors and us as a force --

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
Entirely new requirement.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
Also, the people had changed.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
You probably think that the force that I led

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
carrying exotic weapons.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
In reality,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
much of the force I led

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
looked exactly like you.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
It was men, women, young, old --

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
not just from military; from different organizations,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
many of them detailed to us just from a handshake.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And so instead of giving orders,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
you're now building consensus

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
and you're building a sense of shared purpose.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Probably the biggest change

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
was understanding that the generational difference,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
the ages, had changed so much.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
I went down to be with a Ranger platoon

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
on an operation in Afghanistan,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
and on that operation,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
a sergeant in the platoon

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
had lost about half his arm

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
throwing a Taliban hand grenade

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
back at the enemy

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
after it had landed in his fire team.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
We talked about the operation,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?"

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
And one young Ranger in the back --

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.260
from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind --

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
he said, "Sir, I was in the sixth grade."

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
And it reminded me

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
that we're operating a force

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
that must have shared purpose

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
and shared consciousness,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
and yet he has different experiences,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
in many cases a different vocabulary,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
a completely different skill set

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
in terms of digital media

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
than I do and many of the other senior leaders.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
And yet, we need to have that shared sense.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
It also produced something

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
which I call an inversion of expertise,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
because we had so many changes at the lower levels

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
in technology and tactics and whatnot,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
that suddenly the things that we grew up doing

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
wasn't what the force was doing anymore.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
So how does a leader

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
stay credible and legitimate

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
when they haven't done

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
what the people you're leading are doing?

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
And it's a brand new leadership challenge.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
And it forced me to become a lot more transparent,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
a lot more willing to listen,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.260
a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
And yet, again, you're not all in one room.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
Then another thing.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
There's an effect on you and on your leaders.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
There's an impact, it's cumulative.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.260
You don't reset, or recharge your battery every time.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
with one of my senior officers

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
and we watched a firefight from one of our forces.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
And I remembered his son was in our force.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
And I said, "John, where's your son? And how is he?"

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And he said, "Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking."

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
I said, "Where is he now?"

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
And he pointed at the screen, he said, "He's in that firefight."

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Think about watching your brother, father,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
daughter, son, wife

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
in a firefight in real time

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and you can't do anything about it.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Think about knowing that over time.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And you have to watch and take care of each other.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
I probably learned the most about relationships.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
I learned they are the sinew

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
which hold the force together.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
And every morning in the Ranger regiment,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
every Ranger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them --

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
says a six-stanza Ranger creed.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
You may know one line of it, it says,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
"I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy."

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
And it's not a mindless mantra,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
and it's not a poem.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
It's a promise.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
Every Ranger promises every other Ranger,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
"No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
if you need me, I'm coming."

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
And every Ranger gets that same promise

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
from every other Ranger.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
It's probably more powerful than marriage vows.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
And they've lived up to it, which gives it special power.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.260
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
is just amazing.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
And I learned personal relationships

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
were more important than ever.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
and an old friend of mine,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
that I had spent many years

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
at various points of my career with --

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
godfather to one of their kids --

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
he sent me a note, just in an envelope,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
that had a quote from Sherman to Grant

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
that said, "I knew if I ever got in a tight spot,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
that you would come, if alive."

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
And having that kind of relationship, for me,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
turned out to be critical at many points in my career.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
And I learned that you have to give that

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
in this environment,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
because it's tough.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
That was my journey.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
I hope it's not over.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
I came to believe

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
that a leader isn't good because they're right;

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
This isn't easy stuff.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
It's not like that electronic abs machine

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
where, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
(Laughter)

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
And it isn't always fair.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
You can get knocked down,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
and it hurts

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
and it leaves scars.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
But if you're a leader,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
the people you've counted on

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
will help you up.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
And if you're a leader,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
the people who count on you need you on your feet.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
Thank you.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:32.260
(Applause)
