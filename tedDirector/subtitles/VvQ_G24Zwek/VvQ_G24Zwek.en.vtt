00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I used to be a Malthusian.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
This was my mental model of the world:

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
exploding population, small planet;

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
it's going to lead to ugly things.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
But I'm moving past Malthus,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
because I think that we just might be about 150 years

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
from a kind of new enlightenment.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
Here's why.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
This is the U.N.'s population data,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
you may have seen, for the world.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
And the world's population expected to top out

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.160
at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion, late this century.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.160
And after that, most likely it's going to begin to decline.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
So what then?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
So a lot of economists

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
look at declining population

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
and expect to see stagnation, maybe depression.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
But a declining population is going to have

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
at least two very beneficial economic effects.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.160
One: fewer people on a fixed amount of land

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.160
make investing in property a bad bet.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.160
In the cities, a lot of the cost of property

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
is actually wrapped up in its speculative value.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
Take away land speculation,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
price of land drops.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
And that begins to lift a heavy burden

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
off the world's poor.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.160
Number two: a declining population

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
means scarce labor.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
Scarce labor drives wages.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
As wages increase

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.160
that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160
Now I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
But look what happened in Europe

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
after the plague:

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
rising wages,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
land reform,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
technological innovation,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
birth of the middle class;

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.160
and after that, forward-looking social movements

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
like the Renaissance,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
and later the Enlightenment.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
romanticizing the past.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
and descend through a kind of profligate present

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
to a very ugly future.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
So human history is viewed

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
as sort of this downhill slide

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
from the good old days.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
But I think we're in for another change,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
about two generations after the top of that curve,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
once the effects of a declining population

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
start to settle in.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
At that point, we'll start romanticizing the future again,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
instead of the nasty, brutish past.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
So why does this matter?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
Why talk about social-economic movements

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
that may be more than a century away?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160
Because transitions are dangerous times.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
When land owners start to lose money,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160
and labor demands more pay,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.160
there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.160
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
If we have a positive view about the future

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
then we may be able to accelerate through that turn,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
instead of careening off a cliff.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
If we can make it through the next 150 years,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
I think that your great great grandchildren

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
will forget all about Malthus.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160
And instead, they'll be planning for the future

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
and starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Thank you.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
(Applause)
