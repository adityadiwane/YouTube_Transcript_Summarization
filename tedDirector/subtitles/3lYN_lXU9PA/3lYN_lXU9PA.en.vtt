00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
So, I want to start out with

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
this beautiful picture from my childhood.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
I love the science fiction movies.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
Here it is: "This Island Earth."

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
Two-and-a-half years in the making.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
(Laughter)

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
I mean, even the creationists give us 6,000,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
but Hollywood goes to the chase.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.330
And in this movie, we see what we think is out there:

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
flying saucers and aliens.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
Every world has an alien, and every alien world has a flying saucer,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.330
and they move about with great speed. Aliens.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
Well, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
where we got tired of turning on the TV

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.330
and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
and tried to write a counter-argument to it,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.330
and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
where you could probably get not just life, but complexity,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
which requires a huge amount of evolution,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
and therefore constancy of conditions.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
So, in 2000 we wrote "Rare Earth." In 2003, we then asked,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.330
let's not think about where Earths are in space, but how long has Earth been Earth?

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
If you go back two billion years,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
you're not on an Earth-like planet any more.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.330
What we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
Well, "Rare Earth" actually

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
taught me an awful lot about meeting the public.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
Right after, I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
and with all great earnestness walked in.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
David Brin was going to debate me on this,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.330
and as I walked in, the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
I had a girl who came up who said, "My dad says you're the devil."

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.330
You cannot take people's aliens away from them

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.330
and expect to be anybody's friends.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
Well, the second part of that, soon after --

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
and I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
and I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth."

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.330
And Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
and she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist."

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
It was, "It burns! It burns!"

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
Because SETI doesn't want to hear this.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
SETI wants there to be stuff out there.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
I really applaud the SETI efforts, but we have not heard anything yet.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
And I really do think we have to start thinking

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
about what's a good planet and what isn't.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
Now, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.330
even if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
Because this was a slide that was passed

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.330
between the two major intelligences on Earth -- a Mac to a PC --

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
and it can't even get the letters right --

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
(Laughter)

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
-- so how are we going to talk to the aliens?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
And if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
and you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
and then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
I mean, there we are.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
Mars is a bad planet, but it's still good enough for us to go there

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
and to live on its surface if we're protected.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
But Venus is a very bad -- the worst -- planet.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
Even though it's Earth-like, and even though early in its history

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
it may very well have harbored Earth-like life,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse --

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
that's an 800 degrees [Fahrenheit] surface --

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
because of rampant carbon dioxide.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
Well, we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
what's going to happen to our particular planet.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
We are right now in the beautiful Oreo

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
of existence -- of at least life on Planet Earth --

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
following the first horrible microbial age.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
In the Cambrian explosion, life emerged from the swamps,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
complexity arose,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
and from what we can tell, we're halfway through.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
as they have been here now,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
till we hit the second microbial age.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
And that will happen, paradoxically --

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
everything you hear about global warming --

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
when we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
we are no longer going to have to have plants

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.330
that are allowed to have any photosynthesis, and there go animals.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
So, after that we probably have seven billion years.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
The Sun increases in its intensity, in its brightness,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.330
and finally, at about 12 billion years after it first started,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.330
the Earth is consumed by a large Sun,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
and this is what's left.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.330
So, a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
and we are in its golden summer age right now.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
But there's two fates to everything, isn't there?

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
Now, a lot of you are going to die of old age,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
but some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
And that's the fate of a planet, too.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.330
Earth, if we're lucky enough -- if it doesn't get hit by a Hale-Bopp,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.330
or gets blasted by some supernova nearby

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
in the next seven billion years -- we'll find under your feet.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
But what about accidental death?

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
Well, paleontologists for the last 200 years

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.330
have been charting death. It's strange --

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
He couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
and he said, Aha! It's extinct.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
And very soon after, the fossil record started yielding

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
since complex life really began to leave

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
a very interesting fossil record.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
In that complex record of fossils,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
there were times when lots of stuff

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
seemed to be dying out very quickly,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
and the father/mother geologists

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
called these "mass extinctions."

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
All along it was thought to be either an act of God

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
or perhaps long, slow climate change, 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
and that really changed in 1980,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
where Walter Alvarez, trying to figure out

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
what was the time difference between these white rocks,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330
which held creatures of the Cretaceous period,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
and the pink rocks above, which held Tertiary fossils.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.330
How long did it take to go from one system to the next?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
And what they found was something unexpected.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
They found in this gap, in between, a very thin clay layer,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
and that clay layer -- this very thin red layer here --

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
is filled with iridium.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
And not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
and it's filled with quartz grains

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.330
that have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
Now, in this slide the white is chalk,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
The chalk itself's composed by plankton

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.330
which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.330
so that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
and then you have that millimeter-thick red layer,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
and then you have black rock.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
And the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
in the absence of plankton.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.330
And that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
because that's what this was, of course. This is the famous K-T.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.330
A 10-kilometer body hit the planet.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.330
The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
the death of these beautiful ammonites,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
and so much else.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.330
I mean, it must be true,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
because we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time,

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.330
and this paradigm, from 1980 to about 2000,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.330
totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
Prior to that, uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm:

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.330
there are present-day processes that will explain it.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
so this is a type of neo-catastrophism,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
to finally come to grips: yes, we were hit;

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.330
and yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
Well, there are five major mass extinctions 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
over the last 500 million years, called the Big Five.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
They range from 450 million years ago

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
to the last, the K-T, number four,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.330
but the biggest of all was the P, or the Permian extinction,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
And every one of these has been subsequently blamed

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
on large-body impact.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
But is this true?

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
The most recent, the Permian, was thought to have been an impact

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
because of this beautiful structure on the right.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
This is a Buckminsterfullerene, a carbon-60.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
Because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
of my late beloved '60s,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
they're called "buckyballs."

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
This evidence was used to suggest

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.330
that at the end of the Permian, 250 million years ago, a comet hit us.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
And when the comet hits, the pressure produces the buckyballs,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
and it captures bits of the comet.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.330
Helium-3: very rare on the surface of the Earth, very common in space.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
But is this true?

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.330
In 1990, working on the K-T extinction for 10 years,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
in the great Karoo desert.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.330
I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
into the new South Africa as I went year by year.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
And I worked on this Permian extinction,

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
And the fossils are extraordinary.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
You know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
These are mammal-like reptiles.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
They are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
This is a Gorgonopsian, or a Gorgon.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.330
That's an 18-inch long skull of an animal

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.330
that was probably seven or eight feet, sprawled like a lizard,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
probably had a head like a lion.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
This is the top carnivore, the T-Rex of its time.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
But there's lots of stuff.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
This is my poor son, Patrick.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.330
(Laughter)

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
This is called paleontological child abuse.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
Hold still, you're the scale.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.330
(Laughter)

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
There was big stuff back then.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
Fifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
The age of mammals had well and truly started

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
250 million years ago ...

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.330
... and then a catastrophe happened.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.330
It was all a mistake; it should have never happened. But it did.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
Now, luckily,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
this Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here:

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture --

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
there's a pen for scale; it's really tiny --

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.330
this is in the Lower Triassic, after the mass extinction has finished.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.330
You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:18.330
If that does not survive, I'm not the thing giving this talk.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.330
Something else is, because if that doesn't survive, we are not here;

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.330
there are no mammals. It's that close; one species ekes through.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.330
Well, can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't?

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
Here's sort of the end of that 10 years of work.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
The ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
But we've got survivors and things that get through,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.330
and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.330
Warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
The survivors that do get through 

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.330
produce this world of crocodile-like creatures.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.330
There's no dinosaurs yet; just this slow, saurian, scaly, nasty,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:59.330
swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
And there they would hide for 160 million years,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
until liberated by that K-T asteroid.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
So, if not impact, what?

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.330
And the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
to the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
and the microbes are still out there.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
They hate we animals.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
They really want their world back.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.330
And they've tried over and over and over again.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.330
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.330
because it did is inherently anti-Gaian.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.330
This whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself --

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.330
anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
believing in the Gaia theory? No.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
So, I really suspect there's an alternative,

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
and that life does actually try to do itself in --

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
not consciously, but just because it does.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.330
And here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
There are microbes which, through their metabolism,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
produce hydrogen sulfide,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.330
and they do so in large amounts.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.330
Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:07.330
As small as 200 parts per million will kill you.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.330
You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places -- some lakes --

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.330
and get down, and you'll find that the water itself turns purple.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.330
It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.330
which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.330
and we can detect their presence today -- we can see them --

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
but we can also detect their presence in the past.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
And the last three years have seen

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
I am almost extinct --

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
But the new wave of paleontologists -- my graduate students --

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
collect biomarkers.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.330
They take the sediment itself, they extract the oil from it, 

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.330
and from that they can produce compounds

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.330
which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
It's because lipids are so tough, they can get preserved in sediment

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary,

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.330
and be extracted and tell us who was there.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.330
And we know who was there. At the end of the Permian,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
at many of these mass extinction boundaries,

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.330
this is what we find: isorenieratene. It's very specific.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.330
It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.330
and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide --

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
enough, for instance, to come out of solution.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.330
This led Lee Kump, and others from Penn State and my group,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis:

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.330
by high CO2. And the worst effect of global warming, it turns out:

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
Well, what's the source of this?

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.330
In this particular case, the source over and over has been flood basalts.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
This is a view of the Earth now, if we extract a lot of it.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb;

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
actually, the effects are even worse.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
This is when deep-Earth material comes to the surface,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
spreads out over the surface of the planet.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.330
Well, it's not the lava that kills anything,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.330
This isn't Volvos; this is volcanoes.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.330
So, these are new data Rob Berner and I -- from Yale -- put together,

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
and what we try to do now is

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.330
track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record -- 

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
and we can do this from a variety of means --

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
and put all the red lines here,

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.330
when these -- what I call greenhouse mass extinctions -- took place.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
And there's two things that are really evident here to me,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
is that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.330
But the second thing that's not shown on here:

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
the Earth has never had any ice on it

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.330
when we've had 1,000 parts per million CO2.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
We are at 380 and climbing.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.330
We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.330
but my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a 100 years.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
So, there goes the ice caps,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.330
and there comes 240 feet of sea level rise.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
I live in a view house now;

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
I'm going to have waterfront.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:01.330
All right, what's the consequence? The oceans probably turn purple.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
to take place on planet Earth.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.330
We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.330
They stop complex life from existing.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.330
We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:22.330
And I throw this slide in -- this is me, actually, two months ago --

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.330
and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal, chambered nautilus.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.330
It's been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.330
This is a tracking experiment, and any of you scuba divers,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.330
if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
this is off the Great Barrier Reef.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.330
And as we speak now, 

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.330
But the thing about this is that every once in a while

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.330
we divers can run into trouble,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
so I'm going to do a little thought experiment here.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.330
This is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.330
We pulled it up; up it comes. So, it's out there with me at night.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.330
So, I'm swimming along, and it takes off my leg.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.330
I'm 80 miles from shore, what's going to happen to me?

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
Well now, I die.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.330
Five years from now, this is what I hope happens to me:

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.330
I'm taken back to the boat, I'm given a gas mask:

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.330
80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.330
I'm then thrown in an ice pond, I'm cooled 15 degrees lower

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.330
and I could be taken to a critical care hospital.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
And the reason I could do that is because we mammals

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.330
have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.330
and our bodies have adapted.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.330
And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.330
This is Mark Roth. He was funded by DARPA.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.330
Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.330
He bleeds out pigs.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.330
He puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide --

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.330
the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions --

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.330
and he turns a mammal into a reptile.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.330
"I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
having undergone a series of exposures to H2S."

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.330
I got this email from him two years ago;

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.330
he said, "I think I've got an answer to some of your questions."

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.330
So, he now has taken mice down

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.330
for as many as four hours, sometimes six hours,

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.330
and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:12.330
On the top, now, that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through --

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.330
the dotted line, the temperatures.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.330
So, the temperature starts at 25 centigrade,

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:17.330
and down it goes, down it goes.

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.330
Six hours later, up goes the temperature.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:24.330
Now, the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.330
in this solid graph,

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.330
and look what happens to its temperature.

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.330
Its temperature drops.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.330
It goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35,

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.330
and comes out of this perfectly fine.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.330
Here is a way we can get people to critical care.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:45.330
Here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.330
Now, you're all thinking, yeah, what about the brain tissue?

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.330
And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.330
You're in an accident. You've got two choices:

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.330
you're going to die, or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.330
and, say, 75 percent of you is saved, mentally.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.330
What are you going to do?

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.330
Do we all have to have a little button saying, Let me die?

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.330
This is coming towards us,

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.330
and I think this is going to be a revolution.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.330
We're going to save lives, but there's going to be a cost to it.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.330
The new view of mass extinctions is, yes, we were hit,

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.330
and, yes, we have to think about the long term,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.330
because we will get hit again.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.330
But there's a far worse danger confronting us.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.330
We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.330
Give us a few millennia --

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.330
and we humans should last those few millennia --

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.330
will it happen again? If we continue, it'll happen again.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.330
How many of us flew here?

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.330
How many of us have gone through

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.330
our entire Kyoto quota

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.330
just for flying this year?

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.330
How many of you have exceeded it? Yeah, I've certainly exceeded it.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.330
We have a huge problem facing us as a species.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.330
We have to beat this.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.330
I want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:59.330
(Applause)

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.330
Chris Anderson: I've just got one question for you, Peter.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.330
Am I understanding you right, that what you're saying here

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.330
is that we have in our own bodies

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.330
a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.330
that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.330
due to climate change?

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.330
Peter Ward: Yeah, every single cell in us

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.330
can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:21.330
This is what Roth has found out.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.330
So, what we're looking at now: does it leave a signal?

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.330
Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant?

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.330
And we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.330
how many of these have happened in the past.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.330
CA: It's simultaneously

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.330
an incredible medical technique, but also a terrifying ...

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.330
PW: Blessing and curse.
