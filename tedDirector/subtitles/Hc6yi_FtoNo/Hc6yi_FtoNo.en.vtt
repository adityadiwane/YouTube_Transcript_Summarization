00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:18.434
Well, the subject of difficult negotiation

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:22.236
reminds me of one of my favorite stories
from the Middle East,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.014
of a man who left
to his three sons, 17 camels.

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:28.236
To the first son, he left half the camels;

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.650
to the second son,
he left a third of the camels;

00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:33.269
and to the youngest son,
he left a ninth of the camels.

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:37.107
The three sons got into a negotiation --
17 doesn't divide by two.

00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:38.869
It doesn't divide by three.

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:40.432
It doesn't divide by nine.

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:42.702
Brotherly tempers started to get strained.

00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:44.005
Finally, in desperation,

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:47.690
they went and they consulted
a wise old woman.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.689
The wise old woman thought
about their problem for a long time,

00:00:50.713 --> 00:00:54.217
and finally she came back and said,
"Well, I don't know if I can help you,

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:56.618
but at least, if you want,
you can have my camel."

00:00:56.642 --> 00:00:58.110
So then, they had 18 camels.

00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:00.992
The first son took his half --
half of 18 is nine.

00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:03.710
The second son took his third --
a third of 18 is six.

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:07.236
The youngest son took his ninth --
a ninth of 18 is two.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.819
You get 17.

00:01:09.843 --> 00:01:11.653
They had one camel left over.

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:13.605
They gave it back to the wise old woman.

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:15.236
(Laughter)

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.499
Now, if you think
about that story for a moment,

00:01:17.523 --> 00:01:21.094
I think it resembles a lot
of the difficult negotiations

00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:22.332
we get involved in.

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:24.832
They start off like 17 camels,
no way to resolve it.

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:26.292
Somehow, what we need to do

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:29.997
is step back from those situations,
like that wise old woman,

00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:32.053
look at the situation through fresh eyes

00:01:32.077 --> 00:01:34.014
and come up with an 18th camel.

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.899
Finding that 18th camel
in the world's conflicts

00:01:37.923 --> 00:01:40.081
has been my life passion.

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:43.236
I basically see humanity
a bit like those three brothers.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.850
We're all one family.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.354
We know that scientifically,

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:49.324
thanks to the communications revolution,

00:01:49.348 --> 00:01:52.916
all the tribes on the planet --
all 15,000 tribes --

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.551
are in touch with each other.

00:01:55.543 --> 00:01:57.936
And it's a big family reunion.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.642
And yet, like many family reunions,

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.889
it's not all peace and light.

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.814
There's a lot of conflict,

00:02:03.838 --> 00:02:07.236
and the question is:
How do we deal with our differences?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.356
How do we deal with
our deepest differences,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.089
given the human propensity for conflict

00:02:12.113 --> 00:02:16.640
and the human genius at devising
weapons of enormous destruction?

00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:18.413
That's the question.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:23.236
As I've spent the last better part
of three decades, almost four,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.315
traveling the world,

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.708
trying to work, getting
involved in conflicts

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:32.112
ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East

00:02:32.136 --> 00:02:33.860
to Chechnya to Venezuela --

00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:36.957
some of the most difficult conflicts
on the face of the planet --

00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:39.072
I've been asking myself that question.

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:42.492
And I think I've found, in some ways,
what is the secret to peace.

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:45.236
It's actually surprisingly simple.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.436
It's not easy, but it's simple.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.691
It's not even new.

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:53.089
It may be one of our most
ancient human heritages.

00:02:53.113 --> 00:02:55.430
The secret to peace is us.

00:02:55.922 --> 00:03:01.064
It's us who act as a surrounding
community around any conflict,

00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:03.236
who can play a constructive role.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Let me give you just a story, an example.

00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:08.356
About 20 years ago,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.621
I was in South Africa,
working with the parties in that conflict,

00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:12.908
and I had an extra month,

00:03:12.932 --> 00:03:17.498
so I spent some time living
with several groups of San Bushmen.

00:03:17.522 --> 00:03:21.466
I was curious about them, about the way
in which they resolve conflict.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.236
Because, after all, within living memory,
they were hunters and gatherers,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.616
living pretty much
like our ancestors lived

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.902
for maybe 99 percent of the human story.

00:03:30.473 --> 00:03:33.836
And all the men have these poison arrows
that they use for hunting --

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.378
absolutely fatal.

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:37.696
So how do they deal
with their differences?

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.309
Well, what I learned is, whenever
tempers rise in those communities,

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:45.904
someone goes and hides
the poison arrows out in the bush,

00:03:45.928 --> 00:03:49.563
and then everyone sits around
in a circle like this,

00:03:49.587 --> 00:03:52.539
and they sit and they talk and they talk.

00:03:52.563 --> 00:03:54.874
It may take two days,
three days, four days,

00:03:54.898 --> 00:03:58.236
but they don't rest
until they find a resolution

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.236
or better yet -- a reconciliation.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.293
And if tempers are still too high,

00:04:02.317 --> 00:04:04.856
then they send someone
off to visit some relatives,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.236
as a cooling-off period.

00:04:06.658 --> 00:04:09.643
Well, that system is, I think,
probably the system

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:11.403
that kept us alive to this point,

00:04:11.427 --> 00:04:13.236
given our human tendencies.

00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:17.292
That system, I call "the third side."

00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:20.435
Because if you think about it,
normally when we think of conflict,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.610
when we describe it,

00:04:21.634 --> 00:04:23.007
there's always two sides --

00:04:23.031 --> 00:04:25.737
it's Arabs versus Israelis,
labor versus management,

00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:28.912
husband versus wife,
Republicans versus Democrats.

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.721
But what we don't often see

00:04:30.745 --> 00:04:33.111
is that there's always a third side,

00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:36.807
and the third side of the conflict is us,
it's the surrounding community,

00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:38.236
it's the friends, the allies,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.068
the family members, the neighbors.

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:43.020
And we can play
an incredibly constructive role.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.295
Perhaps the most fundamental way
in which the third side can help

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.236
is to remind the parties
of what's really at stake.

00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:54.100
For the sake of the kids,
for the sake of the family,

00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:56.894
for the sake of the community,
for the sake of the future,

00:04:56.918 --> 00:04:59.359
let's stop fighting for a moment
and start talking.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.541
Because, the thing is,

00:05:01.565 --> 00:05:03.138
when we're involved in conflict,

00:05:03.162 --> 00:05:05.721
it's very easy to lose perspective.

00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:07.784
It's very easy to react.

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:10.681
Human beings -- we're reaction machines.

00:05:10.705 --> 00:05:12.078
And as the saying goes,

00:05:12.102 --> 00:05:14.625
when angry, you will make the best speech

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:16.134
you will ever regret.

00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:17.816
(Laughter)

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.836
And so the third side reminds us of that.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.885
The third side helps us go to the balcony,

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:25.615
which is a metaphor
for a place of perspective,

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.045
where we can keep our eyes on the prize.

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.649
Let me tell you a little story
from my own negotiating experience.

00:05:31.673 --> 00:05:36.744
Some years ago, I was involved
as a facilitator in some very tough talks

00:05:36.768 --> 00:05:39.991
between the leaders of Russia
and the leaders of Chechnya.

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:42.666
There was a war going on, as you know.

00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:46.236
And we met in the Hague,
in the Peace Palace,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.367
in the same room where the Yugoslav
war-crimes tribunal was taking place.

00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:54.263
And the talks got off
to a rather rocky start

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:57.695
when the vice president of Chechnya
began by pointing at the Russians

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:00.236
and said, "You should stay
right here in your seats,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.071
because you're going
to be on trial for war crimes."

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:04.905
And then he turned to me and said,

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:06.111
"You're an American.

00:06:06.135 --> 00:06:09.361
Look at what you Americans
are doing in Puerto Rico."

00:06:09.385 --> 00:06:13.008
And my mind started racing, "Puerto Rico?
What do I know about Puerto Rico?"

00:06:13.032 --> 00:06:14.184
I started reacting.

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.209
(Laughter)

00:06:15.233 --> 00:06:18.069
But then, I tried to remember
to go to the balcony.

00:06:18.093 --> 00:06:19.291
And then when he paused

00:06:19.315 --> 00:06:21.396
and everyone looked at me for a response,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.798
from a balcony perspective,
I was able to thank him for his remarks

00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:27.599
and say, "I appreciate
your criticism of my country

00:06:27.623 --> 00:06:30.070
and I take it as a sign
that we're among friends

00:06:30.094 --> 00:06:31.985
and can speak candidly to one another."

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:33.010
(Laughter)

00:06:33.034 --> 00:06:36.415
"And what we're here to do is not
to talk about Puerto Rico or the past.

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.620
We're here to see
if we can figure out a way

00:06:38.644 --> 00:06:41.236
to stop the suffering
and the bloodshed in Chechnya."

00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:44.426
The conversation got back on track.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.109
That's the role of the third side,

00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:48.214
to help the parties go to the balcony.

00:06:49.082 --> 00:06:51.309
Now let me take you, for a moment,

00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:54.398
to what's widely regarded as the world's
most difficult conflict,

00:06:54.422 --> 00:06:56.963
or the most impossible conflict,
the Middle East.

00:06:56.987 --> 00:07:00.236
Question is: where's the third side there?

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.424
How could we possibly go to the balcony?

00:07:02.765 --> 00:07:06.742
Now, I don't pretend to have an answer
to the Middle East conflict,

00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:10.726
but I think I've got a first step --
literally, a first step --

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.737
something that any one of us
could do as third-siders.

00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:15.968
Let me just ask you one question first.

00:07:15.992 --> 00:07:19.985
How many of you in the last years

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:23.044
have ever found yourself
worrying about the Middle East

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:24.820
and wondering what anyone could do?

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:26.961
Just out of curiosity, how many of you?

00:07:26.985 --> 00:07:29.477
OK, so the great majority of us.

00:07:29.977 --> 00:07:31.581
And here, it's so far away.

00:07:31.605 --> 00:07:34.521
Why do we pay so much attention
to this conflict?

00:07:34.545 --> 00:07:36.236
Is it the number of deaths?

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.657
There are a hundred times more people
who die in a conflict in Africa

00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:40.832
than in the Middle East.

00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:42.943
No, it's because of the story,

00:07:42.967 --> 00:07:46.675
because we feel personally
involved in that story.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:50.528
Whether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews,
religious or non-religious,

00:07:50.552 --> 00:07:52.425
we feel we have a personal stake in it.

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:53.600
Stories matter;

00:07:53.624 --> 00:07:55.382
as an anthropologist, I know that.

00:07:55.406 --> 00:07:59.024
Stories are what we use
to transmit knowledge.

00:07:59.048 --> 00:08:00.569
They give meaning to our lives.

00:08:00.593 --> 00:08:03.290
That's what we tell here
at TED, we tell stories.

00:08:03.314 --> 00:08:04.468
Stories are the key.

00:08:04.492 --> 00:08:07.063
And so my question is --

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.906
yes, let's try and resolve the politics
there in the Middle East,

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.454
but let's also take a look at the story.

00:08:14.478 --> 00:08:16.922
Let's try to get at the root
of what it's all about.

00:08:16.946 --> 00:08:19.166
Let's see if we can apply
the third side to it.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.994
What would that mean?
What is the story there?

00:08:22.018 --> 00:08:26.236
Now, as anthropologists, we know
that every culture has an origin story.

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:28.857
What's the origin story
of the Middle East?

00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:30.236
In a phrase, it's:

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.851
Four thousand years ago,

00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:35.865
a man and his family walked
across the Middle East,

00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:38.460
and the world has never
been the same since.

00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:41.506
That man, of course, was Abraham.

00:08:42.569 --> 00:08:46.236
And what he stood for was unity,
the unity of the family;

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.236
he's the father of us all.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.249
But it's not just what he stood for,
it's what his message was.

00:08:51.273 --> 00:08:53.236
His basic message was unity too,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.470
the interconnectedness of it all,
the unity of it all.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:59.804
And his basic value was respect,

00:08:59.828 --> 00:09:01.696
was kindness toward strangers.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.737
That's what he's known for,
his hospitality.

00:09:05.308 --> 00:09:06.935
So in that sense,

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:10.919
he's the symbolic third side
of the Middle East.

00:09:10.943 --> 00:09:15.366
He's the one who reminds us
that we're all part of a greater whole.

00:09:15.707 --> 00:09:19.000
Now, think about that for a moment.

00:09:19.674 --> 00:09:22.122
Today, we face the scourge of terrorism.

00:09:22.551 --> 00:09:23.829
What is terrorism?

00:09:24.408 --> 00:09:27.667
Terrorism is basically
taking an innocent stranger

00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:32.236
and treating them as an enemy
whom you kill in order to create fear.

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:34.649
What's the opposite of terrorism?

00:09:35.236 --> 00:09:36.956
It's taking an innocent stranger

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.367
and treating them as a friend
whom you welcome into your home,

00:09:41.391 --> 00:09:44.083
in order to sow and create understanding

00:09:44.107 --> 00:09:45.895
or respect, or love.

00:09:46.853 --> 00:09:51.513
So what if, then, you took
the story of Abraham,

00:09:51.537 --> 00:09:53.170
which is a third-side story,

00:09:53.194 --> 00:09:55.236
what if that could be --

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.581
because Abraham stands for hospitality --

00:09:58.605 --> 00:10:01.819
what if that could be
an antidote to terrorism?

00:10:01.843 --> 00:10:05.665
What if that could be a vaccine
against religious intolerance?

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:08.236
How would you bring that story to life?

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.022
Now, it's not enough just to tell a story.

00:10:11.046 --> 00:10:14.440
That's powerful, but people need
to experience the story.

00:10:14.464 --> 00:10:16.418
They need to be able to live the story.

00:10:16.442 --> 00:10:17.718
How would you do that?

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.236
And that was my thinking
of how would you do that.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.403
And that's what comes
to the first step here.

00:10:22.427 --> 00:10:25.150
Because the simple way to do that is:

00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:26.959
you go for a walk.

00:10:26.983 --> 00:10:30.398
You go for a walk
in the footsteps of Abraham.

00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:33.350
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham.

00:10:33.374 --> 00:10:36.283
Because walking has a real power.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.727
You know, as an anthropologist,
walking is what made us human.

00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:43.946
It's funny -- when you walk,
you walk side-by-side,

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.236
in the same common direction.

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:48.673
Now if I were to come to you face-to-face

00:10:48.697 --> 00:10:50.943
and come this close to you,

00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:54.366
you would feel threatened.

00:10:54.977 --> 00:10:57.032
But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder,

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:58.937
even touching shoulders,

00:10:58.961 --> 00:11:00.236
it's no problem.

00:11:00.668 --> 00:11:02.236
Who fights while they walk?

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.236
That's why in negotiations,
often, when things get tough,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.655
people go for walks in the woods.

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:13.101
So the idea came to me
of, what about inspiring a path,

00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:16.763
a route -- think the Silk Route,
think the Appalachian Trail --

00:11:16.787 --> 00:11:21.013
that followed in the footsteps of Abraham?

00:11:21.037 --> 00:11:22.862
People said, "That's crazy. You can't.

00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:25.898
You can't retrace the footsteps
of Abraham -- it's too insecure,

00:11:25.922 --> 00:11:27.780
you've got to cross all these borders,

00:11:27.804 --> 00:11:30.486
it goes across 10 different countries
in the Middle East,

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.907
because it unites them all."

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.186
And so we studied the idea at Harvard.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.440
We did our due diligence.

00:11:35.464 --> 00:11:36.663
And then a few years ago,

00:11:36.687 --> 00:11:39.417
a group of us, about 25 of us
from 10 different countries,

00:11:39.441 --> 00:11:42.621
decided to see if we could retrace
the footsteps of Abraham,

00:11:42.645 --> 00:11:45.145
going from his initial birthplace
in the city of Urfa

00:11:45.169 --> 00:11:47.340
in Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia.

00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:50.808
And we then took a bus and took some walks

00:11:50.832 --> 00:11:54.989
and went to Harran, where, in the Bible,
he sets off on his journey.

00:11:55.013 --> 00:11:57.566
Then we crossed the border
into Syria, went to Aleppo,

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.938
which, turns out, is named after Abraham.

00:11:59.962 --> 00:12:01.236
We went to Damascus,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.004
which has a long history
associated with Abraham.

00:12:04.028 --> 00:12:06.790
We then came to Northern Jordan,

00:12:06.814 --> 00:12:11.840
to Jerusalem -- which is all
about Abraham -- to Bethlehem,

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:15.235
and finally, to the place
where he's buried, in Hebron.

00:12:15.259 --> 00:12:17.542
So effectively, we went from womb to tomb.

00:12:17.566 --> 00:12:18.867
We showed it could be done.

00:12:18.891 --> 00:12:20.260
It was an amazing journey.

00:12:20.594 --> 00:12:22.236
Let me ask you a question.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.623
How many of you have had the experience
of being in a strange neighborhood

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:28.863
or strange land,

00:12:28.887 --> 00:12:32.052
and a total stranger, perfect stranger,

00:12:32.076 --> 00:12:34.798
comes up to you
and shows you some kindness --

00:12:34.822 --> 00:12:37.321
maybe invites you into their home,
gives you a drink,

00:12:37.345 --> 00:12:39.124
gives you a coffee, gives you a meal?

00:12:39.148 --> 00:12:41.318
How many of you have ever
had that experience?

00:12:41.342 --> 00:12:44.133
That's the essence of the Abraham Path.

00:12:44.157 --> 00:12:47.674
That's what you discover as you go
into these villages in the Middle East

00:12:47.698 --> 00:12:49.033
where you expect hostility,

00:12:49.057 --> 00:12:51.604
and you get the most amazing hospitality,

00:12:51.628 --> 00:12:53.037
all associated with Abraham:

00:12:53.061 --> 00:12:56.821
"In the name of Father Ibrahim,
let me offer you some food."

00:12:56.845 --> 00:12:58.028
So what we discovered

00:12:58.052 --> 00:13:01.260
is that Abraham is not just a figure
out of a book for those people;

00:13:01.284 --> 00:13:04.440
he's alive, he's a living presence.

00:13:04.464 --> 00:13:06.591
And to make a long story short,

00:13:06.615 --> 00:13:08.677
in the last couple of years now,

00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:13.537
thousands of people have begun to walk
parts of the path of Abraham

00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:14.894
in the Middle East,

00:13:14.918 --> 00:13:17.973
enjoying the hospitality
of the people there.

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:21.236
They've begun to walk
in Israel and Palestine,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.980
in Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria.

00:13:24.004 --> 00:13:25.313
It's an amazing experience.

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:27.622
Men, women, young people, old people --

00:13:27.646 --> 00:13:30.477
more women than men,
actually, interestingly.

00:13:30.501 --> 00:13:32.436
For those who can't walk,

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.975
who are unable to get there right now,

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:38.619
people started to organize walks
in cities, in their own communities.

00:13:38.643 --> 00:13:41.017
In Cincinnati, for instance,
they organized a walk

00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:44.883
from a church to a mosque to a synagogue
and all had an Abrahamic meal together.

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:46.369
It was Abraham Path Day.

00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:48.799
In São Paulo, Brazil,
it's become an annual event

00:13:48.823 --> 00:13:52.651
for thousands of people to run
in a virtual Abraham Path Run,

00:13:52.675 --> 00:13:54.446
uniting the different communities.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.450
The media love it; they really adore it.

00:13:57.474 --> 00:14:00.928
They lavish attention on it
because it's visual

00:14:00.952 --> 00:14:02.616
and it spreads the idea,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.022
this idea of Abrahamic hospitality,
of kindness towards strangers.

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:11.236
And just a couple weeks ago,
there was an NPR story on it.

00:14:11.849 --> 00:14:13.017
Last month,

00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:18.958
there was a piece
in the Manchester Guardian about it,

00:14:18.982 --> 00:14:20.847
two whole pages.

00:14:21.609 --> 00:14:24.829
And they quoted a villager

00:14:24.853 --> 00:14:27.940
who said, "This walk connects
us to the world."

00:14:27.964 --> 00:14:30.781
He said, "It was like a light
that went on in our lives --

00:14:30.805 --> 00:14:32.236
it brought us hope."

00:14:32.696 --> 00:14:34.778
And so that's what it's about.

00:14:34.802 --> 00:14:36.608
But it's not just about psychology;

00:14:36.632 --> 00:14:38.108
it's about economics.

00:14:38.132 --> 00:14:41.236
Because as people walk, they spend money.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.236
And this woman right here, Um Ahmad,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.410
is a woman who lives on the path
in Northern Jordan.

00:14:47.434 --> 00:14:49.236
She's desperately poor.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.905
She's partially blind,
her husband can't work,

00:14:52.929 --> 00:14:54.881
she's got seven kids.

00:14:55.373 --> 00:14:57.236
But what she can do is cook.

00:14:57.931 --> 00:15:00.472
And so she's begun to cook
for some groups of walkers

00:15:00.496 --> 00:15:04.100
who come through the village
and have a meal in her home.

00:15:04.124 --> 00:15:07.424
They sit on the floor --
she doesn't even have a tablecloth.

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:09.236
She makes the most delicious food,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.382
that's fresh from the herbs
in the surrounding countryside.

00:15:12.406 --> 00:15:14.533
And so more and more walkers have come,

00:15:14.557 --> 00:15:18.451
and lately she's begun to earn an income
to support her family.

00:15:18.475 --> 00:15:21.352
And so she told our team there, she said,

00:15:21.376 --> 00:15:24.542
"You have made me visible

00:15:24.566 --> 00:15:28.236
in a village where people
were once ashamed to look at me."

00:15:29.015 --> 00:15:31.236
That's the potential of the Abraham Path.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.022
There are literally hundreds
of those kinds of communities

00:15:34.046 --> 00:15:36.512
across the Middle East, across the path.

00:15:37.456 --> 00:15:40.362
The potential is basically
to change the game.

00:15:40.719 --> 00:15:44.425
And to change the game, you have to change
the frame, the way we see things --

00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:49.767
to change the frame
from hostility to hospitality,

00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:52.236
from terrorism to tourism.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.997
And in that sense, the Abraham Path

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:56.632
is a game-changer.

00:15:57.147 --> 00:15:58.925
Let me just show you one thing.

00:15:58.949 --> 00:16:00.559
I have a little acorn here

00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:04.070
that I picked up while I was walking
on the path earlier this year.

00:16:04.626 --> 00:16:07.473
Now, the acorn is associated
with the oak tree, of course --

00:16:07.497 --> 00:16:10.575
grows into an oak tree,
which is associated with Abraham.

00:16:10.599 --> 00:16:12.542
The path right now is like an acorn;

00:16:12.566 --> 00:16:14.236
it's still in its early phase.

00:16:14.653 --> 00:16:16.573
What would the oak tree look like?

00:16:16.597 --> 00:16:18.236
When I think back to my childhood,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.213
a good part of which I spent,
after being born here in Chicago,

00:16:21.237 --> 00:16:22.592
I spent in Europe.

00:16:23.071 --> 00:16:29.777
If you had been in the ruins of, say,
London in 1945, or Berlin,

00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:31.000
and you had said,

00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:32.707
"Sixty years from now,

00:16:32.731 --> 00:16:36.056
this is going to be the most peaceful,
prosperous part of the planet,"

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.394
people would have thought
you were certifiably insane.

00:16:39.418 --> 00:16:43.236
But they did it, thanks
to a common identity, Europe,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.236
and a common economy.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.569
So my question is,
if it can be done in Europe,

00:16:48.593 --> 00:16:50.236
why not in the Middle East?

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.947
Why not, thanks to a common identity,
which is the story of Abraham,

00:16:54.971 --> 00:16:59.665
and thanks to a common economy that
would be based, in good part, on tourism?

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.657
So let me conclude, then,

00:17:02.681 --> 00:17:06.030
by saying that in the last 35 years,

00:17:06.054 --> 00:17:08.471
as I've worked
in some of the most dangerous,

00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:11.422
difficult and intractable conflicts
around the planet,

00:17:11.446 --> 00:17:17.051
I have yet to see one conflict
that I felt could not be transformed.

00:17:17.598 --> 00:17:19.451
It's not easy, of course.

00:17:19.963 --> 00:17:21.236
But it's possible.

00:17:21.726 --> 00:17:23.666
It was done in South Africa.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.575
It was done in Northern Ireland.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.116
It could be done anywhere.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.766
It simply depends on us.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.642
It depends on us taking the third side.

00:17:33.182 --> 00:17:36.794
So let me invite you to consider
taking the third side,

00:17:36.818 --> 00:17:38.484
even as a very small step.

00:17:38.508 --> 00:17:40.730
We're about to take a break in a moment.

00:17:40.754 --> 00:17:42.731
Just go up to someone

00:17:42.755 --> 00:17:45.398
who's from a different culture,
a different country,

00:17:45.422 --> 00:17:47.777
a different ethnicity --
some difference --

00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:49.438
and engage them in a conversation.

00:17:49.462 --> 00:17:50.696
Listen to them.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.236
That's a third-side act.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.544
That's walking Abraham's Path.

00:17:54.568 --> 00:17:56.093
After a TED Talk,

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:57.566
why not a TED Walk?

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.011
(Laughter)

00:17:59.035 --> 00:18:03.198
So let me just leave you
with three things.

00:18:03.222 --> 00:18:07.931
One is, the secret to peace
is the third side.

00:18:08.646 --> 00:18:11.066
The third side is us.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.661
Each of us, with a single step,

00:18:14.685 --> 00:18:17.405
can take the world, can bring the world

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.335
a step closer to peace.

00:18:20.578 --> 00:18:22.634
There's an old African proverb that goes:

00:18:22.658 --> 00:18:24.824
"When spiderwebs unite,

00:18:24.848 --> 00:18:27.411
they can halt even the lion."

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:32.205
If we're able to unite
our third-side webs of peace,

00:18:32.229 --> 00:18:35.237
we can even halt the lion of war.

00:18:35.261 --> 00:18:36.412
Thank you very much.

00:18:36.436 --> 00:18:39.755
(Applause)
