00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Planetary systems outside our own

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
but whose streets we can't walk.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
By studying those twinkling lights though,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
we can learn about how stars and planets interact

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
to form their own ecosystem

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and make habitats that are amenable to life.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
In this image of the Tokyo skyline,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I've hidden data

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
the Kepler Mission.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Can you see it?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
There we go.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
where it searches for planets

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
all at once, every half hour,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and very precisely.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And what we're looking for

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
is the tiny dimming of light

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
In just over two years of operations,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
we've found over 1,200

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
potential new planetary systems around other stars.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
To give you some perspective,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
in the previous two decades of searching,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
we had only known about 400

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
prior to Kepler.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
When we see these little dips in the light,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
we can determine a number of things.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
but also how big that planet is

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and how far it is away from its parent star.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
That distance is really important

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
because it tells us

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
how much light the planet receives overall.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire:

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
but not so close

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
that you're too toasty and you get burned.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
However, there's more to know about your parent star

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
than just how much light you receive overall.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
And I'll tell you why.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
This is our star. This is our Sun.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
It's shown here in visible light.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
You'll notice that it looks pretty much

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
like the iconic yellow ball --

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
that Sun that we all draw when we're children.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
But you'll notice something else,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
and that's that the face of the Sun

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
has freckles.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
These freckles are called sunspots,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
and they are just one of the manifestations

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
of the Sun's magnetic field.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
They also cause the light from the star to vary.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And we can measure this

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
very, very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
we would really see

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
the dynamic and dramatic effects

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
of our Sun's magnetic activity --

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Just think, even when it's cloudy outside,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
these kind of events are happening

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
in the sky above you all the time.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
whether it might be amenable to life,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
we want to know not only how much total light it receives

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
and how warm it is,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
but we want to know about its space weather --

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
this high-energy radiation,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
the UV and the X-rays

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
that are created by its star

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And so, we can't really look

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
at planets around other stars

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
in the same kind of detail

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
that we can look at planets in our own solar system.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
I'm showing here Venus, Earth and Mars --

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
but only one of which

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
is really a good place to live.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
But what we can do in the meantime

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
is measure the light from our stars

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
and learn about this relationship

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
between the planets and their parent stars

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
to suss out clues

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
about which planets might be good places

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
to look for life in the universe.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Kepler won't find a planet

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
around every single star it looks at.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
But really, every measurement it makes

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
is precious,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
because it's teaching us about the relationship

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
between stars and planets,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
and how it's really the starlight

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
that sets the stage

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
for the formation of life in the universe.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
While it's Kepler the telescope, the instrument that stares,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
it's we, life, who are searching.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Thank you.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
(Applause)
