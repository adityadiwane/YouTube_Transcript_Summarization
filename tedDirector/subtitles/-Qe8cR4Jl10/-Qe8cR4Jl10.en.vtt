00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:15.101
For a long time in my life,

00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:19.692
I felt like I'd been living two different lives.

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:23.097
There's the life that everyone sees,

00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:26.804
and then there's the life that only I see.

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:29.324
And in the life that everyone sees,

00:00:29.324 --> 00:00:31.798
who I am is a friend,

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.353
a son, a brother,

00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:37.979
a stand-up comedian and a teenager.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:39.820
That's the life everyone sees.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.346
If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me,

00:00:41.346 --> 00:00:43.185
that's what they would tell you.

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:45.183
And that's a huge part of me. That is who I am.

00:00:45.183 --> 00:00:47.993
And if you were to ask me to describe myself,

00:00:47.993 --> 00:00:50.915
I'd probably say some of those same things.

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:54.476
And I wouldn't be lying,

00:00:54.476 --> 00:00:58.006
but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth, either,

00:00:58.006 --> 00:00:59.533
because the truth is,

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.705
that's just the life everyone else sees.

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:06.468
In the life that only I see, who I am,

00:01:06.468 --> 00:01:08.395
who I really am,

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:12.830
is someone who struggles intensely with depression.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.507
I have for the last six years of my life,

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:20.626
and I continue to every day.

00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:23.123
Now, for someone who has never experienced depression

00:01:23.123 --> 00:01:24.325
or doesn't really know what that means,

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:25.708
that might surprise them to hear,

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.613
because there's this pretty popular misconception

00:01:27.613 --> 00:01:30.360
that depression is just being sad

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.848
when something in your life goes wrong,

00:01:32.848 --> 00:01:34.490
when you break up with your girlfriend,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.881
when you lose a loved one,

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:37.632
when you don't get the job you wanted.

00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:39.619
But that's sadness. That's a natural thing.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.531
That's a natural human emotion.

00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:45.729
Real depression isn't being sad

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.358
when something in your life goes wrong.

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.144
Real depression is being sad

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:53.413
when everything in your life is going right.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.898
That's real depression, and that's what I suffer from.

00:01:55.898 --> 00:01:58.023
And to be totally honest,

00:01:58.023 --> 00:02:00.837
that's hard for me to stand up here and say.

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:02.558
It's hard for me to talk about,

00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:05.321
and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about,

00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:07.689
so much so that no one's talking about it.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.083
And no one's talking about depression, but we need to be,

00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:13.825
because right now it's a massive problem.

00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:15.495
It's a massive problem.

00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:17.297
But we don't see it on social media, right?

00:02:17.297 --> 00:02:19.385
We don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter.

00:02:19.385 --> 00:02:21.207
We don't see it on the news, because it's not happy,

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:22.836
it's not fun, it's not light.

00:02:22.836 --> 00:02:26.431
And so because we don't see it, we don't see the severity of it.

00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:30.190
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this:

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.913
every 30 seconds,

00:02:31.913 --> 00:02:34.117
every 30 seconds, somewhere,

00:02:34.117 --> 00:02:36.310
someone in the world takes their own life

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.387
because of depression,

00:02:37.387 --> 00:02:39.627
and it might be two blocks away, it might be two countries away,

00:02:39.627 --> 00:02:41.157
it might be two continents away, but it's happening,

00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:43.727
and it's happening every single day.

00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:46.691
And we have a tendency, as a society,

00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:51.937
to look at that and go, "So what?"

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:56.592
So what? We look at that, and we go, "That's your problem.

00:02:56.592 --> 00:02:58.995
That's their problem."

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:00.847
We say we're sad and we say we're sorry,

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.224
but we also say, "So what?"

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:06.907
Well, two years ago it was my problem,

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:10.964
because I sat on the edge of my bed

00:03:10.964 --> 00:03:14.324
where I'd sat a million times before

00:03:14.324 --> 00:03:17.140
and I was suicidal.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.066
I was suicidal, and if you were to look at my life on the surface,

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:23.308
you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal.

00:03:23.308 --> 00:03:25.424
You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team,

00:03:25.424 --> 00:03:27.485
the drama and theater student of the year,

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:28.444
the English student of the year,

00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:30.272
someone who was consistently on the honor roll

00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:33.945
and consistently at every party.

00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:35.586
So you would say I wasn't depressed, you would say

00:03:35.586 --> 00:03:38.297
I wasn't suicidal, but you would be wrong.

00:03:38.297 --> 00:03:39.736
You would be wrong. So I sat there that night

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:43.774
beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand

00:03:43.774 --> 00:03:45.762
and I thought about taking my own life

00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:49.114
and I came this close to doing it.

00:03:49.114 --> 00:03:50.796
I came this close to doing it.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:53.924
And I didn't, so that makes me one of the lucky ones,

00:03:53.924 --> 00:03:56.059
one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:58.320
and look down but not jump,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.325
one of the lucky ones who survives.

00:04:00.325 --> 00:04:02.722
Well, I survived, and that just leaves me with my story,

00:04:02.722 --> 00:04:05.127
and my story is this:

00:04:05.127 --> 00:04:08.480
In four simple words, I suffer from depression.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.910
I suffer from depression,

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:18.230
and for a long time, I think,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.826
I was living two totally different lives,

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:22.687
where one person was always afraid of the other.

00:04:22.687 --> 00:04:24.786
I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was,

00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:28.028
that I wasn't the perfect, popular kid in high school everyone thought I was,

00:04:28.028 --> 00:04:30.453
that beneath my smile, there was struggle,

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:32.416
and beneath my light, there was dark,

00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:36.793
and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain.

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:39.430
See, some people might fear girls not liking them back.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.519
Some people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death.

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:46.212
But for me, for a large part of my life, I feared myself.

00:04:46.212 --> 00:04:48.904
I feared my truth, I feared my honesty, I feared my vulnerability,

00:04:48.904 --> 00:04:51.126
and that fear made me feel

00:04:51.126 --> 00:04:53.483
like I was forced into a corner,

00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:56.513
like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out,

00:04:56.513 --> 00:05:00.306
and so I thought about that way every single day.

00:05:00.306 --> 00:05:01.753
I thought about it every single day,

00:05:01.753 --> 00:05:03.424
and if I'm being totally honest, standing here

00:05:03.424 --> 00:05:06.797
I've thought about it again since, because that's the sickness,

00:05:06.797 --> 00:05:08.731
that's the struggle, that's depression,

00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:09.950
and depression isn't chicken pox.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.668
You don't beat it once and it's gone forever.

00:05:11.668 --> 00:05:14.431
It's something you live with. It's something you live in.

00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:18.003
It's the roommate you can't kick out. It's the voice you can't ignore.

00:05:18.003 --> 00:05:20.264
It's the feelings you can't seem to escape,

00:05:20.264 --> 00:05:25.337
the scariest part is that after a while,

00:05:25.337 --> 00:05:28.217
you become numb to it. It becomes normal for you,

00:05:28.217 --> 00:05:30.504
and what you really fear the most

00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:33.360
isn't the suffering inside of you.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.876
It's the stigma inside of others,

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.157
it's the shame, it's the embarrassment,

00:05:37.157 --> 00:05:39.610
it's the disapproving look on a friend's face,

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.074
it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak,

00:05:43.074 --> 00:05:44.475
it's the comments that you're crazy.

00:05:44.475 --> 00:05:46.575
That's what keeps you from getting help.

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:49.569
That's what makes you hold it in and hide it.

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:51.904
It's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it,

00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:53.766
and you hold it in and you hide it,

00:05:53.766 --> 00:05:55.442
and even though it's keeping you in bed every day

00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:58.382
and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it,

00:05:58.382 --> 00:06:00.545
you hide it, because the stigma in our society

00:06:00.545 --> 00:06:03.460
around depression is very real.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.662
It's very real, and if you think that it isn't, ask yourself this:

00:06:06.662 --> 00:06:08.471
Would you rather make your next Facebook status

00:06:08.471 --> 00:06:10.217
say you're having a tough time getting out of bed

00:06:10.217 --> 00:06:12.366
because you hurt your back

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:14.358
or you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning

00:06:14.358 --> 00:06:16.458
because you're depressed?

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:18.742
That's the stigma, because unfortunately,

00:06:18.742 --> 00:06:21.210
we live in a world where if you break your arm,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.884
everyone runs over to sign your cast,

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:26.700
but if you tell people you're depressed, everyone runs the other way.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.200
That's the stigma.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.166
We are so, so, so accepting of any body part breaking down

00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:37.268
other than our brains. And that's ignorance.

00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:39.280
That's pure ignorance, and that ignorance has created

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.844
a world that doesn't understand depression,

00:06:40.844 --> 00:06:43.350
that doesn't understand mental health.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.303
And that's ironic to me, because depression

00:06:45.303 --> 00:06:47.813
is one of the best documented problems we have in the world,

00:06:47.813 --> 00:06:49.858
yet it's one of the least discussed.

00:06:49.858 --> 00:06:52.294
We just push it aside and put it in a corner

00:06:52.294 --> 00:06:55.881
and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself.

00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:59.223
Well, it won't. It hasn't, and it's not going to,

00:06:59.223 --> 00:07:01.114
because that's wishful thinking,

00:07:01.114 --> 00:07:03.887
and wishful thinking isn't a game plan, it's procrastination,

00:07:03.887 --> 00:07:08.816
and we can't procrastinate on something this important.

00:07:08.816 --> 00:07:12.207
The first step in solving any problem

00:07:12.207 --> 00:07:13.690
is recognizing there is one.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.448
Well, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect

00:07:16.448 --> 00:07:19.633
to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question.

00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:23.412
And I don't know what the solution is.

00:07:23.412 --> 00:07:25.873
I wish I did, but I don't -- but I think,

00:07:25.873 --> 00:07:27.881
I think it has to start here.

00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:30.280
It has to start with me, it has to start with you,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.698
it has to start with the people who are suffering,

00:07:33.698 --> 00:07:35.115
the ones who are hidden in the shadows.

00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:37.115
We need to speak up and shatter the silence.

00:07:37.115 --> 00:07:39.434
We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in,

00:07:39.434 --> 00:07:42.609
because if there's one thing that I've come to realize,

00:07:42.609 --> 00:07:46.185
if there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem,

00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:49.224
it's not in building a world

00:07:49.224 --> 00:07:52.973
where we eliminate the ignorance of others.

00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:56.259
It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves,

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:57.460
where we're okay with who we are,

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.960
because when we get honest,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.756
we see that we all struggle and we all suffer.

00:08:01.756 --> 00:08:03.708
Whether it's with this, whether it's with something else,

00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:06.535
we all know what it is to hurt.

00:08:06.535 --> 00:08:08.373
We all know what it is to have pain in our heart,

00:08:08.373 --> 00:08:11.067
and we all know how important it is to heal.

00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:14.461
But right now, depression is society's deep cut

00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:17.022
that we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there.

00:08:17.022 --> 00:08:21.526
Well, it is there. It is there, and you know what? It's okay.

00:08:21.526 --> 00:08:25.337
Depression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay.

00:08:25.337 --> 00:08:27.999
And know that you're sick, you're not weak,

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:29.935
and it's an issue, not an identity,

00:08:29.935 --> 00:08:32.688
because when you get past the fear and the ridicule

00:08:32.688 --> 00:08:34.485
and the judgment and the stigma of others,

00:08:34.485 --> 00:08:37.471
you can see depression for what it really is,

00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:39.710
and that's just a part of life,

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.438
just a part of life, and as much as I hate,

00:08:43.438 --> 00:08:45.917
as much as I hate some of the places,

00:08:45.917 --> 00:08:49.013
some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to,

00:08:49.013 --> 00:08:51.548
in a lot of ways I'm grateful for it.

00:08:51.548 --> 00:08:53.360
Because yeah, it's put me in the valleys,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.792
but only to show me there's peaks,

00:08:54.792 --> 00:08:56.391
and yeah it's dragged me through the dark

00:08:56.391 --> 00:08:58.977
but only to remind me there is light.

00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:02.720
My pain, more than anything in 19 years on this planet,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.979
has given me perspective, and my hurt,

00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:07.474
my hurt has forced me to have hope,

00:09:07.474 --> 00:09:10.005
have hope and to have faith, faith in myself,

00:09:10.005 --> 00:09:12.550
faith in others, faith that it can get better,

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.628
that we can change this, that we can speak up

00:09:14.628 --> 00:09:17.386
and speak out and fight back against ignorance,

00:09:17.386 --> 00:09:19.975
fight back against intolerance,

00:09:19.975 --> 00:09:21.990
and more than anything,

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.716
learn to love ourselves,

00:09:24.716 --> 00:09:26.895
learn to accept ourselves for who we are,

00:09:26.895 --> 00:09:30.990
the people we are, not the people the world wants us to be.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.602
Because the world I believe in is one

00:09:32.602 --> 00:09:36.770
where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.851
The world I believe in is one where we're measured

00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:43.367
by our ability to overcome adversities, not avoid them.

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:47.591
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye

00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:49.353
and say, "I'm going through hell,"

00:09:49.353 --> 00:09:52.930
and they can look back at me and go, "Me too," and that's okay,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.632
and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people.

00:09:56.632 --> 00:09:59.062
We're people, and we struggle and we suffer

00:09:59.062 --> 00:10:01.790
and we bleed and we cry, and if you think that true strength

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.909
means never showing any weakness, then I'm here

00:10:03.909 --> 00:10:07.155
to tell you you're wrong.

00:10:07.155 --> 00:10:11.052
You're wrong, because it's the opposite.

00:10:11.052 --> 00:10:13.736
We're people, and we have problems.

00:10:13.736 --> 00:10:15.407
We're not perfect, and that's okay.

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:17.621
So we need to stop the ignorance,

00:10:17.621 --> 00:10:20.699
stop the intolerance, stop the stigma,

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:25.273
and stop the silence, and we need to take away the taboos,

00:10:25.273 --> 00:10:29.812
take a look at the truth, and start talking,

00:10:29.812 --> 00:10:34.536
because the only way we're going to beat a problem

00:10:34.536 --> 00:10:37.870
that people are battling alone

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.633
is by standing strong together,

00:10:41.633 --> 00:10:45.397
by standing strong together.

00:10:45.397 --> 00:10:48.376
And I believe that we can.

00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:50.295
I believe that we can. Thank you guys so much.

00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:52.702
This is a dream come true. Thank you. (Applause)

00:10:52.702 --> 00:10:54.960
Thank you. (Applause)
