00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today --

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
we think of financial and economic primarily --

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
the ones that concern me most

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
is the deficit of political dialogue --

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
our ability to address modern conflicts

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
as they are,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
to go to the source of what they're all about

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and to understand the key players

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
and to deal with them.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
We who are diplomats,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And I can tell you, our agenda is full.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
There is trade, there is disarmament,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
there is cross-border relations.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
But the picture is changing,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and we are seeing that there are new key players

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
coming onto the scene.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
We loosely call them "groups."

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
They may represent social, religious,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
political, economic, military realities.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
And we struggle with how to deal with them.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
The rules of engagement:

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
how to talk, when to talk,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and how to deal with them.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Let me show you a slide here

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
which illustrates the character of conflicts

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
since 1946 until today.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
You see the green

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
is a traditional interstate conflict,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
the ones we used to read about.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
The red is modern conflict,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
conflicts within states.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
These are quite different,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
and they are outside the grasp

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
of modern diplomacy.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
And the core of these key actors

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
are groups

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
who represent different interests

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
inside countries.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
So in a way, it is everybody's business.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Another acknowledgment we've seen during these years,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
recent years,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
is that very few

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.260
of these domestic interstate, intrastate conflicts

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
can be solved militarily.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
They may have to be dealt with with military means,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
but they cannot be solved by military means.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
They need political solutions.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And we, therefore, have a problem,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
because they escape traditional diplomacy.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And we have among states

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
a reluctance in dealing with them.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Plus, during the last decade,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
we've been in the mode

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
where dealing with groups

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
was conceptually and politically dangerous.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
After 9/11,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
either you were with us or against us.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
It was black or white.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
And groups are very often

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
immediately label terrorists.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And who would talk to terrorists?

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
The West, as I would see it,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
comes out of that decade weakened,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
because we didn't understand the group.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
So we've spent more time

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
on focusing on why we should not talk to others

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
than finding out how we talk to others.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Now I'm not naive.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
You cannot talk to everybody all the time.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And there are times you should walk.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And sometimes military intervention is necessary.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
I happen to believe that Libya was necessary

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And my country relies on its security

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
through military alliance, that's clear.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
But still we have a large deficit

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
in dealing with and understanding modern conflict.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Let us turn to Afghanistan.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
10 years after that military intervention,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that country is far from secure.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
The situation, to be honest, is very serious.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Now again, the military is necessary,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
but the military is no problem-solver.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
When I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
I met the commander of ISAF,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
the international troops.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And he told me that, "This can be won militarily, minister.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
We just have to persevere."

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Now four COM ISAF's later,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
we hear a different message:

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
"This cannot be won militarily.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
We need military presence,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
but we need to move to politics.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
We can only solve this through a political solution.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And it is not us who will solve it;

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Afghans have to solve it."

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
But then they need a different political process

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
than the one they were given in 2001, 2002.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
They need an inclusive process

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
where the real fabric of this very complicated society

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
can deal with their issues.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Everybody seems to agree with that.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
It was very controversial to say three, four, five years ago.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Now everybody agrees.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
But now, as we prepare to talk,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
we understand how little we know.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Because we didn't talk.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
We didn't grasp what was going on.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
The International Committee of the Red Cross, the ICRC,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
is talking to everyone,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and it is doing so because it is neutral.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And that's one reason why

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
that organization probably

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
is the best informed key player

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
to understand modern conflict --

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
because they talk.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.260
My point is that you don't have to be neutral to talk.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And you don't have to agree

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
when you sit down with the other side.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And you can always walk.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
But if you don't talk,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
you can't engage the other side.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
And the other side which you're going to engage

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
is the one with whom you profoundly disagree.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Prime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
"You don't make peace with your friends,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
you make peace with your enemies."

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
It's hard, but it is necessary.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Let me go one step further.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
This is Tahrir Square.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
There's a revolution going on.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
The Arab Spring is heading into fall

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and is moving into winter.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
It will last for a long, long time.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And who knows what it will be called in the end.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
That's not the point.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
The point is that we are probably seeing,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
for the first time in the history of the Arab world,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
a revolution bottom-up --

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
people's revolution.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Social groups are taking to the streets.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
And we find out in the West

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
that we know very little about what's happening.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.260
Because we never talk to the people in these countries.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Most governments followed

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
the dictate of the authoritarian leaders

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
to stay away from these different groups,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.260
because they were terrorists.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
So now that they are emerging in the street

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and we salute the democratic revolution,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
we find out how little we know.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
Right now, the discussion goes,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
"Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood?

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Should we talk to Hamas?

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
If we talk to them, we may legitimize them."

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
I think that is wrong.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
If you talk in the right way, you make it very clear

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
that talking is not agreeing.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
as we should,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.260
that they must respect minority rights,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
if we don't accept majority rights?

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Because they may turn out to be a majority.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
How can we escape [having] a double-standard,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
if we at the same time preach democracy

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
and at the same time

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
don't want to deal with the groups that are representative?

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
How will we ever be interlocutors?

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Now my diplomats are instructed

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
to talk to all these groups.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
But talking can be done in different ways.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
and talking at the political level.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
There's a big array

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
of the ways of dealing with this.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
So if we refuse

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
to talk to these new groups

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
that are going to be dominating the news in years to come,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
we will further radicalization,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
I believe.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
We will make the road from violent activities into politics

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
harder to travel.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
that if you move towards democracy,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
if you move towards taking part

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
in civilized and normal standards among states,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
there are some rewards on the other side.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
The paradox here

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
is that the last decade probably was a lost decade

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
for making progress on this.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.260
And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising --

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and for one reason primarily.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
And the reason is what happened in South Africa:

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Nelson Mandela.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
When Mandela came out of prison

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
after 27 years of captivity,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
if he had told his people,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
"It's time to take up the arms,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
it's time to fight,"

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
he would have been followed.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And I think the international community

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
would have said, "Fair enough.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
It's their right to fight."

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Now as you know, Mandela didn't do that.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
In his memoirs, "Long Road to Freedom,"

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
he wrote that he survived

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
during those years of captivity

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
because he always decided to look upon his oppressor

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
as also being a human being,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
also being a human being.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.260
So he engaged a political process of dialogue,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
not as a strategy of the weak,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
but as a strategy of the strong.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
And he engaged talking profoundly

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
by settling some of the most tricky issues

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
through a truth and reconciliation process

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
where people came and talked.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Now South African friends will know

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
that was very painful.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
So what can we learn from all of this?

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Dialogue is not easy --

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
not between individuals, not between groups, not between governments --

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
but it is very necessary.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.260
If we're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
if we're going to understand these new groups

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
which are coming from bottom-up,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
supported by technology, which is available to all,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
believing that we are doing interstate relations.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
We have to connect

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
with these profound changes.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
And what is dialogue really about?

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
When I enter into dialogue,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
I really hope that the other side

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
would pick up my points of view,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
that I would impress upon them

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
my opinions and my values.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
I cannot do that

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
unless I send the signals that I will be open

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
to listen to the other side's signals.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
We need a lot more training on how to do that

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
and a lot more practice

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
on how that can take problem-solving forward.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
We know from our personal experiences

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
that it's easy sometimes

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
just to walk,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
and sometimes you may need to fight.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
And I wouldn't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Sometimes you have to.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
But that strategy seldom takes you very far.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
The alternative is a strategy

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
of engagement and principled dialogue.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And I believe we need to strengthen this approach

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
in modern diplomacy,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
not only between states,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
but also within states.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
We are seeing some new signs.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
We could never have done

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
the convention against anti-personnel landmines

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.260
and the convention that is banning cluster munitions

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
unless we had done diplomacy differently,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
by engaging with civil society.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
All of a sudden,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
NGOs were not only standing in the streets, crying their slogans,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
but they were taking [them] into the negotiations,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.260
partly because they represented the victims of these weapons.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
And they brought their knowledge.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
And there was an interaction

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
This is perhaps a first element

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
of a change.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
In the future, I believe,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
we should draw examples from these different illustrations,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
not to have diplomacy

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
which is disconnected from people and civil society.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
And we have to go also

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
beyond traditional diplomacy

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
to the survival issue of our times,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
climate change.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
unless we are able to make civil society and people,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
not part of the problem, but part of the solution?

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
very different from the one we are practicing today

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
but when we move toward something

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
which has to be much more

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
along a broad mobilization.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
It's crucial to understand, I believe,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
because of technology and because of globalization,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
societies from bottom-up.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
We as diplomats

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
need to know the social capital

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
of communities.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
What is it that makes people trust each other,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
not only between states,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
but also within states?

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
What is the legitimacy of diplomacy,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
of the the solution we devise as diplomats

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
if they cannot be reflected and understood

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
by also these broader forces of societies

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.260
that we now very loosely call groups?

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
The good thing is that we are not powerless.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
We have never had

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
as many means of communication,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
means of being connected, means of reaching out,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
means of including.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
The diplomatic toolbox

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
is actually full of different tools we can use

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
to strengthen our communication.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
where we had a fear of touching it.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
Now, I hope, in the coming years,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
that fear is receding

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
and that we can take courage

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
from that alliance

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
with civil society

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
in different countries

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
to support their problem-solving,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
among the Afghans,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
inside the Palestinian population,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
between the peoples of Palestine and Israel.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
And as we try to understand this broad movement

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
across the Arab world,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
we are not powerless.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
We need to improve the necessary skills,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
and we need the courage to use them.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
In my country,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.260
I have seen how the council of Islamist groups

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
and Christian groups

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
came together, not as a government initiative,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
but they came together on their own initiative

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
to establish contact and dialogue

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.260
in times where things were pretty low-key tension.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
And when tension increased,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
they already had that dialogue,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and that was a strength to deal with different issues.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
Our modern Western societies

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
are more complex than before,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
in this time of migration.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
How are we going to settle and build a bigger "We"

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
to deal with our issues

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
if we don't improve our skills of communication?

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
So there are many reasons,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
and for all of these reasons,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
this is time and this is why we must talk.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
Thank you for your attention.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.260
(Applause)
